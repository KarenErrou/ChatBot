Having John and Dean learn to be father'swhile being completely incompetentis certainly out there. But they managed to make it quite amusingso that was pretty impressive. It's quite crude at timesbut never too crudeto where it turns the viewer offlike Bruno persay. The Brothers Solomon isn't gonna make your world spinit won't become one of your favorite comedies of all time eitherbut it will brighten up your dayit will take a load offand provide you with some much needed laughs.Performances. Will ArnettWill Forte are both very funnyvery likable. They make an excellent comedy teamthat we can all like. Here's hopingwe get to see them againsometime soon. Chi McBride is a funny character actorand here is no different. Kristen Wiig does her job wellI quite liked hereven if she was bitchy at some points. Malin Akerman had a snobby written rolebut who cares when you look like she does?. Rest of the cast are fine.Bottom Line. This is a fun little comedy.

Besides the fact that it was ranked 5.0 out of 10.0 when it was one of the funniest movies I have seen in the last five years assures me that either I have a bizarre sense of humor or that people who are on IMDb take themselves way to fing seriously. I've decided both are true.First off if you like Wet Hot American Summer stop reading now and watch brothers Solomon. It's hilarious.Easily the funniest opening credit sequence I have ever seen. And simple too.I read people saying that this movie wasn't developed properly or it was random. What THE F!!!! That's what's funny about this movie. It's Crazy Absurd!!!!!!!!! It's the two most absurd male characters since Lloyd and Harry from Dumb and Dumber. This movie is not Schindler's List. I'm sorry for whoever thought it would be.If you want silly ridiculous comedy watch this movie. I am now sitting in a room with 6 people who are laughing their asses off at random parts of the movie. Honestly its good. I don't know why it didn't do better.Will Forte and Will Arentt both RULE!".

	schema:reviewBody "The unequivocal epitome of absurdity The Brothers Solomon is equal parts stunning hilarity and eyebrowraising ridiculousness. With a mindbogglingly offbeat sense of Dumb and Dumber humor this film introduces such sustained sociallyinept insanity by its unpredictably bizarre lead characters that it is constantly difficult to predict where it's all going. Despite the berserk brothers' insensibilities this madcap farce manages to be entertaining and different from the recent slew of Rrated comedies.When their father lapses into a coma and Dean Will Forte and John Will Arnett Solomon learn that his only regret was not seeing a grandchild the two brothers determine to acquire one no matter what the cost. After the romantically and socially inept twosome fail at wooing a mate to bear their child they turn to other means of conception Initially The Brothers Solomon appears to be an even wackier and more ludicrous version of Dumb and Dumber with a goofy duo of misfits who lack all cognitive thought processes. Early on the film even steals a joke from the Farrelly Brothers' comedy which is a huge mistake considering how widely recognized Harry and Lloyd's dialogue has become. But after the initial letdown The Brother Solomon redeems itself with a nonstop barrage of hilariously awkward slapstick and unpredictable kookiness.Like Steve and Doug Butabi from A Night at the Roxbury the Solomons never let their spirits down as if they're completely oblivious to their unwieldy social shortcomings. Their chipper attitude remains constant even when they disagree and it casts a bizarre sense of satisfaction straight through to the moronic conclusion. To say that the events in the film are even remotely believable or sensible would be a gross exaggeration yet one has to appreciate the inane degree of preposterousness the film achieves with its extremely overthetop comedy.From picking out a pornographic magazine at a sperm bank they struggle over a copy of Indigenous Weekly to a candlelit hallway dinner to kickass parenting training involving hiding and mistreating baby dolls to stalking children at a playground the absurd gimmicks and slapstick the brothers employ is surprisingly entertaining. The entire film tests the limits to which imbecilic comedy can be pushed and once that line is crossed they continue forward into unknown territories of illogicality. Puppetrybased sex training and friendshipsimulation aside The Brothers Solomon is utterly pointless and largely trivial and yet somehow the all new lows of intelligence make for an unusually high amount of laughs.Reaching unforeseen heights in creative absurdity and comedic eccentricity The Brothers Solomon appears uninhibited by stereotypical comedy output. The humor on display is a seldom seen blend of disturbing mockery and playful stupidity that is ultimately hit or miss. But when it succeeds it does so with masterful relish creating simultaneous shock and laughoutloud silliness. Airplane banners pedophilia and infant abuse never looked so funny.Mike and Joel Massie".

These days we know our actors and can say Yea it's going to contain this sort of comedy if I liked what he or they did last year I will love this and that isn't to put down comedies at all they are made that way and they're hilarious as most comedians usually write or cowrite and produce their films these days. This film which I never even heard whimpered or scoffed of anywhere deserves a review because I don't think many people paid it any mind.The film was written by Forte Dean Solomon a recent SNL personality I never watch it personally. I never knew his comedy style but the two brothers John Solomon played by Arnett both have symmetrical characters who play off each other as pretty much two men who were raised in a sheltered home and pretty much see everything in a very positive light.Their own characters weren't even that annoying as one might think and I am easily annoyed by characters. They were straight forward guys who would ballbust people with a smile on their face. The comedy is situational to them pretty much completing scenes with their personalities playful 'burning' of each other with wise cracks or situations that happened to them and getting by spotty and racy situations by their pure ignorance to their offenses.Simply put if you like comedy you will like this movie. It has a very good modern plot with a twist and two characters who are hilarious. If you liked Dumb and Dumber you should be reminded of the quaint quirky humor back in the 90's with this new fresh look at situational comedy.The plot also keeps moving unlike some comedies that catch a snag. This movie is continuously in motion with pretty much trial and error scenes that are all a laugh.".

The whole mentality of the picture is sweet and overly syrupy I mean at times the thing should come with a dental warning. The script has one or two dcent gags in it's aresenal but not enough to make this worthwhile for anyone with an IQ over 30. Opening alongside Shoot em up it's hard to see how The Brothers Solomon could make anything more than 5 million on it's opening weekend I haven't seen it that highly advertised and when the reviews come out I doubt they'll differ much in terms of opinion from mine.

From finding the woman to be their surrogate mother to figuring out how to impregnate her from arguments at the sperm bank to all the way to baby training and every step in between is hilariously quirky  Should we put locks on the locks in case the baby learns the combinations? It is a sense of humor that will not please everyone since the protagonists are funny not because they snap funny lines and manage to do impossible things like Bugs Bunny surviving a long fall but because they can't do anything right. Yet this redundancy of wrong doing is never redundant here but rather it becomes the movie's very enjoyable quirky theme.

They act like a washedout crossover between Dumb  Dumber and the Butabi brothers which BTW I dearly missed here. John Will Arnett's behavior with women in particular is either hilarious or annoying.If the two main characters had been replaced with more 'suitable' I don't want to say 'talented' comedians this movie would have been much better. The hollow script relies on physical gags and the brothers weirdbutsupposedlyfunny behavior. I really like Will Forte in SNL and here he is bearable. However to do what Will Arnett attempted to do here you need to have a funny face. Some actors have it and some don't  Will Ferrell and Jim Carrey come to mind. Arnett certainly doesn't and comes across as a psychopath rather than a funny guy making a fool of himself. It's not funny  it's uncomfortable and embarrassing. If that was their objective it worked.This movie certainly has a style of its own however. James provides some extra laughs but I suspect most people will be turnedoff by the dry nature of the humor here.410".

When they find out that their dad might be dying they find out that their dad wants a grandson. They try to find a woman who will have their baby. Janine will have their baby but she will be a surrogate mom. She tells them to learn how to be good dads so they buy a doll and pretend it's a baby. It's hilarious the way they use it! John tries to hook up with Tara but she always turns him down. Janine has an exboyfriend named James who is always around but wants to help. James is extremely funny too! Later it seems like Janine enjoys being around John and Dean. I loved how they try to find Janine when she runs away. I love when they are at the sperm bank. I loved everything about this movie! If you love comedy I highly suggest THE BROTHERS SOLOMON!".

It offers three case studies Jodie Foster's callow fashion designer joins the resistance in the name of personal love Michael Ontkean places his convictions above his emotions and Sam Neill is a Nazi whose crush on Foster ties him in gordian knots. Based on Simone de Beauvoir's novel and directed by old master Chabrol it's not for lack of brains that this movie hits the dirt. But if Chabrol can speak English at all he can't direct it. The entire first hour is impossibly stilted and distant Foster's refusal to emote generates more frustration than insight and she sets the tone for the rest of the cast. It's a relief when Neill finally shows up because he's not so on guard against melodrama but by then he has to cram his broad character arc into such a small handful of scenes that he ultimately fares little better. Even the reasonably tense thirdact suspense sequences fail because they don't advance Foster's character if she's progressed beyond romantic selfinterest by then she's keeping it to herself and she's pretty much along for the ride in the climactic jail break. Lots of small moments and nuances that never add up to anything are crammed between loving shots of expensive set design and the kind of gratuitous cameos Kate Reid John Vernon that signal the worst kind of international coproduction  too many cooks in the kitchen.".

I really do not like films that have English lines but songs that are in French etc. At least they did not attempt to have phony French accents. I hope Mr. Chabrol was paid well for this lapse in his usual brilliant film career. This is truly the worst film I have seen directed by this classic filmmaker. Towards the end of the film there is a bit of script writing involving a loveobsessed Nazi and Jodie Foster that is one of the silliest things I have ever seen. This film as so many others do seems to enjoy depicting Germans during World War II as somehow not intelligent. Storytellers seem to forget that they almost conquered all of Europe. This VHS will definitely be donated to the next charity yard sale in my neighborhood. Skip this film.".

I'm used to seeing WWII films from the Jew's perspective with Schindler's List Holocaust and The Story of Anne Frank and many others and in a Rosencrantz and Guildenstern way the bit players of the darker tales The French are the main characters while the story of the Jews goes on in the background almost unaware. It is interesting to see the story from another angle.In the end The Blood of Others is the story of a girl who does the wrong things because she's young and does the right things out of love but what she really believes is a childish ideal and her life though a short one tells the tale of small but important sacrifices made during the war effort for the resistance. The movie some what falls short in this regard because while we feel a loss the overall film suffers from a lack of depth and tension.".

Postproduction dubs of outdoor scenes sound like they were recorded in a room  obviously they were but didn't need to sound like that  and the audiovisual sync  or lack of it  betrays which segments of the soundtrack these are.The entire dialogue should have been in French and since there's no French equivalent AFAIK we would have been spared geddowdahere from Jodie who speaks nearperfect accentless French.The story has great potential after all it's from a critically acclaimed book but was ultimately let down by the direction.The worst moment came for me at the end of the film when Jean embraces Hlne thereby moving the bullet in her lung to somewhere even less convivial.

	schema:reviewBody "If you're like me after watching roughly 3 billion similarly themed period piece kung fu and wuxia movies you're relieved when a contemporary kung fu flick comes along. This seems to be Donnie Yen's bread and butter. Sure he was excellent in Hero opposite Jet Li and even Circus Kids was entertaining but his performances in those films just don't match up to SPL or this film Flash Point. He seems made for modern kung fu.I'll leave plot explanation to others as it's a pretty standard copontheedge film that seems to have been done to death by Hong Kong over the past 15 years or so. What sets this apart is Yen's phenomenal and somewhat unique brand of kung fu and for the first time to my knowledge his surprisingly good jiu jitsu. The flashy kicks and punches are standard Yen affair but it's a bit of a shock to watch him pull off a slick arm bar arm triangle or leg triangle.Yen's performance is only strengthened by a very talented supporting cast. There's no pushover fights here...it's like everyone is really fighting for their lives. That alone should be enough to get you past a fairly overdone plot it's not bad but if you've seen it once you've seen it 1000 times. It's definitely worth the 85 minutes of your time if you're even remotely a fan of the genre.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Flashpoint";
	schema:reviewBody "In his black leather jacket and oozing plenty of charisma Donnie Yen's Inspector Ma Jun quite resembled his other character in SPL which was also directed by Wilson Yip because at one point Flashpoint was supposed to be an SPL sequel. But in any case the character is slightly tweaked. Early in the movie Ma Jun tells it straight to the camera that as a cop his job is to apprehend criminals and it's as simple as that. And the trailers would have you believe here's a man who's lightning quick with his punches throws and kicks.However you've got to wait until the hour mark for all that. For action junkies your patience is severely tested but the wait is well worth every minute you're put on hold. I've caught the trailer at this year's Hong Kong Filmart and it was one that had action and more action with nary a line of dialogue. But in the movie much time is devoted to attempts in building characterization until the story realizes it better give what the audiences are here for to see Donnie Yen kick ass.Having teamed with Wilson Yip in earlier action productions like SPL and Dragon Tiger Gate Donnie Yen returns as action choreographer for Flashpoint and the cast adopts the fighting style called MMA  Mixed Martial Arts which is something of a blend of various martial arts techniques that audiences probably haven't seen before stylistically in close combat scenes. Flashpoint boasts some incredible action sequences with explosive hard hitting fight combinations and the sole complaint I have is I can't get enough of it! What more as learnt from SPL having real martial arts exponents like Sammo Hung and Wu Jing fighting opposite himself it made the sequences look more authentic and the pace at which they can go at each other much more frantic. Collin Chou Seraph from the Matrix movies stars as one of the chief baddies and watching the two awesome gladiators duke it out is nothing short of edge of your seat material  you'll feel their pain!But as I mentioned you'll have to be patient during the story's buildup. Writer Szeto Kam Yuen SPL Exiled Dog Eat Dog weaves in yet another undercover story into Flashpoint with Louis Koo's Wilson as the mole within a gang of Vietnamese brothers Ja Ge Ray Lui in an over the top impersonation of Tony Leung's Big D in Johnny To's Election Tony Collin Chou and Tiger Xing Yu. A simple romance tale is worked into for Wilson with Fan Bing Bing as love interest Julie but as expected action movies seldom have much time devoted for love scenes.Without a doubt Ma Jun as a character overshadows them all with his motivations and drive. His temper is as quick as his reflexes and he doesn't tolerate bull from the top brass which resulted in rather muted or negligible action for about three quarters of the movie because his behavior is reined in by order. And there is a scene though which will make you question his excessiveness and wonder if his doggedness in pursuit and apprehension actually clouds his ethical and moral judgment.Flashpoint is still an awesome action movie when the time came for it to deliver the goods highlighting that Hong Kong action films still have what it takes to innovate within the genre. Oh and stay tuned during the end credit roll for scenes of outtakes which shows plenty of training that the cast had to undergo to perfect their MMA techniques. Sure packs quite a punch in this compact 90 minute movie.".

Intense satisfying action shot from every possible angle yet still filled with a spontaneous verite energy unmatched by any Hollywood film i have seen..ever.Its innovative style while a bit light on plot or dialogue OK so i am stuck with subtitles which obviously lose something in the translation overcomes any accusations of pretentiousness that could be leveled at a lot of similar films. The raw energy of the film leaks into every scene however still and explodes onto the screen when the action finally ramps up. Considering the violent nature of the film a lot of the actual killing is suggested rather than replayed in Technicolor from umpteen angles but we still experience every kick and punch as if it were flying our way.OK admittedly the story is about as engrossing as 300 or a lot of other HK cop films IE runs at a primal level deeper than mere plot twists or any complicated subtext. No its all about the man versus what he sees as injustice and occasionally about a friendship. Mostly though its about the battle for whats right even if thats not quite clear sometimes by the end you know who the good guys are and as manipulated as you might feel you are rooting for them all the way.OK I'm running out of superlatives and metaphors now..just go out and watch it if you like a good old school popcorn bash and can handle some underplayed buddy semantics.".

This new type of martial arts offers different and refreshing possibilities to the genre! And it looks great on the screen! If it didn't no matter how practical I would not accept this style! The final fight between Donnie and Colin is what the fight between Sammo Hung and Donnie should have been in SPL! This shows that Donnie is always learning and wanting to improve himself! I can't even imagine what Donnie's next movie Painted Skin again directed by Wilson Yip would be like ! This golden duo should keep on making movies together! In comparison to previous movies SPL and Dragon Tiger Gate made by Wilson Yip and Donnie Flashpoint is the best of the bunch!".

But believe me it will be worth the wait! When the real action begins you will be in for a treat! Intense Donnie Yen displaying his wonderful mix of Wushu and Jujitsu! His use of martial arts in this movie does make sense! It is realistic and practical! It is called mixed martial arts!  read interview with Donnie Yenuse Google article Donnie Yen on flash point combat. This new type of martial arts offers different and refreshing possibilities to the genre! And it looks great on the screen! If it didn't no matter how practical I would not accept this style! The final fight between Donnie and Colin is what the fight between Sammo Hung and Donnie should have been in SPL! This shows that Donnie is always learning and wanting to improve himself! I can't even imagine what Donnie's next movie Painted Skin again directed by Wilson Yip would be like ! This golden duo should keep on making movies together! In comparison to previous movies SPL and Dragon Tiger Gate made by Wilson Yip and Donnie Flashpoint is the best of the bunch!";

The plot has cop Donnie Yen trying to take down three Vietnamese gangster brothers who are not above doing really nasty things to get their way. Funny thrilling with great action and a visual sense that lifts everything up from the routine. Don't get me wrong this is a a pure macho action film that would be a B movie that you've seen a dozen times before under normal circumstances but there is something about the film that makes it all seem new or if not new it will make it so you don't care that you have. I think the film knows its nothing special but goes for it anyway and so becomes the little film that could.Forgive me I feel like I should say more but I really can't think of anything other than just see this movie. Its one of the very few films that have come out of Hong Kong with a good reputation that lives up to it. If I have to say anything else its that I wanted to stop the film to watch it at a later time with my Dad but found that I couldn't do so I just wanted to keep watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "A kickass police procedural with superb action sequences to carry it through. That's all you need to know about this Hong Kong thriller which utilises a somewhat tired plot line about cops going after a brutal criminal gang as a basis for some absolutely stunning martial arts scenes involving manofthemoment Donnie Yen. Watching this I was immediately reminded of the storyline of NEW POLICE STORY. Both films involve a thuggish gang of criminals who are always one step ahead of the law sending bombs to the police hurting and killing the innocent with a determined lone detective hot on their trail. I felt that the Jackie Chan film had the emotional edge but the plot here was perfectly watchable after a slightly shaky start.Of course such stories are nothing new and hardly anything that happens here is new. Therefore it has to get by on energy alone and it succeeds with a kind of breathless determinism. There are a handful of action scenes mostly brutal fights thrown in along the way to keep viewers watching but these are nothing compared to the largescale climax a shootout between the good and the bad followed by an extremely protracted showdown between hero and villain. It feels very much like an 'old school' kung fu flick this ending as scenery is destroyed and Yen battles the villainous Collin Chou for supremacy. Both actors went on record to say that this was the toughest fight scene they'd ever taken part in and it shows it's eyewateringly brutal full of amazing moves and relentless energy.Yen is on top form as the hardass cop and I liked his character. There's little of the vain posturing that spoiled his performance in DRAGON TIGER GATE. He's ably supported by the likes of Louis Koo as a sympathetic undercover cop Bingbing Fan as Koo's girlfriend and Chou as the slick bad guy. I found that the film looked good and I was entertained throughout so I give this one a thumbsup.".

	schema:headline " A film with lots of action which turns out fairly good";
	schema:reviewBody "Rating710Flash Point is a martial arts film that is full of fast violence overly dramatic characters and big car chases might sound a bit crazy but it is actually quite good fun. With a story we have seen before the creators had to bring something new and for me they brought great sequences of fighting that over shadow even the dialogue. For me the film was firmly a kind of good movie and here below is why I think it also a little bit underrated.The story is fast paced as previously mentioned and it makes the characters never quite seem safe or that gravity doesn't bound them to the earth as some stunts are maybe a little over the top but in any way it is still good fun to watch. It's a cop story that has been tried and tested but they manage to churn a version of it out well and for me personallywho has never really seen Hong Kong cinema it goes down well and this is a perfect advert for Good Hong Kong martial arts films in which I also believe we have to watch a bit more of even if only for it's crazy stunts.The cast do a very basic job and no one not even the main actor Donnie Yen do an outstanding piece of work. They do go well together though and I found the characters such as the one Donnie Yen plays as the cop who is rational and good hearteddeep down where as some other less savoury characters are around who are really evil and mean to take any chances to take those who stand against them out. The characters are also fun to see handle with the stunts as when fighting you feel some will not fight well but then BOOM! They hit someone in a mid air kick great stuff.Wilson Yip as director does a good job and manages to not make it constant fighting the film has some good drama especially near the ending. Of course when talking technical the main point anyone would mention is the fighting scenes which are choreographed superbly and even when with guns they do well the film is perfectly done for this kind of genre and for anyone who is an aspring KungFu director or choreographer this is a prime example. Locations are nice too and if I was the Hong Kong tourism board I would be praising this as it is beautiful scenery among all the carnage.It is a bit crazy and that is the main criticism the fights can go insane like with what I was saying about the anti physics fighting that just goes crazy. The script is a little weak and some things said are the most basic words ever know to man with no heart really going into much but still it makes for some entertainment anyways. One last thing is the basic story used which kind of is always seen and could anger some as maybe it is just too basic and average like.People who love fight films should love this and of course those who love Martial Art filmsespecially those from the area it was invented. I think also if you are looking for a quick film to thrill you this is the one with your heart beating maybe a few times but just have a look. People who want more classy action don't see this it's crazy fight scenes are just too much sometimes and could put some off with just one scene of fighting.Overall a 710 firmly a pretty good movie but never quite get's near being straight good but is in no way falling to just be OK. I feel with this that the film isn't so much memorable but still have a look and see and maybe you will enjoy it. Will also add that this is in no way a massive budget film and some explosion seem a bit weird but I will commend them for managing such good effects with such a low budget.".

	onyx:emotionText "Rating710Flash Point is a martial arts film that is full of fast violence overly dramatic characters and big car chases might sound a bit crazy but it is actually quite good fun. With a story we have seen before the creators had to bring something new and for me they brought great sequences of fighting that over shadow even the dialogue. For me the film was firmly a kind of good movie and here below is why I think it also a little bit underrated.The story is fast paced as previously mentioned and it makes the characters never quite seem safe or that gravity doesn't bound them to the earth as some stunts are maybe a little over the top but in any way it is still good fun to watch. It's a cop story that has been tried and tested but they manage to churn a version of it out well and for me personallywho has never really seen Hong Kong cinema it goes down well and this is a perfect advert for Good Hong Kong martial arts films in which I also believe we have to watch a bit more of even if only for it's crazy stunts.The cast do a very basic job and no one not even the main actor Donnie Yen do an outstanding piece of work. They do go well together though and I found the characters such as the one Donnie Yen plays as the cop who is rational and good hearteddeep down where as some other less savoury characters are around who are really evil and mean to take any chances to take those who stand against them out. The characters are also fun to see handle with the stunts as when fighting you feel some will not fight well but then BOOM!

But it's still a entertaining flick it has undercover cop elements in this movie but that isn't the main focus. But it revolves around cops and undercover cop trying to take down a triad group. There isn't as many fight scenes as I expected but there is one on foot chase scene that uses parkour a shoot out near the end and 2 fight scenes that somewhat stands out. Especially the final fight which both guys uses everything they have to beat each other up including grappling and is the main highlight of this movie.

Recently though I have started to overcome this and started to watch his movies.Flashpoint is a great high speed Hong Kong police action thriller. Sure the storyline here is something that has been seen before in countless other police movies both Asian and Western. But it still worked out well enough because Flashpoint has a good solid storyline and a heap of adrenalinefilled action and really well choreographed martial arts.Being a fan of Asian cinema and Hong Kong movies in particular I found Flashpoint to be a rather great movie and truth be told actually one of the better police actionthrillers I have seen in a long long time. I was immediately caught up in the storyline and was blown away by the action sequences.The people they had cast for the movie were great not only Donnie Yen playing inspector Ma Jun but also Louis Koo playing Wilson who always delivers a great performance. It was nice to see Louis Koo in a movie of this type and see him out of his usual element. And Collin Chou playing Tony really did a splendid job.As mentioned earlier Flashpoint has some really wellchoreographed action and martial arts scenes and sequences. But I must say that the final showdown between Ma Jun and Tony was jawdroppingly amazing. That was one of the best and most adrenalinefilled fights I have seen in a movie. That scene alone makes it well worth watching this movie.If you like action movies with lots of speed and adrenaline like martial arts andor like Hong Kong movies then you most definitely have to sit down and watch Flashpoint because it is a hard hitting spectacular action movie. Flashpoint is a welldeserving movie on the DVD shelves of any Hong Kong movie lover.".

Uncertain and awkward in the beginning looking how to behave in this elitist company he learns fast conquers the hearts of the wives of influential men by sleeping with them to break them shamelessly when a better opportunity shows up.Bel ami film adaptation of the famous classic novel by Guy de Maupassant is an adult tale of the rise of Georges Duroy to the top but also of the dubious and corrupt relationships between politicians and journalists. These themes are still actual and recognizable which makes the movie very accessible. The film makers did a big effort in creating a wonderful setting as authentic as possible. Also the costumes are a joy to watch.The performances were very well done IMO.Though Robert Pattinson was only 23 when he took this role he held his own against experienced actresses as Uma Thurman Christina Ricci and Kristin Scott Thomas who brought respectively the intelligent Madeleine the frivolous Clotilde and the devote Virginie convincingly to life. Because of his strong screen presence and the way he showed Georges' evolution from a beginning casanova to the cad he became Rob nailed the character and showed that he can have a bright future as an actor.Bel ami though it has dark themes is entertaining and has more than once funny moments apart from several steamy sex scenes. It depends of each one's perception of the movie but I can't help but being amused by Georges'conquests or is it Robert Pattinson who has succeeded to make an unlikeable character likable?If you love period movies it's a must see.

I was also skeptical of the casting particularly of the lead role. But even so I couldn't NOT see it.I soon found myself completely taken in watching the vision in my head from reading the book come to life on screen. The wardrobe and sets and music and lighting were rich and beautiful. The pace was excellent and kept me engaged every minute  the time just flew by.I was also completely won over by the casting including Pattinson in the lead role which was probably the biggest surprise. Not only did he manage to hold his own in the role and with a far more experienced cast he completely nailed George Duvoy. This required him to convey a depth and range of nuanced emotions and intentions through expression and tone and manner as well as interpretation of script. Kudos must go to the director as well.Some of the criticisms of the story or of the Duvoy character are mistakenly pinned on the actor's performance when what they are really reacting to is actually how the character is depicted in the book. That's an argument for the author not the actor or director. So I have to assume they haven't read the book or would not like it if they did. And certainly there are a lot of people who just can't be objective about Pattinson because of a strong need to belittle his teen idle celebrity and association with the tweenagetargeted Twilight films.I do think the movie is probably more enjoyable for those who have read the book and can therefore connect the dots and fill the gaps that a movie just doesn't have time to do  but that's true of any movie that tries to stay true to the book.I highly recommend the movie and the book to anyone who loves period dramas with great characters. It is beautifully done.".

That's why the story centred on his figure develops in a boring pedantic way showing no punch and no real pathos in search for a bounce that never comes. Nothing to say against the brilliant female performancesthe frivolous Christina Ricci is the only one who enlivens the pale and inexpressive face of Georges but Uma Thurman and Kristin Scott Thomas compete for the best performance the first perfect in the role of the ambiguous Madeleine and the latter courageous in her role of an ageing married woman losing her mind for a young lover and the last scene with her dressed in black at her daughter's marriage to Georges proves the only vivid moment within the whole picture.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Bel Ami";
	schema:reviewBody "Robert Pattinson is probably trying very hard to shake off his glittering vampire role in Twilight that had earned him millions of fans and followers worldwide opting to play a shady character who's not very talented but possessing enough good looks to tempt and seduce his way up the social ladder in 20th century Paris and to chase fame and fortune by milking the right female connections in his established network. He's a cad with a capital C without much of a plan except to sleep his way to get what he wants.The story by Rachel Bennette based on the 1885 French novel by Guy de Maupassant deals with the notion of how far good looks can get one ahead in life when one is without much talent or smarts having a number of doors that can be opened from a simple praise or a smile and to have urges satisfied by being emotionally and physically available even if the former mindset and actions are nothing more than a little play pretense.This is the classic rags to riches story and the story about insatiable greed in always wanting something more or someone more beautiful. Pattinson plays Georges Duroy an impoverished man who just came back from the war front and given a leg up in life when he runs into an old acquaintance who himself is married to old money. Pattinson almost sets his eye on his friend's wife Madeleine Forestler Uma Thurman if not for her to spurn his advances and to set the record straight that she's there only to help him initially in his job as a columnist..It is Madeleine's doing however to set him off into the arms of her friend Clotilde de Marelle Christina Ricci whose husband is almost always out of town and soon both Georges and Clotilde become adulterous lovers made all the more convenient when Clotilde gets their own love nest where they can carry out their illicit affair. In effect Clotilde becomes his sugar mommy and of course tongues will start to wag and Georges becomes increasingly erratic in not able to control his emotions before ruining a life that's perfectly set up. But second chances always present themselves and Georges couldn't get it any better with being reinstated in his job thanks to Virginie Walters Kristin Scott Thomas and ultimately being able to get married to Madeleine.But life isn't all that rosy with Madeleine spending a lot of time on politics behind the scenes of a revolution spearheaded by the newspaper and editors Georges works for and herself having her own lovers that Georges was warned way early of and when Georges starts to plot things get very ugly indeed as his true colours start to show emotionally breaking Virginie and unleashing his vengeance on Madeleine made all the more worst when he felt he had been played out of a huge chunk of wealth and going after the innocence of Suzanne Rousset Holliday Grainger as revenge against her father and his onetime corporate nemesis.And the surprise package here is Pattinson. Sure we can take out potshots and laugh at his turn as the glittering pale vampire involved in a romance that doesn't know when to call it quits but his effort here as the amorous and the evil Georges Duroy is something to sit up and take notice. But of course the women surrounding him all made him look good as well with Christina Ricci being relatively underrated here as a woman desperate for true love while Uma Thurman does quite the about turn now from her early debut during Dangerous Liaisons progressing from what was once the equivalent of a Suzanne Rousset to an ambitious woman who will do what it takes to secure a stake in the power play amongst men. Kristin Scott Thomas is perhaps the most underused here only appearing in a handful of scenes toward the end playing the most vulnerable of the female characters bearing full brunt of Georges Duroy at his most despicable.Directors Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod has quite a classy film in their hands with lush sets and costumes transporting the reader instantly to a period Paris and with the quality of cast at their disposal delivered an intensely engaging drama about the temptation and seduction of power and the incessant obsession with the climbing of the social ladder given the promises of fame and fortune that comes automatically with the ascension of each rung. Recommended!".

Pattinson plays Georges Duroy an impoverished man who just came back from the war front and given a leg up in life when he runs into an old acquaintance who himself is married to old money. Pattinson almost sets his eye on his friend's wife Madeleine Forestler Uma Thurman if not for her to spurn his advances and to set the record straight that she's there only to help him initially in his job as a columnist..It is Madeleine's doing however to set him off into the arms of her friend Clotilde de Marelle Christina Ricci whose husband is almost always out of town and soon both Georges and Clotilde become adulterous lovers made all the more convenient when Clotilde gets their own love nest where they can carry out their illicit affair. In effect Clotilde becomes his sugar mommy and of course tongues will start to wag and Georges becomes increasingly erratic in not able to control his emotions before ruining a life that's perfectly set up. But second chances always present themselves and Georges couldn't get it any better with being reinstated in his job thanks to Virginie Walters Kristin Scott Thomas and ultimately being able to get married to Madeleine.But life isn't all that rosy with Madeleine spending a lot of time on politics behind the scenes of a revolution spearheaded by the newspaper and editors Georges works for and herself having her own lovers that Georges was warned way early of and when Georges starts to plot things get very ugly indeed as his true colours start to show emotionally breaking Virginie and unleashing his vengeance on Madeleine made all the more worst when he felt he had been played out of a huge chunk of wealth and going after the innocence of Suzanne Rousset Holliday Grainger as revenge against her father and his onetime corporate nemesis.And the surprise package here is Pattinson. Sure we can take out potshots and laugh at his turn as the glittering pale vampire involved in a romance that doesn't know when to call it quits but his effort here as the amorous and the evil Georges Duroy is something to sit up and take notice. But of course the women surrounding him all made him look good as well with Christina Ricci being relatively underrated here as a woman desperate for true love while Uma Thurman does quite the about turn now from her early debut during Dangerous Liaisons progressing from what was once the equivalent of a Suzanne Rousset to an ambitious woman who will do what it takes to secure a stake in the power play amongst men. Kristin Scott Thomas is perhaps the most underused here only appearing in a handful of scenes toward the end playing the most vulnerable of the female characters bearing full brunt of Georges Duroy at his most despicable.Directors Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod has quite a classy film in their hands with lush sets and costumes transporting the reader instantly to a period Paris and with the quality of cast at their disposal delivered an intensely engaging drama about the temptation and seduction of power and the incessant obsession with the climbing of the social ladder given the promises of fame and fortune that comes automatically with the ascension of each rung.

Acceptable the fact that the whole novel might not fit into the cinematic body nonetheless the caspuled version falls flat and for me this turns out to be the worst adapted screenplays of all time! To start with the casting went terribly wrong Robert Pattinson never came close to portraying George  still in colored shades of Cedric Gregory and the vampire boy. The screenplay like i mentioned added to the misery overemphasizing on certain aspects which did mar the intensity of the plot and then underplaying the characters and the drama as if we were getting to see knitted episodes from a TV series. The saving grace comes in form of the background score which was brilliant  how i wished to see an appeasing drama for the music!!To sum it up this was a real disappointment for me i wouldn't have minded watching a 3 hour drama the movie really had the stuff to be that longbut this was just a capsuled dose of what i craved for  the ensemble cast and the build up to the release had sedated me it just blows  410".

Robert Pattinson's interpretation is entirely rational and believable. At the start of the film we see Georges hungry living in conditions that would lead anyone to become desperate. He sees the rich squandering their wealth and when a turn of fate allows him to enter this world he grabs it and initially cannot believe his good luck. However the men who made him decide they no longer want to support him leading him to take his revenge. He has learnt that everyone in these circles is flawed and are willing to take risks in order to get what they want so he feels that he can do the same.

There is nothing clichd or dated with the passion betrayal political and media machinations that take place. It charts the rise of a humble man through Paris society and the newspaper business via several women. The characters are realistic not one dimensional  no one is a all good or bad. In a short time one can see love insecurity and ambition. The pace is good and doesn't lag. It's intense but not melodramatic. A couple scenes are a bit explicit for some of R Patz's younger fans.Top acting from a European and American cast. Robert Pattinson has grown a lot as an actor. He used to have 2 basic expressions  the charming grin and the monstrous look. Here his monstrous look is well used to show the darker side of the central character. He also manages to show a multitude of emotions required by this complex role. He more than holds his own against accomplished actresses. Kristin Scott Thomas is terrific as always. Her devastation and vulnerability are fascinating to watch. Uma Thurman plays an enigmatic independent woman quite well. One fault is the casting of Christina Ricci  she isn't A list and isn't attractive enough maybe a Continental actress would have been better. Production wise the interiors include some lovely rooms. For the exteriors it would have been more authentic if they had actually shot in Paris with some familiar landmarks. It's such a treat to have a fresh exciting adaptation of great literature that hasn't been done many times. Do watch this one. This is the kind of movie that should be rewarded by box office success instead of the decapitation a minute type movies that rule these days.".

	schema:reviewBody "My son's review... Milik  Bel Ami I remember it was more than two years ago that word had reached into my ears that the novel of Guy De Maupassant titled 'Bel Ami' was about to be adapted on screen. The cast was already fabulous the leading role of Georges Duroy was given to Robert Pattinson the young actor trying to squeeze himself out of the stereotype of being a teenage idol. The list of leading actresses at the same level of importance or even more important included Uma Thurman Christina Ricci and Kristin Scott Thomas. The film already had a Hungarian relation as the Paris street scenes were shot on the streets of the more cost effective Budapest and even the French Riviera is substituted by the Tihany peninsula on lake Balaton. With the southern shore removed on postproduction as the viaduct of the motorway would show weird. Somehow the distributor had not found it important to bring 'Bel Ami' to the cinemas in Hungary but after all I don't care. Still the cinema in the not too distant trovo Slovakia had the film on its program. I joined my family on the trip to watch the film in English with Czech subtitles really Czech with the letter  in the text. There were five more people present in the comfortable air conditioned place which had the ability of 3Dscreening and 7.1 Dolby Digital sound. Not bad for the cinema of a small town with ten and some thousand inhabitants compared to similar facilities in the region. Before taking wide consequences from the low number of viewers I'd make the remark that the next film on the program did not attract more of them. So let the curtain roll.Just a few lines on the story if someone would not find it familiar the antihero of the story set in the year of 1890 is the hardly literate Georges Duroy who lives in a battered tenement in Paris and works as a railway cashier  and he becomes a social climber making his fortune mostly by sleeping with wives of powerful men. Meanwhile he is unable to write a single sentence on his own but he is indeed able to look charming and do things needed to win the hearts of neglected women. I think I don't rush too ahead when I say that by the end of the film the high society life sits well with Duroy. Very well.Is the story familiar? Several critics find parallel syndromes when looking at the life of Duroy and looking at the carriers of shorttime stars of the present days. This might be a real analogy but there are differences Duroy of the film does not think of himself as a talented man. He does not even act consciously he is a man of his instincts and he is getting shown a few possibilities which he uses according to his own talent. i.e. sleeps with more women The person showing these possibilities is Clotilde played by Christina Ricci who ends up being given a couple of verbal slaps given by the very man she loves.Let's now leave the storyline  if interested the book is present in the libraries or one can travel to a country where it is stillalready in the theaters. Or one can wait the release of the DVD. And then order it from another country... Take now a look at the actors. I admit that I'm not one of the screaming Pattinsonfans and there is no way that I'd start screaming if I saw him walking in the streets of this place. Yet he was a positive surprise to me looked with an empty face when he had to use an empty face and looked angry when he had to look angry. Duroy is such a character an empty shallow beast who gets angry easily. Hands up if you don't know such a person and smile because you're lucky. Listing the three leading actresses there is Uma Thurman as the injured intelligent but sometimes ebullient Madeleine. We've got Christina Ricci charming a little silly as Clotilde who loves Georges almost unconditionally  it's easy to believe that she's the poor good girl used up by the evil Georges. Kristin Scott Thomas is great at playing the elegant lady neglected by her husband. Philip Glenister plays the arrogant rich editor Charles Forestier brilliantly. Looking at the job done by the actors I don't find anything disputable.Taking a look at the directing of the film. Some changes between the scenes are slow and forced at the first sight but this is not Avatar and remember we're not watching a videoclip but a period novel adaptation. We get a large amount of closeups I found this a bit unnecessary and boring whoever was the subject of the actual closeup. It was odd to me that Pattinson was tried to be made look older by leaving this partly unshaven style. First of all it didn't succeed secondly in a period when guys had the possibility to join the army at the age of 18 or under being a retired solider at the age of twentysome is not very surprising. This unshaven style simply doesn't work  a mustache a beard or nothing. But this really is bagatelle.The music was all right the sound was fine. I've already wrote on the location it was funny to recognize some of the buildings. Or even the interior of the tenement of Duroy you've seen one you've seen them all some buildings in the inner city still can be sold as 100 years old almost without modifications.".

Yet he was a positive surprise to me looked with an empty face when he had to use an empty face and looked angry when he had to look angry. Duroy is such a character an empty shallow beast who gets angry easily. Hands up if you don't know such a person and smile because you're lucky. Listing the three leading actresses there is Uma Thurman as the injured intelligent but sometimes ebullient Madeleine. We've got Christina Ricci charming a little silly as Clotilde who loves Georges almost unconditionally  it's easy to believe that she's the poor good girl used up by the evil Georges. Kristin Scott Thomas is great at playing the elegant lady neglected by her husband. Philip Glenister plays the arrogant rich editor Charles Forestier brilliantly. Looking at the job done by the actors I don't find anything disputable.Taking a look at the directing of the film. Some changes between the scenes are slow and forced at the first sight but this is not Avatar and remember we're not watching a videoclip but a period novel adaptation. We get a large amount of closeups I found this a bit unnecessary and boring whoever was the subject of the actual closeup. It was odd to me that Pattinson was tried to be made look older by leaving this partly unshaven style. First of all it didn't succeed secondly in a period when guys had the possibility to join the army at the age of 18 or under being a retired solider at the age of twentysome is not very surprising. This unshaven style simply doesn't work  a mustache a beard or nothing. But this really is bagatelle.The music was all right the sound was fine. I've already wrote on the location it was funny to recognize some of the buildings. Or even the interior of the tenement of Duroy you've seen one you've seen them all some buildings in the inner city still can be sold as 100 years old almost without modifications.";

In all retrospect it's not a bad movie. The plot is believable and interesting the characters are all pretty well rounded without too much depth and the sets are very beautiful. However Robert Pattinson is quite a miscast. It is very obvious the entire film that he is detached and sorely lacking in some true emotions. Seeing as how he is the star it is pretty boring watching him mildly act his way through a film that has real potential.If you are going to see the movie definitely expect the female performances to be the highlight. Uma Thurman was splendid. She plays a very uptight and workdriven socialite who is a firm believer in her freedom and she plays it very well. Kristin Scott Thomas is another delightful addition to this film. With not as much screen time as the other leading ladies she manages to act out some pretty emotional and intense scenes. The real gem is the only truly likable character in the film Christina Ricci. Her energetic and very believable character honestly is the reason I give this film a 5 instead of a 4. She was so sweet and lovable I found myself smiling at every scene she appeared on the screen.If you are going to see this movie see it for Christina Ricci with Uma Thurman and Kristin Scott Thomas as a plus...".

	schema:reviewBody "Twihards insists that critics are unreasonably harsh on the virtues of Robert Pattinson but notice that they don't rally enough enthusiasm to actually see any of his nonTwilight flicks such I suspect this is because they realize that there youthful infatuation does not out way the fact that pictures such as Remember Me are not any good and possibly they also understand that Pattinson himself is no better than the material. In Bel Ami he is actually given very good material based on Guy de Maupassant's 1895 novel but he is merely only the weakest link in speciously poorly made movie.Pattinson plays Georges Duroy a literary rogue a skillfully charming social climber or as de Maupassant himself subtitled his book the history of a scoundrel. Here he is transformed by Pattinson into a thoroughly unlikable reprobate who's unreasonably smug and arrogant a womanizer and a manipulator it would be a stretch to call this guy an antihero. Pattinson lacks the necessary charisma to pull off such a role think of Johnny Depp in The Libertine a few years back he seems illat ease here as if he understands that the material is staggeringly out of his depth.A capable supporting cast comes across mostly badly for one reason or another. Uma Thurman is primed and proper but has to wobble her way through some horrendous dialogue. Kristen Scott Thomas plays frigid better than any other actress I know oddly enough a British actress she has been a lot more warm and human in some recent French language films. Here she has little to do but does successfully manage to exert great empathy for her repressive and shrewish character but she also manages to remain unmoving and their for dull. Colm Meaney and Philip Glenister two good actors play the other men in Pattinson's vehicle this may explain why they fail to get any dynamic scenes or many scenes for that matter away from the dull lead. Only Christina Ricci adds any spark in a spirited supporting turn but her role is only one dimensional she comes across more like someone's pet than as a fully developed human being.The proceedings unfold so monotonously that at one point Pattinson utters the line this is so boring this endless to and fro. You don't get any more surreal than when movie characters start uttering your own inner thoughts. Everything fails to liven the surroundings the sex is passionless the character's motivations either unpleasantly despicable or maidenly vague. No wonder Pattinson is famous for playing a vampire he is perhaps the most bloodless actor I have seen in ages these days he's outclassed by Daniel Radcliffe.Adapted by Rachel Bennette and directed by Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod first time directors who like most virgins know the basic moves but lack the skills to be fully satisfying. Set in and around Paris at the end of the 19th century the details look good though pretentiously photographed by Stefano Falivene it is filled with what one character calls astonishing depths of emptiness. Pattinson has recently formed a partnership with legendary cult director David Cronenberg they have a finished film title that I greatly anticipate titled Cosmopolis set for US release in August after that they have another film in development. Maybe Cronenberg sees something in Pattinson that has been missing up until now on screen but will fans ever warm to the actor outside of his popular franchise I don't have the answer but one thing that is for sure it wont start with Bel Ami a beggar's version of Dangerously Liaisons.".

	schema:headline " A Scoundrel Climbs the Social Ladder";
	schema:reviewBody "There is something to be said about a character we know we're not going to like from the very start and who spends an entire film working towards making us like him even less. Such a man is Georges Duroy Robert Pattinson who in Bel Ami connives his way up the social ladder of late nineteenth century Paris in a selfish and cruel effort to not be poor. Never once does he tempt us to see things from his perspective or to sympathize with him for he makes it clear that his sense of morality has been permanently warped. From the audience's point of view that does not make him any less fascinating or hypnotic a character the filmmakers understand that his handsome features and unrelenting coldness can be used as weapons against us inspiring curiosity and perhaps even lust in the minds of the decent. He's alluring by virtue of the fact that he's heartless.You can sense throughout the film an undercurrent of Choderlos de Laclos' novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses and the stage and screen adaptations it has inspired most notably Stephen Frears' 1988 film Dangerous Liaisons. But unlike the Vicomte de Valmont who destroyed love lives purely for the sport of it Georges Duroy's uses his amorality as a defense mechanism against his own upbringing. As the son of peasants he has seen the indignity of scraping together a worthless existence. He uses his unseen father as an example a man he claims worked his fingers to the bone with only the hope that the next life will be better. It's not enough to be loved he says in a controlled fury to one of his lovers. She does not understand where he's coming from. I've seen a man die he tells her. I am going to live. It's so clear to me.At the start of the film Duroy is a lowly railway clerk who barely makes enough to get a beer at the local cancan bar. This is after having served several years in the military which included a tour in Algeria. One night while prowling the bar for an opportunity he just happens to bump into his former comrade Charles Forestier Philip Glenister now the successful political editor of La Vie Franaise  the newspaper he claims that brings down the government. Duroy is gentle but direct as he attempts to manipulate Forestier into sharing his financial connections. Taking the bait Forestier gives Duroy his business card with his home address two coins for buying an evening suit and a verbal invitation to dinner. Although Duroy does come to dinner dressed to the nines we clearly see him using Forestier's money on a prostitute.When he first arrives at Forestier's opulent townhouse Duroy all at once meets the three women that will in one form or another prove beneficial to him on his ascent to power and wealth. One is Forestier's wife Madeleine Uma Thurman whose political connections are just as dangerous as they are extensive. Another is Madeleine's friend Virginie Rousset Kristen Scott Thomas the wife of Monsieur Rousset Colm Meaney the owner and chief editor of La Vie Franaise. And then there's another friend Clotilde de Marelle Christina Ricci who in due time will become Duroy's main lover despite having absolutely no interest in politics. Clotilde's unseen husband apparently a man of great wealth is usually away from home for long periods making liaisons between Clotilde and Duroy possible. Her young daughter comes to like Duroy almost immediately and bestows him with the nickname Bel Ami.Because of a convenient twist of fate I won't reveal Duroy and Madeline are able to marry. It's because of her that he's able to land and maintain a writing position at La Vie Franaise he's barely literate so she writes his articles for him feverishly taking cues from the latest political gossip regarding an upcoming invasion of Morocco. Their mutual attempts at oneupsmanship are surprisingly difficult to make sense of and it only gets more complicated with the addition of a prominent political figure named Francois Laroche James Lance. As their marriage grows increasingly icy Duroy continues his affair with Clotilde the one woman he seems genuinely interested in. As a form of revenge against his wife Duroy will start an affair with the insecure Virginie made all the more scandalous by the fact that she has never been someone's mistress.Although the plot is apt to meander and is not especially compelling especially when yet another romantic subplot is added to the mix during the final act Bel Ami does possess a certain seductive charm. In part it's because of the elegant set and costume designs but mostly it's because of the performances. Pattinson's take on a mannered scoundrel is intriguingly nuanced we pay more attention to the malicious words his character isn't speaking betrayed by the slightest smirks and subtlest nods of the head. Ricci is in especially good form which is nothing short of amazing given the fact that her character is hard to read. No one  not her not Duroy and certainly not the audience  understands why she keeps coming back to him. All we do know is that given his complete lack of scruples and his callous toying of the human heart he does not deserve her. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

It was a bad casting job specially Robert Pattinson he acted as there is a grief or dark secret he is hiding rather than that of determination I think he is still living as Edward Cullen. I would have preferred Jude Law playing this role. Rest of the actors do an OK job the only outstanding acting bit is seen by Kristen Scott Thomas and a surprise role by Christina Ricci. The director of the movie didn't establish that Buroy wanted to go up in the social stature rather than it more looked like a money issue only. Moreover throughout the movie it appeared that Duroy is having sex with other women because he is not sure of his wife's loyalty rather than to gain favors and power. A disappointing rendition of the novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bel Ami follows Georges Duroy Robert Pattinson and his sexual travails with rich women. And that appears to be the entire story. The setting is the Belle Epoque 19th century era of Paris. The women wear appalling makeup and monstrous hairstyles the men are bland and indescribable and the setting is supposed to mirror the lavishness of the rich and the squalor of the poor.The film is very skimp on dialogue and I couldn't describe any of the characters even if I wanted to. Every introduction or I'm assuming the scenes that were meant to be introductory were set to a dramatic classical music score and all that was revealed was that our hero liked women especially married women that verbally say no but physically say yes. The music didn't let up once throughout the entire film so essentially nothing else was revealed. It was a headache inducing puzzling experience that boiled down to empty pointlessness.Bel Ami is based on the novel of the same name by French author Guy de Maupassant in 1885. It's quite possible that the novel held some significance in the time that it was written but the question begs to be asked why was it made into a film now? And why was it made into an American film? It stars American and British actors speaking English with French accents while in Paris. That doesn't have to be a sticking point but if the film gives you nothing else to think about it certainly causes some headscratching.A key ingredient in all dramas is conflict of some kind. Good versus evil life versus death or morality versus immorality which I was expecting to find an abundance of in this film. But there was no conflict. The characters weren't necessarily happy or sad but like the film they were just nothing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bel Ami 2012 out of 4 This adaptation of the Guy de Maupassant novel isn't a complete success but the attractive cast give some very good performances which make the film worth watching. Georges Duroy Robert Pattinson decides to climb the Paris wall to riches by seducing three of the most influential women Christina Ricci Uma Thurman Kristin Scott Thomas that he can get his hands on. BEL AMI is a story that I was only vaguely familiar with. I had read pieces of it when I was younger but I wasn't familiar enough with it to say how well or bad the film captured its mood and spirit. With that said I'm always one that says it's not important for a movie to fully capture the book because they're just different things and I don't mind them not being alike. For the most part I was happy with the film as it does a pretty good job at showing what a rather shallow person can accomplish as long as they have the looks and someone willing to let themselves be walked on. I thought Pattinson did a very good job in the lead role as he could perfectly handle the seduction scenes but I thought he was most effective when it came time for his character to turn into a snake. Pattinson has a certain look that he's constantly got in his eye and I thought it told you everything you needed to know about this character. The supporting women are all in very good form and especially Ricci who plays perhaps the most mature character here. I thought she really brought a lot to the performance and made you feel for her even if you don't agree with what she's doing. Both Thurman Thomas and Colm Meaney are very good as well. BEL AMI does have a few problems including the final twentyminutes which just seem too rushed. I'd also say that the opening isn't nearly as strong as it could have been and I think there were a few dry moments scattered throughout. Still the performances are so good that they really keep you attention from start to finish and they make the film worth sitting through.".

But when Miyamoto enters the picture as the wily lawyer and employs her strategies the movie really picks up its pace and proceeds to the uplifting and somewhat sad ending.It is really great to see the evolution of the main characters from whimpering sissies into confident headstrong and defiant defenders of the old hotel.

The hotel decides to hire a sassy streetsmart and charming lawyer who also happens to be a woman to help and train the hotel staff to defend itself against the Yakuza's gentle extortion tactics.There are a lot of funny and charming moments in the beginning as the hotel employees try to deal with the Yakuza on their own and fail miserably. But when Miyamoto enters the picture as the wily lawyer and employs her strategies the movie really picks up its pace and proceeds to the uplifting and somewhat sad ending.It is really great to see the evolution of the main characters from whimpering sissies into confident headstrong and defiant defenders of the old hotel.  You'll laugh you'll cheer.Definitely a must see!";

I have seen so many yakuza films from the best contemporary directors of the gender Fukasaku Kitano Miike but maybe this is the first time I had the feeling of watching a real approach to yakuza's reality. Many books and studies on Japanese cinema says that the so famous Fukasaku's Battles Without and Humanity gives a more real image of what yakuza is where traditional gentlemen behaviors are substituted by more rude and bloody ones. And it's true but anyway Fukasaku's films still provided a very unreal image of Japanese gangsters who spread their deaths in thousands of litres of blood. Itami's Minbo no onna goes further and shows reality the dark reality that yakuza does not want to be known and because of it Itami was attacked by some yakuza members. This movie shows us that yakuza is not another dimension of Japanese society but it is actually a dangerous and active part of it. Minbo no onna is a very iconoclastic film too because it definitely breaks the romantic image of the Japanese criminal societies and shows all their bad points cowardice lack of honor they just appear to be interested on it but they actually have no honor pure interest on money... 100 reality. Not to be missed.".

	schema:headline " Not Itami's best but definitely worth a place in his oeuvre";
	schema:reviewBody "The rumours go that the Japanese director Juzo Itami was attacked by the Yakuza due to the realistic and disrespectful portrayal of them in his 1992 comedy The AntiExtortion Woman or more commonly known as Minbo. Realistic? I can't say for sure. But was it disrespectful? Absolutely. Itami crafted a niche for himself in the early 80s and late 90s with offkilter comic gems that reveled in their absurdity and dealt with unusual subject matter starting with his hit Tampopo. This feature definitely extends that offbeat sense of humour coupled with his darkly tailored undercurrent of social criticism in a simple plot that unfortunately is neither biting nor potent enough to warrant its lengthy runtime and exaggerated mode.Minbo according to the attorney Mahiru Inoue Nobuko Miyamoto is slang a truncated term for something that lawyers understand as the gentle art of extortion used by the Yakuza. She's somewhat of an expert in these matters as we see in a promising first scene at the poolside in Hotel Europa a firstrate hotel competing for the attention of foreign delegates. However the hotel's reputation is tarnished with the continued presence of the different Yakuza families who use the grounds as either meetingexchange places lounging areas or even to cheat the hoteliers out of some yen. The boardroom decides on taking action by assembling an AntiYakuza force from within but only manages a schmuck accountant and a meathead bellboy both with plenty to learn about the world they live in. After an inspired introduction to both of them the film gets down to the nittygritty of them failing to get rid of these foulmouthed shrewd gangsters. Well this movie isn't called The AntiExtortion Woman for nothing. And after about a dubious quarter of the film we finally get to be truly acquainted with Miss Inoue which really puts the opening scene's purpose into perspective.She's here for a reason and that's to help the hotel and in the process teach these men a thing or two about being men. The film is strongly attuned to its titular character with her presence alone driving the film forward in terms of its comedy and plot. She faces up to overly confident mob bosses and talks them down to the hilt with her legal expertise and wellprepared plans that rely on surveillance and the need to be vigil in the face of overwhelming threats. It's novelty wears thin after awhile though when she uses the same strategies over and over again with the new gangsters that show up. However it can't be understated that the film's bulk of coherence lies with these scenes as she mentors the hotel into selfdefending itself against these thugs.Nobuko Miyamoto Itami's wife is often cast in his films in a variety of roles. Her role as Inoue is by far the strongest in the cast that is usually prone to overacting and embarrassingly overthetop theatrics that can actually be described as vaudevillian. She brings a deep sympathy and caring into her role as a confident but never hubristic seasoned attorney that specialises in Minbo. She never talks down to the dolts in the casts and is believable in her persuasiveness with the Yakuza and Itami wisely revolves an inert comedy around her pintsized figure being surrounded by pompous large men that inevitably fall to her knees. She even changes a massive shift in tone by coming up strong in an uneven denouement at the end finally wising up everyone else to the virtues of being strong even in the face of hardship.Rating 3 out of 5".

In this story Miss Inoue a lawyer specializing in Yakuza extortion practices teaches a group of hotel employees how to better protect their hotel's future interests.

Under the pen name and later changed his name toJames Salter he published a novel The Hunters about Sabre pilots fighting in Korea. 4th Wing 2nd Lt. James F. Dad Low became Americas 17th and most junior jet ace with his fifth MiG kill on June 15 1952 just six months out of flight school.Unlike the older pilots many of them WWII veterans Low became proficient in the use of the new A4 automatic ranging gunsights on the E and F models of the F86 Sabre. The novel and movies bad guy Lt. Pell is a defiant risk taking junior fighter jock played in the movie by Robert Wagner Im a killer man! I cut em upyou know!Both Low and Salter acknowledge that the Pell character is in fact James F. Low. Korean War historians speculate that Robert Mitchums character Major Cleveland Saville is based on one or two of the four USAF Medal of Honor recipients from the Korean War either Maj. Louis J. Sebille who died in his F51 as commander of the 67th FBS 18th FBW or double ace Maj. George A. Davis shot down in his F86 as commander of the 334th FIS 4th FIW. James Salter is pretty much of a recluse but was interviewed by Tom Brokaw for NBC Nightly News three years ago. The movies 54th Fighter Group is apparently a contraction of the actual 4th and 51st F86 Fighter Interceptor Wings from Korea. The F86F30 Sabres in the movie were painted with the distinctive yellow band and checkered tail markings of the 51st FIW but with yellow noses much like the Sabres of the 12th FBS of the 18th Fighter Bomber Wing and with postKorean War antiglare panels. A major technical flaw is an insertion shot of a crashing Sabre dancing F100 Super Sabre in place of an F86. American F84F Thunderchiefs were painted up and used for the Russianbuilt MiG15 in both The Hunters and The McConnell Story.  If you look closely not all of the F84Fs are painted like MiGs in The Hunters. The movies top MiG pilot is Casey Jones 711 the Crapshootershown to be Chinese. We now know that virtually all the top MiG pilots were Russian. There were many Casey Joneses flying for North Korea. When bandit trains an actual phrase used in allied radio jargon and used in the movie script took off from Antung Airfield in Manchuria the real or mythical flight wing leaders were dubbed Casey Jones. A 4th Wing F86 Korean War veteran told me that Salters book was too close to the way the 4th Wing really was in Korea and that the Air Force wanted the script changed if they were to cooperate in the making of the movie. Even though a big budgeted movie budget restrictions prevented producerdirector Dick Powell my mother grew up with him in Mountain View Arkansas from filming oversees preferable in Japan. According to Robert J. Lentzs excellent book Korean War Filmography The Hunters combines Korean War aerial dramain beautiful DeLuxe color and widescreen CinemaScope photographywith more turgid human drama on the ground involving sexual desire and fears of inadequacy. Only a few Korean War films actively depicted the sky battles in MiG Alley and The Hunters does so with better aesthetics and greater excitement than Sabre Jet or The McConnell Story. Until the advent of Top Gun and its imitators The Hunters remained the premier jet airtoair combat film in terms of its aerial proficiency. I loved the book and the movie as a 12 year old kid in 1958 and have always remembered the tune to Paul Sawtells theme music march. For years I searched nationwide for a video of this movie with no success. A couple of years ago a friend of mine noticed The Hunters was on Cinemax at 2 AM and taped it for me. Hopefully 20th Century Fox will release The Hunters on VCR or DVD or better yet produce a new Korean War movie involving the legendary air battles between the F86 Sabre and the MiG15!!".

Robert Mitchum portrays an aging air pilot from WWII who manages to find one more war to find some success in. He lands command of an air squadron led by Richard Egan who was his leader during WWII. Mitchum puts together a wing squadron and starts out on hunting missions. His squadron consists of a nice guy a loudmouth guy and a lush whose wife Mitchum falls for. However the squadron does come together and manages to down quite a few enemy planes including a Korean ace nicknamed K C Jones.The film focuses on electrifying flight sequences that hold the attention of the viewing audience and the cast delivers performances that do carry the story. This film has been finally released in DVD by 20th Century Fox and I have replaced my taped VHS version with the DVD. It's very watchable and the flying sequences still hold their own. 710 but a strong entry in this genre.".

Robert Wagner's character is a thinly veiled caricature of ace Jim Low. Mitchum is typically laconic and I do enjoy him in this role in spite of or including the schlocky love story and the F86s are fun to watch. Richard Egan plays well as the retread group commander who pairs Mitchum and Wagner much to Mitchum's initial distaste.

	schema:reviewBody "The first 23 of this film was very good. There were a lot of exceptional airplane flying sequences in the filmwith lots of nice Technicolor and realism. I liked this especially since there aren't that many films about the Korean War. The rest of this 23 was made up of a romance that was very soap operalike. It wasn't bad but also wasn't particularly necessary. I'd give this part of the film a 7 or even 8.The final 13 of the film is just stupidwhich is amazing as the film had been very realistic and believable up until then. However in a dopey sequence one fighter pilot is shot down behind enemy lines and his commander deliberately crashes his F86 fighter in order to try to rescue this downed pilot it's just them versus the combined North Korean and Chinese armies!! This is insane to say the least and making such a belly landing was NOT easy like it looked in the film. Then when a 3rd American fighter plane was shot down in this same sequence when it was making very low strafing runs just to help save one pilotand not a very good one at that! I groaned with annoyance. Then these 3 pilots trek across North Korea just as easy as can be!! Duh this section of the film was just terrible and should earn a 2at best.Overall I'd give the film a 6. It could have been so much better and I was saddened that Robert Mitchum agreed to be in such a film! By the way since I am a huge plane buff here are some final technical comments. In one scene an F86 fighter plane is landing. Instead of showing an F86 blowing up on landing the plane instantly becomes an F100an entirely different plane. This is very sloppy and very noticeable. Did the film makers think the audience was THAT stupid?! However the film makers using F84s instead of Russian Mig15 fighters is more forgivableit isn't like Hollywood had modern Russian fighter planes sitting around waiting to be used in films!".

	schema:reviewBody "Within the last week Fox FINALLY released a DVD version of the VERY seldom seen Robert Mitchum aviation classic THE HUNTERS. My advance ordered copy from Amazon just arrived.This is one of two war films Mitchum made for Dick Powell. The other one the submariner classic THE ENEMY BELOW has been widely available for the last 10 years at least. I don't understand why the long delay in releasing THE HUNTERS... but finally the wait is over.The Korean War has long been a forgotten conflict in American history and the air war there has been almost completely ignored by Hollywood.That's a shame. Fighter combat in Korea marked a significant transition period in air warfare. The Korean War fighter pilots were the last of the old Stick and Rudder fliers. They were the last generation of knights of the sky who fought with gallantry and a respect for the skills and courage of their opponents. Even tho they were officially enemies wearing the uniforms of different nations the unspoken truth was that every pilot was the brother of everyone else who flew. In common they'd shared the thrill of flight and the dangers that came along with it. They might fight to the death in the skies but these warriors understood and respected each other. After Korea the airplanes became technologically advanced and ended the old ways of thinking. It was no longer a man to man confrontation air combat became a matter of triggering a missile that killed your enemy 30 miles away and you often never even saw your foe or his airplane. Air warfare became impersonal and detached.In Korea combat flying was still a very personal matter. The PILOT still flew and FOUGHT the AIRPLANE. After that speeds increased and things in combat happened so quickly that men couldn't control them directly anymore... the old piloting skills were replaced by electronics and the pilot became a mere backup system in case a fuse blew and in reality the AIRPLANE flew the PILOT. He was just a piece of hardware... the Nut that held the stick and throttle!There's a big difference between the men in THE HUNTERS and those in TOP GUN. I have my doubts that Maverick would have acquitted himself very well over Korea. Mitchum as Cleve Seville is a direct descendant of Flynn and Niven in THE DAWN PATROL and Cruise in TOP GUN is a very different animal.As far as the CD production is concerned... I'm surprised that they were able to find as good a print of the movie as they did for the DVD transfer. It appears to me that it's been digitally cleaned up it was almost certainly computer processed to take care of color shift in the '50s vintage single strip Technicolor.What was VERY surprising to me was the extra features. I was astonished that the teaser and trailer both feature a vocal theme song by Frankie Lane the guy who did all those vocals for '50's westerns! You probably remember him best for his vocal on the theme of Mel Brooks' BLAZING SADDLES.I always thought that the music for THE HUNTERS was badly overblown but after hearing the ill conceived Frankie Lane theme song I can now appreciate the film's score as VASTLY preferable... I like Lane but THIS effort definitely STINKS and invokes little more than shocked laughter.Well fellow airplane nuts the waiting is over. GET YOUR COPY NOW of one of the most sought after aviation films ever made.".

And enjoy it. Worth watching.Now. For the nonhistorical The good guys' airplanes are North American Aviation F86 Saber Jets. That bad guys' airplanes are Republic Aviation F84F Thunder Jets. This is perhaps the most jarring inaccuracy in the movie...but in 1958 we all understood that nobody with a herd of MiG15s and MiG17s was interested in helping make a movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "THE HUNTERS 1958This 20th Century Fox Cinemascope production was director Dick Powell's follow up to the excellent 1957 war film THE ENEMY BELOW. This one also stars Robert Mitchum in the lead role. This time however the action takes place in the air over Korea in 1952. Also in the cast are Richard Egan Lee Phillips May Britt and Robert Wagner. This one starts at an Air base in Japan. Personal are off loaded from the States then transferred to their units in South Korea. Mitchum plays a World War Two veteran pilot with the nickname Ice Man. He is one cool and deadly pilot. This will be his first action flying jets F86 in combat. Commanding his unit is another WW2 vet Richard Egan. Also in the squadron is Lee Phillips who has an over fondness for beverages of the alcohol variety. Staying in Japan is the pretty wife of Phillips May Britt.The men end up at a base in Korea and are assigned to fly patrols in Mig Alley an area just south of the border with Red China. This is where the various Red Air forces are trying to gain the upper hand. Each side is out to eliminate the other using ambush tactics and flying skill. At the moment the Americans have the upper hand but not without losses on their part. There are several Red pilots making a name for themselves particularly one who goes by the handle Casey Jones. Of course Phillips' wife May Britt and Mitchum are soon locking lips every time Mitchum is in Tokyo. But as much as Mitchum would like to step up the action he can see that Britt is still in love with Phillips. He makes it his mission to whip the drunk into a first rate pilot. Now enters hotshot jet jockey Robert Wagner fresh from the States. The kid can fly and after a rough start with Mitchum is soon knocking Reds out of the sky at a fast rate. While on a patrol over Mig Alley there is a nasty round of combat between the Americans and the Reds. Phillips is shot up and takes to his chute. Mitchum gets some payback by finally getting the best of the Red Ace Casey Jones. He then decides to see where Phillips had bailed out.Mitchum spots Phillips hanging from a tree and decides to crash land his Sabre nearby. He feels obligated to help Phillips. There is soon a squad of North Korean infantry closing in. Said infantry are shot up by Robert Wagner who is then shot down by ground fire. Mitchum and Wagner are now hauling the badly wounded Phillips towards the United Nations lines. They tackle a couple of North Korean soldiers at a guard post and arm themselves with several burp guns. Then they run into a family of refugees also heading south. Another squad of North Korean types show and liquidate the civilians. Wagner and Mitch step up and pay the Red swine in kind.Taking the dead civilians cart they load up Phillips and continue south. They are soon grabbed up by a U.N. unit of Greeks and sent back for medical attention. Phillips is patched up and will be sent back to the States. Britt and Mitchum say their goodbyes as Britt thanks Mitch for saving her husband.For the most part the film works quite well with some nicely handled action sequences. The film however slows to a snail's pace every time Miss Britt is on screen. The love triangle bit is just not needed or should have been trimmed by a good 15 minutes. Still it is a great looking Cinemascope production with excellent color. Powell does good work as the helmsman while four time Oscar nominated Charles G Clarke handles the cinematography duties.May Britt was another of a string of Swedish actresses who were to be the next Ingrid Bergman. The list would include Marta Toren Viveca Lindfors Signe Hasso and Inger Stevens. None of them were.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hunters 1958Planes Yes And a Battle Between Two WarsThe provocatively titled The Hunters is mostly routine patriotic stuff with some small twists of plot and motivation to keep it interesting. The general tone and the general outcome are givens. There are two halves to the movie. The airtoair combat which is exciting if you like that kind of action and well filmed and a human plot which lopes along with little consequence. This human half is is filmed so well you can watch it all and soak up the sets and framing and the gently moving camera scene after scene. It's a good example of a CinemaScope production using the wide wide look edge to edge. The most beautiful sections are set in civilian Japan which is an interesting emphasis for a Korean War movie. There are some pretty night shots that have great atmosphere filled more with charcoal colors than inky black shadows. The brighter interior sets are really stunning in their horizontal sweep and photographed with a kind of professionalism that's easy to take for grantedconservative beautiful camerawork. Add a little moment here and there like the longing in the woman's look after she moves to the door 14 minutes in and you have a hint of missed opportunity. And I don't just mean Mitchum's. I know other people will like the dogfights and military stuff and if you do check this out. It's not at all corny or clumsy but it all looks too much same to me even if I worry a little about who will get shot down next. A little. Notice how the movie gets far more compelling in the last half hour of fighting on the ground looking more like WWII. And still filmed beautifully.Significance? Actually yes. One serious theme throughout is weighing the small Korean Conflict against World War II. Mitchum a grave nononsense veteran from the earlier war is not only older and more experienced he has the credentials of the real thing. He's fighting in Korea because it's the only war going on and he's a soldier. He has the nickname the Ice Man but the name feels patched on so the movie can show he really has a heart underneath his steely reserve. It's a paradigm for a great kind of man I think and an attractive one even when oversimplified. By contrast the young pilots are casual and wisecracking lacking discipline and any sense of commitment mostly because their war doesn't demand it. One of them played by Robert Wagner is so cocky we know he's covering his cowardice. Another is an alcoholic and his beautiful lonely wife gets a little quality time with Mitchum who isn't above sneaking something past one of his young colleagues she's the little known Swedish actress May Britt who later married Sammy Davis Jr.. Anyway Mitchum makes good in the end. They all do those still alive.Underlying all this is the way the Korean War in its dubiousness made these men less substantial somehow compared to the men formed by WWII. It's a kind of Generation X syndrome and it feels real these Korean War Americans driven mostly by indifference ultimately distorted by the weird fact that they needed something bigger and more meaningful to react to. It's only after some thinking about it do you realize that Mitchum's strength of character might not be a result of WWII after all but of some innate sense of being a fighter. He's not looking for a cause but for a war. In this movie he gets a little of both.".

	schema:headline " Outstanding air war film. Good characterizations.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very under rated film.  Most aviation films flop because their plots fall flat during the ground portion leaving nothing but sameo sameo aerial sequences repeated throughout the movie.The Hunters is different because it could stand alone just as a love story. Yet the underlying plot the story of a career flying ace is strong and believable.  Cleve Saville is the guy with The right stuff. He's not a braggart.  Others like COL Imil have achieved rank andor status but know Saville is the real thing. Saville proves it.What got me was Mitchum's understanding of his role.  Whenever MAJ. Saville sees jets flying overhead he stops whatever he's doing to watch. A true flyer. SPOILER This happens in the opening sequence and the end scene when the love interest May Britt is telling him goodbye he is distracted by jets overhead and ignores her last parting gestures.SPOILER This movie has been panned when compared to the book but personally I found the book plodding predictable and disappointing.  The movie did a role reversal between MAJ Saville and LT Abbott.  Plus it added the character of LT Ed Pell who was based on a real hot shot LT who achieved ace status quickly because he had been trained on the newest USAF computerradar gun sight just prior to deploying to Korea NOT because he cut in on targets or risked other pilots' lives.  Also the Chinese pilot Casey Jones was based on a real Russian advisor pilot who was known by our side as The Professor.For precomputer special effects days the aerial sequences were believable the test your guns sequence WAS real and the Far Eastern scenery uniforms and ac markings accurate.  And unlike other Korean War films where F86s were painted with red stars and passed off as MiGs The Hunters used gray toned F84Fs which with their high horizontal stabilizers and straight chopped nose inlets were acceptable MiG15 substitutes.A good plot great aerial footage and ground combat sequences all add up to a first rate war flick.  Why 20th Century Fox keeps this film out of circulation is a mystery to me.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a very under rated film.  Most aviation films flop because their plots fall flat during the ground portion leaving nothing but sameo sameo aerial sequences repeated throughout the movie.The Hunters is different because it could stand alone just as a love story. Yet the underlying plot the story of a career flying ace is strong and believable.  Cleve Saville is the guy with The right stuff. He's not a braggart.  Others like COL Imil have achieved rank andor status but know Saville is the real thing. Saville proves it.What got me was Mitchum's understanding of his role.  Whenever MAJ. Saville sees jets flying overhead he stops whatever he's doing to watch. A true flyer. SPOILER This happens in the opening sequence and the end scene when the love interest May Britt is telling him goodbye he is distracted by jets overhead and ignores her last parting gestures.SPOILER This movie has been panned when compared to the book but personally I found the book plodding predictable and disappointing.

When the movie came out I had to go see it and the three movie stars Robert Mitchum as Major Cleve Saville Robert Wagner as Lt. Ed Pell and Richard Egan Colonel Dutch Imil became my favorite actors. The movie is an exceptional story of American pilots flying combat missions during the Korean War. The subject of their peril concerns a Korean Air Ace nicknamed 'Casey Jones Leon Lontoc.' This enemy is credited with bringing down a dozen American fliers and is the best the enemy has. Enter Cleve Saville so cool at his job they call him 'The Iceman. To help him in his squadron is none other than cocky Robert Wagner a hip pilot with so many first he hopes to bring down 'jones' before Seville does. May Britt plays Kristina Abbott the love interest and the human aspect of the story. An excellent movie so well done you could write a book report on it. ".

But virtually nothing in the book is in the movie! This is a classic case of Hollywood raping a serious book thinking they would clean up at the box office. If they had stayed true to Salter's novel the movie would be a classic instead of a curio that we watch for a Technicolor thrill.";

The glitches are hilarious especially the stock footage of the F100 floating on its engine power before crashing. Yes there are artistic flaws here and yes it's a love story more than simply a war story. However we can glean a lot more from these older movies by looking at some of the behavior that is special to the time. For example who knew that the Joe College lingo would call something George for good and Tom for bad. And Koo Koo Daddyo! That's early fifties and I was around 2 and 3 when the war was on and 8 when the movie was made. The philosophy of Saville saying he kills planes. You ask any fighter pilot and he will tell you that in the final analysis that's what establishes air superiority. You get a real feel for the times when you apply observation and reflection that's why I love the WWII movies. So...there's a lot more to these movies even the flawed ones than just the story.

She won the Los Angeles Film Critic's award for Best Actress of 1988 and received a Golden Globe nomination but unfortunately she must have just missed when they announced who the five finalists were for the Oscar. She has two scenes in this film where she just tore my heart out including one with Steven Hill from Law And Order who plays her father. The movie did get an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay and made many top ten lists including Roger Ebert's. Although it wasn't a box office hit I believe it will be remembered as one of Director Sidney Lumet's best films and certainly the best one to watch if you want to remember why the talented actor River Phoenix's death was so tragic.".

The best scene in the movie as far as I'm concerned was between Christine Lahti and Steven Hill who plays her father. Steven Hill has always been a favorite of mine and in this film he is magnificent as he comes face to face with a daughter he hasn't seen in years  and to boot the last time she saw him she insulted him. The scene is powerful but what happens when Lahti leaves the restaurant is unexpected and will break your heart.

The young man played by River Phoenix is someone we must sympathize with his dilemma is a lifelong choice between never seeing his loved ones again or continuing to grow as a very talented pianist.  The choice is agonizing and the ending is sure to bring tears to many eyes of people who are part of a closeknit family.  One scene is particularly powerful and makes me tear up every time I watch it The luncheon meeting between Annie the mother Christine Lahti and her father played by Steven Hill.  The dialog during this scene is so convincing and the acting is perfect.  But River Phoenix is the main reason to see this beautiful film and this simply underscores the tragedy of his death at an early age.  He had already proved he was a talent of considerable promise with in Stand By Me and in Mosquito Coast.  I fully recommend this film to all thinking people with feelings about the inevitable conflict between family and individuality.  This is a small film  what I call a little gem  most of which are small budget films with great acting and centered around the subjects of families and their values.  Also see Crossing Delancey another little gem.".

Emotionally you cannot help caring about the characters all of them. The premise living underground in ordinary American suburbia is brilliant and instantly engaging. The story coming of age on the lam flows effortlessly with hardly a slow spot and keeps me engaged even after umpteen viewings. The romance of love and loss and dedication brings a tear every time even just thinking about the birthday party as I write this.Plus  I was a 'red diaper baby' who became a conservative republican 35 years ago and this film touches every button of my past. A lot of those reds were in person truly decent people just a bit deranged and extremely delusional and dogmatic all of which Judd Hirsch conveys with perfect pitch. No special FX pretty tame action mostly involving music and dancing only six main characters but a great entertaining and inspirational film.Rated 9.9 out of 10 in case something better ever comes along.P.S. I just got the DVD. Even better than the tape. Elsewhere I have read complaints about its technical quality but I can see nothing wrong with it.".

Running On Empty is a moving family drama told through the point of view of Danny Pope aka Michael Manfield aka Richard McNally sp? played by the very talented and lamented River Phoenix. It's not hard to see why he got an Oscar nomination for this role but I find it insane that he didn't get the award. His portrayal of Danny was simply touching. Danny is loyal and sometimes awkward boy notice the way he stumbles when he tosses the bike into the bushes in the first few scenes he is also musicallygifted. The way he plays the piano is astounding. The audition scene is one of my favourites.Running On Empty has a lot going on for it a good though slightly flawed script talented actors Phoenix Christine Lahti Judd Hirsch and Martha Plimpton and BEAUTIFUL music. Also how often do you have movies involving teen romance that don't make it into something cheesy and unbelievable? Everything Danny does for Lorna Martha Plimpton is believable right down to the confession scene in the woods. Through his actions it is apparent that Danny is really  in love with her but can't be with her because he has to stick with his family. That alone is enough to bring tears to anyone's eye his dedication to his family and his willingness to give up himself for them. Another great scene is when the Pope family and Lorna are all singing and dancing to James Taylor's Fire and Rain great song. I think there is a reason why the song was played at the end again. So in short Running On Empty is simply fantastic. If you haven't seen it you don't know what you're missing.".

Another great scene is when the Pope family and Lorna are all singing and dancing to James Taylor's Fire and Rain great song. I think there is a reason why the song was played at the end again. So in short Running On Empty is simply fantastic. If you haven't seen it you don't know what you're missing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Art is the most intense mode of individualism that the world has known. Oscar WildeIn the 1970s Annie and Arthur Pope were responsible for the antiwar protest bombing of a napalm laboratory. Though the couple expected the building to be empty a janitor was present and was left severely blinded by the explosion. As a result the couple have spent the past 2 decades on the run from the FBI relying on an underground network of activists and supporters to help them financially.Sidney Lumet's Running on Empty focuses on Danny the couple's eldest son River Phoenix. Because the family jump from town to town constantly changing homes and even identities Danny's found it hard to settle and forge an identity of his own. His life is in a constant state of flux leaving Danny to find solace in music.Empty opens with an atmospheric sequence in which the Pope family evade the FBI. We then watch as they settle into a new town and enrol their kids in a new school.In one cute scene Danny arrives late to his first music lesson and is asked by the teacher to explain the difference between Beethoven and Madonna. Danny's answer You can't dance to Beethoven! and his teacher's later explanation sums up the central theme of the film. Pop songs we learn are largely comprised of a series of predictable rifts and choruses. Beethoven in contrast constantly thwarts expectations. He sets up a predictable route then veers off in different directions. The point is the young need a familiar beat. And so Danny who is constantly on the move constantly out of synch with the world is never given the time or space to develop a dance of his own. Ironically it is being out of sync which leads to great art. Being out of sync creates a kind of artistic objectivity. An outsiders view which Danny embodies.As the film progresses Danny clashes several times with his father a hippie and antiauthoritarian activist who insists that Danny must give up his music he's been offered a place at a prestigious university and stay with the family. What makes the film interesting however is that Danny is so softspoken and loyal to his family that he agrees with his father. This leads to a sort of internal conflict only recognised by Danny's mother. She senses the pain in her own son and tries to persuade her husband to set him free.But no Arthur refuses. If Danny enrols to the prestigious music school he will have to give his real name and real birth details. When he does so the FBI will track and monitor him which of course means that Arthur and Annie will never get to see their boy again. It's not a simple matter of forbidding one's son from pursuing art a common theme in films but of holding a family together. By setting Danny free Arthur and Annie effectively prevent themselves from ever seeing him again.And of course both Arthur and Annie know all to well how painful it is to be separated from family they were young when they committed their crime and so have not seen their own mothers and fathers in decades. It is thus an act of profound love which makes the family's decision so difficult. Lumet has always been an actor's director so its no surprise that Running on Empty features a number of powerful conversations. One of the best involves Danny confessing his identity to a girl he's fallen in love with. Another involves Annie's conversation with her father a man she hasn't seen since she was a child. Danny's final words to his father are likewise powerful.Another interesting theme is the film's treatment of art and political activism. Annie and Arthur both tried to change the world but in wanting to make the world safer for their kids they've effectively cut their own children off from society. The film then looks at the way the hippies radicals and political activists of the 1960s and 70s were enveloped and assimilated into a more dour suburban life rendered invisible not by choice but by what is essentially a complex blend of fear and threat of violence. For Lumet art in this case music thus becomes a form of neoactivism. A form of potent protestation and personal freedom. Danny in playing his music does not cut himself off from his family rather he reinvigorates the spirit and ideals they once fought for.8.910  A love letter to artists sensitively directed by Sidney Lumet. Worth two viewings.".

Judd Hirsch and Christine Lahti play the husband and wife and River Phoenix and Jonas Abry are their kids.There is excellent acting in this film and particularly by young Phoenix. The story shows us a good portrait of what it must be like to live in hiding. Politically people will view this movie as they think conservative or liberal because it could be viewed a number of ways.To me it showed the worst of what could have happened to young people in the '60s who believed they were doing the right thing but broke the law....and paid the consequence. The sad part as this shows so vividly is how it affects the rest of the family and others. I think the most powerful scene in the film is when Lahti meets her dad after 14 years in hiding very very emotional stuff and one of the most intense short talking scenes I've ever seen on film.".

I wasn't disappointed being very touched by this film and remarkably found myself crying during the final scene. The film has an interesting plot line that of a family on the run from the law while showing the impact on the children and was something I felt hadn't been done well before. Concentrating largely on the experiences and reflections of the family's eldest son Danny the audience can really relate to events within the film. It boasts strong performances by the leads of course especially the ceaselessly brilliant River Phoenix. Martha Plimpton was also very convincing as the love interest with attitude and their chemistry was undeniable. Some moments were clichd and unnecessary the inclusion of an excomrade and war activist who tests Annie Pope's loyalty to her husband seemed rather contrived and out of place. Overall however there were many warm moments in an understated wellwritten film. I wouldn't recommend viewing for everyone the film is slow in comparison to modern offerings but if you're interested in romance drama or even just River Phoenix this is definitely a mustsee movie.".

	schema:headline " Subtle grossly underrated masterpiece from Sidney Lumet..";
	schema:reviewBody "No one makes movies like Sidney Lumet. The man is in my opinion one of the greatest directors in the history of film. For evidence see Dog Day Afternoon Network Twelve Angry Men Q  A Serpico the list goes on and on.. One of the truly exceptional things about Lumet is that he understands and respects actors and due to this always without fail gets first rate performances from the actors he works with. Notice also that all the actors have nothing but gratuitous praise for him as a director. There is a mutual appreciation there. Read his book Making Movies if you're really not convinced of his genius. However going by the excellence of this film Running On Empty I honestly don't see how you could see him as anything but.Judd Hirsch and Christine Lahti both give wonderful performances as the exradicals on the run from the FBI for 17 years and the worried parents of two fastgrowingup boys but the undoubted star of the picture is a then 18yearold River Phoenix as their eldest son. Phoenix plays Danny Pope a 17yearold boy on the verge of adulthood who's never known a life not lived in constant fear of being discovered. Who for all his young life has moved from town to town with his parents and younger brother changing schools homes and identity at each stop so as not to be located by the government and punished for the acts his parents committed before he was born.The film concentrates on the latest identity the latest stop on the Pope families' neverending quest to evade the law. This stop as one eventually had to be is different. Phoenix's character falls in love with a girl played by Phoenix's real life girlfriend at the time Martha Plimpton and wants to stay. A move that would mean breaking up the family the one thing that his father simply cannot accept as a possibility. On top of this Phoenix is offered a place at the prestigious Juilliard school of music being a prodigiously talented piano player which presents another good reason for him to stay. The unique family dynamic is brilliantly portrayed. The tension the strong bond of love and the eventual acceptance that every parent has to deal with at some point of letting go of one's children. It's all there and it's all handled so subtly so poignantly so BRILLIANTLY.River Phoenix's performance ranks among the best I've ever seen from a young actor in my life. If you can picture a subtle mix of some of the best aspects of James Dean and a young Henry Fonda and you're coming close to what Phoenix achieved here.'Running On Empty' is a classic example of great poignant affecting emotional film making and acting and I give it 1010. Without hesitation.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant warm convincing straight up drama with great acting";
	schema:reviewBody "Running on Empty First of all what a great performance by River Phoenix. In fact there are smart convincing warm performances by all the main cast. At first you might feel this is a movie about a couple on the lam for a long ago crime and that they happened to have two kids. But really the opening of the movie an inside view from Phoenix's character's situation makes clear that he is the start and the fulcrum around which the rest of the characters swing. So the movie ends up being an interpersonal drama and you sympathize with everyone even if they have done a bad thing. This is open to your judgement for sure...a 1960s radical sentiment on the part of the left leaning director Syndey Lumet who had the early uberclassic 12 Angry Men as well as Serpico and many others. It was Lumet who drew me to the film but it was Phoenix who stole the show and who breaks your heart knowing how young he commited suicide. Look for the kind of classic filming and editing you'd expect from this wellschooled director. It's a warm film and it avoids pretensiousness and artifice turning instead to the innate abilities of the actors including a young Marth Plimpton. Plimpton is wonderful and she is given some classic lines funny and perceptive just as you'd expect this kind of girl to be. Plimpton was in another movie with Phoenix The Mosquito Coast two years earlier. So watch this for sure. It was nominated for a ton of awards and overcomes what seems to be a contrived tightly focussed impossibility of a plot and makes it work. Very well!".

The DVD is pretty good overall no features and mono sound well worth the price. I recall Judd Hirsh from his Taxi days and his character here the father is totally different. As is Christine Lahti the mother River Phoenix as the son and Martha Plimpton as the girlfriend. Watching the young Plimpton reminded me of watching the young Witherspoon in The Man In The Moon but Plimpton's career has not been so successful now that she has grown up a bit.In total Running On Empty is a masterful film has a great story and guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye as the son is set free given his chance to live and to attend Julliard for his talent with the piano.".

The story it tells of radicals in hiding and on the run while trying to raise a family but actually living the half life of the hunted is compelling enough but contributions of cast director and script make it something extraordinary.

Taut yet accessible you really care for this family warts and all.Beautifully acted by all but there are several standouts. Christine Lahti a great unsung actress is achingly real in her conflicted duty to her family and sense of frustration at their rootlessness. The scene between she and her father in a restaurant is one of the most moving you'll ever see in any film. Her work her really deserved an Oscar nomination in my opinion she should have won but an acknowledgment was at least her due. River Phoenix did receive a nomination and along with Martha Plimpton they offer the other really fine performances. His desires to remain loyal to his family and their situation versus his yearning for roots the exploration of his talents and a chance to find his own way in the world make compelling viewing.

Here're a few selected ironies the parents Hirsch and Lahti end up in the same situation they put their own parents in the choice Hirsch and Lahti make contrasts with the lack of choice their choice creates for their kids the necessity to stay under cover makes the parents appear to lead the straight life they rejected and not least in order to express their love of River Phoenix's character they have to sacrifice the opportunity for its expression.Phoenix and Plimpton do well but I guess it's usual for regular critics to dwell on the young. It's Lahti in particular and Hirsch who really make the film though  and quite agree with many comments here that Steven Hill's scene with Lahti is utterly superb. It's all in the eyes.I'm quite a fan of Sidney Lumet but many even of his best films notably 12 Angry Men have had a slightly distracting proselytising tendency.

The story revolves around Ryan Dunn and his serial cheating girlfriend which is supposidly based on a true story  in short this film is bloody funny and if I was you I would attempt to see it at all costs. This is not Shakespare in Love and this is not the Shawshank Redemption if it had been made half as seriously as either of these two films then it would have been crap... but seen as they set out to make a crap movie then its actually pretty good.8 out of 10.".

I must say before i write anything more that if you have not seen any of the CKY Camp Kill Yourself videos than the movie most likely won't be AS funny. My advice is to watch a few clips of those videos that Bam and his friends made. Haggard does not take itself seriously AT all and that was never the purpose. Throughout the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot which may get annoying but its nothing that is out of control. Even through all that the plot does stay focused and the story of Ryan Dunn's character does unfold quite nicely. This plot i have been told is based off a true story for the most partof Ryan Dunn's exgirlfriend. Brandon Dicamillo is by far the best character in the movie. He has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh. He stole the movie if you ask me. Overall I love this movie for its simplicity and straight up weirdness. Its a Bam movie people its not going to be normal. Haggard is filled with hilarious quotes that my friends and I constantly used since the first time we saw it. I've seen the movie 67 times and still find new things every time. The soundtrack is just as good. Everything from Gnar Kill to New Order and some techno. Just don't go into the movie with high expectations let it all unfold and then judge it for what it is.".

It's a humorous little nonspecific Canadian french accent that pretty much is the extent of his performance basically funny for 5 minutes and then its like 'ok you're pretending to be foreign enough alreadyMaybe it would work if they were going for parody but all they succeed in doing is making a movie with an IQ of zero. I love toilet humor as much as the next guy but this isn't even lowbrow its just stupid.

Seeing this one it clears up a lot of the confusion I had with Minghags. I wasn't aware this was the predecessor to the film but seeing it now really makes me take a liking to Bam Margera's independent style of filmmaking.Before Jackass Bam Margera took part in a series of videos he called CKY named after the band. He wound up making several volumes of him and his friends like Raab Himself Ryan Dunn Rake Yohn etc goofing around and being themselves. Then he went on to be a member of Jackass and do his own MTV shows like Bam's Unholy Union and Viva La Bam. Haggard The Movie was the middle of the road coming out in 2003. A year after the first Jackass movie.It's supposedly a true story remade with the characters in the movie are played by Bam's friends. Ry Dunn is upset when he finds out his girlfriend Glauren Rivell wants time apart. He then realizes that she is hanging out with a heavymetal punk nicknamed Hellboy Yohn. To help their friend out Valo Margera Falcone DiCamillo and Raab Himself Raab all try to vandalize Glauren's house. But Ry is still sinking deeper and deeper into a mental depression.The humor is totally up my alley with lots of rough housing name calling and well acted natural conversations. The movie is not too long or too short. It is perfectly managed. The only downside is it has one montage too many. Many of the montages in the movie are set to skateboarders with rock music by CKY Gnarkill and H.I.M. in the background. I have no problem with any of the music played but there are at least four montages in the film that go on for way too long.Other than that the film is pretty close to perfect. I was under the assumption that since most of these guys are used to doing dangerous stunts they couldn't really do justice acting in a full length movie. I was way off. They pulled if off perfectly. In no way was I expected Bam and Dunn could both act as well as they did.Between the soundtrack the filming style the humor the acting and the story Haggard The Movie wins in every category. Except the fact that the number of montages can be tedious and the subplot of an invention doesn't really take off as much but we see it done with more in the sequel. Haggard The Movie is not only a great film but a great way to remember an amazing actor and daredevil.Starring Ryan Dunn Jenn Rivell Bam Margera Brandon DiCamillo Chris Raab Rake Yohn and Vincent Margera.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard of this movie I was mildly interested. The plot seemed like an opportunity for hilarity and Bam Margera as an actor and director seemed like something that might be good. When I found out the movie starred Ryan Dunn I was even further interested I was a fan of Homewrecker when it was on... Yeah I'm that lame. However I didn't have much faith in it being to good.

This movie was painfully bad I was falling asleep during it and ultimately turned if off before it was over.Ryan Dunn does a decent job in the lead role but most of the acting is pretty bad. The design and cinematography felt very art school film studentish. As it was mostly done by our favorite CKYers. At times the movie has the look and feel of a music video and while I love to watch Bam skate his occasional skating montages through the fill were I assume only to give the move a reputable length of 96 minutes.Unless you are only watching this to get a daily dose of the beautiful CKY men skip this one".

	schema:headline " A fantastic comedy by some daring performers";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this back in 2006 and I got to say this is one of the funniest films I've seen in such a long time. Bam Margera's technically directorial debut known as Haggard really delivers something special and original to us as it's really a romantic comic tragedy but made by either Jackass stars or CKY stars if you're fans with any of them... Haggard tells the story of Ryan Dunn playing himself who gets dumped by the love of his life 'Glauren' for some dude named 'Hellboy' and ever since the devastating news he swears revenge and gets his pals Valo and Falcone to do his dirty word some of that is pun at Glauren's house. It's such a ridiculous concept but somehow I have a feeling that we can all relate to this film due to losing someone we love and having mixed emotions over it.What I love about this film is that it's a film clearly made just for fun. Sure it was funded and well plannedstructured however you can tell they had a good time making it and most of the characters are played by either friends or family of Bam's. But there's something personal behind it and I didn't realise until now that the story is based on Ryan's actual love life where something like that actually happened. You really feel sorry for Ryan and his pain behind it all and for that you're keen to know what happens until the very end.What I didn't like about the film and unfortunately this happens a lot. I didn't particularly like the skateboarding montages and I felt that Bam needed to remind us that they're also skilled skaters as well as actors. Is this CKY I'm watching now or a narrativefilm? I'm a massive fan of HIM and thought that the music choice was incredible so there's a positive about those random montages throughout the feature.Overall a fantastic film about love and anger dealing with the sadness that we can all relate to if we ever had someone to brake our hearts but still laugh out loud to those lovable characters who either get ped on smear s on the door videotape girl's under wears in their house.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like CKY and Viva La Bam so I couldn't resist this when I saw it for 1.99 in Gamestation. It is Bam Magera's debut scripted film penned by himself and Brandon Dicimaillo and stars the entire CKY crew Ryan Dunn Raab Himself Rake Yohn Jenn Rivell Don Vito etc etc. Brandon also is in charge of the artistic direction  which is one of the film's greatest merits  its quite CKYish in its colour style  but also shows progression.Basically it follows very loosely Ryan Dunn's break up with girlfriend Glauren played by Jenn. Vilo played by Bam named after Vilo Valo by any chance? and Falcone Bran play his best mates who reek havoc by doing various stunts.Its a bit like the CKY films but with a linear storyline which is very basic indeed and poor acting. Its strange the usually super charsmatic gang seem to have the life sucked out of them when they know what their meant to say next.The acting and script is pretty appalling for the most part but the second half of the film is much better than the first 90 mins is a stretch for the flick though and there are a number of redeeming factors such as Tony Hawk's cameo Dicimaillo's sub plots such as 'The Futurstic Invention Awards' and 'The Diamond Bike' the soundtrack is also very strong its not ALL cKy and HIM  in fact Bomfunk MC's steal the film in terms of its use of music. In the second half of the film the sense of fun is much more real  especially since Don Vito has a fairly prominent role in the latter part  and he seems to steal every scene he is in.The film will appeal to those who like the CKY antics but only because of the core material and not the filler or story line bullshit. Oh and will someone tell Bam that skating montages especially in films is sooo 1998.However the best part of the package on the DVD is not the film  but the 40 mins 'Making Of' doc.The last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with Raab Himself's alcholism and the crew's real feelings towards each other amazing candidly as usual Bam comes across as a bit of a dick especially towards Raab's drink problem and Ryan Dunn comes across as a really nice down to earth guy. The last ten mins of the documentary deal with a friend who is an infrequent CKY member trying to kick heroin whilst staying at the Magera household with the crew  and a caring unitary side of gang espcially Ape and Ryan really comes across  a startling gem in an otherwise dull DVD.For 1.99 I'm very satisified  although I hope Bam stays to the improvised and short skits from now on.".

Overall i think the characters in this film aren't with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character.To say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time.Towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn although a lot of the attention is on Bam and Brandon.In conclusion this film is OK if you laugh at things that aren't very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene! Also i think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music! 710".

I'm pretty sure the entire movie was filmed in Bams home town which includes a lot of his regularly visited locations. The cast of is made up of all his friends and cky buddies and also includes some big name pro skateboarders too. The soundtrack is phenomenal with music by HIM. In my opinion Haggard has it all.

	schema:reviewBody "The Icicle Thief is a very difficult film to describe by plot. In fact I can't think of any other film that is so hard to describe. Don't let that fact hinder you from watching this film! The Icicle Thief is a wonderful film and I strongly recommend it! I think the easiest way to describe The Icicle Thief would be to say there are four basic plot elements involved1. A motion picture is being shown on national Italian television this is where the parody of The Bicycle Thief comes in. 2. There are commercial breaks during the airing of the film. 3. The director of the film being shown on television is present in the television studio. 4. An Italian family watches the film from their living room.The motion picture that's being shown on Italian television is similar to the classic The Bicycle Thief and the film's director is nervous about its broadcast. The film eventually copies a key scene from The Bicycle Thief and a character steals a crystal chandelier from the chandelier factory where he works. The stolen icicles are the dangling crystals of the chandelier. Everything seems to be running as scheduled with the broadcast of the film. Suddenly something goes haywire as the film is being broadcast! A lovely swimsuit model from one of the commercials gets transported into the film that's being shown! Also characters from the film being aired find themselves in the commercials! Black and white meets color and the English language meets Italian as the characters go into worlds which are not of their own media. It's up to the film's director to save his film as it's being aired and he manages to go into the world of his film to straighten it all out. The results are humorous delightful and even joyous! While all of this chaos is going on a family watches the film unfold in the comfort of their living room. They aren't too sure what to make of the film that's being broadcast onto their television!The Icicle Thief is a very imaginative film and a very wellmade film. Director Maurizio Nichetti has crafted something unusual and special. The performances are wonderful including Maurizio Nichetti's own performance as the director of the film that's being shown on Italian television. Caterina Sylos Labini turns in an excellent performance as the pastamaking wife and mother in the parody of The Bicycle Thief. Heidi Komarek gives The Icicle Thief a fun touch as the English speaking television commercial model who finds herself suddenly transported into the Italian film as it's being broadcast. One of my favorite moments happens when Maria Piermattei Caterina Sylos Labini a character from the black and white Bicycle Thief parody finds her little boy has left the black and white film to join a colorful television commercial. It's a moment of colorful brilliance and joy!".

	schema:reviewBody "This offbeat Italian comedy uses the familiar black and whitecolor dichotomy to indicate different worlds a technique always in danger of being overdone. Last time I saw it was in Hollywood's Pleasantville 1998 where it was so cloying it annoyed the first time magically in The Wizard of Oz 1939. It was even done to good effect in Spielberg's Schindler's List 1993. Here the film is in black and white as it's being shown on TV and the commercials are in color. The characters bizarrely go from one world to the other while somewhere in between is the real world of TV viewers. Because the world of TV commercials is the more fantastic I think the technique works well here. Maurizio Nichetti who might and might not remind you of Roberto Benigni stars as Anotonio Piermattei the icicle thief the protagonist of the movie within a movie which is a Bicycle Thieflike tragic film that the TV people manage to mangle into a TVlike romantic comedy. If you're wondering how one can be an icicle thief keep wondering. I'll never tell. Nichetti also plays the auteur of the film being shown on TV who is invited to be interviewed but never gets to speak partly because the film critic who is to do the interview thinks they are viewing a different film.The title notwithstanding this is not a satire or a spoof of Vittorio De Sica's internationally acclaimed The Bicycle Thief 1948 although De Sica himself might be seen as being lightly satirized. Nichetti's The Icicle Thief is more like an identification as it attempts to stand with the art film solidly against commercialism. However any similarity between the film within a film here and De Sica's masterpiece is sycophantic. This is not to say that The Icicle Thief does not have its moments and its charm. It does.Caterina Sylos Labini who plays Maria Antonio Piermattei's singing wife is charming as the archetypical Italian femme fatale a dark lusty earthy woman who can cry and laugh at the drop of a hat. She is contrasted with Heidi Komarck a colorized blonde model in a butch haircut who does TV commercials. Komarck looks like a member of the Swedish ski team draped in a lingerie outfit that leaves little to the imagination while speaking only American English. My favorite part of the film was the cute shtick with Maria's happy oneyearold daughter who crawls continually into mischief grabbing a knife by the blade putting an electric wire in her mouth etc. but somehow never has to shed a tear.That this is a satire and spoof of TV and not De Sica's Bicycle Thief or oldtime neorealism itself is immediately apparent when the TV film critic has to ask the name of the film he is critiquing. On TV the only things that really matter are the commercials. So to the extent that a Big Big candy bar jingle and a laundry detergent superhero triumph over a black and white neorealistic film we can see that triumph as a satire of television and its middlebrow audience.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	onyx:emotionText "This offbeat Italian comedy uses the familiar black and whitecolor dichotomy to indicate different worlds a technique always in danger of being overdone. Last time I saw it was in Hollywood's Pleasantville 1998 where it was so cloying it annoyed the first time magically in The Wizard of Oz 1939. It was even done to good effect in Spielberg's Schindler's List 1993. Here the film is in black and white as it's being shown on TV and the commercials are in color. The characters bizarrely go from one world to the other while somewhere in between is the real world of TV viewers. Because the world of TV commercials is the more fantastic I think the technique works well here.

So quite a labour of love and an impressive achievement. The movie operates I guess in three distinct ways  as a parody of the film The Bicycle Thief 1948 and Italian neorealism in general a satirical assessment of commercialism vs art and lastly as an inventive bit of imaginative cinema where three worlds merge together. The worlds of course are the 'real' world of the TV studio and households watching television the world of the movie itself and lastly the world of the commercials. It's an idea which is executed very nicely with some fun crossreferences between the realities which allows for a few amusing observations.

If the director was not determined for movie to be all about harem there was a place to make a decent end. Not everything should be left to one's imagination.When I think about the movies as a whole I really liked it and some actors were really really good f.e. Desgraz. Locations were beautiful and were more or less the same as I was imagining while reading the books. I think I will read the books again ".

Having read the books i know that it could have been easily full of action and the end itself should have been better. And what about their encounter with their children? If the director was not determined for movie to be all about harem there was a place to make a decent end. Not everything should be left to one's imagination.When I think about the movies as a whole I really liked it and some actors were really really good f.e. Desgraz. Locations were beautiful and were more or less the same as I was imagining while reading the books. I think I will read the books again ";

Now at the prologue to this third film you see her brand new husband who she wed at the end of the second film...and of course he dies! I felt like yelling out to each man she slept with in this film to run! While she herself never killed anyone the results are still hard to discounttwo lovers and two husbands dead.Soon after this latest death the King himself Louis XIV meets with our heroine and begs her to help convince the Persian Ambassador to agree to a treaty. However what they didn't realize was that the handsome Persian was in fact a sexual sadist. So it is up to the King's half brother some Hungarian prince to save Anglique from the evil troll's clutches. Later the Prince returns to get a thank you bit of nookie and I automatically assumed he'd soon be dead.Later she is summoned to Louis' court and it appears she's about to become his mistress. However when she learns that her first husband might not be dead she leaves in search of hima good idea since someone is trying to poison her at Versailles. Unfortunately whoever dislikes her isn't just trying to get her away from the King as they soon make another attempt to poison her in her own palace this by the way is a particularly cool scene. Does it ever end for poor Anglique?! Just before she can go off in search of her missing husband Anglique accidentally stumbles into a Satanic cult at Versailles!! And it's not the nice Satanic cults that give out donuts and candy on pagan holidays but the baby sacrificing kind! Will our dear heroine survive? Will she get back her scarred but sexy Marquis? Will men stop dying once they have sex with her? Tune in to find out for yourself.Overall this film is a good bit better than the second sequel. The second had even more plot elements and twists than this onetoo many for one film. Here though there seems to be everything but the kitchen sink thrown in at least it's easier to follow and more satisfying.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nadine Labaki perhaps not a familiar name not yet. You are certain to hear more of her well beyond this report about her first film Caramel. The young Lebanese beauty is not only the star of this heartwarming and unusual movie but also its director and cowriter.Unusual? It sure is a contemporary film taking place in Beirut without any reference to the wars tearing the city apart for decades now. There is a parallel here with another excellent film making its U.S. appearance The Band's Visit of an EgyptianIsraeli encounter set deliberately outside the political context. Unusual? Amazingly so when you realize having witnessed an extraordinary ensemble performance that all but two of the cast members have no acting experience.It's all great acting by nonactors and you wouldn't know it without a press release.Sex in the City with brains realism and without affectation Caramel tells the story of five women in a Beirut beauty salon their lives and dreams. The tone is simple intimate the characters are different from each other but all likable and real. Caramel is a movie to enjoy beyond its vitality and good humor it offers the viewer the acquaintance of everyday believable people you can care about.The title refers to the pliant caramelized sugar used for hair removal material that can be used for good removing hair or ill inflicting pain on a lover's wife who ends up in the wrong salon. It is something sweet and salt sugary and sour of the delicious sugar that can burn and hurt you Labaki has said.The director  whose theme and work are reminiscent of Pedro Almodovar's early films  is Layale the owner of the salon a woman in her early 30s who should be married by now but instead she carries on a passionate for her affair with a married policeman. Layale is Christian her best friend working in the salon Nisrine is a Moslem woman of 28 about to get married but she is facing a daunting obstacle. The role is played memorably by one of the film's many amateur actors Yasmine Al Masri.Also in the salon Rima a 24yearold tomboy played by Joanna Moukarzel in real life business manager with an electrical appliance company! who is quietly struggling with her growing interest in women. It is one of the many glories of Caramel how her friends literally look the other way when Rima  very much in love  cuts the hair of a beautiful stranger Siham Fatmeh Safa who should be a model and an actress but is neither.Among the many fascinating characters Jamale a customer who virtually lives in the salon a woman in denial of and battling her age Lili a crazy aunt who collects parking tickets from windshields and the men in the cast  relegated to supporting roles but not belittled or presented in a hostile manner. It's not so much a women's picture as a film for and about people.With splendid cinematography by Yves Sehnaoui and appealing music by Khaled Mouzanar Caramel completed production work in 2006 one week before the most recent bombing of Beirut began.".

The protagonist and director is a breathtaking and very convincing actress I had no doubt all the ladies of the cast were good friends and would have hung out all their lives. The storyline is kept simple and clear so even if you don't follow the subtitles you easily understand the movie. I don't like to compare it with any other movie I saw but speaking of colors and emotions it reminded me of Almodovar's movies dedicated to the women in his life. Even though I'd have preferred to see more of the name giving caramel for about two hours I was transported into the oriental world of spices taxi drivers aunties grandmas uncles nieces' sisters and brothers living laughing and mainly eating together. The movie combines a very traditional Lebanon with very modern questions emancipated women and not to forget love. Leaving the cinema I felt loved and happy I strongly recommend it!".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the official submission of Lebanon for Best Foreign Film in 2007. Though the ones selected appear a bit repetitive seems to be a war theme there is no good reason Four Months Three Weeks and Two Days was not selected except for that this is not really best film of the year quality. This might lead to some disappointment for those who thought it was as a few comments seem to.But it is a good movie. It has been compared to Beauty Shop which I have not seen so I don't know. The film though foreign is rather universal in many ways all the same  the cell phone for instance is familiar presence. And the women who work at the shop all seem pretty independent not as traditional as some members of their family. There is also someone who brought to mind a young Melissa Etheridge in more ways than one. The older single mom fighting aging and struggling to get acting jobs also seems familiar. One can imagine this film e.g. taking place in Spain with little altered.But from my limited knowledge Lebanon is fairly cosmopolitan visavis various other places in the Middle East. And there are reminders including the owner of the shop living with her parents and the problems a young Muslim woman ready to get married has when her finance doesn't know she isn't a virgin. The mixture of Christian and Muslim also takes an added meaning given the setting. This adds foreign flavor to a film that still remains largely universal.Anyway as to the film itself. It is an ensemble piece with the directorstar having a slightly superior role though the older seamstress that must deal with a mentally retarded aunt or whatever also has a lot of screen time. The owner of the shop is having an affair with a married man while a lovelorn traffic cop pines for her. This latter part is touching and the actor here as does an older gentleman who favors the seamstress is charming in his small role. Such touches often make movies and it helps this one.Overall I cared for these people and thought the performances were good and true to life. Someone noted the film's stories ultimately are a bit thin. This is probably true but they are good all the same and in some ways quite touching. I was not wowed or anything but simply thought it was a good film. Not best material but no need for that to enjoy things.".

This latter part is touching and the actor here as does an older gentleman who favors the seamstress is charming in his small role. Such touches often make movies and it helps this one.Overall I cared for these people and thought the performances were good and true to life. Someone noted the film's stories ultimately are a bit thin. This is probably true but they are good all the same and in some ways quite touching. I was not wowed or anything but simply thought it was a good film. Not best material but no need for that to enjoy things.";

A very delicate never vulgar watercolour depicting women involved in what seem to be out of time female problems and concerns. A fresco which also deals with hot topical issues such as war the living together between Catholics and Muslims the clash of different cultures but never losing its amusing and amused tone. In the end we are both stunned and comforted by the strength that only women can show when they join together and problems are to be faced. The director and actress Nadine Labaki manages to render the female daily melancholy without ever falling into the banal or the clich but through a powerful and intense synaesthetic strategy through eyes smells sounds in such a poignant way as to make us able to touch to smell to taste what is being performed as if we were absorbed in that same intense atmosphere.

	schema:reviewBody "A blend of the unique and the familiar Caramel Lebanon's official Academy Award submission for Best Foreign Film 2007 is a bittersweet comedy set in Beirut Lebanon a city on the road to recovery from a civil war. The familiar part is that like Barbershop the film takes place in a beauty salon called Si Belle where a group of women work and congregate as they deal with problems of thwarted romance marriage aging and sexuality. The unique part is that these personal stories occur in a city where religious and political conflict is never too far from the surface though there is no mention of Israelis or Palestinians. The title by the way has nothing to do with very sweet chewy candy but refers to a sticky concoction used by the hairdressers to rip out unwanted facial hair. Ouch! The cast consists of excellent nonprofessional actors including the director and cowriter Nadine Labaki who plays Layale a single 30year old salon owner who happens to be Christian. Layale is involved in an affair with a happily married man and ignores the romantic overtures of a handsome traffic cop Adel Karam who openly flirts with her while giving her parking tickets. Her best friend is coworker Nisrine Yasmine Al Masri a Muslim who in a state of panic that her future husband will discover that she is not a virgin goes to a plastic surgeon to attempt to fix the problem.Other offbeat characters are Aunt Rose a sweet old seamstress who lives with her slightly demented sister Aziza Semaan and Jamale Gisele Aouad an aging actress who goes through mechanical auditions for commercials but senses that her best days are behind her. Though the salon environment is quite nurturing and the women are open about expressing their feelings and desires it is quite evident that they operate under a society governed by traditional Islamic law. Layale learns that you cannot book a hotel room unless you can prove that you are either married or a prostitute and a couple is harassed by a policeman merely for sitting in their car and talking.Rima Joanna Moukarzel is attracted to a beautiful longhaired woman Fatmeh Safa who comes to the shop for shampoos but she is reluctant to openly express her feelings. While Caramel might have veered into soap opera under less capable hands the director carefully avoids the Hollywood treatment. She has created strongminded women who have built the kind of community in which they can turn to each other for mutual support. Dedicating her humorous quietly engaging film to my Beirut Ms. Labaki has woven a tapestry of the fading beauty of the ancient city old traditions being confronted by the new and the discovery of the bonds between people that make relationships worth celebrating.".

This is enough trivia to make it worth watching and a landmark for a country which not being as immersed in fundamentalism as other Islamic countries is still quite overshadowed by them. So there is a line of commentary about this that goes on that. I skip it.What interested me here was the sweetness of everything. Sweet as caramel? Sure but more. There are true urges true fundamental issues debated here without being mentioned directly so they have to be told visually and that's the sweet spot i deeply appreciate.There are no depressive pseudo intellectual babbling here only true needs by these women with truer existential concerns that go way beyond fundamentalism women's oppression or feelings. What women fight for is a way to be a way to live they look for their own mood that mood the film itself has beautiful cinematography. Each of these women go around adversities the fake virgin the lesbians or face them directly and move on the older lady the protagonist. So in a way the stories we watch is probably the very story of the making of this film. Though this has french support i'm guessing that Labaki went around and faced directly similar existential concerns while making this. Well she got out nicely to my eyes.It's nice to have women filmed maybe cinema can become the best way to watch women through women's eyes literally. From my short viewings of women's films it's a much less erotic look but a much greater insight into their soul. I can live with that.My opinion 45 httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

We are asked to examine women's issues of sex relationships and aging without being subjected to the graphic scenes and gratuitous language that are prevalent in today's filmmaking. There isn't even an instance of potty humor although one particularly touching scene takes place in a bathroom. Nevertheless humor abounds in the form of terrific writing and amazingly good acting by these Arabic actresses.Naturally movies of this type do not have mass appeal in US culture. But for cinema buffs who appreciate the creative nature of screen writing Caramel should not be missed.

The story is Lebanese although it gives an ideal mix of eternal dilemmas and local flavours. The eternal dilemmas are the various female roles and conflicts which you can experience everywhere in the world. The local flavours are provided by the Lebanese environment which is excitingly mixed itself. It is a country torn by civil wars as we know from the press but looks much more peaceful in this movie. Christians and Muslims Arabs and Frenchspeaking coexist in a natural although perhaps a bit tense manner proven by the strong presence of the military and the police. Still the story concentrates on how women face love loneliness and aging. These are eternal issues but the local patriarchist society gives much less freedom for women in coping with them than in the west. This is mildly criticized by director Nadine Labaki also playing one of the main roles of the movie in this refreshing and interesting film.".

The local flavours are provided by the Lebanese environment which is excitingly mixed itself. It is a country torn by civil wars as we know from the press but looks much more peaceful in this movie. Christians and Muslims Arabs and Frenchspeaking coexist in a natural although perhaps a bit tense manner proven by the strong presence of the military and the police. Still the story concentrates on how women face love loneliness and aging. These are eternal issues but the local patriarchist society gives much less freedom for women in coping with them than in the west. This is mildly criticized by director Nadine Labaki also playing one of the main roles of the movie in this refreshing and interesting film.";

The screenplay by Rodney El Haddad and Jihad Hojeily is greatly enhanced by the cinematography by Yves Sehnaoui with the atmospheric musical score by Khaled Mouzannar but it is the impeccable cast that completes this tender humorous and gently sentimental little tale. The film shows us a Lebanon we rarely see. The setting is a Beirut beauty salon La Belle owned by Layale Nadine Labaki whose frequent absences from her place of business are due to trysts with a married man trysts often delayed by a police officer the handsome and infatuated Youssef Adel Karram. Working in the shop is Rima Johanna Moukarzel whose same sex infatuation with a beautiful patron is subtly explored and regulars in the salon include an aging wannabe actress Jamale Gisle Aouad a non virgin bride to be Nisrine Yasmine Elmasri and an older seamstress Rose Sihame Haddad who has elected to relinquish her hopes for love with a willing and potential elderly man Charles Dimitri Staneofski in favor of continuing to care for her humorously senile mother Lili Aziza Semaan. How these unforgettable characters interact displacing each other's anxieties by caring friendship freely shared offers each of these fine actresses many moments of glory in addition to creating a fine ensemble effect as sensitively directed by Nadine Labaki. This little film in Arabic and French with subtitles is a complete pleasure and will likely draw attention to future films from Lebanon. Grady Harp".

A frequent customer and aspiring actress is troubled by aging a tailor with a shop next to the salon is an old woman who had given her life to looking after her deranged elder sister but has found her first love.Caramel hums with courage and unapologetic honesty. Labaki's story doesn't touch on any of the political troubles or topical warfare that has painted the western world's immediate image of Lebanon. Instead she repaints it with a film in the same spirit as many female bonding movies from France Italy and America. Her characters and situations involve normal people with average problems that take into poised contemplation Lebanese society and customs and its traditional notions and expectations of women. Without being cynical belligerent or aggressive Labaki's film betrays nothing hides nothing and even by the end has not contrived a thing for the sake of appeasing her strict traditionalist culture or for the sake of her film's inherent message which evidently has reached the people it is most important that it reaches made clear by the fact that the film gained first place in the Lebanese box office for more than a month.This is an uncannily natural and graceful film.

Issues of homosexuality adultery religious customs and aging are explored in an unbiased way.Labaki is very clear with her desire to maintain an objective point of view on life and leave it to the viewer to come to their own conclusions about what to believe.Basically I would recommend this film to anyone. It's heartwarming it's tearjerking it's laughinspiring. I loved it and I think anyone would regardless of what background and what social standing. Any woman would be able to see themselves in at LEAST one of the women in this film. It's a great snapshot into the lives of these women. I also went with three men to to this film and every single one of them whose tastes range from The Godfather to American History X loved this film as well. Go see it!

	schema:headline " Intensely sensitive utterly brilliant film about women's feelings and identities";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is so incredible that there are barely words to express the admiration and amazement which any sensitive person must experience upon seeing it. There are so many remarkable things about it. First of all it is the first and only film directed by the beautiful young Lebanese actress Nadine Labaki and yet she has the sure touch of a master as if she had been making films like this for fifty years. Everything appears entirely effortless and natural not like a 'film' at all but like the spontaneous happenings of life itself. It flows like water sparkling darkening then sparkling again. Apart from Labaki who plays a lead character no one in the film had ever acted before. They are all ordinary people some of them actually picked up in the street! And yet their performances are perfect as if they had all won plenty of Oscars before and were all old pros. The film is made without any Englishspeaking influence at all and is entirely influenced by French filmmaking style. There is a great deal of improvisation and a loose natural structure. But Nadine Labaki is such a genius that she has outdone the French at their own game and frankly she could now go to Paris and tell them all how it should really be done. She must have been born a master like Mozart. This is the ultimate nouvelle vague film and Godard never even came close to this kind of total spontaneity and sense of truth. There is a touch of the anguished desperation of Agnes Varda of the devilmaycare lightness tinged with melancholy of Julie Delpy of the harrowed intensity of Agniezka Holland and it is all profoundly feminine. Men barely figure in the film which is about five Lebanese women who work in a beauty salon owned by one of them Labaki. In this sanctum sanctorum where men rarely enter the secrets of the inner lives of the women are shared not necessarily by discussion but by osmosis. The 'caramel' of the title is literally the caramel made by boiling sugar lemon juice and water to make caramel candy. It is used in Beirut to do the waxing on women's legs but plenty gets eaten before they get to work. Waxing with caramel is a kind of purely female bonding ritual in Lebanese families Labaki explains in a fascinating and lengthy interview which is an extra to the DVD and which everybody ought to watch. One hopes that Labaki will get lots of work in Paris now where they should all bow down and kiss the nether hems of her garments and be quick about it as she has surpassed them all with her first effort. However as Labaki dedicates her film at the end 'a mon Beyrouth' 'to my Beirut' she may be too attached to the place to leave. She admits to having lived with her parents as a young adult until her marriage and to being integrated into her community in a way difficult for Westerners to comprehend. The women in the salon are a mixture of Christian and Muslim wholly indifferent to any barriers of religion and cosmopolitan in their manners as only the women of Lebanon can be in the 'Arab world'. They are as far from the black crows of oppressed Saudi Arabia as day is from night. But that does not mean that they are liberated inside. As Labaki says all Beirut women feel an undefined sense of guilt every day they don't know for what and none of them is really sure of who she is or who she should be. There are so many spectacular performances in this amazing film that it would be pointless to name them as they are all so brilliant and no one is even vaguely inferior to anyone else. It is the most perfectly matched ensemble I have ever seen. A great deal of the credit for this spectacular achievement is due to the French producer AnneDominique Toussaint who was executive producer of the amazing 'Mina Tannenbaum' in 1994 and coproducer of Deneuve's 'Place Vendome' in 1998 to name two which are well known around the world. If it were not for Toussaint Labaki would not have been given her chance. The film has excellent music by Khaled Mouzzanar whom Labaki married in 2007 perhaps because she liked the sound of his music so much that she decided they may as well make some together. This film is extremely daring in terms of an Arab country or even a Maronite one as it deals with themes which include adultery and lesbianism and the double lives lived by Lebanese women who are liberated when alone but conventional when with their families so that they are not sure which is really 'them'. They stand with one foot in the Stone Age and one foot in the future which can be legsplitting. Gisele Aouad Sihame Haddad Dimitri Staneofski and Aziza Semaan all bring their own special pathos to the problems of getting old. The sad story of 'Tante Rose' played by Sihame Haddad is heartbreaking and is portrayed with such infinite delicacy that the actress could be described as a spiritual lacemaker. Aziza Semaan as her much older sister Lili who has dementia is both hilarious and tragic at the same time and one of the wildest and most breathtaking performances filmed in years. She is the one of whom Labaki says 'I turned round in the street and saw her and I asked her if she would be willing to be in a film.' It took a year to piece together the cast off the street like this. Not since Carl Dreyer cast his silent film 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' with strangers whose faces he liked has anything like that been pulled off so well. Everything about this film is sheer genius.".

My friend would dismiss this film if he would ever attend it as being too costly for the bang of the movie. He like probably many who would venture into the darkness to sit through a foreign film would hope to see a little blood a car crash or two and of course many guns so he would be disappointed at the subtlety and quiet that constituted this wonderful small film. He would be disappointed that Caramel had no significant male actors bar one no Hollywood theatrics and no sex. Rather this lovely film was an intense examination of the interconnecting lives of the women who visited the parlour. This is a soft film a film that quietly examines the small dramas that are the substance of our lives so this film is us in so many important ways. I am drawn to these films about small human dramas they provide the inward examination of our lives that is the true substance of what we are and the drama that is our existence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kenneth Roberts was a distinguished novelist who wrote many fine fictional works about colonial and revolutionary America. Probably his biggest seller was Northwest Passage a fictionalization of the exploits of Roger's Rangers during the French and Indian War.His books sold well at the time and we have to remember that in viewing Northwest Passage we are seeing a fictional story rather than the real story of Roger's Rangers. At that we are only seeing part of that book nothing at all about a search for a land route across North America.The historical significance of the Rangers is that Robert Rogers had an idea that one should be living and thinking like the American Indian in order to fight him. His ideas about specialized units who could meet the enemy on his own terms in colonial America have been followed right down to the Green Berets in Vietnam. His is a distinguished contribution in military history.To do that and lead such a group you have to be one charismatic leader. And in Spencer Tracy Rogers has the best kind of interpreter.This was Tracy's first color feature for MGM and Louis B. Mayer spared no expense for this film. No back lot backwoods here the company went on location to the Payette River in Idaho for the outdoor scenes depicting colonial era New York State. No stunt doubles here either that's Tracy Walter Brennan Robert Young and the rest of the company waist deep in those rapids forming that human chain. Some of the stars nearly drowned making this film.One aspect of this film is rarely discussed and that was the politics surrounding the Indians. Please note that while Tracy is burning the Abinagi village he has some friendly Mohawks with him. When the British and French went to war in this theater of the Seven Years War the various Indian tribes chose up sides trying to figure which group of whites would give them the better deal. The Mohawks are part of the Iroquois Confederation and they aligned themselves with Great Britain. Various other tribes allied with with French. Both were supplied with the white man's weapons of war and both fought on each side. And neither got a really great deal in the end.Northwest Passage is definitely not for the politically correct of the day. Tracy is leading a savage reprisal against the Abinagi he burns the town kills all the males of fighting age steals their meager food supplies to feed his men who are hungry themselves. Tracy makes it clear this is reprisal for raids against the British colonists. Prominently displayed for the camera just before the shooting start is that large exhibit of settler's scalps in the village.Of course the real story is the retreat back fleeing a much larger force of French in the area. The men are starving as they reach the rendezvous point which is an abandoned fort. Tracy races ahead of the men who've been promised a feast when they get there and as he makes it there he realizes the supplies haven't come. He starts to break down but as he hears his men behind him he regains control of himself and starts issuing the orders necessary for their survival. It's all done in a few minutes without dialog and its own of Spencer Tracy's greatest film moments.Northwest Passage will not find too much favor with a lot of today's audience. But taken for what it is worth it is a story about brave men and their struggle for survival in the colonial wilderness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two months before his death in 1957 Kenneth Roberts received a special Pulitzer Prize for his historical novels. Of them Northwest Passage was his most famous. It consisted of two distinct parts and was the second best selling American book of 1937 after first having been serialized in the Saturday Evening Post.MGM's 1940 movie is based on the first and in my opinion better part of the book. It recounts Major Robert Rogers' 1759 raid on St. Francis an Abenaki village during the French and Indian War. As Rogers Spencer Tracy gives a powerhouse performance King Vidor delivers the directorial goods and the storyline itself is very exciting. Indeed I remember Northwest Passage fondly from my childhood and consider it a classic. However because of today's values it probably appeals more to conservatives than liberals.In 1945 Warner Brothers' Objective Burma! starring Errol Flynn used the same plot without attributiona Japanese transmission station replacing the Indian village. Directed by Raoul Walsh it too is very well done. Then in 1951's Distant Drums starring Gary Cooper director Walsh again used the same plot without attribution. This time the movie which is not so well done occurs during The Seminole Indian Wars 18351842 and the initial objective is an old Spanish fort lying deep within the Everglades.In conclusion I'm not shocked that Hollywood recycled Roberts' plot without attribution. You only have to remember Dorothy Parker's quip The only 'ism' Hollywood believes in is plagiarism. I am however somewhat shocked that Roberts did not sue. His reputation was that of an acerbic curmudgeon. But then again maybe he just didn't know.".

	schema:headline " A Great Film But The Sequel Would Have Made It Sublime";
	schema:reviewBody "There are few films about the French and Indian War 1754  1763 which is surprising. Given the rising solidity of AngloAmerican relations in the late 1930s into World War II more films should have been made. I can only think of this one and THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS with Randolph Scott and Henry Wilcoxen as the best  possibly sole  examples. But NORTHWEST PASSAGE is a marvelous example of how to make an interesting historical film. Briefly it is 1759 and Major Robert Rogers and his famous Rangers probably America's first example of a special forces unit are sent into territory in the hands of an enemy Indian group. The film shows all the problems of 18th Century forest fighting with supply problems ambushes and personal problems. Rogers does not have to only worry about Indian attacks off screen we hear of the massacre of part of his men who separated for security reasons to rendezvous at a later spot but with starvation and madness witness Addison Richards insane ranger. But the mission is accomplished and one step brought forward to the successful completion of the war.But the story was not fully told due to the expenses of filming it was filmed mostly outside the studio. The actual title is NORTHWEST PASSAGE PART I. Robert Young plays Langdon a young college student actually he looks slightly old for that role who is skillful in drawing and drafting. So he is taken under Major Rogers' wing Langdon and his best friend  played by Walter Brennan  were almost arrested for quasiseditious remarks about a local British government official played by Montague Love and go on the trek. TracyRogers needs YoungLangdon as a map maker. He has plans to find the Northwest Passage with his Rangers once the war is finished. The present film ends with Langdon married and watching Rogers and his Rangers marching off on their next mission.The sequel would have been a downer but a brilliant one  and I suspect the subject matter of the sequel had more to do with killing the problem than the actual expense after all the first part was a hit film and made back it's cost at the box office. In the sequel Rogers tries to get his exploration plans under way only to run afoul of history it seems the colonies and Britain are becoming less and less friendly due to the issue of taxation and British legislation like the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts. Rogers as he was an officer  albeit an irregular one  in the British army is a loyalist and Langdon and his friends are not. Gradually Rogers becomes more and more isolated due to his political stand. In the end he goes into exile and becomes a bitter defeated exhero. The Northwest Passage is not to be discovered by this remarkable man.

This would not fully become notable until Sir Robert McClure in 1851 and Sir Leopold McClintock in 1859 rediscovered the passage while seeking Franklin's men. Finally Roald Amundson would successfully sail through the passage on the Gjoa in 19031905.The sequel as you can see became increasingly antiBritish the audience in America would have to be proAmerican if shown in America. Therefore it would have been out of place in a period when American films were to be proEnglish. That's more likely the reason that the sequel was not made with Tracy being shown going slowly to seed. An understandable reason but it would have been Tracy's greatest part  the hero denied his just claim for glory by sheer historical chance. The completed NORTHWEST PASSAGE would have been one of the masterworks of 20th Century motion picture making.".

	onyx:emotionText "There are few films about the French and Indian War 1754  1763 which is surprising. Given the rising solidity of AngloAmerican relations in the late 1930s into World War II more films should have been made. I can only think of this one and THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS with Randolph Scott and Henry Wilcoxen as the best  possibly sole  examples. But NORTHWEST PASSAGE is a marvelous example of how to make an interesting historical film. Briefly it is 1759 and Major Robert Rogers and his famous Rangers probably America's first example of a special forces unit are sent into territory in the hands of an enemy Indian group. The film shows all the problems of 18th Century forest fighting with supply problems ambushes and personal problems. Rogers does not have to only worry about Indian attacks off screen we hear of the massacre of part of his men who separated for security reasons to rendezvous at a later spot but with starvation and madness witness Addison Richards insane ranger. But the mission is accomplished and one step brought forward to the successful completion of the war.But the story was not fully told due to the expenses of filming it was filmed mostly outside the studio. The actual title is NORTHWEST PASSAGE PART I. Robert Young plays Langdon a young college student actually he looks slightly old for that role who is skillful in drawing and drafting. So he is taken under Major Rogers' wing Langdon and his best friend  played by Walter Brennan  were almost arrested for quasiseditious remarks about a local British government official played by Montague Love and go on the trek. TracyRogers needs YoungLangdon as a map maker. He has plans to find the Northwest Passage with his Rangers once the war is finished. The present film ends with Langdon married and watching Rogers and his Rangers marching off on their next mission.The sequel would have been a downer but a brilliant one  and I suspect the subject matter of the sequel had more to do with killing the problem than the actual expense after all the first part was a hit film and made back it's cost at the box office. In the sequel Rogers tries to get his exploration plans under way only to run afoul of history it seems the colonies and Britain are becoming less and less friendly due to the issue of taxation and British legislation like the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts. Rogers as he was an officer  albeit an irregular one  in the British army is a loyalist and Langdon and his friends are not. Gradually Rogers becomes more and more isolated due to his political stand. In the end he goes into exile and becomes a bitter defeated exhero. The Northwest Passage is not to be discovered by this remarkable man. It would be first sited by Thomas Simpson an explorer for the Hudson Bay Company in 183839.The illfated Franklin Expedition 184549 would find the key to the passage but perish in the course of the discovery. This would not fully become notable until Sir Robert McClure in 1851 and Sir Leopold McClintock in 1859 rediscovered the passage while seeking Franklin's men.

As a consequence only the first part of the novel was brought to the screen where passage through the northwest never actually happens but only is talked about.   The story is centred on Major Robert Rogers Spencer Tracy and his rangers who take a dangerous and adventurous journey through the territory controlled by the Indians and the French troops in 18th century America in order to destroy a hostile Indian village from where English settlements are constantly being attacked.    Right in the beginning the rangers are joined by right out of Harvard idealistic young cartographer Langdon Towne Robert Young who is dreaming of becoming a great painter like Velasquez or Rubens' and is enthusiastic about the journey because of possibility it offers to paint portraits of Indians and landscapes in contrast with the other rangers who are mainly driven by yearning of revenge for relatives murdered during Indian raids.   Northwest Passage is possibly the best and the most visually impressive King Vidor's adventure film. Breathtakingly beautiful landscapes shown here certainly stand out as the most wonderful even among King Vidor's work who was well known for beautiful Technicolor exteriors in his movies. A beautiful film definitely worth watching. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Northwest passage is one of those films that your parents probably watched when they were growing up. Despite having seen it or parts of it many times over the years its still very entertaining. Like other classics of it's times DODGE CITY ROBIN HOOD etc that has been given the Technicolor Hollywood treatment of the late 1930's for what ever reason Northwest passage stands out as being the best. Watching it in 2006 almost 60 years after it was made on a digital plasma widescreen one can really appreciate the efforts that went into filming this back in the 1930's as well as the work gone into keeping it restored.As for the movie some of the rangers looked to be a bit long in the tooth to be credible rangers a bit old scrawny and tired looking but perhaps it only enhanced the disheveled appearance that you might expect after such a long treks. Ironically it's the tension throughout the movie keeps you on your toes because it's really not that violent. There is one major battle and that's it for a move that is well over two hours long it's not really that much but it's worth watching it for the cinema photography the atmosphere as well as the scenery alone. However if that's not going to keep your attention you'll find Spencer Tracy at his finest. Although Robert Young and Walter Brennan are fine in support Tracy just steals the show as the enthusiastic tough as nails ranger ready to conquer North America.I say conquer he's not a raving maniac that is just out to kill he'll fight if he has too but its' discovering routs and new territory that's important to him. He commands respect not through fear but through admiration. There is nothing he asks his men to do that he is not prepared to do himself. If it's not going without food or hauling a boat over a mountain he's the first link in a human chain trying to cross a swollen river riddled with rapids. He shows no fear but he's not reckless and is not looking to kill the enemy just for the sake of it. Discipline is important but the safety of the expedition as a whole is paramount he wont slow down his troop and endanger it by carrying a wounded man.Interesting thought no medivac helicopter ready to swoop in and take out a casualty.He has courage demands loyalty but is prepared to listen to his junior officers when they want to split up despite his reservationswhich apparently they are entitled to dohe acquiesces. He rallied his command to go on at every opportunity and encourages them when in doubt with resolve as well as humor. He certainly understands his responsibility as leader. At the end of the movie when he is addressing the new expedition he delivers it with humor that clearly motivates the men into relishing the challenge I was almost sorry I couldn't go along as well! Noteone of these days I'll have to try drinking rum and hot water with brown sugar and butter added!".

	schema:reviewBody "Spencer Tracy is the real historical figure Major Robert Rogers leader  of an elite group of Rangers within the British Army during the French  and Indian Wars of about 1760 known in Europe as the Seven Years' War.  Everyone else in the army dresses in outlandish red coats high  feathered hats stockings dirndls tutus and whatnot. Rogers' Rangers  dress in fringed buckskin of forest green and they wear moccasins like  the real woodsmen they are.   Well they might make room for ONE elitist. Robert Young has just been  booted out of Harvard College intent on becoming an artist. Tracy has  no particular use for artists but he does need a map maker and he  enlists Young and Young's comic sidekick the everirascible Walter  Brennan.  There is a long and perilous trip by longboats from New Hampshire up to  the Canadian border one of those trips in which we can't stop for any  wounded men. There is a fierce battle in which the Rangers wipe out an  entire village of Abenaki Indians. When the Rangers discover that the  French have captured their boats it means they must make a tenday  march without food across a mountain wilderness. Starving they vote to  break up into smaller parties. Two of the parties are captured and  slaughtered by the hostile Indians loyal to the French. The pitiful  remnants catch up with the main body tattered in mind and body.  The movie has been called racist and it really doesn't treat all the  Indians fairly. At the same time the tribes of the Northeast woodlands  were tough customers rough not only on white settlers but on their  Indian enemies too. The butchery was expected on all sides.  Tracy keeps promising them that when they reach their goal Fort  Wentworth in the middle of nowhere the British will be waiting for  them with sides of beef vegetables hot buttered rum arugula salad  and diverse configurations of sushi. Come on men! Tracy keeps  shouting. It's only a thousand more miles! A Ranger can walk it on his  hands! Alas when they reach Fort Wentworth it's falling apart  deserted overgrown with sagebrush in the mountains of New England.  Either the British Army is late for the appointment or Rogers' message  to them never got through. Plenty of good ROOTS here Tracy declaims  waving his arms operatically and Moses went for 40 days without food  or water. And we've got plenty of WATER. Buckets full of water! The  Rangers too pooped to pop sink to the ground. Just as Tracy is  leading them in a final prayer salvation arrives.  It's interesting to consider this movie from the perspective of the  audiences of 1940 from which the whole story must have seemed like a  metaphor. The Rangers are Americans. We are the allies of the British.  The Indians are brutal maniacs who butcher women and children. In 1940  Britain was in the middle of a great air battle with the brutal Nazis.  America wasn't yet at war but our sympathies were clearly with the  Brits. The movie doesn't show us any villainous Frenchmen. Why not?  Because in 1940 the French had just been overrun by the German Army  and shifted its government to Britain. How could the movie paint the  French as bad? The friend of my friend is my friend. There's a good  explanation for this dynamic. Google balance theory or Fritz  Heider. The performances are good. Most of the acting looks like  acting which was expectable in a Hollywood product of the time. But  Walter Brennan is as always Walter Brennan and Spencer Tracy could  play anything from Mr. Hyde to Clarence Darrow. Ruth Hussey's  appearance is brief and that's just as well. She's pretty bland.  As a tale of adventure this is unimpeachable. As a war story it's  unusual in that it focuses not on the usual things  battles banter  shoehorned cardboard romance  but on physical fatigue on the  difference between hope and despair. In this way it reminds me a  little of Norman Mailer's novel The Naked and the Dead. The plot is  so good it showed up a few years later morphed into a story of  American paratroopers isolated behind Japanese lines in Warners'  Objective Burma. Well worth catching not just because it represents  Hollywood at its craftsmanlike best but because it's like looking  into a time capsule.".

	schema:headline " Well it's well photographed but .....";
	schema:reviewBody "Northwest Passage is one of the few films about the Seven Years' War that isn't based on a James Fenimore Cooper novel and in that sense it's a welcome lesson in how that important period has come to be mythologized in popular culture. I've never read the Roberts books so I can't comment on how faithful the film is to its source material. I can only make a few comments on how movies have their own sensibilities and cultural rules. Like most films this one tells us more about the era in which it was made than the time period in which the film's events take place. It's certainly an exciting story but it has a number of cringeworthy elements and they would have elicited just as many cringes back in the 1930s I assure you.Here's a few commentsJeffrey Amherst and Sir William Johnson As anyone who has read any of the fine studies of this era can attest I recommend the works of James Axtell Gregory Evans Dowd Daniel Usner Daniel Richter Richard White and many others as fine introductions to IndianWhite relations in the 17th and 18th centuries this film takes a rather interesting view of these historical figures. Amherst is here depicted as the realistic good guy who is in tune with Rogers's vicious sentiments. Johnson on the other hand is seen as part of the problem because of his private relationships with several Indian groups especially the Mohawks. Johnson's Mohawk allies are here shown as lazy duplicitous suspicious interlopers. In fact Johnson and his many Indian allies throughout Iroquoia and the Ohio country were indispensable to the British victory in the Seven Years' War while Amherst a capable officer but a virulent antinative racist instituted policies that helped start the 176364 Indian uprising Pontiac's War and actually approved using germ warfare on Indians near Fort Pitt he approved a plan to give them smallpoxinfected blankets.Uniforms If you squint Roger's Rangers look like they should be in the Confederate Army. This may be a Technicolor issue. In fact Roger's men often dressed as Indians and other backcountry residents did. It is the demands of movie convention that put them all in blue buckskin uniforms  just as Japanese and German soldiers always wore particular shapes of helmets so you can tell them apart from the other guys. Even the Mohawk and Abenaki Indians wear similar uniforms i.e. matching loincloths. The Indians in this movie look like they belong in the Southwest or the plains  not in the Eastern Woodlands especially late in the year.Rogers himself Well his antiIndian rants probably do illustrate something of the man himself. It should be noted that Rogers's sensationalized exploits made him a problematic celebrity during his life. He was always distrusted by his British superiors who nevertheless bowed to public acclaim and gave him important positions after the war including a brief command of Fort Detroit and his disastrous tenure commanding Fort Michilimackinac after the Indian uprising. Like many outpost commanders Rogers let his personal greed take over in the relative freedom of the pays d'en haut and ended up being arrested and returned to Niagara in irons. Amherst gave him guarded trust but Amherst's successor Thomas Gage and Indian Supervisor William Johnson considered him a villain. As for the native Americans everyone knew about Rogers's Indian killing and he had few Indian friends and many enemies. Everywhere Rogers went became a tense place of interaction between Indians and Europeans.Indian issues Well it's true that Indians Abenakis and others used brutal tactics in war. But this movie like other movies such as Drums Along the Mohawk definitely take the settlers' side in their confrontations with native Americans. In one scene Rogers tells his men how the Abenakis should be killed for brutally hatcheting innocent settlers who were just trying to make lives for themselves and weren't bothering anyone. It should be noted that settlers were often a great bother to Indians just by their presence alone. Indians who lived in transitional regions resented the encroachments of white settlers more than anything else including the presence of forts and soldiers. Settlers used land for farming which was an exclusive operation. Unlike the skin trade which used native residents as partners farmers viewed Indians as being in the way.

	onyx:emotionText "Northwest Passage is one of the few films about the Seven Years' War that isn't based on a James Fenimore Cooper novel and in that sense it's a welcome lesson in how that important period has come to be mythologized in popular culture. I've never read the Roberts books so I can't comment on how faithful the film is to its source material. I can only make a few comments on how movies have their own sensibilities and cultural rules. Like most films this one tells us more about the era in which it was made than the time period in which the film's events take place. It's certainly an exciting story but it has a number of cringeworthy elements and they would have elicited just as many cringes back in the 1930s I assure you.Here's a few commentsJeffrey Amherst and Sir William Johnson As anyone who has read any of the fine studies of this era can attest I recommend the works of James Axtell Gregory Evans Dowd Daniel Usner Daniel Richter Richard White and many others as fine introductions to IndianWhite relations in the 17th and 18th centuries this film takes a rather interesting view of these historical figures. Amherst is here depicted as the realistic good guy who is in tune with Rogers's vicious sentiments. Johnson on the other hand is seen as part of the problem because of his private relationships with several Indian groups especially the Mohawks. Johnson's Mohawk allies are here shown as lazy duplicitous suspicious interlopers. In fact Johnson and his many Indian allies throughout Iroquoia and the Ohio country were indispensable to the British victory in the Seven Years' War while Amherst a capable officer but a virulent antinative racist instituted policies that helped start the 176364 Indian uprising Pontiac's War and actually approved using germ warfare on Indians near Fort Pitt he approved a plan to give them smallpoxinfected blankets.Uniforms If you squint Roger's Rangers look like they should be in the Confederate Army. This may be a Technicolor issue. In fact Roger's men often dressed as Indians and other backcountry residents did. It is the demands of movie convention that put them all in blue buckskin uniforms  just as Japanese and German soldiers always wore particular shapes of helmets so you can tell them apart from the other guys. Even the Mohawk and Abenaki Indians wear similar uniforms i.e. matching loincloths. The Indians in this movie look like they belong in the Southwest or the plains  not in the Eastern Woodlands especially late in the year.Rogers himself Well his antiIndian rants probably do illustrate something of the man himself. It should be noted that Rogers's sensationalized exploits made him a problematic celebrity during his life. He was always distrusted by his British superiors who nevertheless bowed to public acclaim and gave him important positions after the war including a brief command of Fort Detroit and his disastrous tenure commanding Fort Michilimackinac after the Indian uprising. Like many outpost commanders Rogers let his personal greed take over in the relative freedom of the pays d'en haut and ended up being arrested and returned to Niagara in irons. Amherst gave him guarded trust but Amherst's successor Thomas Gage and Indian Supervisor William Johnson considered him a villain. As for the native Americans everyone knew about Rogers's Indian killing and he had few Indian friends and many enemies. Everywhere Rogers went became a tense place of interaction between Indians and Europeans.Indian issues Well it's true that Indians Abenakis and others used brutal tactics in war. But this movie like other movies such as Drums Along the Mohawk definitely take the settlers' side in their confrontations with native Americans. In one scene Rogers tells his men how the Abenakis should be killed for brutally hatcheting innocent settlers who were just trying to make lives for themselves and weren't bothering anyone. It should be noted that settlers were often a great bother to Indians just by their presence alone. Indians who lived in transitional regions resented the encroachments of white settlers more than anything else including the presence of forts and soldiers. Settlers used land for farming which was an exclusive operation. Unlike the skin trade which used native residents as partners farmers viewed Indians as being in the way. All Eastern Indians knew that farming was the one operation that turned Indian country into European territory exclusively and did everything they could to oppose it. And as far as relative levels of brutality go backcountry settlers and soldiers were capable of all the worst kinds of viciousness. Reference the Gnadenhutten Massacre during the Revolutionary War if you want to read about some really vicious behavior by America militiamen.This movie is a great mirror on its time.

There's also a show stopping scene where the camera follows the line of sight of a ranger taking aim at a red skin . Wonderful cinematography There are one or two flaws though . One is that not only are some of the characters too old to be elite fighting men but they seem too old to still be alive . Honestly how old did people live to in the mid 18th century ? The rangers themselves are written as being a good bunch o blokes but I found them just a little too good to be true while no doubt the thought police will complain about the native Americans being portrayed as a bunch of blood thirsty savages  but this was made before revisionary westerns like the overrated DANCES WITH WOLVES and before Marlon Brando sent native Americans to collect Oscars  but at least King Vidor has cast real natives in the part of Indians and hasn't dressed up a bunch of white guys pretending to be injuns Good Hollywood movie featuring the rangers .

	schema:reviewBody "Spencer Tracy has long been one of my two favorite actors the other being Cary Grant and this particular film has long been one of my favorite Tracy movies. I was so happy to see it finally released on DVD...but so disappointed to see such a poor transfer by Warner Brothers. Some scenes are rather crisp particularly closeups but other scenes are downright fuzzy and very red. Color correction on this film is badly needed. This is perhaps the worst transfer to DVD I have ever seen. Tracy and we deserve much better.And I must fault the original studio  MGM  for thinking that Idaho could substitute for New York State. Having lived in New York State and having been to many of the locations discussed in this film I have to tell you that that's not what Crown Point looked like at all and not how the landforms and river look like there and not how Lake Champlain looks. You can't confuse the Rockies with the Adirondack region! Nevertheless the quality of the movie script and performances definitely make this one for your DVD shelf. There was a great deal of onlocation filming...much of this film is outdoors and that shows. Clearly this film was not an easy shoot.Tracy as reallife historic figure Robert Rogers of the famous Rogers' Rangers shines in this film. Tracy as a leader is the prime theme of the film and he accomplishes it brilliantly. Let's face it Tracy was a tremendously talented actor whose many roles showed a real breadth in his abilities. This is one of his best roles.Robert Young is also excellent as a wouldbe collegeeducated artist who gets himself in political trouble and joins Rogers' Rangers to flee possible arrest. While I loved Young in Father Knows Best I was never as enamored with his film appearances. This is an exception. His scenes where he show fear and apprehension of battles ahead are excellent.As is typical Walter Brennan turns in a bravura performance as a woodsman who plays a sort of sidekick to both Tracy and Young.There are lots of other familiar faces of supporting actors here all from the MGM stable. If you're into character actors look for Donald MacBride. He was famous for the slow burn in many comedy films but here he is in a completely different role of a ranger  Sergeant McNott. The love interest here  for Robert Young  is Ruth Hussey but you won't see much of her except in the opening and closing scenes of the film. Frankly this is a man's film.The key to enjoying this film is to understand that the script follows actual historical events more closely than most such films although of course MGM and the script writers did take some liberties for the sake of the story. However the basic plot remains pretty true. Among the most impressive segments of the film is the primary battle with the Indians and the French. I've rarely seen battle scenes done so well at least up until Mel Gibson's The Patriot. Also impressive is the manner in which one soldier's insanity grows during and after the key battle.An excellent film with my only real complaint with the 2011 DVD being the quality of the film transfer. Nevertheless this is one to savor on your DVD shelf.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1940 film Northwest Passage subtitled Book One Rogers' Rangers is a major work and was a resounding success in its day. The story taken from the historical novel of the same name by Kenneth Roberts concerns the reallife exploits of British Major Robert Rogers the original founder of what would become the U.S. Army Rangers. Although the title alludes to a far off expedition this film concentrates on Rogers leading his men against the Abenaki Indians and their French masters during the early years of the French and Indian War 1750s. Spencer Tracy portrays Rogers as near superhuman driving his men to expectations and accomplishments far beyond the norm. Along for the ride are two new recruits Robert Young as Langdon Towne and a very youthful Walter Brennan as Hunk Marriner. There's no Political Correctness to be found in this movie. The Indians are evil savages who have killed defenseless settlers and Rogers and his men are out for revenge. They massacre nearly an entire Abenaki village on the Canadian border and then make a run for it through the treacherous wilderness with the enemy hot on their tail. Not all of the Rangers make it back to safety and the film does its utmost to convey the dangers they encounter and the miserable and horrific end to many of the men. One group of Rangers who stray from the rest are ambushed and butchered by the French and Indians who literally play ball with their heads. Iconic film director King Vidor does tremendous work here with his cinematographer and the talented cast. Northwest Passage was filmed in Technicolor and the location shots mostly in Idaho are considered some of the greatest of this era. Spencer Tracy as usual carries much of the load but he's helped immensely by Robert Young and his sidekick Walter Brennan. Those two gentlemen are a fine contrast to Tracy's roughhewed Rogers and they give the film some muchneeded balance. In one scene Young is severely wounded but Tracy inspires him to regain his feet after chiding him about the girl he left behind Ruth Hussey. There are also some grim reminders of the brutality of war sprinkled throughout this film. One Ranger goes stark raving mad cutting off the head of an Indian and carrying it around like a hidden souvenir. He later gets hungry and begins to nibble away on it handing out tidbits to his unsuspecting fellow soldiers. It's those kinds of scenes that give this film its welldeserved reputation for realism and kept it relevant for modern audiences. Unfortunately Book Two which would have dealt with Rogers' illfated mission to discover the Northwest Passage and his subsequent fall from grace was never filmed. The real Major Rogers died in the Fleet Prison for debtors in London at the age of 64.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the early eighteenth century a plucky young American is 'sent down' from Harvard for lampooning his pompous professors.  After making himself persona non grata in New Hampshire by speaking out against English tyranny he throws in his lot with Rogers' Rangers a crack unit of irregular skirmishers led by the charismatic Major Rogers.  The young man Langdon Towne accompanies the Rangers on a punitive raid against the indians and their French allies.This MGM adventure yarn displays to great effect the majesty of the virgin American wilderness.  Spencer Tracy is utterly believable as the inspirational Major Rogers able to motivate his men through a mixture of toughness kindness and sheer example.  Studeley's Inn in Portsmouth has a superb period feel to it being modelled one suspects on the reallife Buckman Tavern in Lexington.  The film is confident and upbeat in tone and the strong esprit de corps of the Rangers is convincingly portrayed.  Vidor directs the battle scene with considerable visual flair.The slaughter of the indians may well trouble a modern viewer though it would not have bothered its contemporary audience in the slightest. Similarly Rogers' method of silencing a barking dog killing it with a thrown hatchet may not sit well with today's sensibilities.  At a deeper level the film's underlying premise  that it is the anglosaxon's manifest destiny to own and tame the continent  is somewhat bothersome to our 21stcentury consciences.  It could be said that the sack of the indian village prefigures My Lai with chilling accuracy.Even taking the film on its own terms there are things which simply don't come off.  When Langdon Towne Robert Young expresses dread at the coming wrath of his parents when they learn of his expulsion from Harvard we anticipate something more spectacular than what unfolds  the mildest dressingdown in the history of cinema.  In an age when even modest families had servants would a gentlewoman like Elizabeth Ruth Hussey really answer her own front door?  In the 1740's would a drunk arrested in a tavern really say I demand to see a lawyer?  Would Langdon in his condition stop the madman with that flying tackle?  Why is the relief column playing a marching tune when its entire personnel is aboard a fleet of rowboats?The film suffers from the confusion inherent in its own period setting in that the secondnature American resentment of the redcoats is entirely misplaced here.  Rogers and his men are loyal subjects of the British Crown and noone at this point in history was talking of independence yet the filmmakers slip into the habit of antiBritish sentiment.  The script is guilty of some dreadful wordiness.  Trying to soar emotionally it merely descends into such bathotic tripe as It's every man's dream to find a short route to his heart's desire.Finally 'Northwest Passage' is not about the Northwest Passage at all. It is a simple tale of a scrap with indians which had it not been for the remarkable screen presence of Spencer Tracy would have lacked any lustre whatsoever.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the early eighteenth century a plucky young American is 'sent down' from Harvard for lampooning his pompous professors.  After making himself persona non grata in New Hampshire by speaking out against English tyranny he throws in his lot with Rogers' Rangers a crack unit of irregular skirmishers led by the charismatic Major Rogers.  The young man Langdon Towne accompanies the Rangers on a punitive raid against the indians and their French allies.This MGM adventure yarn displays to great effect the majesty of the virgin American wilderness.  Spencer Tracy is utterly believable as the inspirational Major Rogers able to motivate his men through a mixture of toughness kindness and sheer example.  Studeley's Inn in Portsmouth has a superb period feel to it being modelled one suspects on the reallife Buckman Tavern in Lexington.  The film is confident and upbeat in tone and the strong esprit de corps of the Rangers is convincingly portrayed.  Vidor directs the battle scene with considerable visual flair.The slaughter of the indians may well trouble a modern viewer though it would not have bothered its contemporary audience in the slightest. Similarly Rogers' method of silencing a barking dog killing it with a thrown hatchet may not sit well with today's sensibilities.  At a deeper level the film's underlying premise  that it is the anglosaxon's manifest destiny to own and tame the continent  is somewhat bothersome to our 21stcentury consciences.  It could be said that the sack of the indian village prefigures My Lai with chilling accuracy.Even taking the film on its own terms there are things which simply don't come off.  When Langdon Towne Robert Young expresses dread at the coming wrath of his parents when they learn of his expulsion from Harvard we anticipate something more spectacular than what unfolds  the mildest dressingdown in the history of cinema.  In an age when even modest families had servants would a gentlewoman like Elizabeth Ruth Hussey really answer her own front door?  In the 1740's would a drunk arrested in a tavern really say I demand to see a lawyer?  Would Langdon in his condition stop the madman with that flying tackle?  Why is the relief column playing a marching tune when its entire personnel is aboard a fleet of rowboats?The film suffers from the confusion inherent in its own period setting in that the secondnature American resentment of the redcoats is entirely misplaced here.  Rogers and his men are loyal subjects of the British Crown and noone at this point in history was talking of independence yet the filmmakers slip into the habit of antiBritish sentiment.  The script is guilty of some dreadful wordiness.  Trying to soar emotionally it merely descends into such bathotic tripe as It's every man's dream to find a short route to his heart's desire.Finally 'Northwest Passage' is not about the Northwest Passage at all. It is a simple tale of a scrap with indians which had it not been for the remarkable screen presence of Spencer Tracy would have lacked any lustre whatsoever.";

	schema:headline " That man will never die";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this during the Spencer Tracy tribute on Aug. 18 on Turner Classic Movies. Ironically that date is the birthdate of Meriwether Lewis 1774. Much of the action in this film mirrors the toils and turmoils of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which occurred less than 50 years from the time of this story. When you see the men malnourished facing difficult portages battling mosquitoes and having to wade through cold water for long stretches fearing Indian attacks constantly you have some ideas of the challenges facing the Corps of Discovery. Their coleader Lewis Actually he officially outranked Clark during their trip because Clark's orders promoting him to captain equal to Lewis didn't arrive before their departure had a career that had much in common with Maj. Rogers. Like Rogers he was a brilliant leader and his men followed him loyally to the end. Both men toiled along with the men and consulted their junior officers and men before making difficult lifeordeath decisions. Both were hailed as great heroes by the public and government they represented after their marvelous feats of derringdo but both came to bad ends. Rogers sided with the British during the Revolutionary War and his Rangers eventually became a Canadian outfit and he never was able to achieve his mission of finding the Northwest Passage although as Tracy says in the film he may have had little faith in there actually being such a water route. Lewis also never saw his extensive journals of his expedition come to be published dying mysteriously in a Tennessee travelers' inn a few years after arriving home from that epic trip which was charged with also trying to find the elusive Passage. Langdon's summary quote about Rogers could also apply to Lewis as American adventurers since then carry his spirit of discovery with them even into outer space. This film has always been one of my favorites. As a lover of westerns I can enjoy many of the familiar elements an arduous journey over breathtakingly beautiful but perilous land and water battles with Indians men and women of unflinching courage. I'm lucky enough to live in a part of the northwestern U.S. where some of the film footage was shot which was only a little more than a hundred miles from the same part of Idaho which had proved so difficult to the Lewis and Clark expedition. In fact this film and COME AND GET IT 1936 also featuring Walter Brennan in his first Oscarwinning role were the first two films made in this part of the Northwest specifically northern Idaho to achieve Academy Award nominations and NORTHWEST PASSAGE had some great photography which was so honored. If you've never traveled to the Northwest I urge you to do so. And I urge you to see NORTHWEST PASSAGE. In either case you'll enjoy the trip. Dale Roloff".

	schema:headline " Rogers' Rangers' History Is Far More Exciting and Unbelievable Than the Film 2of2.";
	schema:reviewBody "Harking back to Kenneth Roberts' Roberts' Northwest Passage Rogers' life after the legendary mission to destroy the nest of Abenaki vipers equally unbelievable.Did you know that Rogers undertook with just two companies of Rangers an equally legendary 1763 expedition into what was called the Northwest the Ohio territory to accept the surrender of the French posts to the British who had in that year won the French and Indian War?This trip afoot took Rogers nearly halfway across the continent. In fact Rogers proposed to the British Crown an expedition to the Pacific an exploration which one of his captains later partly accomplished while Rogers was stuck commanding Fort Michilmackinac in what would later become Michigan.Thus Rogers almost achieved in 1763 what Lewis and Clark wouldn't actually fully achieve till some 40 years later  an expedition of exploration to the Pacific Ocean.Rogers was indeed turned down by George Washington at the start of the American Revolution as a volunteer Ranger in the colonial forces. Instead Washington had Rogers arrested and tossed into prison.Understandably rankled by this Rogers broke out of jail and went over to the British.Rogers is the guy of whom George Washington said He is the only man I ever feared.We have our unfathomably brave predecessors in the Rangers to thank for the British colonists' ultimate victory in the 150yearlong war against the French and Indians  America's longest war and one that NO elementary or high school ANYWHERE in America teaches ANYTHING about.Robert Rogers was larger than life. He is often called the Father of U.S. Special Forces for his work pioneering the colonial rangers in early America. His Rules for Ranging are still required reading by the U.S. Rangers and Green Berets.But Rogers wasn't the first colonial ranger. It is uncertain who could claim that title because the tradition of ranging goes back to early England and Scotland. The colonists took that tradition with them when they settled America. Rangers were deployed in Jamestown.Ranger Benjamin Church who was instrumental in winning King Philip's war 16751678 in New England is also called the Father of the Rangers. It was his team that hunted down and killed King Philip aka Metacomet in Rhode Island.King Philip's War is another one of those gigantic historical struggles not taught in our schools.This was the war in which the Indians pushed the American colonists all the way back to the shoreline towns all across New England except in Connecticut where there were just a few battles and almost into the ocean.Did you know that New England's colonists almost starved during that war and would have had it not been for ships full of emergency provisions sent from England?

	onyx:emotionText "Harking back to Kenneth Roberts' Roberts' Northwest Passage Rogers' life after the legendary mission to destroy the nest of Abenaki vipers equally unbelievable.Did you know that Rogers undertook with just two companies of Rangers an equally legendary 1763 expedition into what was called the Northwest the Ohio territory to accept the surrender of the French posts to the British who had in that year won the French and Indian War?This trip afoot took Rogers nearly halfway across the continent. In fact Rogers proposed to the British Crown an expedition to the Pacific an exploration which one of his captains later partly accomplished while Rogers was stuck commanding Fort Michilmackinac in what would later become Michigan.Thus Rogers almost achieved in 1763 what Lewis and Clark wouldn't actually fully achieve till some 40 years later  an expedition of exploration to the Pacific Ocean.Rogers was indeed turned down by George Washington at the start of the American Revolution as a volunteer Ranger in the colonial forces. Instead Washington had Rogers arrested and tossed into prison.Understandably rankled by this Rogers broke out of jail and went over to the British.Rogers is the guy of whom George Washington said He is the only man I ever feared.We have our unfathomably brave predecessors in the Rangers to thank for the British colonists' ultimate victory in the 150yearlong war against the French and Indians  America's longest war and one that NO elementary or high school ANYWHERE in America teaches ANYTHING about.Robert Rogers was larger than life. He is often called the Father of U.S. Special Forces for his work pioneering the colonial rangers in early America. His Rules for Ranging are still required reading by the U.S. Rangers and Green Berets.But Rogers wasn't the first colonial ranger. It is uncertain who could claim that title because the tradition of ranging goes back to early England and Scotland. The colonists took that tradition with them when they settled America. Rangers were deployed in Jamestown.Ranger Benjamin Church who was instrumental in winning King Philip's war 16751678 in New England is also called the Father of the Rangers. It was his team that hunted down and killed King Philip aka Metacomet in Rhode Island.King Philip's War is another one of those gigantic historical struggles not taught in our schools.This was the war in which the Indians pushed the American colonists all the way back to the shoreline towns all across New England except in Connecticut where there were just a few battles and almost into the ocean.Did you know that New England's colonists almost starved during that war and would have had it not been for ships full of emergency provisions sent from England? The Indians banded together  most of them but not all  to exterminate the white man.But the colonists won that war.They won all of the other Indian wars in New England too.Rogers is the guy who turned the tide in the last such war.If you read anything about Rogers and the men he fought with you will not believe the hardships they endured to bequeath us our free and easy lives of today.

This is one of my favorite claustrophobic films.  It has the feel of an old secluded farmhouse and thankfully lacks that Hollywood gloss.  The characters feel real as well.  The cast is perfect.  Tony Todd William Butler and Tom Towles are the reincarnations of the original Ben Tommy and Harry Cooper.  And longtime Romero collaborator Patricia Tallman revamps her character Barbara for the nineties.  And you gotta love Bill Moseley They're coming to get you Barbara.  They're horny Barbara..

They either absolutely hate it or they have been enraptured by the changeup's that it pitches at you. I am of the later camp. At least Barbara played by the beautiful Patricia Tallman has enough of her wits about her to point out how irrational everybody else is being instead of being the catatonic victim like the first time around. They're so slow. We can just walk right by them. She remarks to Ben Tony Todd who is adamant about staying in the house. Perhaps this version isn't socially relevant like the first but it's nice to see that Romero can add a twist ending that can stand on it's own merits but really is amusing in light of the former movie.".

Looking at Romero's other films  Dawn and Dusk strong females like Fran and Sarah play tough believable characters. The catatonic Barbara in Night '68 was way too weak especially for a Romero film. Although the execution wasn't as good as I would have liked more on that later it was the right decision.2. WRONG  The music. Though the original used library samples for its music they were very wellpicked and added a chilling side to the action with very few hitches. Here though an annoying score sometimes takes the viewer out of the picture. Better to leave the music out altogether.3. RIGHT  Playing on people's expectations. The opening cemetery scene is one heck of a shock. Shooting at a gas pump? Not a good idea.4. WRONG  Harry Cooper. The point of this film was to make Harry out to be a complete ahole. He hits his wife drinks argues and doesn't even sound rational. The original made Harry an angry nasty guy but he helped some throwing the cocktails etc. and made some good arguments for staying in the basement. Here all he does is shout at everyone  not fun.5. RIGHT  Effects. Great makeup here absolutely convincing. Much better than the average horror film.6. WRONG  Pacing. When the house is being boarded the zombies attack constantly and overpower the humans several times. You'd have to be an idiot to stay up there if the zombies were THAT strong. The first one made staying upstairs a viable option.7. RIGHT  The third option of just getting the heck away. With a rifle and a shotgun it shouldn't be too hard to get everyone past the zombies and into the open.8. NEUTRAL  The ending. Certainly a radical change for Barbara's character but it makes sense in context of Harry's behavior.9. NEUTRAL  Decreased role of TVradio reports. It's nice to focus on the matter at hand but seeing the wider view of things is fun too. It's good that they didn't explain WHY the dead were rising.There you have it.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm always wary of remakes of horror and science fiction classics as they are almost always inferior to the original versions in many cases REALLY inferior. There have been a few successful and worthwhile attempts especially John Carpenter's 'The Thing' and David Cronenberg's spin on 'The Fly'. Tom Savini's 'Night Of The Living Dead' is another good one. Even though Savini is a legend in the special effects world I really expected this to be awful. It wasn't. While not as literal as the misguided 'Psycho' remake by Gus Van Zant Savini sticks very close to the source material and doesn't mess with it as much as Carpenter or Cronenberg did. George Romero scripted adapting his original screenplay cowritten with John A. Russo and both men coproduce. The main difference in this version apart from obvious ones like being filmed in colour and with some more sophisticated special effects is the expansion of the Barbara character who is much less passive and more important to the plot. Barbara is played by Patricia Tallman who worked with Savini on Romero's cult favourite 'Knightriders'. She is probably best known for her recurring role on 'Babylon 5'. Tony Todd 'Candyman' plays Ben and is very good and the underrated Tom Towles 'HenryPortrait Of a Serial Killer' is excellent as the slimy Harry Cooper. The scenes between the two are really strong and add a lot to the original. I also enjoyed seeing Bill Mosley Chop Top from 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2' playing Barbara's brother Johnny in the opening sequence. My only real gripe about the movie is the surprising lack of gore and also the new ending which to me is nowhere near as good as the original. Apart from that it is much better than I expected and I highly recommended it to anyone who enjoys Romero's Dead trilogy.".

Yet another wants to make a run for it. Now rather than say which person is right I will refrain so that it won't spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it. I will say however that the differences between the original version and this one were rather stark. For instance the original was filmed in black and white and when it was released shocked the nation. The remake on the other hand had some improvements but wasn't nearly as impressive. For example the original character of Barbra played by Judith O'Dea was in a state of shock and hysteria which added greatly to the suspense of the film. The new and improved Barbara Patricia Tallman was sleeker more capable and less catatonic which added more versatility to the storyline. However it seemed to lessen the effect. Likewise the other characters seemed more polished but less effective as well. Now that is not to say that there was anything wrong with the acting abilities of any of the characters as all of them were adequate.

	schema:headline " A Terrific And Memorable Remake From Tom Savini And George A. Romero.";
	schema:reviewBody "Night Of The Living Dead is a terrific and memorable remake that combines great directiona wonderful casta good score and great special makeup effects. And while the Night Of The Living Dead remake isn't a good as the original it is a welldone and worthy remake of the original classic from Tom Savini and George A. Romero.Set in PennsylvaniaNight Of The Living Dead tells the story of a group of strangers including BenTony ToddBarbaraPatricia TallmanHarry CooperTom Towlesand his wife HelenMcKee AndersonTomWilliam Butlerand his girlfriend Judy RoseKatie Finnermanwho are holed up in a farmhouse and have to fight off Zombies who want to eat their flesh.Night Of The Living Deador Night Of The Living Dead 90is a wonderful Horror remake that was the directorial debut of Special Effects master Tom Savini and with a screenplay by George A. Romerothe director of the original film. Remaking a classic landmark film like Night Of The Living Dead1968is no easy task but I think SaviniRomero and company have made a film that is one of the better Zombie films and remakes around. One of the reasons Night Of The Living Dead 90 is a great remake and Zombie movie is that while it's the same story as the original with the same settingcharacters and some of the dialog but is updated and works not only as a remake of the original film but as an homage as well. While NOTLD 90 lacks the genuine scares and Black and White documentary style atmosphere of the original it some moments of suspense and atmosphere that hangs over the movie throughout. This film doesn't have a lot of the social commentary like the first film or any of Romero's other Zombie filmslike Dawn Of The Dead in 1978 or in Day OfThe Dead in 1985it does tackles that same themes as the original such as tension among the human characters and pulling in different directions showing how things fall apart in drastic situations which will always be relevant. The Action scenes in NOTLD 90 are simple but effective with a lot of shotgun action that is done with great timing and editing. The blood and gore in the movie is fine and memorable although compared to the gore in DAWN and DAY the blood and gore is pretty lightwhich was because of the MPAA which gave NOTLD an X rating and the movie had to cut some of the gore out although an unrated version of this has been released. While the main characters are the same as the original with Ben being the headstrong leaderCooper being a jerkTom and Judy being a scared young couple and Helen having problems with Harry the biggest character change is with the character Barbara. Where as Barbara in the original and was pretty weak and was always screamingthe Barbara in this film is strong and tough always shooting and fighting the zombies and holding her own when things start to fall apart which almost like Ellen Ripley in the Alien franchise. Strong female characters have been a long staple in the Horror genre and the character Barbara in this film is apart of that fantastic tradition. The Zombies are still the slow walking dead creatures they were in the original film coming from every corner and wanting to feast on the living and attack in packs. Although NOTLD is not a HorrorComedy and is very serious there are some moments in the movie that are over the top and make me laugh whether it's Ben and Cooper's bickering or moments that are just unintentionally funny. The ending of Night Of The Living Dead is great because it's an ironic twist on the original's ending and offers a powerful message about human beings and society's own destruction. An amazing conclusion.The cast is great. Tony Todd is excellent and intense as Benwith Todd bringing depth and power to the role. Patricia Tallman is terrific as Barbarawith Tallman being tough and fierce. Tom Towles is fantastic as Harry Coopera jerk who wants to do things his way. McKee Anderson is wonderful as Helen CooperHarry's wife. William Butler and Katie Finnerman do fine jobs as Tom and Judy Rosea young couple. Bill Mosley is amusing in his small role as JohnnyBarbara's brother. Heather MazurSarah Cooperand David ButlerHondogive good performances as well.The direction by Tom Savini is great for his directorial debutwith Savini using a style that is simple but effective with good angles and wide shot giving the movie nice lighting and atmosphere. Good directionSavini.The score by Paul McCollough is good and is filled with enough tension to match the movie's tone. Fine scoreMcCollough.The Special and Practical Makeup effects are outstandingeffective and work for the movie. Great effects.In final wordif you love Zombie films or Horror films in generalI highly suggest you see Night Of The Living Dead 90a terrific and memorable remake that's not as good as the original but still an entertaining Zombie movie. 9.510.".

One of the reasons Night Of The Living Dead 90 is a great remake and Zombie movie is that while it's the same story as the original with the same settingcharacters and some of the dialog but is updated and works not only as a remake of the original film but as an homage as well. While NOTLD 90 lacks the genuine scares and Black and White documentary style atmosphere of the original it some moments of suspense and atmosphere that hangs over the movie throughout. This film doesn't have a lot of the social commentary like the first film or any of Romero's other Zombie filmslike Dawn Of The Dead in 1978 or in Day OfThe Dead in 1985it does tackles that same themes as the original such as tension among the human characters and pulling in different directions showing how things fall apart in drastic situations which will always be relevant. The Action scenes in NOTLD 90 are simple but effective with a lot of shotgun action that is done with great timing and editing. The blood and gore in the movie is fine and memorable although compared to the gore in DAWN and DAY the blood and gore is pretty lightwhich was because of the MPAA which gave NOTLD an X rating and the movie had to cut some of the gore out although an unrated version of this has been released. While the main characters are the same as the original with Ben being the headstrong leaderCooper being a jerkTom and Judy being a scared young couple and Helen having problems with Harry the biggest character change is with the character Barbara. Where as Barbara in the original and was pretty weak and was always screamingthe Barbara in this film is strong and tough always shooting and fighting the zombies and holding her own when things start to fall apart which almost like Ellen Ripley in the Alien franchise. Strong female characters have been a long staple in the Horror genre and the character Barbara in this film is apart of that fantastic tradition. The Zombies are still the slow walking dead creatures they were in the original film coming from every corner and wanting to feast on the living and attack in packs. Although NOTLD is not a HorrorComedy and is very serious there are some moments in the movie that are over the top and make me laugh whether it's Ben and Cooper's bickering or moments that are just unintentionally funny. The ending of Night Of The Living Dead is great because it's an ironic twist on the original's ending and offers a powerful message about human beings and society's own destruction. An amazing conclusion.The cast is great. Tony Todd is excellent and intense as Benwith Todd bringing depth and power to the role. Patricia Tallman is terrific as Barbarawith Tallman being tough and fierce. Tom Towles is fantastic as Harry Coopera jerk who wants to do things his way. McKee Anderson is wonderful as Helen CooperHarry's wife. William Butler and Katie Finnerman do fine jobs as Tom and Judy Rosea young couple. Bill Mosley is amusing in his small role as JohnnyBarbara's brother. Heather MazurSarah Cooperand David ButlerHondogive good performances as well.The direction by Tom Savini is great for his directorial debutwith Savini using a style that is simple but effective with good angles and wide shot giving the movie nice lighting and atmosphere. Good directionSavini.The score by Paul McCollough is good and is filled with enough tension to match the movie's tone. Fine scoreMcCollough.The Special and Practical Makeup effects are outstandingeffective and work for the movie. Great effects.In final wordif you love Zombie films or Horror films in generalI highly suggest you see Night Of The Living Dead 90a terrific and memorable remake that's not as good as the original but still an entertaining Zombie movie. 9.510.";

The ending isn't a happy one but it's very realistic.The remake unfortunately elected to eliminate certain personality traits that we can identify with in favor of more politically correct motifs.  For example the frightened girl who is muted by fear and horror evolves into a female Rambo played admittedly very well by Babylon 5's Patricia Tallman who swoops in with the cavalry and saves the day at the last minute.  Very PC not very realistic.  The tone doesn't really promote sympathetic fear at all and the happy ending where everything is tied up by the 180 shift of Tallman's character doesn't help this problem.On the other hand the movie is not a total loss.  The acting is not bad and while you're never really scared as you are watching the original you're never moved into the realm of laughter either.  Never let anyone tell you that this film is terrible... it isn't but compared to the original it's not great either.

	schema:headline " Not as scary as the original but still very good";
	schema:reviewBody "Although this 1990 remake of the scariest film I have ever seen is not anywhere near as scary as the 1968 original it is still a very good film and has improved with age and repeated viewings. I first saw the original NOLD upon the initial 1968 release at a drivein again in 1970 at a drivein and then not again until around 1980 on VHS video. In the interim I was lucky enough to find and buy the original paperback edition of the 1974 Warner Books novelization. In the remake Tom Savini does a fine job with the director's chair and the film benefits hugely from two very strong performances from Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman. The makeup effects onlocation filming and music are also all firstrate. It is a very worthwhile film despite being a remake of a true classic. It does not attempt to be equal to or better than the original. It doesn't copy the original sceneforscene and dialogfordialog. Although the plots are indeed very similar the remake offers some very unexpected twists and enhances some characters while it somewhat changes others. And for those who have seen the original film but not the remake steer clear of reading spoilers for the remake's ending. It was a touch of pure genius and won't be at all what you will be expecting. See the remake but don't compare it to the original classic. It stands very well on its own merits and even compliments and pays homage and tribute to the 1968 version.".

It started out slowly and I wasn't sure if I was going to stick with it.  But as it went on I was totally drawn in.  I love the fact that the director chose to film it in black and white which only added to the artistry of it.  I loved the fact that she as the director and making it autobiographical allowed us the audience a peek into her creative process.  I also love the fact that she courageously placed herself into the hands of another artist to learn the tango.  I was impressed when I read that Sally Potter had a background as a dancer so it came naturally to her to appreciate and learn the tango.This movie impressed me on many levels because as a creative talent it takes courage to cross over into the world of another artistic discipline how easily could a dancer cross over into the world of a film director?  you see my point.  Or maybe that's not a fair comparison.  But to me its literally a case of walking a mile in another man's shoes.  Perhaps we find it easy to stand on the sidelines and criticize the work of an artist be it an actor director dancer writer etc. but is it hard to come up with creative visions?  Not bloody likely.I viewed this film as a metaphor for life relationships artistry etc. all of which had parallels in the film.  If this sounds too deep it is believe me!  I saw all of this and more in this film.It also felt as if Sally Potter is going through an autobiographical and artistic midlife crisis in this film which has given me courage to put myself on the line autobiographically and artistically.  There was some criticism that she should have cast someone else in the title role but when you can't see anyone playing yourself but yourself how can you answer even this kind of criticism?Bravo Sally!

	schema:reviewBody "This uncommon film will test your ability to perceive at different levels on the surface it only portraits what it seems to be a weak plot and the subplot of a movie within a movie but that are not the points of this movie in my estimation. In another level there are the metaphorical aspects of the Tango being a dance form born in the gutter motivated by raw instincts and erotic sensuality versus the all unending malefemale quest for love and understanding.This is not the typical follow me through the plot and visuals movie but instead is about an atmosphere of sound and silent body language spoken through the haunting sounds of a Bandoneon lost in the sorrow of its own world. The poetic images and symbolisms are all there for those who can see them but you need a sensitive and willing heart to find them. Like one of the characters says in the movie You have to have suffered a lot to understand Tango'. Those who are still too attached to their egos will only see the surface you have to let yourself go and then you will see.This microcosm of the world of relationships is enveloped in ravishing music and dance all this tinted with subtle erotic overtones. It is not about the obvious it is about the inner beauty or not of its characters and their quest for communicating and understanding love. I find Sally Potter to be the perfect match in every way to Pablo Vern character's ego and abilities. This is a lesson indeed to teach those who live only in the shallow surface of today's society that real emotions run deeper than the tan of their skin or their look. To love and to feel is hard work and not just good looks. And to understand a Tango you have to dance it and here they dance it as best as I have seen it on film. And you have to ask yourself. When was the last time you truly held or were held in some one arms in a dance floor at such close distance with such passion? And I don't mean sexuality as it is imposed commercially in everything now a days.This is a dance of kindled spirits and of two hearts who are emphatic on their pains and joys in their path through life which see the world so differently but are ultimately united by their passion for the Tango and to me here is the real lesson. As it has been said You really need two to Tango!' and especially when the lesson is about love.".

Pablo is a pretty sexy guy and a bit younger than Sally but by the end she's leading and he's following.I'm not sure whether they actually get to do the horizontal tango. In between we learn with Sally the intricacies of the dance as an expression of culture as well as personal affinity. There's not much of a story a year in the life of an original and talented art film makerbut the Paris  and especially Buenos Aires settings are evocative  the latter seems frozen in the 40s when the economic tide went out for Argentina. No the dance is the thing. Remember Zorba? A Greek man dances for his soul. Sally dances like a moth drawn to a candle but wears asbestos underwear and gets an interesting movie out of it. The black and white photography is luminous and completely appropriate and the soundtrack a treasure trove of Tangos. Recommended for those interested in romance ie vertical and horizontal tangos though as I said the latter is merely hinted at. Not a film for people who want a compelling story.".

	schema:headline " A provocative film about silence and power";
	schema:reviewBody "As many reviewers have noted there isn't a lot of talking in this movie and indeed this makes for a slow first half hour but as the movie unfolds you realize that silence is the genius of the film.  It's appropriate that writerdirectorstar Sally Potter has chosen tango for her subject for as we see in the film tango at its best is about two dancers communing with each other silently and sharply.Sally and Pablo the Argentinean dancer costar connect immediately as Pablo realizes Sally's seriousness and passion to the art of tango and the two commune in various dance scenes as well as through the one good conversation they have about believing in God.  But eventually this communion breaks down as the duo consider exploring romance and then Sally and Pablo do a whole lot of dancinginstead of talking.  In the end I think they realize that their relationship is based on a kind of mutual painjoy the pain of alienation that Sally experiences in her job as a director and that Pablo feels as an artist and the joy Sally feels as a creator and Pablo as a dancer for whom dancing is like a religion. This joy is evident in a memorable scene where Pablo dances all over the kitchen while making dinner for Sally using every kitchen utensil as a rhythmic instrument. Besides dancing there is also a lot of gazing in this moviemostly Sally gazing at Pablo and on the larger scale the viewer gazing at the two dancing.  Part of Sally's fascination with tango and indeed the way she became enraptured by it stems from the sheer joy of watching.  Sally exercises a kind of powerful intrusiveness in her gaze and it is this that makes her truly dangerous and more of a leader than a follower as Pablo notes.  With this in mind the subplot involving a movie Sally pitches about models being killed perhaps by their lovesick director starts to make sensefor in this case and in Sally's case the art of looking has become a bit like murder as the viewer subsumes the object into himherself and thereby robs it of its autonomy.  As Pablo says to Sally after their first public performance Sally's intense gaze robs him of his freedom and blocks his artistic ability at the same time though it is precisely this gaze that fuels the uncontainable joy of Pablo and Sally's two other dance teachers. In the end I think this movie asks more questions than it answers but it certainly dwells on an unsuccessful relationship that somehow manages to fulfill at the same time as it intrudes and violates.  We may like to think of tango as a dance of love and communion but it can also be about power and control and in this sense Sally uses tango as a metaphor for her relationship that transcends words yet can't subsist on silence.".

Like the screen Sally the real Potter also learned from Pablo Veron also her costar. If only the film was as cogent and searching as her intelligent definititon of a fascinating dance!As a keen tango dancer myself I was eager to see the committed to celluloid the intricacies of a dance which is part improvisational game part physical conversation and as much an exercise for the mind as for the body. A lot of work goes into becoming an excellent and effortless tanguista' and there is much more to tango than most people realise. Turning her story into a roman a clef does not make it experimental or postmodern as appears to have be intended but in fact regresses to the selfreferential musicals of yesteryear such as Singing in the Rain'. As long as there has been art there has been art about art and art about creative blocks. Though such an approach can create masterpieces such as Fellini's 8 12 it can also create ponderous excuses for not creating original art.Worse still it can come off as an act of monstrous narcissism. Potter is a stunning dancer and it is understandable that she wished to play the main role on that count but in all other respects she is merely adequate and her singing in the final scene quite inadequate. Potter berates Veron in the film for not trusting her to be lead by him by not trusting another actor to play her part Potter is doing exactly the same thing.Thus the film plays out like a rather dull overheard conversation that one might idly listen to on the bus but not miss once you reached your stop. Tango is a dance in which the female must follow unquestioningly adding little of her own input occasionally stepping back to let the alpha male shine. The tensions that this has with a woman who is a film director and feminist used to leading and guiding rebelling against traditional roles of male and female might have been fascinating. Instead it all seems a playful act of revenge against Pablo in film she gets to lead not him.Though tantalising ideas leap out from time to time the influence the tango had on her creativity is something touched upon but unfortunately not explored and as always her visuals are sumptuous I found the film a disappointment overall.".

The first time I saw The Tango Lesson I wondered why Potter abandoned the first film the one in her head with the glorious color.  But then I began to understand what the Tango was teaching her about malefemale relationships and I could clearly see that the first film merely posited woman as a victim of male aggression whereas the Tango Lesson discovered the beauty of a woman's strength.  The Tango is not a dance that relies on passivity or the ability merely to be lead.  And this I think is key to why this dance becomes such a sensual experience for both men and women.  I was also delighted by the way Potter used the painting of Jacob wrestling the Angel to speak about the way men and women are capable of occupying the intimacy of shared space.  The film as well as the painting deftly explore the employment of bodies in a movement that calls itself dance but looks enticingly like life.  The film is not about dance.  It is about life which could be dance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sally Potter is one of the most respected names in feminist film. The Tango Lesson while very different from any of her earlier works seems to be a really personal even autobiographical film. It's about a middleaged British filmmaker named Sally Potter. More recent productions have abandoned prudery towards women's bodies and moved to the other side of visual pleasure. The film shows Sally's own personal involvement with Tango. Its original purpose of something fun new exciting and stress relief from her routine life soon became an obsession causing several conflicts.The relevance of feminism in the film is blatantly present. A conflict scene in the film is between characters Sally and her Tango partner teacher and love interest Pablo Veron. The back and fourth arguments are the strongest representation of a feminist point of view in a relationship. After Sally's first Tango performance with Pablo they are involved in a confrontation. Pablo's issue with Sally is that he is the leader and she was to follow which in his eyes she was not doing during the performance. The feminist thought and idea is that men lead woman. Sally replies to this by saying you danced like a soloist. She said that no emotions were involved in the dance sequence which is extremely important in order to create a believable and interesting performance.The fact that they were involved in a personal relationship outside of the dancing did not help the situation. Pablo's character was an alpha male who fell for a woman whose strength and power intimidated him. I noticed in the film in several scenes in his house in the bathroom on top of the fire place and in the dressing room Pablo was placed in front of a mirror. His obsession with himself intrigues Sally to a near jealous streak. She is envious of his confidence. He is also in control of the language spoken between the two of them. They both speak French Spanish and English. When they are not dancing as business partners and enter their personal relationship they speak French. Pablo unable to speak very well English prefers not to while conversing with Sally.Sally Potter was not considered what society considers beautiful. She was an older woman who dressed moderately did not wear makeup and did not possess a voluptuous body. The gaze in television and movies is a serious issue for our society. Woman are considered spectacles used as objects of visual and physical pleasure. The director's gaze is present in the film because she represents and analyzes our visual culture in how men and woman perceive each other.".

Far be it from me to prescribe what they should or shouldn't like but I wonder if they were viewing a heavily edited andor spedup VHS print. One of them referred to a 45minute cut. In fact Drifters should run just over an hour and while an extra 15 minutes might not sound appealing those extra minutes are essential to the rhythm of this film. For Drifters attempts to create a gently rolling rhythm much like the sea itself. I personally find the images hypnotic. This is an art film after all  not a documentary in the traditional sense. Yes the film is about herring fishermen their work and their life at sea. But the film is really an experiment and it only makes sense in conjunction with other documentaries of the 1920s Nanook of the North Grass and Man with a Movie Camera. Perhaps a better classification than documentary would be nonfiction narrative film. At any rate Drifters is historically significant because it was the first and only feature film personally directed by John Grierson. Grierson was of course the man the who coined the term documentary in a review of Robert Flaherty's second film Moana and he went on to head the GPO film unit where he nourished better filmmakers than himself including Humphrey Jennings Harry Watt and Alberto Cavalcanti. Thus Drifters should possess inherent interest for fans or students of British documentary cinema it's the only time Grierson had the opportunity to put his own personal stamp on a feature film.Stylistically Drifters was heavily influenced both by Flaherty's more poetical approach with soft focus and lots of managainstnature imagery and Soviet montage with quickcut editing and lots of juxtaposition. The result is interesting but not entirely satisfying. Following Flaherty's example Grierson chooses to focus on one fishing crew. Unlike Flaherty however he never names or attempts to individuate the crew members despite featuring two very strong and natural personalities a bearded captain who lies awake at night and a cabin boy who's learning how to cook for the crew. Flaherty definitely would have personalized these people even more. On the other hand Grierson manages to illustrate how these fishermen are related to the other elements of the fishing industry  something that Dziga Vertov would have approved of. And Grierson shares Vertov's fascination with the relationship between men and their tools. There's a lovely scene of a stoker lighting a cigarette with some burning coals he's just shoveled into the engine.On the whole I recommend this movie to those who are interested in the history of documentary filmmaking especially in Britain. But I also suggest that if you're new to early documentaries you watch some others first Flaherty's Nanook of the North and Man of Aran Cooper  Schoedsack's Grass Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera and especially Jennings' Fires Were Started a.k.a. I Was a Fireman and A Diary for Timothy. These films rank among not just the most influential early documentaries but also the most beautiful films ever made. By the way Panamint a small Scottish home video company has released a complete print of Drifters on DVD. It looks quite good for a relatively minor 1929 production. Just be aware that it's a PAL release and only available in the UK.".

The documentary film like all genres has undergone so many changes as to be virtually unrecognisable from John Grierson's silent study of a fishing expedition from the 20s. Thanks to the fact of its silence the film stands as an example of pure documentarymaking free of any personalities or voices explaining to the viewer what more often or not they can see for themselves. The fact that we can't hear the sound of the sea the call of the sea birds or the noise of the men at work doesn't detract from the film but concentrates the viewers' senses on the visual and also adds a certain romanticism to what in truth must have been a backbreaking and unpleasant job. The editing is superb showing us everything we need to see in a natural and logical order but with a rhythm that prevents it from becoming mechanical. The fishermen go about their duties with little hint of selfconsciousness or awareness of the camera  other than that stoker of course who casually lights his cigarette from a flaming shovelful of coals before he throws them into the furnace. If like me you don't watch many documentaries give this one a chance  it might just change your opinion of them.".

The fishermen go about their duties with little hint of selfconsciousness or awareness of the camera  other than that stoker of course who casually lights his cigarette from a flaming shovelful of coals before he throws them into the furnace. If like me you don't watch many documentaries give this one a chance  it might just change your opinion of them.";

	schema:reviewBody "Buoyed by the tremendous energy of Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers MONKEY BUSINESS is a charming throwback to the screwball era of the 1930s and 40s. You know that you're being asked to leave reality behind and just settle back for a good laugh the second the film begins especially when the narrator repeatedly warns Cary from beginning the film before the credits are done rolling! Directed with great skill by Howard Hawks mastermind of brilliant films such as 'Bringing Up Baby' and 'His Girl Friday' the film shares the trademark rapidfire dialogue and zany situations typical of most Hawksian comedies. As always following the conversation between the characters is more than enough to leave the viewer breathless... One example out of so many is the scene in Room 304 when young!Edwina loses her temper and the couple squabble about Hank Entwistle and she finally locks Barnaby out of the roomto hilarious and painful effect!As with most screwball comedies the premise of the film must first be accepted since the entire film is a logical development from the original zany premise. In 'Monkey Business' Barnaby Fulton is working on the development of some kind of youth elixir which he is testing on chimpanzees. Unbeknownst to him one of his test subjects escapes his cage and successfully concocts the potion leaving it in the water fountain. Of course when Barnaby tests the potion on himself he drinks some water to get the bitter taste out of his mouthand almost immediately becomes about 20 years old mentally and physically. Before the elixir wears off Barnaby gets a funky new haircut coat and car all with his boss' sexy young secretary Marilyn Monroe who else? at his side. His wife Edwina Ginger Rogers then gets in on the action taking some of the elixir to allow Barnaby to make scientific observations about someone else's reaction to it. It isn't long before she drags her husband to their honeymoon hotel dances the night away and impetuously starts divorce proceedings when he upsets her. The ending is a terrific exercise in beliefsuspension as the rejuvenated Barnaby and Edwina simultaneously this time engage in paint wars hairpulling and scalping.The best part of the film really would have to be the central performance given by Cary Grant as Barnaby Fulton. He's evidently one of Hawks's favourite actors and for good reason toohe makes the trippiest of dialogue sound perfectly natural and plays sciencegeeks and debonair reporters equally convincingly. With Barnaby the viewer is instantly reminded of David Huxley a role Cary Grant infused with life about 15 years ago in Bringing Up Baby. Just as David is kickstarted to life by Susan Barnaby is youthened by the elixir and in both films it's a delight to watch the transformation take place. Initially Grant's Barnaby is as stuffy as you can imagine a scientisthe's absentminded and somewhat stern in effect all 'grownup'. But the moment the youth elixir kicks in the change is miraculous yet believable. Watch in delight as Barnaby flips an effortless cartwheel drives like a daredevil and conducts an entire chorus of children in a rousing war song. The 'joie de vivre' that Grant infuses his character with is almost palpable.Cary Grant is also capably matched by Ginger Rogers in their second film together. Her ability to turn into a little girl is charming in the extreme and you can see the years drop off her in her final stint as young Edwina... it's so evident that she's having fun as she tapdances through the hotel or flips rubber bands at people chews gum and scribbles Barnaby loves Edwina across the conference room chalkboard.In general the film itself is a little uneven it has brilliant and hilarious moments but you definitely get the feeling that much of the film is coasting on the considerable energy and skill of its casta splendid Cary Grant a lovely Ginger Rogers and an intriguingly young Marilyn Monroe. You probably won't be in too much of a hurry to rewatch this film once you've seen it the first time but there's really no reason to put off your first viewing... so what are you waiting for?".

The story is pleasantly zany the characters are entertaining and the stars were all perfectly chosen for their roles.Hawks's opening gag with Cary Grant in the doorway sets the tone and lets you know right away that you can sit back and not take anything seriously for a while.  Grant's character a somewhat befuddled scientist who is trying to come up with a youth formula is the kind of role he could play in his sleep.  As Grant's wife Ginger Rogers doesn't get much to do for a good while but then she has some fine comic moments later on.  Charles Coburn is perfect as Grant's boss and he gets a couple of the best lines in the whole show.  And who better than Marilyn Monroe to play Coburn's secretary?It's an entertaining throwback to the screwball comedies of a slightly earlier era.  Monkey Business may be no masterpiece but it's good fun of the pleasantly offbeat kind that is rare anymore.".

Howard Hawks takes you back to the good old days when Hollywood demonstrated total mastery of time and space with the screwball comedy.Along with monkeyshines and child actors you really get a lot in this film Grant and Rogers play off each other very nicely and the driving scene with Monroe and Grant is a classic.  Adding to the hijinx is Charles Coburn who always dominates the screen with his easy charm.  I bet he loved chasing after Monroe with a spray bottle. The movie holds up well over 50 years later which makes one wonder why Hollywood hasn't cringe chosen to ape the storyline for Jim Carrey or maybe Tom Hanks who might be looking for a comic turn these days.But then they remade Freaky Friday this summer didn't they?".

	schema:reviewBody "Basically this nice little comedy by Howard Hawks is based on the urban legend that I used in the summary line If you put a certain number of monkeys in front of type writers for a long period of time eventually you are going to get the complete works of Shakespeare the King James Bible War and Peace Little Women etc. This urban legend is based on probabilities but whether it is true or not is something nobody is really prepared to attempt it would be too difficult to monitor and too expensive and too long. Here the whole idea is that an overly observant chimpanzee in a laboratory might be able to mix the elixir that regains lost youth or zest.Howard Hawks had directed several comedies with Cary Grant and Grant's Dr. Barnaby Fulton seems like a cousin of Dr. David Huxley the hapless paleontologist in Hawks' 1938 comedy Bringing Up Baby. Huxley is a child in handling the madcap heiress Susan who is pursuing him no matter what. Fulton is not as helpless as that but he does have some similarities. He wears eyeglasses like Huxley and he can seem somewhat absent minded like Huxley. Fulton has attracted the attention of Miss Laurel Marilyn Monroe the secretary of Mr. Oxley Charles Coburn. When Fulton goes to see Oxley for a brief conference Ms Laurel tries to lure his attention by showing him her lovely leg  supposedly demonstrating her new nylons using a process he's invented. Fulton looks at her leg closely but clinically regarding the success of the unbreakable nylon process.Ginger Rogers too showed some fragments of her past screen career as Edwina Fulton. She constantly wants to go dancing and when she drinks the rejuvenating formula she starts doing some nice dance steps reminding us of her days with Astaire but even of her work in the Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930s. At one point when she has taken too much of the formula she is suddenly 1012 years old and we see a repeat of her SueSue Applegate in The Major And The Minor.Grant works for a corporation headed by Coburn and Larry Keating. They have been prospering from Grant's chemical inventions and patents but Coburn is particularly interested in this rejuvenation formula. It is supposed to make a man feel decades younger and vigorous again. As Coburn has the beautiful Monroe as a secretary with indifferent skills he hands her a paper to have someone else type and when she protests to get another chance to type it instead he gently explains it is too important  Anyone can type! he says to Grant it is obvious that if the formula works he will be using it to pursue Monroe. Coburn is so desperate he wants to convert the entire factory to just produce the rejuvenation formula if it succeeds.Grant is not too happy  he's been working for two years on the formula and there has been no success yet. He leaves the monkey cage open and a female chimpanzee who has been watching Grant mix the formula throws the chemicals together and hides it within the water cooler. And every time the formula that Grant makes is tried the guinea pig Grant Rogers whoever takes a drink of water to help make it palatable. And of course it is the unknown concoction of the monkey that actually sets off the rejuvenation.The film follows the good and bad points of rejuvenation. Yes it does make a person more vigorous and able to do things that he hasn't been able to do for years Grant does a cartwheel at one point. But it makes the user unreasonable to others who are not similarly peppy  Rogers thinks that Grant is a drag as he doesn't take the concoction when they go out back to the hotel they honeymooned in. She is ready to jitterbug and he's collapsing. And if too much is taken you become emotionally immature leading to Grant arranging the scalping of his former rival Hugh Marlowe by some real kids.The film has some nice little bits in it. An immature Grant is asked for the secret ingredient to his formula. How much Coburn asks him for the formula? I want a zillion dollars! Grant says  which he claims is a trillion million. And when he is trying to arrange the scalping of Marlowe one of the youths George Winslow keeps bringing him down to earth by reminding him they need a war dance if they are going to scalp anyone!Probably not on par with Bringing Up Baby or His Gal Friday but it was a good comedy for all that. However later on when he's taken the rejuvenating formula Fulton does recognize Ms Laurel by her legs under a sign  suggesting that the attractiveness of her legs did make an impact on him.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Monkey Business could have been pretty bad. I would say that it's saving grace is the fact that the people involved are all highly talented. Howard Hawks turns in some excellent direction per usual although I'm sure he was only paying the bills. Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers are pitch perfect. Marilyn Monroe is essentially eye candy in this movie but she still steals every scene she is in which unfortunately isn't very many.The script was written by the highly respected Ben Hecht  Charles Lederer of His Girl Friday fame and I.A.L. Diamond Some Like It Hot etc.... With so many excellent writers involved you know the script is going to be at least decent. Granted that a monkey discovering a potion for the fountain of youth is a pretty silly premise they managed to pull it off for the most part. The dialog is a bit awkward in places but overall very good and the script certainly got it's message across.Cary Grant's performance makes this film. He perfectly embodies what a typical teenager and child of the age would be. Of course the scenes in which he takes the potion are the highlights of the film and he does an excellent job with them. He also has considerable chemistry with his female costars particularly Ginger Rogers Who plays his wife.Marilyn Monroe plays Grant's bosses slightly dim but wonderfully innocent secretary. Although she has limited screen time you cannot take your eyes off of her anytime she is in the shot. The sign of a great actress.Overall a very charming film with a feel good message. 710".

He would reteam with Hawks and Monroe the following year in another classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Monkey Business was the fifth and final teaming of Hawks and Grant.

	schema:headline " The Fountain Of Youth In Your Watercooler";
	schema:reviewBody "Monkey Business Cary Grant's second film with Ginger Rogers and his fourth and final film for director Howard Hawks has him reaching back into some of the lunacy of his previous work like Arsenic and Old Lace. Not since that madcap piece was Grant ever so frantic on the screen.Ginger Rogers doesn't yield one inch of screen ground to him in that department though. In The Major and The Minor she faked being a teenage girl very convincingly and in this film she and Cary go back even farther in their return to adolescence.

Not since that madcap piece was Grant ever so frantic on the screen.Ginger Rogers doesn't yield one inch of screen ground to him in that department though. In The Major and The Minor she faked being a teenage girl very convincingly and in this film she and Cary go back even farther in their return to adolescence.

I find suspending disbelief here no problem and the result is a wonderfully silly movie.  Cary Grant is spot on as the absentminded scientist Barnaby Fulton.  The opening credit scene which seques seamlessly from Cary being referred to as Mr. Grant by the offcamera director to Cary being Barnaby Fulton is a classic in itself.  Ginger Rogers Mrs. Fulton is hardly credible as a scientist's wife but she is brilliant whenever Mrs. Fulton is under the influence of the elixer. Monroe is effortless as the dumb blonde secretary wanting to have fun with the youthful version of Barnaby Fulton.  Charles Coburn is perfect as the frumpy boss Mr. Oxley.  The comedy is in the situations and dialog that develop as the elixer is repeatedly unwittingly imbibed by Grant and Rogers and then by others.  I would rather not spell these out but they are fully within the screwball comedy genre that goes back to the 1930's.".

Barnaby works for a company that is capitalizing its existence on the success of a product that will change people's lives as their lives will benefit with a youth feeling that no one else has marketed.Unknown to Barnaby one chimp in the lab decides to imitate Dr. Fulton and creates its own formula which he dumps in the water cooler. Barnaby decides to taste his own creation himself something the company does not encourage. Finding it ever so bitter he must have some water to take away the after taste he gets after drinking his formula. The results are amazing Barnaby becomes a reckless young man.Monkey Business owes its success to the great Howard Hawks a man that produced some of the best comedies of Hollywood that still are seen again and again. Mr. Hawks was a versatile man that knew what the public wanted. The comedy worked because all the elements came together to make it a timeless piece that will be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. The screenplay was by Ben Hecht Charles Lederer and I.A.L. Diamond and based on a story by Harry Segal.An inspired Cary Grant is the basically the excuse for watching the film. He shows his range in playing the morose scientist as well as the younger man that has fun playing with children as well. Mr. Grant is perfect as Barnaby. Ginger Rogers also has some excellent moments when she tastes her husband's magical formula reverting to the time when she had just married Barnaby. Marilyn Monroe added a touch of mischief playing the secretary with all the right equipment to distract men at the office. Charles Coburn and Hugh Marlowe are also seen in supporting roles.".

Cary Grant is 48 and shows amazing energy here more frantic than I have ever seen him elsewhere. Grant gets a kids hair cut in this and looks younger with that style than his age.Marilyn Monroe in this film is good but her role is support. She has the full curve look here as it appears her weight was up into the plump area when she did this movie.This did happen sometimes in her career. Still even plump she looks attractive. Ginger Rodgers always was quite slim and I like her figure in this one. She gets to do a few dance steps but not really the dancing she did with Astaire. Her acting is frantic in this too. I'd have dated Ginger with this look. The chemist who has invented a youth formula here is pretty thin to hang the plot on and at times the story line blurts and some of the acting is really over the top. This Monkey Business has no relation to the Marx Brothers film of the same name. Given a comparison the Marx film is much funnier the only thing it lacks is Monroe. This movies only assets are the great cast.".

Socalled sophisticated comedies replaced screwball comedies with the likes of Woman of the Year and To Be Or Not To Be. One of the best directors of screwball comedies Howard Hawks made one last hurrah with Monkey Business which can be considered the final comedy of the genre there were elements of screwball comedy in Some Like It Hot and other later films but these don't really fit the category completely.Monkey Business is all but forgotten today even though its cast includes many of the best actors around at the time. The only element that keeps it from being swept under the rug totally is the significant appearance of sex goddess Marilyn Monroe who was beginning to show the world that she was more than just a sex kitten. Though Hawks focuses on that aspect of her persona she is able to rise above it with her immense comedic talents. Perhaps another reason for this movie's obscurity is the title since one of the great Marx Brothers films is also called Monkey Business. This little gem is a winner. The writing talents of Ben Hecht Charles Lederer and I.A.L. Diamond are utilized to create a laughaminute marathon of science fiction hocuspocus brought to life by Cary Grant who is outrageous in his antics especially when he reverts to childhood Ginger Rogers who gets to cut a rug in what becomes almost a parody of her dances with Fred Astaire the always wonderful Charles Coburn Sex pot Marilyn Monroe adds the spice and all threaten to be upstaged by Esther the Chimp.The lines in the script are at times saucy to say the least for a film made in 1952. When buying a sports car Dr. Barnaby Fulton Cary Grant mentions adding a beaver tail. The camera pans and shows Marilyn's feet and legs then travels upward. While Barnaby and Lois Laurel Marilyn are driving the sports care for the first spin the conversation becomes titillating with Lois Laurel telling Barnaby how hot she is. When Barnaby and his supervisor Oliver Oxley Charles Coburn speak about secretary Lois Laurel the camera pans from her bottom to Oxley who comments Anyone can type. There are many other sexual innuendos sprinkled throughout including a scene when a naked baby crawls into bed with Edwina Fulton Ginger Rogers. She thinks it is her husband Barnaby who has become an infant by drinking the youth potion. She first arrives at this conclusion when she feels the baby's butt.The story sounds simple when outlined. In reality it becomes complex in its presentation. A brilliant chemist Dr. Barnaby Fulton is extremely absent minded. Consequently he continually misplaces notes to experiments and forgets at times to write down some of the main ingredients to his formulas. Working on a youth concoction and using chimps in his experiments he is not adverse to drinking his own mixtures becoming a human guinea pig. While a monkey is loose in the laboratory the skillful creature mixes his own potion which is accidentally put into the water cooler. This leads to all types of hilarious situations including one scalping with the team of scientists headed by Oxley trying to find the one ingredient that makes the formula work.The humor is fastpaced the lines fly like a buzz saw. If you don't find this film hysterical then your funny bone is out of whack. See a laugh doctor immediately. Oh as a bonus you get to hear Cary Grant croon The Whiffenpoof Song".

	schema:reviewBody "This farcical adaptation of  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  is also an affectionate valentine from director Howard Hawks to a veteran pair of campaigners  Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers  as well as to the audience who remembered when Hawks Grant and Rogers were in their youthful prime back in the Thirties.  The great thing of it is Hawks  Co. are asserting here in 1952  that they are most definitely NOT past their prime both in comedic execution and in terms of the movie's theme which is the inadvisability of wishing to turn back the clock.Grant is the absentminded professor working  rather unenthusiastically  on a  youth elixir which he's testing on lab chimps.  Well one of these chimps gets out of his cage inadvertently creates the perfect  formula by mixing and matching chemicals and finally dumps the beaker into the water cooler.  Hijinks follow.  With each encounter with the formula Grant and wife Rogers regress further and further into youth all the way back to infancy.  The gags here are as good as anything Hawks and Grant in earlier Hawks films ever put on the screen.  Grant's performance is really a wonder  a slowburn rising to an almost scary lunatic crescendo wherein he's slathered in Indian warpaint and administering a mohawk haircut on an old chum  and romantic rival  with a group of savage children as his aides.  And Hawks gives Ginger the opportunity to cut a rug or two.  What more do you want?  Marilyn Monroe?OK Monkey Business  has MM too.  It's an early picture for her and it's a small role . . . but I must echo a comment below that her magnetism is an irresistible force.  It's beyond  acting  the woman was clearly a star. When this absolutely ripe tomato is onscreen she's all you see.  Old Charles Coburn must have relished the scene where he gets to chase her around the lab soaking her with a spray nozzle.  An enviable role for any actor!  Because  Monkey Business  was one of her first movies Cary Grant is also able to get away with asking MM to pull his finger !.  Dr. FULTON!  she huffs.  Monroe was wonderful before superstardom barbituates and the Actors Studio got their hooks into her.I suppose I should bring up the meatier subtexts underneath all the farce YOU know the sublimated desire to escape Fifties conformity the catastrophe of male midlife crisis the dark side of consumerism  Grant is a hiredout chemist for a crass pharmaceutical company which is willing to foist any poison on the public as long as said poison is profitable the discovery of Sex After 40  notice how much lovelier Rogers looks when she releases her long blonde hair from that horribly severe Fifties bun Freudian connotations of repressed adulterous desires . . . oh but why spoil the fun?  Along the lines of spoiling the fun the wet blankets bemoaning the unPC treatment of animal experimentation and kids playing Cowboys and Indians can go jump in the lake.All in all Monkey Business  this screwball throwback  is funnier and more substantial than its Thirties antecedents.  It requires great artistry to return to one's old material without parodying oneself.  I guess Howard Hawks and Cary Grant were great artists eh?".

And Hawks gives Ginger the opportunity to cut a rug or two.  What more do you want?  Marilyn Monroe?OK Monkey Business  has MM too.  It's an early picture for her and it's a small role . . . but I must echo a comment below that her magnetism is an irresistible force.  It's beyond  acting  the woman was clearly a star. When this absolutely ripe tomato is onscreen she's all you see.  Old Charles Coburn must have relished the scene where he gets to chase her around the lab soaking her with a spray nozzle.  An enviable role for any actor!  Because  Monkey Business  was one of her first movies Cary Grant is also able to get away with asking MM to pull his finger !.  Dr. FULTON!  she huffs.  Monroe was wonderful before superstardom barbituates and the Actors Studio got their hooks into her.I suppose I should bring up the meatier subtexts underneath all the farce YOU know the sublimated desire to escape Fifties conformity the catastrophe of male midlife crisis the dark side of consumerism  Grant is a hiredout chemist for a crass pharmaceutical company which is willing to foist any poison on the public as long as said poison is profitable the discovery of Sex After 40  notice how much lovelier Rogers looks when she releases her long blonde hair from that horribly severe Fifties bun Freudian connotations of repressed adulterous desires . . . oh but why spoil the fun?  Along the lines of spoiling the fun the wet blankets bemoaning the unPC treatment of animal experimentation and kids playing Cowboys and Indians can go jump in the lake.All in all Monkey Business  this screwball throwback  is funnier and more substantial than its Thirties antecedents.  It requires great artistry to return to one's old material without parodying oneself.  I guess Howard Hawks and Cary Grant were great artists eh?";

I have always loved Cary Grant he was a very charming urbane and likable actor and he is sublime here. Ginger Rogers is also very good it shows that she is just as good as acting as she is at dancing. It is Marilyn Monroe though who steals the show very beautiful and sassy she is delightful in Monkey Business. All in all this movie is a delight and definitely worth the look. 1010 Bethany Cox".

All the players simply shine in the material especially Grant and Rodgers who do hilarious takeoffs on becoming and behaving like children.I find comments made here concerning the political incorrectness of the cowboy and Indian scene to be laughable. Why do modern movie goers judge a movie 50 years old by current standards.  I was born in 1950 and every kid on the block all over the USA played cowboys and Indians.  It wasn't politically incorrect in 1952 it was in fact part of the mainstream sociocultural structure. Shall we not play The Merchant of Venice because Shakespeare's Shylock is antisemetic. I'm reminded of how ludicrous Pearl Harbor was with none of the sailors smoking because it's politically incorrect these days. One must put the time and context of certain works of art in perspective. Frankly the cowboy and Indian sequence is one of the funniest in the movie and very true to the 1950's.

	schema:reviewBody "What makes Three on a Meathook a ballsout real horror film? It's the fact that it looks like a home movie a serial killer would make. It looks like after finding a 16mm camera in one of his victim's houses some serial killer got a few of his demented buddy's together put some ad in the paper for cheap talent and tried to make a movie. In one of the earliest scenes where the father is berating the son you can see that although the actors keep screwing up their lines they kept filming and left it in the final print. The grainy stock of the film the inventive although cheap special effects and the downtrodden feel of this picture really put you into the subconscious pocket of something brewing in a crude psychopath's mind. Scene after scene is dragged out mercilessly as the filmmakers try to fill the legal featurelength time. One scene has the son sitting in a bar watching the band AMERICAN XPRESS play through two lackluster 70's contemporary tunes.

It looks like after finding a 16mm camera in one of his victim's houses some serial killer got a few of his demented buddy's together put some ad in the paper for cheap talent and tried to make a movie. In one of the earliest scenes where the father is berating the son you can see that although the actors keep screwing up their lines they kept filming and left it in the final print.

	schema:reviewBody "As the title suggests Three on a Meathook is a grainy and grisly slice of seventies American horror although it offers slightly more than similar genre films. The film is apparently based on the classic and influential story of Ed Gein although aside from the rustic setting mother themes and the fact that people die this one strays a lot from the story and actually takes more influence from Geininspired classics such as Psycho. It's obvious that the film was shot on a very low budget as it doesn't feel completely finished and that along with the bare locations bad acting and short running time ensure the budget limitations shine through. The plot revolves around a father and son that live on a farm. The film opens with four girls breaking down while on a camping trip and after taking up the son's nice offer of a bed at his farmhouse they decide to stay there. However they all wind up dead and the son is dismayed when he finds out that he is the killer! His father helps him clean up the mess but when he brings another girl home it looks as though history is going to repeat itself.As you might expect there's a fair amount of gore here  although perhaps not as much as in other similar films. Still what there is in terms of gore is well done and Three on a Meathook features some excellent kill scenes most of which are misogynistic. The film constantly hints at a twisted ending and indeed the mystery behind the murderer is so obvious that I'm convinced the audience is supposed to guess that straight away  but luckily William Girdler's film has more in reserve and the twist that comes at the conclusion is a definite surprise...although it does hint at how much more shocking the film could have been if it had been incorporated properly into the story rather than just being rolled out at the end. The acting is nothing special although the director obviously rates his lead stars James Pickett and Charles Kissenger as they both went on to star in two more of his films The Zebra Killer and Asylum of Satan both of which may be worth tracking down. The climax to the film is an obvious nod to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and overall while this is not exactly great cinema grindhouse fans will definitely find a lot to like.".

I am just going to summarize things that others have said that I agree with.This is a gritty lowbudget exploitation movie with a 70's feel. You will notice similarities to Psycho and Texas Chainsaw Massacre and supposedly it is inspired by the same truelife serial killer. It has some gore and nudity and quite a bit of slowmoving filler. If you are bothering to track this movie down you probably already have seen several like it and know what to expect.The plot involves an isolated farm boy who lives with his father. When the movie begins four young ladies are traveling to his neck of the woods for a girlsonly camping trip. Their car breaks down and he invites them to stay at his place where he lives with his dad. Twenty minutes into the movie and all four girls are dead.I really had to keep watching to see what else the director would do for the rest of this fulllength movie after accomplishing what most movies would take their entire running time to do. Instead of following the formula this one switches things up and has the boy head into town to drink away his troubles. It seems he murdered the girls without realizing what he was doing and apparently this was not the first time something like this happened. The shot of the young killer walking down the neonlight street with his hands in his pockets seems to suggest Peter Parker more than a pickax murderer. Luckily he gets drunk and an attractive bartender takes him home because that's what girls did in the seventies isn't it? They end up getting along and he invites her to stay at his farm. She accepts and it looks like the horror will occur all over again.I usually never even try to figure how movies are going to end but I saw where this one was going VERY early on. It contains most of the elements of trashy 70's horror such as a weird repetitive score poor acting ridiculous dialog a grainy yet naturalistic look and retro fashions. In the middle of the movie there is a band playing in the bar where the main character goes to drink and we watch them play two entire songs as if they were the musical guests on an episode of SNL. The movie is unintentionally funny and I had to find something else to do during long stretches where very little was happening. However as a fan of these sorts of curiosities I enjoyed the experience overall at least upon my first viewing. I don't think I could sit through it again.I also want to say that I have seen the last movie this director made titled Manitou. It is actually pretty impressive to see the progress he made in the time between these two movies. I was saddened to learn that he died at a young age after only six years of writing and directing horror movies. He seems like he was on track to becoming a very prolific filmmaker.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay admittedly Three on a Meathook is a pretty damn terrible godawful film and most normal people will probably find it an unendurable cinematic experience to sit through. The production values are unimaginably poor the supposedly shocking plot twists are laughably predictable the acting performances are miserable the photography and editing are hideously amateurish and even with a running time of barely 80 minutes at least half of the film is purely redundant padding footage. But still regardless of all its shortcoming and stupidities I can list numerous reasons why this sickly gem ranks amongst my alltime favorite early 70's grindhouse flicks. So in case you insist on reading an unbiased and twentyfour carat objective review you should probably quit reading mine right now First and foremost Three on a Meathook was the debut of devoted horror writerdirector William Girdler. Girdler was clearly horrorobsessed at young age already and remained extremely busy during the next six years of his wellfilled but painfully too short career. He was barely 25 years old when he debuted with this gritty Psychoinspired shocker but the film itself also inspired a whole series of grainy redneckhorrors maybe even including Tobe Hooper's classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Girdler then quickly specialized in cashing in on contemporary popular trends in the horror industry. He made his very own violentcopabovethelaw flick The Zebra Killer as well as Blaxploitation films Sheba Baby Abby and a Satanic Cult movie Asylum of Satan. His most famous films are the notorious Jawsonland classic Grizzly and his supremely demented imitation of The Exorcist entitled The Manitou. William Girdler died at the tender age of 30 when his helicopter crashed whilst spotting locations for already another film. With NINE fine movies in just 6 years imagine what he could have achieved if he hadn't sat foot in that helicopter  Back to Three on a Meathook specifically this film is to me the purest embodiment of devoted early 70's grindhouse filmmaking. Girdler didn't have much of a budget to work with but nearly every penny he did have went straight to the accomplishment of bloody makeup effects and scenery to make the film appear more grim  disturbing. This film is politically incorrect as hell with uncompromising gore and gratuitous nudity aplenty and the main characters are your average and stereotypical dumb countryside folks. Clumsily disguised as a tragic lovestory Three on a Meathook serves one deviant story twisted after another although admittedly with some dreadful musical interludes and pointless we're falling in love montages in between and the wholesome works towards an indescribably frenzied climax.The film opens with the clichd premise of four young girls deciding to go camping in a remote woodsy area. One topless swimming party and multiple girlish chuckles later their car breaks down in the middle of the night but the simpleminded farmer's boy Billy  who previously observed the girls as they were skinny dipping  comes to the rescue and invites them to spend the night at the farm with himself and pa. The father worriedly warns Billy about what happens when he gets too close to girls but the next morning the girls are all reduced to lifeless corpses. When going into town to drink away his misery Billy falls in love with a waitress and takes her and a friend back to the farm where the horror threatens to repeat itself. You don't exactly have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out the truth behind the murders but still the script provides an extra ingenious and practically unpredictable twist at the very end of the film. The narrative structure is wildly uneven and the padding footage is horrible but the at least sequences that truly matter are morbidly atmospheric and misogynistic. If you're into this type of questionable cinema I can't recommend Three on a Meathook wholeheartedly enough. That's a guarantee because I have yet to encounter a grindhouse fanatic who doesn't appreciate hatchet murders pickaxe horror stabbing and nasty meatcleavers.".

Clumsily disguised as a tragic lovestory Three on a Meathook serves one deviant story twisted after another although admittedly with some dreadful musical interludes and pointless we're falling in love montages in between and the wholesome works towards an indescribably frenzied climax.The film opens with the clichd premise of four young girls deciding to go camping in a remote woodsy area. One topless swimming party and multiple girlish chuckles later their car breaks down in the middle of the night but the simpleminded farmer's boy Billy  who previously observed the girls as they were skinny dipping  comes to the rescue and invites them to spend the night at the farm with himself and pa. The father worriedly warns Billy about what happens when he gets too close to girls but the next morning the girls are all reduced to lifeless corpses. When going into town to drink away his misery Billy falls in love with a waitress and takes her and a friend back to the farm where the horror threatens to repeat itself. You don't exactly have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure out the truth behind the murders but still the script provides an extra ingenious and practically unpredictable twist at the very end of the film. The narrative structure is wildly uneven and the padding footage is horrible but the at least sequences that truly matter are morbidly atmospheric and misogynistic. If you're into this type of questionable cinema I can't recommend Three on a Meathook wholeheartedly enough. That's a guarantee because I have yet to encounter a grindhouse fanatic who doesn't appreciate hatchet murders pickaxe horror stabbing and nasty meatcleavers.";

Three on a Meathook however is a very poor and slow slasher attempt that hasn't got after all pretty much to do with the actual case from the real life except that these both men kill people.Billy James Pickett lives on the countryside with his father Charles Kissinger. Billy is not allowed to see females as they're filthy and evil and so on you know what I mean if you've seen some of these films that have a religiously paranoid parents that torture their kids like Brian De Palma's masterpiece Carrie 1976 for example. Soon a bunch of attractive females break their car and have to stay at the two men's apartment for the night the father of course opposing very much. The night comes and so comes some gory murders. Soon Billy meets another girl whom he falls in love with. What follows is extremely slow situations laughable dialogue some absurd scenes and some more gratuitous gore at the end.The film is very slow as I've mentioned couple of times already. It has painfully long scenes of the seventies discobar music that don't have ANY other purpose than to make the film run nearly 80 minutes so that it can be called a feature film. It has long scenes of Billy wandering around the town and thinking about something as well as running in the fields showing cars drive away and so on and these scenes are as meaningless and boring as they sound. If all the necessary bits were cut out and put together again the film would run approximately 50 minutes I think!The dialogue and some of the situations will make most of the fans of trash laugh and enjoy. The film tries to offer some kind of an explanation for the acts the killer does but none of it makes sense. Why is the boy so stupid and weak he cannot do anything about it? And what kind of a cannibalistic disease actually is their mother suffering from?? Also this kind of a setting could give a good premise for some effective parody and black humor like Hooper did with his Chain Saw Massacre two years later but in the Meathook both the town and the countryside are depicted as equally apathetic boring and also dangerous places to be and all the potential the film could have is not used. The film includes also plenty of quite graphic nudity and gore so this is pure drivein exploitation in its most honest form. The murders are pretty graphic and gory and towards women only so this can be considered as one of the earliest slasher films but far away from the most noteworthy ones. The leg scene at the end is pretty absurd to say the least and again makes me think how much better Hooper for example used the same potential and ideas. The editing and cinematography is nothing special the former being awfully bad especially at the end. Rarely have I seen such bad and confusing editing as in the gore finale of Three on a Meathook. Also the music by the directorwriter himself is pretty bad and not interesting at all. The acting is as apathetic as the characters but fortunately the actors are not as near as bad as they could be and at least they found very attractive young females to act in the film to make at least something shine in the piece.There are not many merits in this film other than those negative sides that turn positive in the eyes of the fans of trash. Three on a Meathook is the kind of film that don't get made anymore and so they have and will have their fans around the world and even though I'm a fan of low budget grade z cinema too I still cannot give Three on a Meathook more than 210 as it just should have been much more than it now manages to be.".

The dialogue was laughable and the music score was awful and just drags on and on making this movie feel longer than it actually is.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS AHEAD ... Skid row exploitation ripoff of Hitchcock's Psycho Three on a Meathook is actually enjoyable on some sort of inexplicable level. With the assistance of alcohol and allowing your critical urges to remain dormant for eighty minutes the film does have some redeeming qualities.Here's the story  Billy a weird loner who lives with his father on an old outoftheway farm is traumatized by past events that unravel throughout the film. The day he decides to go fishing he stumbles across a brokendown van full of scantily clad girls. Courteously he offers them to stay on his farm for the evening. His old man is furious with him when they arrive back at the house and ominously reminds his son  You know what happens to you when you get around women.'The following morning the girls are all found dead. After Papa' gives his son the I told you so' lecture he gives him some money and tells him to go to the city and catch a movie' and not to return until he's feeling 'better'. Cue about fourteen gratuitous minutes of a band who the director probably loved as he allows them to perform two entire songs. Meanwhile enjoying the band and drinnking more than he can handle Billy befriends Shelly the barmaid. He passes out she takes happily him home. The following day it transpires that this couple were made for one and other and fall in love.By now you're probably wondering where the Hell this wild movie is going. Billy goes home and tells Pa' that Shelly and her friend will visit them the following weekend. Ignoring his father's pleads that Billy will kill them the insecure boy allows the ladies to visit anyway.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS AHEAD ... Skid row exploitation ripoff of Hitchcock's Psycho Three on a Meathook is actually enjoyable on some sort of inexplicable level. With the assistance of alcohol and allowing your critical urges to remain dormant for eighty minutes the film does have some redeeming qualities.Here's the story  Billy a weird loner who lives with his father on an old outoftheway farm is traumatized by past events that unravel throughout the film. The day he decides to go fishing he stumbles across a brokendown van full of scantily clad girls. Courteously he offers them to stay on his farm for the evening. His old man is furious with him when they arrive back at the house and ominously reminds his son  You know what happens to you when you get around women.'The following morning the girls are all found dead. After Papa' gives his son the I told you so' lecture he gives him some money and tells him to go to the city and catch a movie' and not to return until he's feeling 'better'. Cue about fourteen gratuitous minutes of a band who the director probably loved as he allows them to perform two entire songs. Meanwhile enjoying the band and drinnking more than he can handle Billy befriends Shelly the barmaid. He passes out she takes happily him home. The following day it transpires that this couple were made for one and other and fall in love.By now you're probably wondering where the Hell this wild movie is going. Billy goes home and tells Pa' that Shelly and her friend will visit them the following weekend. Ignoring his father's pleads that Billy will kill them the insecure boy allows the ladies to visit anyway. Pa gets drunk Billy and Shelly hit the hay and the friend gets a pickax in her belly at the hands of Pa. The killer now revealed the last ten minutes involve Shelly finding the film's title in a nearby barn Pa being incarcerated and Billy being told that his father killed girls to feed his cannibalistic mother who was presumed dead for many years but was kept in a shed.This is an insane film with some bizarre plotlines annoying music andinept acting.

	schema:reviewBody "I bought this film simply because of all the stories about this film being similar to Texas Chainsaw Massacure when I watched it it was not what I had expected.  This movie is about three women that go off by themselves to get away from life and their car breaks down on the side of the road and in the middle of the night a strange young man comes along and offers them a place to stay for the night at his house.  After bebaiting on whether or not to go along with the stranger they finally accepted and when they get there they meet with the mans crazy father that objects with the girls staying over night.  During that night the father kills the young girls and the next day blames the killings on his son who is also blamed for the murder of his mother when he was thirteen as well as many other murders involving young girls that are picked up by him and the old man.  The son goes off by himself and ends up at a bar and gets picked up by the waitress.  He falls in love with her and invites her to stay the weekend with him and his crazy father.  The father kills the ladys friend that came with her and tries to blame her murder on his son.  The father and son get into a misshap in the kitchen and out comes his ageing mother who was supposed to be dead.  He finds out the truth that his dad was lying all along and wanted his son commited to a mental instution to be rid of him and continue feeding his mother who has by now become cannibalistic.  The son and lady go off together and seek phyciatric help in dealing with this lie that has been haunting him all these years.  This movie is a waste of time and in noway near TCM.  It is dumb and boring.  The crazy way the women that were killed off in the beginning and never even mentioned or seen until the end left little excitement.  They didn't even give the movie time to get to know the characters much less have a chance to stay at the house a little while longer before they were killed.".

Anyway a title like that attracted the real geeks out there. So this movie became a cult favorite. But it never had a proper release. The only way to catch it is on VHS and even they are rare. What we have here is an OOP oh yes I know there are some DVD releases also OOP but they were just rip offs of the VHS. That is what I have a DVD release. What makes it unique is that it is signed by Linda Thompson. The blond one who's naked all the time and get killed earlier in the movie. So far I never found one on the Net signed. Enough of my pride. The movie itself is really a grindhouse release. Due the fact that it was an US release we all know what that means NTSC format. And being in the business we all know what that means here in Europe Never The Same Color. Indeed when they cut from on shot to another then yellow rules and next shot green appears as the main color. Oh yeah never been colorized afterwards. So it's low budget. But the editing is okay the score is okay lipsync is sometimes a problem but the quality of the film they used is terrible. There are a lot of drops and scratches on it. But that makes it more and more grindhouse. The only failure the movie has is that it was advertised as based on the life of Ed Gein. No way it does. It starts of pretty well you are only 10 seconds in the movie and Linda who signed my DVD yeah yeah already appears in a TA shot. No problems the first 20 minutes. You know the story 4 birds go for a hike in the weekend car breaks down a guy passes by and take them to his place. Father isn't happy with girls in the house so they all die. The effects used are cheap but they used the red stuff very good. It never is gory but it works watch the decapitation how they edited that. It works. But after 20 minutes the movie falls down becomes slow and is nothing more than a love story. At the last 15 minutes the blood flows again. If they only had used the other 50 minutes to do something with it. Again it never bored me due the grindhouse drive in style. It has a lot of gratuitous nudity 70 style so full bush anyway. If you come up to a copy of it don't hesitate to hook on it but you must have a grindhouse feeling.".

	schema:reviewBody "Definitely cheaplymade bad horror film from the early 1970s that is oddly fascinating as when one catches a forest on fire and cannot turn away. Director William Girdler's first feature is interesting to say the least and problematic as well. Girdler you may remember directed those wonderful cheesy 70s horror films such as The Manitou Asylum of Satan Day of the Animals and Grizzly. His films often have lamentable qualities but are always watchable. Three on a Meathook is no exception though still largely unpolished as it is his first. The film is very  grainy  of course I was going to use that word! The set designs onlocation shots costumes and what little special effects we are given pale in comparison to other Girdler filmsokay maybe NOT Asylum of Satan!. The acting is subpar with no one really giving a good performance but the two male leads  James Pickett as Billy a boy told that he cannot stay around women otherwise he will butcher them and Charles Kissenger as his Pa  alcoholic and seemingly in a trance through much of the film  do fair enough work. The girls that die are well basically talentless though all beautiful. Watch for Elvis squeeze Linda Thompson looking ever so deliciousno pun here either. You get what you would expect in a movie like this gratuitous sex nudity and violence. The nudity is almost immediate and stays the course throughout however the violence is not nearly as hyperbolic as the title Three on a Meathook might suggest. There are a lot of talking scenes with long drawn points being made. I particularly loved the scene where Billy's girlfriend Sherry and her friend Becky come up to the farm and run through fields and Becky fakes falling down and hiding while some ridiculous music plays. She falls then again and laughs. Sickening. Or how about the speech Becky gives us about her camp counselor husband going to fight in the war? Man that was Oscar worthy! Okay I am being facetious. The corny scenes and dialog abound and wait until you see that hokey ending that makes little sense. Or how about the band that plays two whole songs just to make the movie long enough? It is easy to go on and on but for what it is Three on a Meathook is fun if anything in a sobaditsgood vein. I was entertained and given a few hearty laughs as well.".

Yet magnificently this story is portrayed so well on screen that it seems as realistic and natural as any other common relationship.Yes Mel Gibson is in this film but as a heterosexual male my favorite character is played by leading lady Piper Laurie...........Who just so happens to be H  O  T Hot Hot Hot !!!!!In the words of young people today  She's a real M.I.L.F. !!!!!  My goodness......that flaming red hair and that navy blue bathing suit she wears at the end.....Oh be still my beating heart !!!! Piper Laurie is absolutely gorgeous in this film. If you can appreciate the beauty of an older woman then this DVD is worth buying just to see her !!What makes this movie so sweet though is that there is nothing in this story that is perverted about their romance. You truly fall in love with Piper Laurie as an honest woman who genuinely cares. Although she is an accomplished and successful woman she is as emotionally innocent as Mel Gibson's character. Their romance develops naturally and without sex as an ulterior motive.This film in it's own quiet little way shows us that just because a relationship might seem bizarre to you does not mean that there's anything wrong with it. The love of a lifetime can spring forth between the most unlikely people.".

It is certainly one of the best and proved quite early in his career that he knows his craft very well and is well able to carry off a challenging role to perfection.  The title character Tim is seeking to know the adult world around him without an adults' understanding of the subtilties of life.  Mel Gibson plays the part to perfection neither feeling sorry for himself nor being so crass as to portray this childman as cute and silly.  He is simple Not the full quid as Tim puts it.  But he feels all of an adults needs and finds the person to explain life to him in a way he can understand.  Piper Laurie as Mary becomes the most important person in Tim's life and she plays the role with a kindness and compassion usually not seen in today's actors.  This film is a must for anyone concerned with raising and educating a child with the challenge of a mental handicap.  One could hope that Mel will do more movies of this type with the love and understanding and true actor's ability he shows in this his second movie.".

Piper Laurie excels as 'Mary Horton' a successful fortysomething widow who takes a romantic interest in Tim but is unsure if a relationship will work.The thing that struck me about this movie was it's basic principle. It is not uncommon for rich fortysomething men to be seen with attractive supposedly lessintelligent women. 'Tim' turns this on its head having a rich older woman hooking up with an attractive less intelligent younger man. Society frowns on the latter form relationship I'm not sure why and it adds an interesting angle to the story.The only complaint about the film is the ending. They had such a fantastic idea but the movie just...ends. Loose ends are left and to be honest it seemed tacked on or just plain rushed.It is a good heartwarming film with a few weepy bits and oneortwo good ideas not explored well enough but still entertaining nonetheless.".

I hope what I say below contains no material that can be construed as a spoiler but I have referred to 2 scenes that are important.It is a small sensitive film that in combination with the book gives a rich canvas of emotion response to the human condition. Many parts of it are heartbreaking. Tim's father opening up his heart in a very simple and masculine way when he shows Mary his stock portfolio for Tim and she correctly infers that he is planning for his own imminent death and Tim's complete misunderstanding about what Mary and 'Mr. Melville' have been talking about. This scene correctly displays sadness jealousy anger tenderness concern love longing intuitive understanding and a deep parental concern and resignation that no more can be done. No guns are fired. No missiles launched. No fireworks light up the sky. We are treated to a vision of ordinary people dealing with the tides of our lives. Many parts of it are tender. Tim cannot speak or read or write. He is not clever. In fact just the opposite. But that really is not what the movie conveys. Nor the book either. Both try to strip away anything that would make Tim attractive in any more than the physical sense. The book implies that Mary has the problem of guilt and knows that her only compensation will be Tim's deep and abiding and unconditional love and she feels that if she commits to him it will be 'until death do us part'. She wonders if that will be enough. I think the same things are conveyed in the movie. She does not go to the psychiatrist for counseling although it sounds like it. She goes to hear the echo of her own positive thoughts and she needs conformation that the negative ones don't matter. It is not so much that she takes his advice it is that she reaffirms her own convictions. The guilt and uncertainty come from her understanding of the problems that will come outside her door. His advice amounts to 'Whatever are you worried about. You know what's best. Now do it.'Many parts are very tender. Watch for any scene with Em in it. A good mother and a good wife. Very plain very simple very human very unglamorous.Don't look at this film if you are not prepared to give it the time and study it deserves. It is not eye candy. It is soul candy.".

He gives us insight into the world of feelings of his character with his voice body language and facial expression in a way that makes each moment come alive. He is truly living his character. PiperMary also plays her role with all the care and sensitivity it needs. The story of the growing friendship between the two makes for more of a poem than a movie. A true love story regardless of age and handycaps. And Tim's parents are well acted and believable. The harsh note of realism comes in the form of Tim's sister who only sees the oddness of it. However magic prevails and a delicate love story is born. I wish it had been longer to further develop their lives. I also wish Mel Gibson would return more often to his ability to portray sensitive men with such truth.".

	schema:reviewBody "A shallow display of an underplayed surfacy adaptation of the wonderful book by Colleen McCullough.  This movie by Michael Pate simply doesn't do the characters justice as if the director said Let's just keep the film rolling in this spot and have the actors speak and move around as little as possible so we don't waste any valuable time and money!  The viewers aren't allowed to delve into the characters' minds as we should be making us feel somewhat cheated of a great story line. It unfortunately omits rather amusing and emotional details the contractors in this film who constantly play practical jokes on a bewildered Tim feed him a 'turd' sandwich leaving him in tears to be comforted by a neighbor.  It also leaves out important deep philosophical dialogue such as when Mary seeks the advice of the expert who founded a school for mentally retarded individuals.  We don't get to see the turmoil in Mary's being as she painfully ponders her awkward relationship to Tim a stunningly handsome young laborer trying to keep their friendship pure and simple and nonsexual.  I felt Mary in this film wanted the relationship become more than that although that's not what the author had intended in the first place.  The script lacks deep meaningful dialogue among All the characters which were so much better in the book omitting some great witty lines from Mary's neighbor the contractors Tim's father for starters.  The only reason I bought it was the fact that it stars a gorgeous 22year old Mel Gibson who seems to innocently sport the tightest shortest shorts I've ever seen on a guy while cutting grass and trimming bushes.  Mel portrays his character with such innocence and wonder like a lonely lost puppy dog  And that teeny bathing suit!  I'd buy the film again in an instant! Aside from the surfacy details I love the essence of the story and jumped in my seat during certain scenes hoping it would end the way I wanted it to.  There are wonderful moments especially if you're a female!  It does end rather abruptly however...but that's another puzzlement  the way it ends.  I mean it just does.  But if you're a Mel fan and don't mind sitting through sappy music or boring dialogue than you'd enjoy it.  Otherwise rent something else.".

Exspecially Piper Laurie who played Mary Hotton. She had to act emotional and she fell in love with Mel Gibson who played Tim. He was a young man he did gardening work for Mary. She had a gardener who had a bad back so he wouldn't be able to come anymore so she employed Tim.They were both amazing characters. My mum used to watch it every day with a lager and lime. When Tim was with his dad in the pub Tim gobbled his pint down. I also liked his father Alwyn Kurts who played Ron. He took a great part. When Tim's mother had died Pat Evison who played Em. I thought that the scene was depressing she had died of an heart attack.No one was for her at the time and I thought that it was heartbreaking. When Ron was talking to Mary. Tim starred at Mary in a jealous look. Ron was talking about planning his own death and Tim didn't understand. He was angry and jealous. He ran off in a temper. He said that she isn't paying much attention to him anymore and she hates him. But she replied that it wasn't true. He knew that this would happen. Then Tim started to kiss Mary. I thought how romantic. In one of the scene Tim had asked Mary what is death? And he didn't know what death was until Mary had told him. Because he thought that he would never see his sister Deborah Kennedy who played Dawnie again. I thought that it would be heartbreaking for Mary because she lost her parents. This was the first film that i ever saw her in and she was brilliant. I have seen her in other films. Carrie as Margaret White and Trauma as Adriana Petrescu and she was the killer. But she was great. I thought that MeL Gibson took a great part as Tim but i didn't fancy him. I thought that the film was brilliant but heartbreaking. Luv Gail".

There are those among us who are similarly mentally endowed but this is the only good movie I've seen to present this innocent type of below intelligence character. Even I was at first skeptical of Gibson's portrayal but when the movie explained that his family had given up on what could be done for his intellect it provided me hope in the movie along with his clean relationship with the old maid Piper Lauri. This movie combined many facets of people together and situations which is a tall order for a movie so short ... a mentally challenged young man stunted by family stigma and unintentional limitations a simpleton family limited in ways of the world but with a healthy family cohesion the importance of life quality of life and death the raw turmoil of one's age and her perception of love and oldmaid self esteem everyone's perception of love not lust and the clean nuances required to keep it all together. This movie gave the audience freedom to connect their own dots of things left unsaid .. to allow clean thinking on subjects that are difficult to ponder. Despite the low budget this movie seemed to have had it is full of much depth. Due to being a deep movie it would be missed by action thrill seekers. More could have been done for the audience regarding supporting Mary's Piper Lauri decision to marry Tim but given the movie's flow style the reason given was acceptable if not quite adequate. After all Mary was an intellectual but not necessarily a rocket scientist. This movie presents what I would call a different walks of life scenario and due to this it wouldn't have been as readily acceptable to many viewers. Definitely not a movie for rotetype thinkers. I would rate this depth perception movie an 8 due to its' targeted depths it has and the pleasantly lasting impression it made on me and not just Gibson's shortshort blue jean cutoffs ... grin.".

The two develop a friendship she teaches him to read and takes him on trips to the beach.Their relationship eventually turns romantic following the death of Tim's mother. At first Mary denies her feelings Tim experiences jealousy and then his father asks Mary to look after Tim when he passes.I really enjoyed the family dynamic here both of the parents were fantastic just great acting in this and I fell a bit in love with Alwyn Kurts who played Tim's father. There is also a neat scene with Mary reading The Thorn Birds Tim was based on a novel by Colleen McCullough as well as all of the cups of tea and middies of beer at the pub true blue.

Anyone who thinks Dawnie or Justine in Mary and Tim is hostile should contrast her with the novel.The plot is compressed in the movie. Events which take over a year are shown in a shorter period. Also events are different than in the novel. It tends to be a more entertaining account than the novel. More of a happy ending.It is a very nice gentle story of love. I think it is one of the best movies Mel Gibson has done in that it's not a superstar just a talented actor. Yes it is different than other roles he has done which is why they call it acting.One thing in the novel Tim Mary Horton is an Prentiss child who never knew her parents in the movie her parents have died. Also she is an American immigrant not an Australian native which you can see in the way she talks. The language is more for an international audience.".

I think it is one of the best movies Mel Gibson has done in that it's not a superstar just a talented actor. Yes it is different than other roles he has done which is why they call it acting.One thing in the novel Tim Mary Horton is an Prentiss child who never knew her parents in the movie her parents have died. Also she is an American immigrant not an Australian native which you can see in the way she talks. The language is more for an international audience.";

Rafael tells him that this attack had been arranged by his real mother Paluzzi and her lover.Sebastian's sister who had witnessed the massacre all those years ago had since fallen in love with Rafael for which he had been severely punished and hounded. The extent of this punishment becomes clear later in the movie when whilst captive he is forced to lie next to a beautiful lady and taunted that he now only has his muscles to prove his manhood.This revenge story follows a different path to the majority of Eurowesterns with emphasis on the tale rather than action that said there are some great action scenes.

Alberto De Mendoza as a cruelly baddie role is terrific subsequently he would play similar characters in various oaters . Furthermore appears usual secondary actors from ItalianSpanish Western as Jose Suarez  Jose Riesgo Franco Pesce  Jose Luis Martin  Luciano Rossi Enzo Fiermonte  and several others. Brief appearance of future Spahetti secondary myth  Piero Lulli . The film blends violence blood tension family drama  high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing a shootout or stunt every few minutes . This is a good Spaghetti Western with some moments genuinely entertaining if you can avoid thinking too much . The musician Roberto Pregadio composes a vibrant soundtrack in Morricone style and well conducted  including a catching leitmotif and considered to be one of the best . Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine sets with striking cinematography in Eastmancolor with negative regularly processed  being necessary a right remastering . Interior filmed in Elios Studios Rome and outdoor sequences filmed on location in Lacio Rome along with Almeria where in the 60s and 70s were shot innumerable Spaghetti.It's a Western freely based on famous Orestes myth . According to Pindar the young Orestes here played by Leonard Mann was saved by his nurse Arsinoe or his sister Electra here Pilar Velazquez  who conveyed him out of the country when Clytemnestra Luciana Paluzzi wished to kill him.

	schema:headline " Another Solid Western By Ferdinando Baldi";
	schema:reviewBody "Ferdinando Baldi's Il Pistolero Dell' Ave Maria aka. Forgotten Pistolero Of 1969 is good Spaghetti Western with an excellent score. Baldi is responsible for several good Spaghetti Westerns including the great Blindman of 1971 and Texas Addio of 1966 with Franco Nero in the lead and although Forgotten Pistolero is not one of his greatest achievements Baldi proves once again that he is an above average Western director. While Blindman is my definite favorite of Baldi's movies I couldn't say whether I preferred Texas Addio of Forgotten Pistolero. On the one hand Texas Addio has Franco Nero without doubt one of the Italian Western's best actors in the lead and the supporting cast includes Luigi Pistilli Livio Lorenzon and Gino Pernice. On the other hand the acting in Forgotten Pistolero is also very convincing the score is excellent and the storyline is a bit more interesting than that of Texas Addio.After Sebastian's father Civil War General Juan Carrasco Jos Surez is murdered by his wife Anna Luciana Paluzzi and her lover Tomas Alberto De Mendoza their son Sebastian flees with his nanny and former wetnurse. Years later grown Sebastian Leonard Mann has become a fast and excellent shot. One day Rafael Peter Martell comes to Texas where Sebastian lives and brings back the dark memories of Sebastian's childhood. Rafael who is the lover of Sebastian's sister Isabel Pilar Velsquez is constantly victimized by Anna Carrasco's henchmen one of them played by Piero Lulli and Sebastian agrees to join him back to his mother's estate in order to free his sister from their unscrupulous mother and to avenge his father's death.This is the second movie starring Leonard Mann I've seen after Three Amens For Satan of 1971. Three Amens For Satan was certainly no masterpiece but Mann definitely delivered a good performance. In Forgotten Pistolero he is once again very good in the lead and although Mann is not a very wellknown Spaghetti Western actor it should be said that this guy definitely had potential to play silent avenger types. Peter Martell also delivers a credible performance as Sebastian's sidekick Rafael and Alberto De Mendoza is good as the villainous Tomas. The best performances in this movie however are in my opinion those of Luciana Paluzzi as the sneaky mother Anna Carrasco and beautiful Pilr Velsquez as Isabel. Piero Lulli fits perfectly into his regrettably small role of the brutal thug as always. The score by Roberto Pregadio is excellent and the film is shot quite nicely in decent locations.Forgotten Pistolero is a solid and entertaining Spaghetti Western not a genrehighlight but definitely a good film. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "The DVD I've ordered features the film Il Pistolero dell'Ave Maria in its original Italian language. Some aspects of the story may have been changed in the English language version.I will tell you just the very beginning of the story. I only want to give you a taste of the film. There will be no real spoilers I think.A lone rider going through a canyon. Up on the cliffs horsemen watching him. Closeups of their faces hands ready for action. The scene is enhanced by a hauntingly beautiful score.The rider is Rafael Pietro Martellanza. As a boy he had worked in a hacienda in Mexico. The owner of the hacienda was absent fighting against the french. For those that have no knowledge of the history of Mexico very simplistically told the french had invaded Mexico in 1861 and installed Maximilian of Habsburg in power. He became the emperor of Mexico! The french rule lasted until 1867 when the Mexicans led by Benito Juarez expelled the french and shot the Emperor. Crazy ain't it? Coming back to the film Rafael worked in this hacienda that belonged to the Carrasco Family. The patriarch and owner of the hacienda General Juan Carrasco was absent fighting against the french. Rafael was the best friend of his the general's son Sebastian Leonard Mann and loved and was loved by Sebastian's sister Isabella Pilar Velazquez. Children the three of them. But while General Carrasco was away fighting the french his wife Ana Luciana Paluzzi was having an affair with the hacienda's foreman Tomas Alberto de Mendoza. After the french had been defeated General Carrasco returns home and is received in high style by everyone in the hacienda. A party is held to commemorate his return. Suddenly... betrayal and tragedy.The characters are scattered to the four winds. Years pass and the dust seems to have settled down but a chance meeting will rekindle old memories. The day of reckoning has arrived.This story almost seems a Mexican melodrama but it's filmed with a grandeur and style that's unique. The party that is held in homage to General Carrasco when he returns from the war with its dancing singing and eating is flamboyantly portrayed. The same holds true for the scene in which a character enters a small Mexican village where a celebration is taking place in the streets ... firecrackers people laughing singing ... Then the saloon with wild and beautiful women dancing barefoot on the counter... Ferdinando Baldi is very skilled in telling a story by way of images  editing framing closeups music ... everything adds up to create the right atmosphere and the proper emotion. It's true that sometimes he goes overboard as he proved with the completely overthetop film's ending that's so operatic so melodramatic as to put even the wildest Mexican melodramas to shame.A good welltold story featuring beautiful women Luciana Paluzzi Pilar Velazques and many others sunny dry landscapes and a wonderful soundtrack. I didn't like so much the ending though with its fire and brimstones conclusion but this is a matter of taste. Highly recommended if you like your spaghetti hot and wild.".

Well I would always prefer not to live together with murderers but that quantity of logic is missing. The story as it is told often rises more questions than it answers. Acting is as good as the weak script permits the women are really handsome.

	schema:reviewBody "Overall Forgotten Pistlero is a solid Spaghetti Western  not great but good enough. Like a lot of the SWs I've seen the central theme in this one is revenge. The children of a man murdered by his wife and her lover want revenge. It may be a familiar setup but Ferdinando Baldi does an excellent job of building interest and tension right to the final moments. Baldi also throws in a lot of other bits that I've come to expect from an entertaining SW  mysterious strangers Leonard Mann and Pietro Martellanza with overthetop gun skills an impossibly beautiful heroine played by Pilar Velazquez a gang of cutthroat killers and lots and lots of sweaty men. And the film's finale is about as downbeat as you'll find. It's not as dark as something like The Great Silence but it's definitely not a happy ending. It stuck with me long after the movie ended. Good stuff.A few other thoughts1. The music while very good is often derivative and very Morriconeesque. It will remind you of a dozen other scores  but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 2. The acting is good but no one really stands out. The highlight of the cast for me has to be Luciana Paluzzi of Thunderball fame. 3. For what seems like a modestly budgeted SW there are a couple of setpieces that are exceptionally well filmed. For example the waltz scene looks like it came out of a film with a budget far exceeding that of Forgotten Pistolero. It's gorgeous. The other is the film's finale. The burning building is another setpiece that's very well done. I'll give Forgotten Pistolero a rocksolid 710.".

Indeed the action sequences fist fights gun battles are directed to bring much impact.One of the villains happens to be a woman for a change which will make you wonder how this unusual menace will be dealt with. The Roberto Pregadio music score is very memorable. The production values are solid. And there is a great climax. Is there a flaw to be found anywhere? Well I have to admit that the middle section of the movie was somewhat slow moving and talky though it didn't bother me THAT much. And despite that problem the movie all the same is a solid example of its genre.".

What is great is the amazing music score that immediately starts by Roberto Pregadio which was used in the movie Kill Bill. The music really makes a SW movie and the music here really sets the mood. I liked such scenes as when Peter Martell's character Rafael is being hunted down from Mexico into Texas by Miguel Jose Manuel Martinwho to me has the face and good acting for a small part SW actor that plays Mexican bandit roles to the tee. He finds boyhood friend Sebastian and helps him remember his blocked out past and seek the revenge they both rightfully deserve. It was amazing the ending scene with the Hacienda burning and the music playing and justice being served. You have to see it and will not be sorry....".

	schema:reviewBody "The First Great Train Robbery is directed by Michael Crichton who also writes the screenplay. It stars Sean Connery Donald Sutherland LesleyAnne Down Wayne Sleep Robert Lang Alan Webb and Andre Morell. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth. The story is loosely based on the real Great Gold Robbery of 1855 where a rogue criminal named William Pierce and his cohorts executed the theft of 12000 in gold from a speeding train on route to aid the British Army during the Crimean War.A delightful period caper picture that's high on production value and fun characterisations. Split into two halves Crichton's movie makes light of the actual crime to portray Connery and co as lovable rogues thus hooking the viewer in to actually root for them to pull off the intricate crime. First half well it's more two thirds of the film to be exact details how the robbers obtained the four keys needed to get into the safe. Harder than it sounds since they are in different locations to one and other and guarded over by different officials. Naturally there are scrapes skirmishes and obstacles to overcome during this complex operation and no short amount of humour and tension either. Then it's on to the actual crime which buzzes ferociously with derring do and ingenious cheek! It may have been loaded with chitter chatter and much bluffing of the way leading up to it but the pay off is excellent and not without genuine excitement as Connery's doing his own stunt work Pierce and Sutherland's safe cracking Agar pull off the seemingly impossible. Benefiting the film greatly is Crichton's attention to detail where he thrives on the Victorian England setting. From the streets the costumes the dialogue and mannerisms of the characters they all fit nicely within the narrative. Helps too that the cast are playing it with tongue in cheek Connery and Sutherland are revelling in playing roguish dandies splendidly attired facially with quality face fuzz and Down raises the temperature of Connery and male audience members alike. Probably her best ever performance Crichton writes a good role for Down that sees her not only as a sexy head turner it's unlikely that Victorian underwear has ever looked this sexy before in film but also as an observant member of the gang one who isn't too shabby on the disguise front either. Dancer Wayne Sleep is nicely cast as a fleet footed housebreaker while Lang Webb Morell and Michael Elphick pitch their respective performances just right. Goldsmith's score is energetic and Unsworth's his last film as he sadly passed away shortly after shooting it photography is a lesson in quality without trickery.Fanciful and tame if compared to the big budgeted actioners of today The First Great Train Robbery none the less is testament that simplicity of plot and a keenness to entertain is sometimes all you need. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "With Mission Impossible like precision Sean Connery Lesley Anne Down and Donald Sutherland pull off The First Great Train Robbery years before Jesse James did it in the American West. Of course holding up a train with a dozen masked bandit confederates doesn't equal the near precision complexity that it took to steal gold bullion off a train by three men in stealth. Connery is the mastermind of the scheme and he plays Edward Pierce with the usual charm we've come to associate with Connery. It was interesting how Connery gets the idea for the heist in your typical Englishman's club with at least one of the responsible parties for the gold in that very room. The other club members know him as a retired industrialist who seems rather well fixed and comfortable. If they only knew the real source of his comfort.Lesley Anne Down may have given her career performance here as Connery's girl friend. Their scenes fairly crackle with witty repartee and sexual innuendo. Down is certainly not above using her sex to help in the robbery. In fact the first part of the plan which took about a year in preparation was to get duplicates of four keys that unlock the safe on the train where the bullion is transported. She compromises one of the key custodians in a Victorian bordello which is the film's humor highlight.Donald Sutherland is the safecracker friend of Connery's enlisted for the caper. He gets the dirtiest details of the caper. In fact the authorities get wind of some kind of plan in the works and Connery has to make some last minute adjustments to his plan. The adjustments call for Sutherland to get into the car in a coffin with a dead cat for odorous effect. What some won't do for money. Sutherland handles the whole thing quite well.Connery has the dangerous part of the caper which calls for him to go from front to back on a moving train. Those sequences according to the Films of Sean Connery were shot in Ireland which better represented the look of rural 1855 England. I was stunned to learn that Connery himself did the stunts. Sean admitted himself that it was the most dangerous business he ever undertook for any film. What some will do for the sake of art.The First Great Train Robbery is a stylish caper film set in Victorian Great Britain and the film really captures the look and manner of the period. One of Sean Connery's best films definitely worth a look.".

This is almost a twohour film and they build up slowly to famous heist. However I didn't find any of it boring. This is rated PG but there are quite of bit of sexual innuendos early on by Connery as he woos LesleyAne Down. Other than that it's a pretty tame film. Donald Sutherland adds a touch a touch of humor here and there as he and Connery pull off the suspenseful heist....and it is suspenseful.Connery trying to maneuver on top of the train was a highlight as was the whooshing sound of the train each time it passed under a bridge. The stereo in here is very good for a film almost 30 years old.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another fine performance from Connery in his attempt to move away from his cliched James Bond persona and expand on a wider variety of character roles.Based on a richly descriptive screenplay  textured direction both by Critchton we see Connery as a master criminalgentleman attempt to steal gold from a moving train in Victorian England.Connery plays the role very much with a straight bat perhaps a little too pompous  stiff but entertaining all the same.However he is ably supported by fellow criminals Donald Sutherland with a rather thick  unforgiving Cockney accent and a rather angelic performance from LeleyAnne Down as Connery's love interest.Coupled with a some outstanding cinematography by Geff Unsworth showing panoramic views of the English countryside as well as superb set direction of a very realistic Victorian London First Great Train Robbery is a treat to watch.Critchton's direction has never been better although I feel the film is perhaps 10 or 15 minutes overlong. But he never lets the pace flounder and neither does he let the ConneryDown love interest suffocate or distract from the overall plot.However the characterisation for the main leads is a bit shallow  clumbsy. Connery is very much at home as Edward Pierce the well respect city gent  playboy. In essence not all that different from his James Bond character although in this film he is given enough invention  adlib to make the character more rounded than the rather onedimensional Bond.Sutherland offers the comicrelief the workingclass foil to Connery's respected gent and he plays it very well apart from the rather hammy English accent.Obviously the most memorable scenes are with Connery risking his own life as he hops along the tops of carriages of a steam train as it winds its way through the English countryside on its way to Folkstone. I must admit to being totally gobsmacked at how close Connery was to being decapitated from those very low bridges the train went under. But I guess its testiment to Connery's great interest in the movie that he allowed himself to take on such risk.The ending is perhaps too contrived and perhaps blemishes the movie as a whole. But don't let this stop you. Overall this is a fine film and a very funny film and is definitely an underrated Connery role that deserved more praise than it received on original release.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe not the great train robbery but a pretty good one.Michael Crighton is not an artist but he's a fine storyteller. Often his films are better than his novels. But everything comes together in this one  script score direction photography and performances. How does someone like Leslie Anne Down come to look so droopyeyed and lovely? And how come Sean Connery looks so good and so sexy as he ages? A criminal act if you ask me. Donald Southerland is the epitome of an 1855 criminal rogue. Goldsmith's score is lively and reminiscent of Prokoviev's Lieutenant Kije.The whole enterprise is witty well thought out and engrossing. There's an excruciating byplay between Connery and the younger wife of an old banker. They are having tea al fresco watching the workmen build an ancient water wheel out of old parts. Neither of them cracks a smile as they talk about how the parts are bolted tightly together instead of screwed how the joints must be tightly fitted so rare remarks the lady and how America is a land of many prominent erections. Connery probably has the best lines. One of them is keen. His girl friend Downe demands of him Do you ever tell the truth? He smirks slightly and answers No. I'm uncertain about whether to explain exactly why this exchange is so funny because I don't want to insult anyone who already knows. But for any kids who may be reading this exchange of lines constitutes a logical paradox. If you are asked if you ever tell the truth and you deny it well then you are lying in your response which means you must be telling the truth. The answer is both true and false at the same time as is this sentence This statement is false. Sorry a little tedious I know but that's the sort of thing you find in this film.The script will also give you an entertaining lesson on the life and lingo of early Victorian England. You learn what a jack is and what a ratter is and what a crib is. The moral calculus of the film is a little wedged what with Connery having strangled to death a shrimpy squealcat who didn't deserve being murdered by any but The Godfather standards.It's not all intrigue and planning though. The climax is filled with riproaring action. Crighton has said that when they were shooting the scene in which Connery is crawling along the top of the train the coat he was holding accidentally was blown out of his hands but the actor stayed in character turned around and retrieved it.You won't regret catching this if you can manage it. Kind of a family movie and a nicely rendered one.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the beginning there were four keys. And the keys were used to lock two giant safes. There was gold locked in the two safes and it was good. And the giant safes were aboard a British train. The train was destined for Eastern Europe to fund the British forces fighting the Crimean War. Edward Pierce stated the gold was worth 25000 and aroused the criminal element. But there had never been a robbery from a moving train before. And Edward Pierce said All anyone ever thinks about is money. And it was good.Sean Connery plays Edward Pierce a comely yet conniving thief of thieves who decides for his next project to lift the Crimean Gold from a train bound for Eastern Europe. The character Edward Pierce is loosely based on reallife thief William Pierce who enacted one of the greatest train heists in the 1850's. The very opening of the movie is Connery's voiceover explaining the gold the safes and the whereabouts of the four keys. Immediately we understand that his initial goal is to acquire the keys to steal the gold.He solicits the help of fellow pickpocket and locksmith the best screwsman in England Edward Agar also a reallife figure involved in the 1855 heist played by Donald Sutherland and the beautiful LeslieAnne Down as Miriam. The first half of the film is Connery and Sutherland investigating the location of each key its owner and a possible weakness in the keys' owner. Their first target is Mr Edgar Trent head of the bank entrusted with the dispatch of the gold. Connery discovers Trent's routine to discover a weakness. We see an imagined scene in which Trent rejects the solicitations of a young woman to which Connery remarks in voiceover No respectable man is that respectable! This first segment demonstrates how the film is organized through the investigation and acquisition of each key which is duplicated care of Sutherland. The last act is the actual heist. Blessed are they that experience this pure entertainment from beginning to end. Of course the bad guys are all colorful characters with not only shrewdness but wit to match while the upright members of society who hold the keys to the gold are painted as bland and stodgy bores. Every scene is replete with humor and sarcasm and Sutherland and Connery make an unlikely pair of complementary underworlds. And this heist must shortly come to pass. Amen.".

	schema:headline " Donald Sutherland's best corpse scene";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fun movie and I recommend it with only two reservations which I'll get back to. Sean Connery rarely is in historic costume films the only two that come to my mind was The Red Tent and the Indian Jones movie that he made and they are set in fairly modern times  1928 and the 1930s to be exact. He pulls off Edward Pierce with elegant aplomb a brilliant and inventive gentleman thief who one roots for. LeslieAnne Down is properly coquettish and sluttish when her goals require it. And Donald Sutherland is properly lovable as a successful pickpocket and thief I loved his snapping his knuckles to make his hands more limber who allies himself with Connery to carry off the theft. He also makes the most purple faced cholera corpse on film you have to be there to understand why. The sense of the film setting is good too from the vintage 1850 train and carriages to the use of Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace in a scene. The original palace burned down in 1936 but the model although it looks like a model is a nice reminder of the time and place.Now my reservations Michael Crichton's novel was an examination of the hypocrisy of Victorian England. Taking an actual 1855 robbery probably the first really great theft committed on a train  of gold bullion needed in for the Crimean War Crichton examined the existence of the very rich and privileged and the very very poor in the slums. He looked at bordellos that the rich frequented or the public executions. Much of this is in the film. Downs repelling the advances of the fat bank official in the train is an example as is the public execution of a poisoner  the chant the good people yell as the woman is hanged Oh my I think I have to die is an actual chant used by the public at those occasions. But Crichton also notes the irony of the way the public attack the train thieves while embracing the idiots running the Crimean War that the gold was for. In the novel Pierce brings up the murderous James Brudenell in court. He refers to Lord Cardigan the fool who led the Charge of the Light Brigade. The court rebukes Pierce. That is not in the movie.Secondly in reality Pierce was more villainous than the film and Connery makes him. We do see Connery's character strangle Willie the human fly who he used to steal one of the keys he needs. But Willie had peached on Connery and the gang to the police. In the actual case Pierce had cheated several of the others in the division of the spoils. He was better covered when the prison sentences were handed out because he planned the crime and the others performed it. The judge in the case angry at how Pierce behaved sentenced his one or two year sentence to solitary confinement  which is very hard on most prisoners. And he served the sentence  he did not escape the police as the film has it.Despite those reservations this is still a grand film to watch.".

The first thing they have to do before thinking of getting on the train full of gold is getting the four keys to open the safe. They manage to do this successfully and they make sure they know the right time to make all the moves to pull it off.

Connery and Sutherland or Butch Connery and the Sutherland Kind make a good double act and while it isn't the most thrilling it is a likable period crime film. Worth watching!".

	schema:headline " A country of many prominent erections";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was based upon a Michael Crichton novel entitled The Great Train Robbery and was known under that title in America. Crichton not only adapted his book for the screen but also directed the resulting film as he had done with two earlier novels Westworld and Coma. In Britain however the extra adjective First was added to emphasise that the film had no connection with the reallife Great Train Robbery of August 1963 when 2.6 million was stolen from a Royal Mail train in Buckinghamshire. That robbery was later to form the subjectmatter of the film Buster. Up until the 1950s the film censors in most countries either forbade or strongly discouraged films which glamorised crime but the relaxation of censorship which started in the 1960s lead to the emergence as a genre of the heist movie. These were films which told the story of a robbery from the viewpoint of the criminals and were generally lighthearted in tone The Thomas Crown Affair and The Italian Job both from the late sixties are good examples. The First Great Train Robbery fits into this category although it was unusual in having a period setting and in being based albeit loosely on a reallife event. The film is set in 1855 and chronicles the theft of a large quantity of gold from the London to Folkestone train. The gold is being taken to Europe in order to pay British troops fighting in the Crimean War. The scheme by which this is accomplished is a complex one but it essentially involves making duplicates of the four separate keys to the safe in which the gold is being transported. The central character is Edward Pierce played by Sean Connery as a sort of amateur gentleman cracksman along the lines of E.W. Hornung's Raffles. Donald Sutherland plays Pierce's workingclass accomplice the pickpocket Robert Agar and a third member of the gang is the burglar Clean Willy Williams played by the dancer Wayne Sleep. Connery may have tired of his bestknown role James Bond but a number of his subsequent movies were in the same actionadventure genre as the Bond films. The First Great Train Robbery follows the same formula as the Bonds mixing suspense and humour in roughly equal proportions. There is even a Victorian Bond girl in the shape of Pierce's beautiful mistress Miriam LesleyAnne Down the sort of girl who habitually wears underwear far more scanty than that we have come to associate with the nineteenth century. There are a number of setpiece suspense scenes such as the one where Willy escapes from Newgate Prison and the one where Pierce has to balance on top of a moving train avoiding being hit whenever the train passes under a bridge. Both Sleep and Connery did their own stunts. Perhaps the best such scene is the one where Pierce and Agar break into the railway company's office to steal a key having timed the night watchman with a stopwatch to find out exactly how long he takes on his lavatory breaks. Most of the humour is slightly bawdy in tone. This is not a serious study of Victorian sexual mores but the film does play on the common twentiethcentury preconception that the Victorians were all either hypocrites or prudes when it came to sex. Thus the seductive Miriam manages to obtain one of the keys from its owner in a brothel and Pierce and a seemingly respectable lady carry on a long conversation full of sexual innuendo. The hidden joke is that the double meanings are only apparent to a modern audience to people in 1855 words such as screwing tools and erections would probably only have had a single nonsexual meaning. Unlike some earlier heist movies such as The Italian Job or The Biggest Bundle of Them All both from about ten years earlier this one does not have an artificially moralistic ending tacked on. Doubtless at some time between the late sixties and the late seventies the old rule that films could not show crooks getting away with it had finally been laid to rest. If one can take its rather relaxed morality about crime and dishonesty The First Great Train Robbery is an agreeable period romp which makes entertaining watching. 610".

It's just fortunate that it turned out to be a clever imaginative actionadventure rather than the dullminded bigbudget exploitations we've had to endure in remakes  sequels in recent years. Conman and cracksman bank robber Edward Pierce aka John Sims Connery masquerades as a sharp businessman to enter a London gentleman's club and scope out a ringflash pull. He settles on the British Army's monthly payroll for the Crimean campaign a shipment of solid gold sent in two special Chubb safes on a guarded railroad car. Much of the film is devoted to the collection of the four keys needed to open the two safes two kept in a very secure railway office one by squarerigged bank President Trent Webb and one by oversexed bank manager Fowler Terris. To do all this  the climactic robbery Sims assembles a colorful crew theater actress Miriam Down who's also his mistress pickpocket  screwsman Agar Sutherland driver  strongarm Barlow Downing and snakesman Clean Willy Sleep in a unique  outstanding role who can reputedly climb a wall of glass. Sutherland has one of his best roles as the gifted safecracker who's both deft and hilariously awkward. Down combines sexiness  funniness as well as Marilyn Monroe ever did  it's an injustice that no one else has ever said so. But there's no match for Connery in a role that was made for him a charming polished gentleman rogue No respectable gentleman is THAT respectable he insists as long on charisma as he is short on honor. Sims will resort to anything even murder to protect his interests  get what he wants but it's impossible to hate him. Instead Connery gives an outlet to the villain in each of us the side that wants to stick it to the Man by robbing a bank or bamboozling the IRS but can't be aired in real life by anything more dastardly than voting Mickey Mouse for President without fear of arrest. Prolific novelist and erstwhile doctor Crichton in his first directorial effort exercises firm control in bringing his own novel to the screen seeming to know exactly what he wants to say  how to say it. Every time it seems that the film is about to lag it somehow just picks up againeven at the very endmaking it difficult to find a place to get a soda  popcorn refill or a bathroom break.

	schema:reviewBody "The First Great Train Robbery is set in Victorian England in 1855 during the Crimean War while Great Britain was at war with Imperial Russia to pay the soldiers 25000 worth of gold is transported to the Crimean Peninsula every month starting at the London branch of the Huddleston and Bradford bank  across England by train in two several inch thick safe's which require four keys to open. Noone has ever robbed a moving train before but suave criminal Edward Pierce Sean Connery  his partner Miriam LesleyAnne Downe comes up with an elaborate  daring plan to do just that. Each of the four keys are stored separately so finding them  copying them is the first thing Edward  his men need to do then the hard work really starts...This British production was written  directed by Michael Critchton based on his own 1975 novel which was simply titled Great Train Robbery apparently the 'First' was added to the title to distance itself from the real great train robbery of the 60's. The film apparently is a fairly accurate adaptation of the novel although the end is changed slightly  a subplot involving a 12 year old prostitute was also dropped. Based on true events that indeed took place in 1855 the film doesn't really strive for historic accuracy  is a crime caper in the mould of The Italian Job 1969 with a charismatic  likable criminal  his gang staging a daring heist to steal lots of gold  a throughly entertaining tale it is too I have to say I liked it a lot. I liked the character's Sean Connery's character in particular is very suave  likable I love the innuendo filled conversation he has with Edgar Trent's wife Donald Sutherland's key maker Agar provides good support although in the book it was he who turned Pierce into the police  there's plenty of colourful Victorian character's to flesh the film out as well. The film has a decent pace although it's not the most incident packed ever made the film has lots of great sequences from the tension filled scenes where they steal  copy the the keys to the exciting climax where Pierce has to make his way across the roof of a speeding train. If you like crime heist films then this is one of the best.Director Crichton does a good job  the film looks splendid with sumptuous Victorian England production design I would expect a lot of time effort  energy was spent on making The First Great Train Robbery look so good. Animal lovers should beware although not in the UK since it's cut because there's a ratting scene where a dog attacks some rats. The film showcase's both the rich splendour of the wealthy inhabitants of Victorian England there's a great scene early on in a mens club where several gents scoff at the idea of women being able to vote  the squalid slums of the poorer inhabitants. There's a great attention to detail throughout including a recreation of a flower show held at Crystal Palace.With a supposed budget of about 6000000 the film is well made throughout with impressive production values  period design. Filmed in Ireland  here in England. The acting is very good with Sean Connery making a very likable villain but one who also has a dark side when needed British ballet dancer Wayne Sleep did all his own stunts including scaling that prison wall while there are numerous other notable faces involved.The First Great Train Robbery wasn't the first by any means but definitely still stands as a great heist film that has eye catching period detail a good solid plot  a great cast. A really good film  it's as simple  straight forward as that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Geoffrey Unsworth's sterling cinematography and Sean Connery's startling stuntwork are the only two worthwhile takeaways from this dodgy period piece that can't decide whether to be a caper comedy a la The Sting or a serious suspense yarn.Edward Pierce Connery is an ostensibly respectable member of 1855 London society who harbors a crooked secret He likes to steal. When he targets a shipment of gold en route via train to the British Army in the Crimea he goes all out enlisting the support of ace safecracker Robert Agar Donald Sutherland to boldly go where no crook has gone before.Well it's an interesting setup anyway. But writerdirector Michael Crichton doesn't do much with it except set up Connery for his big stunt. We see Connery very clearly without benefit of stuntman climb upon a moving train and duck under a series of stone bridges that could have easily decapitated him his only safety measure apparently being the two giant brass counterweights he had nestled in his pants.It's unforgettable viewing yet it doesn't add a thing to the story. We know Pierce is going to make it or the movie would have a different title. So this deathdefying stunt actually manages to become somewhat tedious even with Unsworth's sterling lenswork playing the hulking Connery against a whooshing rural countryside. This is Unsworth's last film and boasts his signature sheen. No one captured the outdoors quite like him.Before they break into the safe Pierce and Agar first need to get four keys requiring three different breakins. Again any suspense here is of the titlerestricted variety. Some attempts at comedy are introduced but don't get much farther than entendres of the double and single variety. Sutherland's Irish accent wouldn't survive a Lucky Charms casting call while thirdbilled LesleyAnne Down flashes her big blues and giggles. Beautiful she is subtle she ain't.A big problem for me was why to root for Pierce and his crew. Most of the film seems bent on making us like them yet they commit some heinous acts to get what they're after. Speaking of heinous why does Crichton subject us to a real scene of a terrier killing rats? It's not like we need it storywise. I guess it's there because Crichton thought it was properly authentic.You do get authentic details in this movie like criminal argot a betty or twirl is a key a crusher is a cop a tightener is a drink a public hanging and a doss house. There's also something called a Bateson's belfry which Crichton apparently made up though at least that works for the story. Crichton was a meticulous researcher who enjoyed ideas but Robbery lacks the energy of his more future oriented yarnspinning. He's working with a real story this time and seems uncharacteristically hemmed in by it.Watching Connery is always worth something but after that train scene I can't help but feel this was nearly at too high a cost. Even though he lived to make other movies it still wasn't worth it.".

	schema:headline " When the man at the top panics the dominoes start to fall!";
	schema:reviewBody "In the aftermath of Watergate a number of conspiracy movies appeared such as this one written by the late Adam Kennedy  based on his novel . Gene Hackman plays exVietnam veteran 'Roy Tucker' a loser who has wound up in prison. He receives visits from Marvin Tagge  Richard Widmark  who claims to represent an organisation designed to assist the wrongly convicted. They offer him freedom and despite distrusting Tagge he accepts. But he brings along a fellow cell mate by the name of Spiventa  Mickey Rooney . Exactly why is hard to see as Spiventa is an irritating little man who drives Tucker mad with persistent talk of sex not what you want to hear when you are behind bars.Tagge's benefactors kill Spiventa before Tucker's astonished eyes. Reunited with wife Ellie  Candice Bergen  and given a new identity  strangely he does not attempt to change his appearance. Shaving off that cheesy moustache would have been a start  he settles down but finds there is a catch  Tagge wants Tucker to do no less than assassinate the President of the United States. He refuses so Tagge has Ellie abducted...I will leave the synopsis here but I am sure you can guess the rest for yourself. The script has enough plot holes to make you want to read the book  neat trick that! . The people Tagge represents are never revealed. The allusions to J.F.K.'s killing are unmistakable. Despite the findings of The Warren Commission the doubt as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone persists to this day.This was Stanley Kramer's first movie in years and while no turkey it lacks the grip of say John Frankenheimer's 'The Manchurian Candidate' or Alan J.Pakula's 'The Parallax View'. Being a leftwing conspiracy movie it tends to skirt around its subject matter instead of getting to grips with it. I prefer rightwing ones myself  they are funnier! 'Domino' has the look and feel of a madeforT.V. movie and boasts what must be the easiest prison escape in movie history not to mention an ending copped from the Michael Caine classic 'Get Carter'.What makes it watchable are Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark. The latter who sadly passed away earlier this year is superb as the mysterious Tagge who initially appears to be behind the operation until he too is ruthlessly eliminated beginning a chain of deaths designed to remove all trace of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot fall  just like dominoes. As Tucker the innocent pawn Hackman is marvellous. You have to wonder though why he chose to hide out in such an obvious place. In his shoes I'd have fled to the other side of the world anywhere to get away from these fanatics. Hackman's love scenes with Bergen slow the plot down and it is almost a relief when she gets snatched. Presumably the producers thought so too which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue setting out the film's entire premise  voiced by British actor Patrick Allen  warning the audience that 'they' are out there and that 'they' are out to get us. Comedian Les Dawson later spoofed this opening in his B.B.C. show 'The Dawson Watch'.Mickey Rooney had earlier worked with Kramer on 'Its A Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad World'. His 'death' scene here resembles like an outtake from that picture with the actor looking as though he has been stung by a wasp rather than shot dead.Conspiracy movies used to be only made by the left but now the right are getting in on the act too. Last year 'Taking Liberties' an absurd concoction of lies and halftruths about Tony Blair's Government turned out to be Britain's answer to 'Reefer Madness'. At least 'Domino' had lovely Candice Bergen. The best Chris Atkins' film could offer was Anne Widdecombe!Surprisingly 'The Domino Principle' was made by Sir Lew Grade the legendary British television mogul behind 'The Saint' 'Jesus Of Nazareth' and 'The Muppet Show'. He worked with Adam Kennedy again in 1980 on 'Raise The Titanic!' whose failure was so great it sank Grade's ambitions of being the new Louis B.Meyer. Being somewhat openminded I would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy.".

They offer him freedom and despite distrusting Tagge he accepts. But he brings along a fellow cell mate by the name of Spiventa  Mickey Rooney . Exactly why is hard to see as Spiventa is an irritating little man who drives Tucker mad with persistent talk of sex not what you want to hear when you are behind bars.Tagge's benefactors kill Spiventa before Tucker's astonished eyes. Reunited with wife Ellie  Candice Bergen  and given a new identity  strangely he does not attempt to change his appearance. Shaving off that cheesy moustache would have been a start  he settles down but finds there is a catch  Tagge wants Tucker to do no less than assassinate the President of the United States. He refuses so Tagge has Ellie abducted...I will leave the synopsis here but I am sure you can guess the rest for yourself. The script has enough plot holes to make you want to read the book  neat trick that! . The people Tagge represents are never revealed. The allusions to J.F.K.'s killing are unmistakable. Despite the findings of The Warren Commission the doubt as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone persists to this day.This was Stanley Kramer's first movie in years and while no turkey it lacks the grip of say John Frankenheimer's 'The Manchurian Candidate' or Alan J.Pakula's 'The Parallax View'. Being a leftwing conspiracy movie it tends to skirt around its subject matter instead of getting to grips with it. I prefer rightwing ones myself  they are funnier! 'Domino' has the look and feel of a madeforT.V. movie and boasts what must be the easiest prison escape in movie history not to mention an ending copped from the Michael Caine classic 'Get Carter'.What makes it watchable are Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark. The latter who sadly passed away earlier this year is superb as the mysterious Tagge who initially appears to be behind the operation until he too is ruthlessly eliminated beginning a chain of deaths designed to remove all trace of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot fall  just like dominoes. As Tucker the innocent pawn Hackman is marvellous. You have to wonder though why he chose to hide out in such an obvious place. In his shoes I'd have fled to the other side of the world anywhere to get away from these fanatics. Hackman's love scenes with Bergen slow the plot down and it is almost a relief when she gets snatched. Presumably the producers thought so too which explains why it opens with a bizarre prologue setting out the film's entire premise  voiced by British actor Patrick Allen  warning the audience that 'they' are out there and that 'they' are out to get us. Comedian Les Dawson later spoofed this opening in his B.B.C. show 'The Dawson Watch'.Mickey Rooney had earlier worked with Kramer on 'Its A Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad World'. His 'death' scene here resembles like an outtake from that picture with the actor looking as though he has been stung by a wasp rather than shot dead.Conspiracy movies used to be only made by the left but now the right are getting in on the act too. Last year 'Taking Liberties' an absurd concoction of lies and halftruths about Tony Blair's Government turned out to be Britain's answer to 'Reefer Madness'. At least 'Domino' had lovely Candice Bergen. The best Chris Atkins' film could offer was Anne Widdecombe!Surprisingly 'The Domino Principle' was made by Sir Lew Grade the legendary British television mogul behind 'The Saint' 'Jesus Of Nazareth' and 'The Muppet Show'. He worked with Adam Kennedy again in 1980 on 'Raise The Titanic!' whose failure was so great it sank Grade's ambitions of being the new Louis B.Meyer. Being somewhat openminded I would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy.";

Hackman asks a lot of questions that NEVER get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere.

The film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it. Kramer's direction is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny movie! The acting is fine with Hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are suitably nasty and Albert is well cast as Widmark's cruel lackey. Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's sidekick. One oddity however is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang. Kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig. It's a role better suited for the likes of Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.".

But the effect if anything would be instead to point out the relative artistic blandness of Kramer's film how the character's dilemma largely fails to illuminate anything meaningful about power and connection or about our own natures at least not in the way it intends to. Gene Hackman plays Tucker languishing in prison with at least fifteen years left on his murder sentence the unnamed organization fronted by Richard Widmark's Tagge offers him freedom a wellfunded new identity and a resurrected relationship with his wife Candice Bergen all in return for unspecified services to be performed later given that the movie starts off by flashing the term Assassination on the screen in several languages the services will be obvious to the viewer at least. It might seem like a simple narrative weakness that of all the available stooges in all the country's prisons the organization chose in Tucker just about the most contrary uncooperative subject imaginable. On the other hand that points to the most intriguing subtextual question  if these guys they're mostly although not exclusively guys are so powerful shouldn't their control on things be tighter removing the need for such expensive drawnout convolutions? In this sense the movie resonates against incomprehensible contemporary theories of the deep state and the like which mainly serve as rather plaintive assertions of if not disguised wishes for dark underlying order even as all the evidence only suggests we're being dragged into increasing global chaos and erosion. Kramer's direction is perhaps a little more fluid than his sticky reputation suggests leaving aside the thumping quasisermon at the start but given such fanciful underpinnings it's all doomed from the first narrative domino.".

	schema:reviewBody "First I bought The Butterfly Effect now The Domino Principle. In both movies the title makes a promise which is not kept in the least. The metaphor signifying that one falling stone brings all the others down has nothing to do with the story. The main character is rather a pawn in a game of chess with no will of its own and part of an unknown scheme concocted by the player. Unfortunately the viewers do not learn much about the scheme either and everything simmers down to blind antigovernment paranoia.The acting is better than the story and there are a few great helicopter scenes. This is possibly the last time Richard Widmark used his insane Tommy Udo laughter in a movie. Eli Wallach has not enough screen time to be more than reliable.

	onyx:emotionText "First I bought The Butterfly Effect now The Domino Principle. In both movies the title makes a promise which is not kept in the least. The metaphor signifying that one falling stone brings all the others down has nothing to do with the story. The main character is rather a pawn in a game of chess with no will of its own and part of an unknown scheme concocted by the player. Unfortunately the viewers do not learn much about the scheme either and everything simmers down to blind antigovernment paranoia.The acting is better than the story and there are a few great helicopter scenes. This is possibly the last time Richard Widmark used his insane Tommy Udo laughter in a movie. Eli Wallach has not enough screen time to be more than reliable.

Quite the contrary simplicity can be precisely the opposite something very good and of great quality. This film is a perfect example of this theory of mine.Being Portuguese myself I saw very few Portuguese movies my whole life  and apparently so most Portuguese people. Many Portuguese people including me don't even dream about the huge amount of Portuguese films that actually exist. Among the very few Portuguese films I saw the majority of them were nothing special. In fact they were more like a longer episode of some boring Portuguese soapopera that could make me yawn like a hippopotamus.But 'Aniki Bob' is different. Here we've got a truly quality Portuguese movie comparable to the finest films of the Golden Age of cinema and one that is really movielike instead of seeming just a longer episode of some soapopera. This movie is something to make us Portuguese proud of our nationality. Actually it's one of the few things that still makes us proud of being Portuguese.I'm not from Porto city and the Portuguese accent in this film is typically Portolike. Might be a little tricky to understand at first or if you're not paying enough attention but with successive viewings it gets much easier to understand but there are always some lines that are hard to catch up with.Being a movie with more children than adults it is about childhood. A kind of childhood you don't see anymore when children were really children lived of dreams and did everything children were supposed to do. The kids are excellent in their performances especially the ones that portray the characters Eduardo Carlitos Batatinhas and Pompeu. Carlitos is the film's nicest kid friendly harmless innocent quiet and shy. Batatinhas is very funny. Eduardo is vain cocky despicable arrogant bratty and annoying yet funny at the same time. These aren't really faults. What's worst is the way he treats Carlitos  he's so mean to him! Pompeu the intellectual boy is hilarious despite or maybe because of his bizarre slowpaced voice. The other favorite characters of mine are grownups the hilarious suspicious shorttempered owner of the shop of temptations Loja das Tentaes and his poor dumb clerk and the impatient teacher. The respective actors's performances are impeccable.The director Manoel de Oliveira is nowadays best known for his age than for his work but he should be reminded at least for this fabulous movie which deserves a round 10. It is extremely simple but immensely charming. It makes you laugh feel good and feel bad like few movies do a clever combination of humor and drama. Cinematography is terrific it does a fine job in showing us the streets of Porto. The music is wonderful. There are a few tense scenes and it also deals with such things as the feeling of sin and guilt. There are some nice and charming old Portuguese vocabularies not used nowadays and a good message Segue sempre por bom caminho that is something like Always do the right thing.Title in Portugal 'Aniki Bb' duh!.".

But the film has adult themes of guilt sin desire and jealousy that pervade the whole story. The film centres around Carlitos an outsider from the main group who attempts to 'buy' his friendship by stealing a doll form the local 'Shop of Temptations'. Once accepted he becomes the object of jealousy from another boy as they are both fighting for the same girl! Accused of revenge after being falsely blamed for an accident the shopkeeper who has been searching for the thief eventually saves Carlitos.The film is beautifully filmed around the director's home town Oporto in Portugal and has a cast almost entirely made up of the local children.

	schema:headline " A rare gem made in Portugal";
	schema:reviewBody "This is about as simple as a movie can be. Yet its simplicity is one of its strengths. This is a Portuguese film spoken in Portuguese language. It's 100 made in Portugal. It was directed by Manoel de Oliveira the world's oldest film director in activity and still doing films even though he is now more than 100 years old. But for someone in such an advanced age he is in very good shape. That and the fact that he still has plans for the future is respectable to say the least.'AnikiBob' is one of his earliest films. It wasn't well received when it came out but time has been kinder to it. Truly a shame that after all these years this wonderful movie is still not available on DVD. The way I see it they're waiting for the director to die to finally do it as a homage in his memory.Our movie takes place in Porto city the director's hometown. Porto has its own symbols such as the Francesinhas the Maria Pia bridge the Port wine and the exlibris Torre dos Clrigos. The movie is masterfully filmed with great sceneries and almost entirely filmed in natural settings.This classic film in black  white is about poor children in the streets of Porto and near the Douro River where they live adventures play games socialize use their imagination and sometimes have conflicts. It's a take on a childhood that has disappeared today being pure poetic human nostalgic charming funny and dramatic.The movie's title comes from a rhyme of a children's game which was already mentioned by one the reviewers here so I won't say it all over again. As for the shop Loja das Tentaes it means Shop of Temptations in Portuguese.Each cast member does a fine portrayal. In fact this movie is almost entirely acted by kids. The kids have different personalities for example Carlitos is shy and reserved Eduardo is naughty and the ruffian one the little kid who is constantly stumbling is confident but they get along well. It's not that they don't have some rivalries at times but there is no swear no major violence and no bad stuff.This film anticipates the Italian neorealism in several ways. It's a small Portuguese masterpiece that should get more credit than it does. Almost everything in this movie works out in perfect harmony despite its simplicity. And I like very much the typical accent from Porto city by the actors and the music in the film. It's difficult to understand at times but with more viewings and if you put the sound louder it's pretty easy to understand.This should definitely be on Top 250.".

The tacked on introduction scene and the obligatory happy ending are indeed laughable when one thinks of what is horrific in this day and age but I was hooked from the surreal credit sequence on. To me the real ending of this film will always be at the burning windmill an ending of an alltoobelievable tragedy.Colin Clive is a little bit overblown as Herr Frankenstein but he does a capable enough job with the title role something that is usually tacked onto the monster instead. Edward Van Sloan a favorite of mine from the Universal stock company does quite well himself as Frankenstein's old teacher Dr. Waldmann. As for Karloff...exhale in admiration what can I say? I first knew him as the narrator and voice of the Grinch in Dr Seus' How the Grinch Stole Christmas I didn't find this out until years later but find out I did. Frankenstein marked the first time that I'd ever seen him on the screen for real. From the stiff walk to the eternally mournful face he made the misunderstood monster his for the ages it is also telling that in spite of this Karloff went on to a long illustrious if underappreciated career. Two other facts that stick in my mind about this movie the creation sequence and the naming of two of it's characters. The heavyindustrial machinery used to create the monster was inspired by the silent Fritz Lang classic Metropolis indeed many films from the original The Mummy and Bride of Frankenstein to Dark City and The Matrix owe a debt to this excellent science fantasy specifically the grafting of Maria's image onto the android. This machinery I am told would later go on to a return engagement in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein. Fact 2 anyone who has read the novel will know that the first name of Frankenstein is Victor and his best friend's Henry. Apparently the play or perhaps the screenplay writers I've no way of knowing switched these two around to where we know have HENRY Frankenstein and VICTOR his best friend.The only thing that has sucked about Frankenstein is its imitators vainly trying to make lightning strike twice pun intended. But don't bet the house on any ever coming close. A hundred years from now this brilliant alternate work will still stand as truly classic as the book that helped to inspire it.".

This was the first of Universal Studios' moody screen adaptations of literary Gothic horror the other being Dracula. Put all thoughts regarding Mary Shelly's novel aside and see this original work of art with Boris Karloff bringing the ultimate monster to life.The sets are a pure spin off of German Expressionism. The good Doctor Frankenstein's castle is twisted and distorted and seems to be not of this world. He is played by Colin Clive in a delightfully freakish performance. And of course the wellproportioned Fritz is there to help. Notice the signposts of evil in the opening grave robbing scenes. It is a propmaster's dream and the black and white photography displays a theatrical sense of spookiness. It's Alive! will live forever as one of the cinema's most familiar lines and the picture begins to sparkle as Karloff is brought to life. The influence of Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS is evident during the dazzling scene of the Monster's birth.Boris Karloff is and always will be the prototypical Monster. The closeups of his face are truly frightening after all these years. He is walking death however Karloff gives him a hint of sadness of a creature who was not meant to be. The flowertoss scene with the little girl was so controversial at the time of the film's release it was cut from many versions. The new restored print available on video has it.I know FRANKENSTEIN has been spoofed many times and is wideopen to criticism regarding its dated look. Mel Brooks went so far as to use the actual props from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory in his hilarious sendup YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. Be sure to keep an open mind and watch it in the dark. Boris Karloff and James Whale have created a monstrously fun film.".

The influence of Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS is evident during the dazzling scene of the Monster's birth.Boris Karloff is and always will be the prototypical Monster. The closeups of his face are truly frightening after all these years. He is walking death however Karloff gives him a hint of sadness of a creature who was not meant to be. The flowertoss scene with the little girl was so controversial at the time of the film's release it was cut from many versions. The new restored print available on video has it.I know FRANKENSTEIN has been spoofed many times and is wideopen to criticism regarding its dated look. Mel Brooks went so far as to use the actual props from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory in his hilarious sendup YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. Be sure to keep an open mind and watch it in the dark. Boris Karloff and James Whale have created a monstrously fun film.";

	schema:headline " Whale's First Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "After having been kicked out of school for his controversial work Dr. Henry Frankenstein Colin Clive has been experimenting with the scientific forces behind the creation and perpetuation of life in his private laboratory. With the aid of his assistant Fritz Dwight Frye Frankenstein finally tries his coup de gracepiecing together human parts to create a new life. When his experiments do not go exactly as planned Frankenstein and his fellow villagers are endangered. Like a few other classics director James Whale's 1931 masterpiece Frankenstein is one of those films that deserves to have every frame analyzed. Unlike most Frankenstein is one of those classics that actually has had almost every frame analyzed. Countless theses and dissertations have been written about the film and its subtexts so I can't imagine that I'd add anything novel along those lines in the space provided here. Instead I'll take a brief look at some of the more straightforward aspects of Frankenstein that in my view contribute to its masterpiece status. The opening of the film has a very hefty dose of atmosphere which continues more or less throughout its length. Although it was obviously filmed in a studiothe sky is a painted backdrop complete with wrinkles this fact actually adds to the atmosphere of the film even lending a slight surrealism. There is no score to speak of aside from the music playing during the titles but the sounds that occur are just as effective such as the ringing bell during the opening. There are also a lot of subtle visuals and some merely subtly effective such as the grim reaper at end of a long panning shot in the beginning of the film. The seriousness and realism of the gravedigging scene complete with Henry Frankenstein throwing dirt at the grim reaper is beautiful foreshadowing. As in the rest of the film there is nothing jokey about this situation. Watch how effectively the actors convey a sense of toiling and franticness how they convey the weight of the coffin. This is a curious fact about the film overall. Although the material is relatively melodramatic and occasionally extremely so especially in the case of Henry Frankenstein the performances always come across as serious and realistic rather than campy with the possible exception of a single snarling growl from the monster when he encounters Elizabeth Frankenstein's bridetobe. Contrast this to how Tod Browning's Dracula plays in the present day. In that film Lugosialthough I love his performancedoes come across as occasionally campy especially in the closeups of his hypnotically staring eyes. Even the one character that is meant to give some light comic relief that of Frankenstein's father Baron Frankenstein Frederick Kerr is comic only in that the character is a bit sarcastic with a dry sense of humor. As such Kerr portrays the Baron seriously also.The production and set design as in the sequel Bride of Frankenstein 1935 adds volumes to the atmosphere and beauty of the film. The interior of the watchtower where Frankenstein's private laboratory is located is reminiscent of German expressionist films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 1920 and they both contrast and cohere wonderfully with the more symmetrical rightangled lab equipment constructed by Kenneth Strickfaden.Because there is no score the actors have no help in amping up the emotions in their performances. Despite this rarely has either Boris Karloff's monster or Colin Clive's mad doctor been matched. Whale helps with some ingenious shots and sequences such as the progressive closeups when we first see the monster. He also gives us a number of stagelike devices that work remarkably well such as the pans through cutaways in the set that in the film's world do not really exist. Interestingly Whale has still had the cutaways decorated as if they are extant in the film's world. Although they may seem dated now Whale's technique of fading to black between scenes also amplifies the sense of literary chapters in the story and gives an effective ambiguous sense of time passage between the scenes.Whale also achieves some wonderful more understated scenes of horror in the film often set up by contrasts. For example the severe contrast of the villager walking into the wedding party with his daughter and the surreal bucolic adventure of the villagers working their way through the countryside to find the monster. Many younger viewers might have a difficult time watching Frankenstein if they are not used to black  white slower paced understated films with a different approach to acting. These classics are an acquired taste for younger generations but of course it's a taste worth acquiring.".

Much of the credit for this goes to director James Whale who by all accounts was deeply influenced by silent German film and his own traumatic experiences during World War Iand who mixed those elements with occasional flourishes of macabre humor to create a remarkably consistent vision of Mary Shelly's original novel.Whale was extremely extremely fortunate in his cast. Colin Clive was a difficult actor but Whale not only managed to get him through the film but to draw from him his finest screen performance Mae Clarke is a memorable Elizabeth and Dwight Frye so memorable in Dracula tops himself as Fritz. But all eyes here are on Boris Karloff as the monster. Karloff had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade and although he appeared in quite a few films before FRANKENSTEIN he never really registered with the public. But in this role acting under heavy makeup weighed down by lead weights in his shoes and struts around his legs and without a line of intelligible dialogue he offered a performance that transcended the word monster. This is a suffering being dangerous mainly through innocence of his own power and the way of the world goaded from disaster to disaster to disaster. Even some seventyplus years later it is difficult to imagine any other actor in the part.Karloff would play the monster again in two later films one of them directed by Whale but although THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a remarkable film in its own right this is the original combination of talents and the original vision.

Done in 1931 fully black and white this amazingly creepy tale still bears the marks of a genuine masterpiece. Having withstood the tests of time I find this brilliantly directed portrayal just as darkly enchanting as I did 30 years ago. It is hard to believe that it has been over 70 years since this wonderful production was first released but that not withstanding it is a hauntingly beautiful disturbingly tragic work of pure genius which is still just as compelling today as it was when it was made.In my opinion this is also Karloff's best work. In this desensitized society I feel honored and humbled to be able to view a movie of this caliber. When it was released it was the scariest thing to be put on film. Today there are gore effects CGI and a plethora of other mediums with which to shock and amaze us. Soon the makeup artists of old will be wholly lost to the industry. If for no other reason we should cherish these classics. Witness the industry when true artisans plied their crafts.The casting of Karloff in this part was the epitome of ideal casting. There was no other actor at that time who could have contributed to this role the darkling charm which Karloff demonstrated through this character. Of all the remakes done of this classic I still favor the original work. The only remake which contains even the smallest degree of the magic of this original was the 1974 Mel Brooks parody Young Frankenstein.I love this movie and even by today's standards it still rates a 9.110 from...the Fiend .".

	schema:reviewBody "Revisiting Frankenstein is always a wonderful experience. I watch it today with the same enthusiasm and awe I did nearly 35 years ago. Everything about the film is so perfect. Acting direction cinematography set design plot dialogue special effects etc. are top notch. And although each of these areas deserves to be discussed in detail and have in the volumes that have been written on Frankenstein I'll focus on two areas that really standout to me  Boris Karloff as the monster and James Whales direction.Is there a more iconic image in horror than Boris Karloff as the Frankenstein monster? I sincerely doubt it. Even those who wouldn't be caught dead watching a horror film are familiar with that image. Beyond Jack Pierce's makeup Karloff is amazing in the role. Even with the makeup Karloff gives the monster life. We are able to see and feel the emotions the monster goes through. There is no better example than the scene with the monster and the little girl. As the monster stumbles out of the woods there is a cautious look about him as his experiences with humans have thus far been less than satisfactory. But when the little girl accepts him and wants to play with him the look of caution is transformed into a look of utter happiness. He smiles he laughs and he plays. But that emotion is replaced by one of confusion mixed with anger when he accidentally kills the girl. It's all there on Karloff wonderful face. It's this life that Karloff imbibes in the monster that makes Frankenstein a real classic.I've always thought that James Whale's direction was ahead of its time. In an era when directors were using what I call the plant and shoot method of filming Whale made his camera a fluid part of the action. Whale takes the viewer beyond just watching moving images. He uses the camera to take the viewer into the scene. A small example is the way Whale filmed characters moving from one room to the next. The camera moves with the characters. Another example is the tracking shot Whale uses as the father carries his dead child into the town. As I said earlier it has a fluidity in the way Whale filmed these scenes that makes it seem more natural. Finally the way Whale introduces the monster is a highlight of the film. The monster backs into the room. As he turns Whale shows the monster with three quick ever tighter shots ending with a closeup of the monster's face. Every Hollywood star of that era could have only wished for an introduction like that.While I have done nothing but praise Frankenstein I'm not such a fan that I can't spot flaws in the film. The major issue with me has always been the way the scenes of action horror and violence are intercut with scenes of tranquility and bliss. I realize that was the way things were done in the 30s so people wouldn't in essence overload on horror but it can make the film seem a little disjointed. But it's difficult to hold Whale overly responsible for this custom of the period.".

	schema:headline " A film just as tragically misunderstood as it's monster.";
	schema:reviewBody "While certainly leagues ahead of Browning's Dracula Whale's Frankenstein still creaks aplenty and in comparison to it's two sequels it looks primitive indeed and yet....of all the Universal horrors this is the most compelling and timeless.I find it ironic how in discussions of the Frankenstein legend this film is often considered as just a footnote only worth discussing for the influence it had on physical depictions of the monster and dismissed in favor of Branagh's adaption or Fisher's excellent Curse of Frankenstein. The rationale is often that those versions are more faithful to the book. But I disagree and if you care to read I'll explain why.I will admit firsthand that Branagh's film follows the PLOT of the novel with minimal changes however I feel that the changes despite their minimal size are detrimental to the novel's SPIRIT. And although I will proudly praise Fisher's version He seems to be less concerned with focusing on the novel's themes than he is with his F the rich subplot he includes in all his movies. Whale's version discards the plot but creates an excellent abstract adaption that drives home the novel's themes better than anyone else has with the exception of Frankenstein The True Story and Fisher's Frankenstein must be Destroyed. One big complaint is how Karloff's Monster isn't as sympathetic as the novel's Monster pure tripe in my opinion.If anything Karloff's portrayal is MORE sympathetic than the book's Creature. Critics say that's impossible because the Creature is given a criminal brain by Fritz but that would only be a valid argument if he was shown to be violent solely for that reason and he isn't. First abnormal brain of the typical criminal could mean anything given the period's beliefs perhaps the man in question was mentally ill or had killed in selfdefense or was a minority of some sort. But Karloff's Monster does not turn violent for no reason he does for flimsy reasons but reason's nonetheless excusable because he's so stupid he walks backward and doesn't know people can drown. The creature is provoked by the sadistic Fritz reacts angrily is taunted then attacks. Frankenstein unwilling to take responsibility has the creature locked away to be disciplined by Fritz. The creature kill's Fritz and breaks loose. And even then his murders are in selfdefense or accidents. The book's Creature goes through similar persecutionlikely but left ambiguous because it's told in flashback but commits murder out of jealousy and to prove points to COMPLETE innocents. Add the fact that the creature in the book understands the consequences and feels no remorse until later it becomes clear that monster or not he's a controlfreak sociopath like Ted Bundy. The creature of the film is more like a retarded child who lashes out at bullies. The novel's creature kidnaps a child to make him my companionplenty of childabductors who are not pedophiles do the same thing in real life then gleefully kills him when he learns he is Frankenstein's brother and frames a servant girl for the murder. In contrast the film's Creature gently plays with a little girl but accidentally drowns her and dies at the hands of a mob who really DON'T have any proof he's guilty in a scene reminiscent of both a Klan lynching and Christ's crucifixion. Yeah what an 'unsympathetic' character in comparison to the bookRolls eyes.Both characters are unpredictable and dangerous but does Karloff's Creature really come off as unsympathetic just because he doesn't talk endlessly like the novel's monster? Would you rather pity the equivalent of Ted Bundy because he can talk rather than the equivalent of Lenny from Of Mice  Men because he cannot? I also want to point out how name change and assistant aside Colin Clive's portrayal of Frankenstein comes closer personality wise than any others. Clive is criticized for his hammy It's Alive! line but in the novel Frankenstein raves like that for SEVERAL CHAPTERS. This film doesn't take the easy way out by making Frankenstein into a monsterhunting heroBranagh or into a 19th century Lex LuthorFisher he's like Shelley's portrayal basically wellmeaning and fully blessed with all any man could want but secretive callous neglectful and unwilling to see consequences until it's either too late or too early. I think Clive's otherwise restrained portrayal fares better than Branagh's who overacts It's Alive style in EVERY scene. The fact that Karloff inspires more fear and more pity with a few grunts than De Niro does in Branagh's whole movie is also telling.So what exactly is the problem with Whale's film? It features the most spiritually accurate Dr. Frankenstein ever drives home the themes of the plot better than any other version the accusation that the monster is unsympathetic is horse ca ca since he's more sympathetic than he is in the actual novel so what's to hate? The best answer is to visit the comments section for this movie under hated and the comment's under loved for Branaghs. 99.9 of the complaints are by children who hate it because it's an old movie in black  white or who make homophobic comment's about James Whalewho was gay. The people who like the Branagh movie mostly just love it because it's in color or because they are teenage English lit fan girls who think Branagh is hot and any movie with attractive leads HAS to be better right? If they say they like it because it's more faithful they are lying because they never read it or did read it but didn't like it and therefore have no right to demand fidelity to source material they didn't like themselves.This movie isn't perfect but of the 3 films I've cited as being the best spiritual adaptations it's the best. Simply it's the greatest Frankenstein movie ever made as of now.".

	onyx:emotionText "While certainly leagues ahead of Browning's Dracula Whale's Frankenstein still creaks aplenty and in comparison to it's two sequels it looks primitive indeed and yet....of all the Universal horrors this is the most compelling and timeless.I find it ironic how in discussions of the Frankenstein legend this film is often considered as just a footnote only worth discussing for the influence it had on physical depictions of the monster and dismissed in favor of Branagh's adaption or Fisher's excellent Curse of Frankenstein. The rationale is often that those versions are more faithful to the book. But I disagree and if you care to read I'll explain why.I will admit firsthand that Branagh's film follows the PLOT of the novel with minimal changes however I feel that the changes despite their minimal size are detrimental to the novel's SPIRIT. And although I will proudly praise Fisher's version He seems to be less concerned with focusing on the novel's themes than he is with his F the rich subplot he includes in all his movies. Whale's version discards the plot but creates an excellent abstract adaption that drives home the novel's themes better than anyone else has with the exception of Frankenstein The True Story and Fisher's Frankenstein must be Destroyed. One big complaint is how Karloff's Monster isn't as sympathetic as the novel's Monster pure tripe in my opinion.If anything Karloff's portrayal is MORE sympathetic than the book's Creature. Critics say that's impossible because the Creature is given a criminal brain by Fritz but that would only be a valid argument if he was shown to be violent solely for that reason and he isn't. First abnormal brain of the typical criminal could mean anything given the period's beliefs perhaps the man in question was mentally ill or had killed in selfdefense or was a minority of some sort. But Karloff's Monster does not turn violent for no reason he does for flimsy reasons but reason's nonetheless excusable because he's so stupid he walks backward and doesn't know people can drown. The creature is provoked by the sadistic Fritz reacts angrily is taunted then attacks. Frankenstein unwilling to take responsibility has the creature locked away to be disciplined by Fritz. The creature kill's Fritz and breaks loose. And even then his murders are in selfdefense or accidents. The book's Creature goes through similar persecutionlikely but left ambiguous because it's told in flashback but commits murder out of jealousy and to prove points to COMPLETE innocents. Add the fact that the creature in the book understands the consequences and feels no remorse until later it becomes clear that monster or not he's a controlfreak sociopath like Ted Bundy. The creature of the film is more like a retarded child who lashes out at bullies. The novel's creature kidnaps a child to make him my companionplenty of childabductors who are not pedophiles do the same thing in real life then gleefully kills him when he learns he is Frankenstein's brother and frames a servant girl for the murder.

If a person wants a film version that follows Mary Shelley's novel to the letter but is still a classic piece of cinema and is chillingatmospheric and memorable then one should see the film Terror Of Frankenstein.Producer Calvin Floyd made it and it is a great version of the novel and a film that is neither boring or suffering from a star's ego to tell his version of the story as was Kenneth Brannagh's film which is not the masterpiece that it and a variety of uninformed other's have claimed it to be.Universal's Frankenstein1931 is an amazing film to see.It is uniquely it's own version of the tale of a medical student who is not a doctor but is a scientist on his own misguided quest to create life from the dead.Colin Clive is Baron Henry Frankenstein who has chosen to break any ties that he had with the medical school where he had attended.In this writer's opinion Colin Clive is Baron Frankenstein and he's ideal as the reasonably mad scientist.Also this writer prefers Frankenstein's first name being changed to Henry for this film and for the entire Universal series.How sad that Clive would only live to the age of 37 and expire in 1937.Boris Karloff is the Frankenstein Monster.James WhaleBoris Karloff and makeup magician Jack Pierce are all responsible for one of the all time greatest movie monsters ever to show his pathetic face on the silver screen!The Universal version of the Frankenstein Monster with Boris Karloff portraying the part made me feel that way back as a child I was seeing Frankenstein's Monster actually alive on film for the first time.It is still a superb sight to see even to this day more than 30 years later! From the very beginning of Frankensteinwe are shown the blackwhite and gray images of death as Baron Henry Frankenstein and his hunchbacked assistant FritzDwight Frye steal bodies from newly buried graves and roadside gallows. Henry Frankenstein takes these corpses to his laboratory which is in the top of an old stone watchtower.Frankenstein tells his former teacherEdward Van Sloan that he has ...found the ray that had first brought life into this world and in his laboratory's machinery he has harnassed it to bring his creature to life!It is Henry Frankenstein who declaresbefore he brings his creation to lifethatThat body is not dead.It has never lived.After the creature has been brought to life and has been presumably living in the dungeon of this ancient watchtower that we first see the immortal first images of The Frankenstein Monster.Karloff's monster is gigantic in size with a flat head a bolt sticking out of either side of his necka neanderthal like brow that looms over his 2 eyes which have dark circles under them and eyelids that droop so far over his eyes that he appears to be only half alive.This Monster is a pitiful child who tries to grab for light when it's first cast upon him and is afraid of fire when the sadistic Fritz cruelly tortures him with it. This performance of Boris Karloff proves that he was one of the greatest actors that ever lived along with Spencer TracyGene HackmanAl PacinoEdward G.

	schema:reviewBody "As I'm sure fans of this movie are aware 2006 marks the 75th anniversary of the release of this timeless classic. I'm not sure of the exact release date I'm pretty sure it was sometime in November 1931 but it's a testament to the film's quality that it's still held in such high regard seven and a half decades after its initial release. I wasn't born until 1979 and didn't see the movie until 1997 but it still blew me away. I've seen it dozens of times since and I never get bored with it.What makes this film so good? It's not particularly scary to a modern audience but it still possesses a charm that belies its age and while many regard Bride of Frankenstein as superior you can't have a sequel without the original can you? The thing about Frankenstein is that unlike the 1931 Dracula which is rather static and stagy both technically and in terms of acting I'm surprised that Universal were able to reuse so many of the sets in later productions given that Bela Lugosi Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye all seem intent on not just chewing the scenery but devouring it Frankenstein possesses remarkable depth and subtlety.Volumes have been written about Boris Karloff's performance as the monster and it is truly mesmerising but credit must also go to the remarkable supporting cast and foremost among these is Colin Clive who was actually the star of the film and not the thenunknown Karloff. Clive gives a superb performance as Henry Frankenstein illustrating the character's obsessive side without ever losing touch with his essential humanity. Clive was sadly a reallife Jekyll and Hyde he was an alcoholic and in Frankenstein he reconciles the two conflicting aspects of the doctor's personality perfectly.Dwight Frye as Frankenstein's assistant Fritz is also excellent portraying the odd little hunchback with just the right sinister touch. Frye had played another oddity Renfield in Dracula and he once again balances the differing sides of his character well going from fear of the monster to tormenting him sadistically which costs him dear eventually.Edward Van Sloan's Doctor Waldman may not be as entertaining as Ernest Thesiger's wonderfully camp Doctor Praetorius in Bride but he leads the proceedings an air of authority his rational approach providing a good counterbalance to Frankenstein's madness. John Boles and Mae Clarke as Victor Moritz and Elizabeth are not as showy and Boles is rather bland note that the character did not reappear in Bride but they are fairly likable and inoffensive. Frederick Kerr gives a wonderfully blustering performance as Henry's father and Lionel Belmore is good as the burgomaster his argument with Kerr is quite amusing but the real highlight is of course Karloff as the monster.Whereas later Frankenstein monsters had a tendency to be somewhat robotic which is why Karloff stop playing the character after Son of Frankenstein Karloff's performance is remarkable for the humanity he invests in the character something that never disappears under Jack Pierce's iconic makeup job. The important point is that Karloff plays the creature as an innocent more sinned against than sinning. Although the monster does kill and kidnap he does so not out of a sense of malice but rather because he lacks the intelligence to do any better his brain is after all a criminal one. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the scene with Marilyn Harris' Little Maria the way Karloff plays the monster's changing moods from happy innocent to horrified when he realises the girl does not float like the flowers is unforgettable.Frankenstein is memorable not only for its acting but also its technical and visual aspects. The set design is superb from the spooky tower where Frankenstein conducts his experiments with its Kenneth Strickfadendesigned machines full of sound and fury to the burning windmill at the end but the real credit has to go to director James Whale who took over a project rejected by Bela Lugosi and featuring a mediocre script and turned it into one of the greatest movies of all time. The original script had the monster as nothing more than a savage beast which is why Lugosi turned it down but under Whale it was extensively reworked with the pathos and humanity that have made it a classic added. Although Frankenstein was not the first Universal horror movie without it there wouldn't be the term Universal Horror just a stagy vampire movie starring a rather hammy Hungarian. Because Frankenstein confirmed that audiences had a taste for this type of movie it opened the floodgates for virtually every other scary movie made since 1931. While this may be a mixed blessing at least we have this brilliant movie and that makes up for all the dross in the world.".

The important point is that Karloff plays the creature as an innocent more sinned against than sinning. Although the monster does kill and kidnap he does so not out of a sense of malice but rather because he lacks the intelligence to do any better his brain is after all a criminal one. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the scene with Marilyn Harris' Little Maria the way Karloff plays the monster's changing moods from happy innocent to horrified when he realises the girl does not float like the flowers is unforgettable.Frankenstein is memorable not only for its acting but also its technical and visual aspects. The set design is superb from the spooky tower where Frankenstein conducts his experiments with its Kenneth Strickfadendesigned machines full of sound and fury to the burning windmill at the end but the real credit has to go to director James Whale who took over a project rejected by Bela Lugosi and featuring a mediocre script and turned it into one of the greatest movies of all time. The original script had the monster as nothing more than a savage beast which is why Lugosi turned it down but under Whale it was extensively reworked with the pathos and humanity that have made it a classic added. Although Frankenstein was not the first Universal horror movie without it there wouldn't be the term Universal Horror just a stagy vampire movie starring a rather hammy Hungarian. Because Frankenstein confirmed that audiences had a taste for this type of movie it opened the floodgates for virtually every other scary movie made since 1931. While this may be a mixed blessing at least we have this brilliant movie and that makes up for all the dross in the world.";

	schema:headline " A Monster We Can Feel Sorry For";
	schema:reviewBody "Of all the monsters constructed out of the human imagination I can't imagine one more sympathetic than Frankenstein's monster. In fact I have trouble even thinking of him as a monster. Instead he surely must be Frankenstein's creature or Frankenstein's creation. It's the sympathetic nature of the creature that gives the movie it's greatest power  it's perhaps the only monster movie I can think of where I feel sorry for the actual monster true one feels sorry for the afflicted people who become werewolves but not for the actual werewolf. Think about this poor creature. After his creation by Henry Frankenstein Colin Clive he is by Frankenstein's own admission kept isolated and in darkness and his only regular companionship seems to have been from the hunchback Fritz Dwight Frye  Frankenstein's assistant who takes great delight in tormenting the creature with torches and whips. Under the circumstances could the creature have been expected to turn out to be a ballet dancer? This movie is both a social worker's and a psychologist's delight. The social worker will see in the creature a classic depiction of an abused child for that's what the creature was  as Frankenstein himself put it he didn't give life back to the dead this body had never lived in its new form it was in fact a child. For the psychologist there's a study of obsession in Frankenstein who it seems to me gives up on his creature altogether too easily and Fritz is a wonderful character from the psychological perspective a man probably tormented and ridiculed and abused all his life who suddenly  when the opportunity presents itself  becomes the tormenter abuser and ridiculer. But the creature is always an object of sympathy. When he killed Fritz I thought good for him! When he killed the little girl Maria Marilyn Harris it's clearly portrayed as a dreadful accident  he was playing with her but he was too strong for her. When the windmill breaks out in flames how can one not empathize with the creature's terror? And yet  in the powerful sympathetic portrayal of the creature also lies the story's greatest weakness. After constructing the body from the parts of dead bodies and I must confess that I wondered when Frankenstein lifted the creature's hand  before it was brought to life  and proudly exclaimed no decay I wondered why? It certainly didn't look like there was a refrigerated morgue in that place to keep the body fresh! Frankenstein sends Fritz to a local medical school to steal a brain. Great play is made from the fact that the brain Fritz came back with was a criminal's brain  an evil one from a violent man as Dr. Waldman Edward Van Sloan described it. We're clearly to think that the evil brain was somehow responsible for the creature turning out this way but that was inconsistent with everything else portrayed here. Here we find an early example of nature vs. nurture. I never thought that the havoc wreaked by the creature was because of its brain. The creature didn't have an evil nature it was the way it was because of the way it was nurtured. The whole evil brain story underlying the monster's actions seemed to me to weaken the story.Boris Karloff was magnificent as the creature. In a voiceless role aside from a few growls he managed to portray a huge range of emotions confusion anger fear rage playfulness excitement panicstricken terror just to name a few. Edward Van Sloan as Dr. Waldman offered what I thought was his best performance in the Universal monster movie collection  at least of those I've seen. Dr. Waldman seemed more rounded and certainly more emotional than Van Helsing in Dracula or Muller in The Mummy. Clive did a good job of portraying two sides of Frankenstein  the obsessed scientist who wants to play God and the repentant one who wants nothing more than to turn the clock back and Mae Clarke was pretty good as his fianc Elizabeth. The only disappointment in performances was that of Dwight Frye as Fritz. After a brilliant performance as Renfield in Dracula I didn't think he really captured this role.Two scenes stay with me from this movie. Maria's death  which clearly the creature didn't mean to happen  and the panicked creature trapped in the burning windmill. I'd have liked the movie to have ended with that scene actually. So  great performances but the issue of the brain left me a little cold and detracted from the best and most meaningful issue raised by the story. All in all  710".

It certainly didn't look like there was a refrigerated morgue in that place to keep the body fresh! Frankenstein sends Fritz to a local medical school to steal a brain. Great play is made from the fact that the brain Fritz came back with was a criminal's brain  an evil one from a violent man as Dr. Waldman Edward Van Sloan described it. We're clearly to think that the evil brain was somehow responsible for the creature turning out this way but that was inconsistent with everything else portrayed here. Here we find an early example of nature vs. nurture. I never thought that the havoc wreaked by the creature was because of its brain. The creature didn't have an evil nature it was the way it was because of the way it was nurtured. The whole evil brain story underlying the monster's actions seemed to me to weaken the story.Boris Karloff was magnificent as the creature. In a voiceless role aside from a few growls he managed to portray a huge range of emotions confusion anger fear rage playfulness excitement panicstricken terror just to name a few. Edward Van Sloan as Dr. Waldman offered what I thought was his best performance in the Universal monster movie collection  at least of those I've seen. Dr. Waldman seemed more rounded and certainly more emotional than Van Helsing in Dracula or Muller in The Mummy. Clive did a good job of portraying two sides of Frankenstein  the obsessed scientist who wants to play God and the repentant one who wants nothing more than to turn the clock back and Mae Clarke was pretty good as his fianc Elizabeth. The only disappointment in performances was that of Dwight Frye as Fritz. After a brilliant performance as Renfield in Dracula I didn't think he really captured this role.Two scenes stay with me from this movie. Maria's death  which clearly the creature didn't mean to happen  and the panicked creature trapped in the burning windmill. I'd have liked the movie to have ended with that scene actually. So  great performances but the issue of the brain left me a little cold and detracted from the best and most meaningful issue raised by the story. All in all  710";

Okay the modern viewer has to try and watch it without jaded and cynical eyes and take it in its historical context to really appreciate it but that isn't difficult.  The acting is often hokey the special effects which were astonishing 70 years ago may look a little primitive by our standards and the movie isn't anywhere near as terrifying to us as it was to 1930s movie audiences but even so I can't see how anyone can not LOVE this movie! Director James Whale was a lot more sophisticated and original than Todd Browning and as much as I enjoy 'Dracula' 'Frankenstein' is a much better movie and the best from this era not counting its brilliant sequel 'Bride Of Frankenstein' which to mind mind actually surpasses it. Talented character actors Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye both from 'Dracula' reappear in different but similar roles and Colin Clive is fine as Henry Frankenstein the prototype mad scientist but the real star of the show and the main reason this movie has lived for so many years is the utterly superb performance by the legendary Boris Karloff as The Monster. I think Karloff is amazing in this and doesn't get the respect he deserves because many dismiss it as just a horror movie. 'Frankenstein' is one of the most important and influential movies ever made and is one movie I NEVER tire of no matter how many times I watch it and James Whale is one of the most underrated directors of all time looking at his innovative work in this 'The Invisible Man' and especially 'Bride Of Frankenstein' the greatest sequel in the history of motion pictures.

Although the school's directress Madame Blanc Joan Bennett welcomes her warmly she is unsettled by her aide Nazified teacher Miss Tanner Alida Valli as well as several mysterious student disappearances. When her new friend Sara Stefania Casini is the latest to vanish Susy begins her own investigation of the academy. Filmed in bright lurid Technicolor and accompanied by a thundering soundtrack by Goblin Suspiria is a nightmarecometolife. The performances of Harper Bennett and especially Valli like Bennett a major star of the Golden Age are solid as is the unrelentingly creepy atmosphere. Also on display are two especially gruesome murders which happen near the beginning of the film. Argento later said that he modeled the look of the film directly on Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and indeed the similarities are apparent. Suspiria may not always make perfect sense plot wise but it's a thrilling rollercoaster ride through what may very well be Hell.

It turns out its run by a witches coven and they'll kill anybody who threatens them...That's about it for plot. There IS a plot but it jumps all over the place...but it doesn't matter. This movie is fascinating just to look at and hear it. The settings are truly bizarre and done in eyepopping color. They're complimented by the excellent use of color and lighting. Also the group Goblin contributes to it a downright terrifying and LOUD score which really starts to work on you. The murder scenes are graphicVERY graphic. The opening double murder is shocking and bloody. There are many great sequences that you just look at in wonder HOW this was done. My favorite is when Sarah Stefania Casini is being stalked through the academy late at night by an unseen evil force.Director Dario Argento has made a true masterpiece of horror. Its short on plot but the visuals and music more than make up for any of its drawbacks. The acting is goodespecially by Joan Bennett obviously enjoying herself and Alida Valli who just LOOKS scary...especially those teeth of hers. Harper is also very good considering she was acting opposite people who didn't speak English! The poor dubbing is a little distracting but this is still a horror masterpiece. A mustsee. TRY to see it in a theatre.".

One day at nine in the morning she left Kennedy airport New York and arrived in Germany at 1040 p.m. local time. Those are the opening lines of Suspiria as spoken by the narrator. Those lines are the beginning of a must see experience for all horror fans... period.Dario Argento has to be one of the most talented directors in Italian film history. He was influenced by some of the greatest directors in cinema including Alfred Hitchcock. Dario Argento did it all with Suspria. Suspria breaks all the barriers. Not only is it completely nightmarish and bazaar but it uses different colors of light in a brilliant chilling way. Suspiria has some of the most memorable scenes in history whether it be the first shocking murder the dog biting the man's neck or the very good ending which will have your eyes glued to the screen. One of the most nightmarish aspects of Suspiria is the overthetop creepy music that it offers. When Goblin performs music for a movie that should be instant indication that the movie will be very tense experience. The tension and suspense in Suspiria is built up by the music.Gore hounds will not be disappointed by Suspiria. Keep in mind I said won't be disappointed not be impressed. Suspiria has enough gore to be realalistic but not enough to impress. However people who watch Suspiria shouldn't watch it for the gore they should watch it for the haunting atmosphere and tension.Suspiria was shot in Italy therefore if you are watching the movie in an English language you will find that it is dubbed. This may very well be the only reason I found the dialoge in Suspiria to be fairly average. The dubbed audio didn't fit very well but it isn't beyond terrible.The only con of Suspiria is the fact that it seems to be dragged out. However this hardly hurts the film in anyway and is almost unnoticeable to first time viewers. The first time I viewed Suspiria will be a experience I will not forget.I highly recommend Suspiria to every eurohorror fan out there.

	schema:headline " Amazing Colors with Intense Murders";
	schema:reviewBody "Suspiria1977 is given its cult status in the USA partialy due to the extreme usage of colors.  The colors in Suspiria1977 gives it an artful flavor that makes the movie beautiful to watch.  Argento uses the colors of blue green red and yellow in an unique manner.  The director uses the old technicolor technique that was in use during the 1950s.  This aspect gives the movie a fairy tale appearence.In the first 20 minutes Dario Argento wanted to build up suspense and tension that was normally reserved for the climax of a film.  The main character and story are built up in good fashion.  The shoots of Suzy Bannion inside the taxi cab gives the viewer a feeling of claustrophobia and dread.  The image and music in the opening moments add high voltage suspense to the film's pounding intensity level.  The shots through the woods are fabulously done.The double murder sequence is one of the most bloody scenes in modern horror films.  It still retains its shock value after twenty four years. This one sequence makes any murder scene in a teen horror film today look tame. The only murder sequence from an Argento film to match this in its brutality is the arm removal scene in Tenebre1982.  The murder of the first victim is extremely violent and yet stylishly filmed.Dario Argento owes his debt in making Suspiria to the early animations of Walt Disney and the art of Jean Cocteau.  The main source of influence is the Disney film of Snow White  the Seven Dwarfs.  The Snow White film would influence many Italian horror movie makers because of the impression it made on them as a child.  The story of Suspiria1977 was to originally take place in a children's school.  This was changed because of the possible controversies this would cause in the film community of Italy.In filming the murder scenes the director wanted to pump them with intense horror that wouldn't let up.  He wanted to create scenes of fear that would be carried by its gory visuals and ear pounding music.  The murder scenes in the motion picture are given their own personal style. On doing this film and these murder scenes Argento has saidFear is a 370 degree centigrade body temperature.  With Suspiria I wanted 400 degrees.  The murder sequences are one of the main things that make the film a gem of a horror movie.Suspiria1977 adds some movie lore to witchcraft mythology.  The movie looks at the mythology of witches and witchcraft with keen interest.  Its one of the best films on the subject of witches.  Argento was fascinated by the subject of witches and used that fascination to make Suspiria1977. Another source of influence is a section from the Thomas De Quincey's drug induced fantasy essay Confessions of an Opium Eater called Suspiria De Profundis.Daria Nicolodi gives an important contribution in co writing the screenplay. Suspiria is the only film where Daria Nicolodi had creative imput on an Argento flick.  Part of the film was inspired by Nicolodi telling Argento about her Grandmother's experiences at a finishing school where black magic was practriced during the late hours of the night.  Daria Nicolodi was to play Sara Suzy's friend but got injured during shooting.  The story is there to give structure to the visuals  music.The death of Daniel the blind piano player is set up with suspense.  The scene takes an unexpected turn when he is attacked by his own dog.  This is because the scene at its opening points to him being killed by a witch. Dario Argento along with cameraman Luciano Tovoli uses complex camera movement to make this scene work.  This scene must have impressed Lucio Fulci when he saw the film that he would play homage to it in The Beyond1981.There has been a great debate among Argento fans on whether Deep Red1975 or Suspiria1977 is the director's masterpiece.  Some see Suspiria1977 as the masterpiece in the film cannon of Dario Argento.  Others regard Deep Red1975 as his true masterpiece.  In my opinion Tenebre1982 is the masterpiece of Dario Argento because its complete in motifs that were seen in his films up to that point.  Deep Red1975 and Suspiria1977 are Argento's top horror films of the 1970s.I find it intriging that Suzy and Sara resemble sisters and have names that begin with the letter S.  Suspiria was influenced by an obscure horror pic called La ResidenciaThe Finishing School1968.  Supiria contains a tinge of the giallo genre with a scene in the opening moments.  The Goblin gives out another amazing soundtrack following their excellent score for Profondo Rosso.  Luciano Tovoli does a fantastic job as the cinematographer in showcasing the nightmarish world of Suspiria1977.".

	schema:headline " Dismally Wretched !!";
	schema:reviewBody "As an absolute avid horror movie fanbuff I had been directed to this movie over and over. This is one of the most highly praised if not THE most highly praised European horror movie of all time. Whenever anyone asks What horror movies are good? What should I see? this movie is invariably in the elitist list. Its use of light and color is indeed a true study of cinematic technique and style. So what?! The one good idea Argento had the imagery was simply not enough to cover for the total lack of script acting talent meaningful dialog horrible direction of these actresses and the downright cheesefilled allout crapfest that is Suspira.SPOILERS ABOUNDIn the first death scene the acting was the most puerile trash I've ever witnessed and I've SEEN Killer Klowns from Outer Space. These girls did not die well prettily or with grace. In fact they didn't die with talent either. The death scenes were nothing but an indication to me that this should have been the death of the movie. There simply aren't words for how horribly these girls portrayed their parts. Honestly if the redhead had actually fallen that far with a cord attached around her neck the weight of her body would have popped her head off her neck rather than the sloppy inane banality we were given.Inane banality actually sums up the entirety of this movie. I cannot believe how highly recommended this trite piece of garbage is in the horror field. This was actually much MUCH worse than I Still Know What You Did Last Summerwhich was a total waste of my time. A friend who watched this garbage with me observed You know Fiend? Aside from no one being naked this really reminds me of a porno. Okay hence the exploitation feel of this film. I don't care. How could I possibly care? The atmosphere everyone raves about just came off as a really bad porn and nothing more. Nothing could have saved this film from Argento's lack of talent but a really good remake. Hopefully they won't make the mistake of assuming that this was in any way to be considered artsy. The acting quality is nonexistent and the screen play should have been exorcised and then buried in about 7 tons of salt if you ask me. Even the ballerinas were inept. I've seen better down at the local play house.Most of the players and the director being Italian is a far cry from making this art. European does not equate art. Sorry but um...no. This is rubbish. Nothing but unadulterated crap. The effects are laughable and there was not one redeeming performance in this whole venture. All I've accomplished in watching this garbage is the wasting of 9598 minutes. I should've taken a nap instead. The time would have been put to much better use.The musical score sounded like something that a twoyearold crackhead relentlessly banged out on the kitchen pots and pans in an epileptic seizure to rival the mother of all epileptic fits. The sound effects were distracting rather than complementary cutting in and out at the worst possible moments and coming off like some irritating noise an eight year old was making in the back seat of the car to annoy his dork brother.

	onyx:emotionText "As an absolute avid horror movie fanbuff I had been directed to this movie over and over. This is one of the most highly praised if not THE most highly praised European horror movie of all time. Whenever anyone asks What horror movies are good? What should I see? this movie is invariably in the elitist list. Its use of light and color is indeed a true study of cinematic technique and style. So what?! The one good idea Argento had the imagery was simply not enough to cover for the total lack of script acting talent meaningful dialog horrible direction of these actresses and the downright cheesefilled allout crapfest that is Suspira.SPOILERS ABOUNDIn the first death scene the acting was the most puerile trash I've ever witnessed and I've SEEN Killer Klowns from Outer Space. These girls did not die well prettily or with grace. In fact they didn't die with talent either. The death scenes were nothing but an indication to me that this should have been the death of the movie. There simply aren't words for how horribly these girls portrayed their parts. Honestly if the redhead had actually fallen that far with a cord attached around her neck the weight of her body would have popped her head off her neck rather than the sloppy inane banality we were given.Inane banality actually sums up the entirety of this movie. I cannot believe how highly recommended this trite piece of garbage is in the horror field. This was actually much MUCH worse than I Still Know What You Did Last Summerwhich was a total waste of my time. A friend who watched this garbage with me observed You know Fiend? Aside from no one being naked this really reminds me of a porno. Okay hence the exploitation feel of this film. I don't care. How could I possibly care? The atmosphere everyone raves about just came off as a really bad porn and nothing more. Nothing could have saved this film from Argento's lack of talent but a really good remake. Hopefully they won't make the mistake of assuming that this was in any way to be considered artsy. The acting quality is nonexistent and the screen play should have been exorcised and then buried in about 7 tons of salt if you ask me. Even the ballerinas were inept. I've seen better down at the local play house.Most of the players and the director being Italian is a far cry from making this art. European does not equate art. Sorry but um...no. This is rubbish. Nothing but unadulterated crap. The effects are laughable and there was not one redeeming performance in this whole venture. All I've accomplished in watching this garbage is the wasting of 9598 minutes. I should've taken a nap instead. The time would have been put to much better use.The musical score sounded like something that a twoyearold crackhead relentlessly banged out on the kitchen pots and pans in an epileptic seizure to rival the mother of all epileptic fits. The sound effects were distracting rather than complementary cutting in and out at the worst possible moments and coming off like some irritating noise an eight year old was making in the back seat of the car to annoy his dork brother. Refuse to be one of those mindless sheep who follow the herd. Don't allow yourself to be dragged into the whole mindset that because it's Argento it's genius. That's just NOT the case as Suspira MORE than proves. This is the most dismally wretched act of cinematic micturition ever to be committed to film and I've seen some real stinkers in my time.

Secondly thanks to all the pretentious film buffs that have listed Suspiria in any top 100 list I appreciate that this is your opinion but you are wrong. This movie comes close to one of the worst I have ever sat through one with little or no redeeming features.Argento's much acclaimed use of colour is pointless and clumsy the soundtrack distracts the viewer from any potential suspense and his choice of effects is poor at best. An example of this is the overly graphic stabbing scene Hitchcock taught us years earlier that you don't need to show what the mind can create for itself. Also why even use the chubby bat prop when the mere suggestion of a bat would have been more frightening. The script is poor and the plot line thin if this movie had used a sense of irony it would still be bad but could have been funny.In conclusion I would advise any movie lover to avoid Suspiria as you would any Steven Seagal film your time will be better spent elsewhere.Here are some alternative titles you should tryThe Shining  Stanley Kubrick 1980 The Vanishing  George Sluizer 1988Ringu  Hideo Nakata 1998 Psycho  Alfred Hitchcock 1960 Rosemary's Baby  Roman Polanski 1968That is all.".

If anything Dario Argento art directs this movie within an inch of its life to a point where it actually succeeds to separate itself from its horror roots and begins to open itself to a perverse fairy tale. The first fifteen minutes of the movie are one of the most tense moments of mounting horror I have seen in a while despite the horrible dialogue and the bad dubbing courtesy of what seems to be the norm of Italian movies of the period. Its setup consisting of Jessica Harper's character Susie Bannion arriving at the school of dance that she is to attend in the middle of a storm. Why she doesn't take the storm as a signal that maybe this might not be the ideal place for her is anyone's guess. A girl Pat Hingle runs out screaming into the night and winds up at the neighboring dorm where a friend takes her in but soon later she meets a grisly fate in a fantastic sequence that has become a classic all its own.What's shocking is not the absolute terror that reaches this early pitch in SUSPIRIA compressing the horror which happens in PSYCHO by half an hour and setting the stage to the events which follow even when in retrospect they make little sense it's the way it's set up. Instead of going for dark moody colors or the more modern technique of filtering a sickly green or sepia or blue color to enhance elements of dread instead of utilizing a darkambient theme with the occasional crashing violin Argento decides to flood the scene in an orgy of color rapid editing and its unsettling feverish Goblin score reminiscent of Tubular Bells with more primeval howls and drums which escalate until they're practically reverberating all over the film. This is stunning beautiful horror a fable gone to the extreme perverse technique over substance taken to its maximum level. SUSPIRIA is quite simply one of the best horror films ever made and despite its age it does not show it and proves that the oldest tricks in the book still work perfectly well. Watch it and enjoy for this is a masterpiece.".

It lacked dramatic tension ambiance and even the popup scares and gore that even mediocre horror has. Notice that even the positive reviews mentioned that it lacked in plot and didn't directly scare the viewer but the visuals and atmosphere more than made up for that. In truth it's all bad. Many horror fans would agree that you can forgo an airtight plot if other things keep the film moving but Suspiria has very little going for it. And has anyone stopped to think that if Argento succeeded in creating a rich haunting atmosphere then why shouldn't the movie be scary?Even with an art house lens it's amateurish. I give it points for good sets and costumes. Beyond that many of the scenes are uninteresting visually AND storywise and totally unrelated to each other i.e it doesn't make sense and it's paced badly! Its witch mythology is nonsensical and there is no story motivation. Why does a devious underground witches' coven open a dance school? And why do they ritualistically drug one oblivious dancer and not the others? What's the point of the maggots? Why is a shiny spoon supposed to be scary? Too many nagging questions. Somehow there is little action story or character development in the numerous scenes of this film. Suspiria takes itself way to seriously to get past these holes or even make the movie fun or interesting. Plus the chilling light effects are literally reminiscent of the comic book murder scenes in Creepshow go Adrienne!. Creative and unique' my ass! I found the camera work dull and lacking in intensity. Even cheesy nobudget Evil Dead which we all love of course had creativeunusual cinematography. Suspiria's also not very gory was that magenta Tempra paint? which I can appreciate except that the few killing scenes are just lame and go on too long. The meandering killers seem pretty bored and lackadaisical actually making it seem unbelievable that the victims are so scared. Horror should be about intensity and passion and Suspiria is all wrong.If you like creepiness with interesting shotslighting with slow development and not too much blood try Repulsion or even Alien.  There are a million creepier more atmospheric and more interesting films just in the sub genre of Bhorror. Good old Night of the Living Dead! To recap story pacing and visuals are a bust and there isn't gore to hold the attention of splatter fans. I won't even mention the beloved soundtrack. Okay I will. It was generally inappropriate for the scenes and the band regularly struck disruptive power chords hissed and screeched when absolutely nothing was happening. Why?!

Argentos' Demons is a whole lot better than this one.  This tagline should be theres nothing more BORING than the last 10 minutes except the first 90!!!! Don't rent this movie expecting a masterpiece or even a good film rent it if you want something to fall asleep too.  The music also gets annoying its the same tune played over and over and over until you just wanna yank the tape out and kick it across the room!  The color is just plain weird not as great as everyone says it is.  Its just red or green the whole time.  The end sucks most of all although I shouldn't have expected more...How this movie got such a great rating I will never know or understand!  My rating is 2 out of 10.  DON'T CHECK IT OUT...........".

Personally I liked it but I've read plenty of negative comments saying how it was too loud distracting and even made people have to turn the volume up and down all the way through the film.There is gore  low budget stuff though and if you like your horror slow burning and colourful you might get something out of this.".

Chief among the young leotard set is Ms. Harper's relatively longlived pal lovely Stefania Casini as Sara. As hairraising events continue Harper begins to suspect a coven of witches may have infested the dance Academy.The storytelling part of Suspiria is relatively weak with events unintentionally serving to lesson the dramatic impact of the horror. The superb opening scenes for example are never really improved upon. Interesting characters are underdeveloped and should have been more cleverly woven into the plot. Despite its haphazard script and some obvious budget restraints director Dario Argento's Suspiria remains an excellent film.Mr. Argento's innovative imaginative direction is the film's greatest strength. His cutting edge camera sense is often striking and the color photography with Luciano Tovoli is illuminating. The sharp soundtrack music by the appropriately named Goblin band is reminiscent of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. Ms. Bennett and Ms. Valli are a treat. The usually underutilized Bennett is especially noteworthy in her only postDark Shadows feature film appearance.Bennett accepted the project on the strength of the director's reputation and a chance to visit Rome. When Suspiria appeared in the USA she received some unwarranted poor notices and professed dissatisfaction with the film's violent content. Still Bennett was Saturn Awardnominated as 1978's Best Supporting Actress for her work. Bennett duplicitously gives the Madame Blanc character just the right amount of respectability or class she keeps her Academy dancers enrolled and helps hold the slim story together.

The movie itself is very eerie and suspenseful and there are some gory murders but that's about it.  I like horror movies which are shocking and the opening murders were a bit shocking but i felt that Suspiria had nothing else to offer there certainly wasn't any excitement like other Argento movies such as Phenomena and Demons.  During the rest of the movie i was struggling to stay awake and i wanted to just turn it off i knew it wasn't going to get any better. The movie also relies heavily on creepy music this works because you may never forget that music for the rest of you life.  However the music seems to get louder and louder until you lose your consentration on the movie and it feels like your watching a music video. Something diffrent this movie offers is the use of colours which is probably why most of the movie was shot in the dark to make the colours stand out.  I found this to be annoying and hard to watch. I consider Suspiria to be a creepy drama rather than a horror movie.  If you like movies which stand out as being diffrent then you may enjoy this. If your looking for gore theres just not enough of it to hold your interest. If your looking for thrills and excitement look elsewhere because you won't find it here.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really liked 'Suspiria'. It's a totally other movie than most contemporary horror films but I have heard that the same director Argento has many other similar movies.What I didn't like was the dubbing. Argento let's every cast member speak their native tongue and they dubbed it over in English later. This makes for some comical situations in intense moments. The main cast members protagonists and antagonists did all speak English as native language but for some reason they had to dub their own dialogue later anyway. The lip sync on the main character is quite okay the rest is not.Now about the movie itself. The story is quite stupid though optimists may label it 'minimalistic' p and the end is horrible. Horrormovies shouldn't have anticlimaxes the tension build up was good but then it just disappoints.Suspiria relies on tension and mood for 99 of it's entertainment worth. The plot is pretty irrelevant. And the acting was luckily not important since it wasn't very good at all.Argento really uses VERY theatrical music which I didn't like but it does create a certain appropriate effect and he drenches the screen in vibrant primary colors with scenes dominated by great pools of reds blues yellows and greens. This provides for a very special effect and I really dug it. It's an inspired fever dream of a horror moviesurreal and very stylish.I'll end with the best Suspiria has the best opening scenes of any horror film I've ever seen. It's beautiful thrilling haunting intense disgusting...all in a couple of minutes scenes. Of course I'm not talking about the first scene but the scenes when the main character arrives at the academy.Furthermore there are three additional scenes that are simply superb the scene with the blind man on the empty square BRILLIANT! the scene with the roommate where the lights go out  and the scene with the red lights in the sleeping quarters.In conclusion I have a lovehate relationship with horror films and I do too with this film. I love the intensity and the cinematography but hate the theatricality bad acting and the overdose of gore the bloody heart makes me cringe.910 for half the movie the night scenes LOL  410 for the other half the day scenes dancing lessons and witchcraft plot yuck. Makes for a 6.510 average.You might be surprised that this movie that I rated 6.5 is on the number 10 spot in my all time best horror movie list...".

	schema:headline " Well not Everybody's Fine in this nevertheless very fine movie";
	schema:reviewBody "If trailers were ever suggesting that Everybody's Fine might be a comedy or even only a lighthearted drama they were truly misleading and a simple drama denominator from its poster does the movie better justice. Though and not the least thanks to occasional humorous undertones evidently somewhat a weaker part of the movie and despite really uneasy feelings that story frequently brings out viewers are often ahead of father in whatever sad facts his noteverybody'sfine children have concealed from him one can get almost exhilarated with quite an optimistic ending when the father Frank Goode Robert De Niro on his disastrous crosscountry tour to meet his children one by one not without a trouble of going through serious health problems finally reconvenes with surviving ones Kate Beckinsale Sam Rockwell and Drew Barrymore and postmortem reconciles with his long ago estranged ultimately lost son finally coming to terms with his artistic limitations even seeking to buy one of his paintings. An early sketch he discovers speaks volumes within the running metaphor of Frank's life with its working part spent in putting coating on telephone wires that should connect people. However when those wires in the times subsequent to his wife's demise continue transferring embellished pictures of lives of his own ones in order not to disappoint fatherly expectations unfairly in their young lives so highly imposed on them ties get easily broken where it hurts the most between father and his children.One inevitably wonders how such a depressing story full of toned down bitter emotions has even been considered to be made into a Hollywood movie?

Though and not the least thanks to occasional humorous undertones evidently somewhat a weaker part of the movie and despite really uneasy feelings that story frequently brings out viewers are often ahead of father in whatever sad facts his noteverybody'sfine children have concealed from him one can get almost exhilarated with quite an optimistic ending when the father Frank Goode Robert De Niro on his disastrous crosscountry tour to meet his children one by one not without a trouble of going through serious health problems finally reconvenes with surviving ones Kate Beckinsale Sam Rockwell and Drew Barrymore and postmortem reconciles with his long ago estranged ultimately lost son finally coming to terms with his artistic limitations even seeking to buy one of his paintings. An early sketch he discovers speaks volumes within the running metaphor of Frank's life with its working part spent in putting coating on telephone wires that should connect people. However when those wires in the times subsequent to his wife's demise continue transferring embellished pictures of lives of his own ones in order not to disappoint fatherly expectations unfairly in their young lives so highly imposed on them ties get easily broken where it hurts the most between father and his children.One inevitably wonders how such a depressing story full of toned down bitter emotions has even been considered to be made into a Hollywood movie?

I will be surprised if he has not turned the heads and hearts of those who can nominate him for an Oscar.

At the conclusion of the film I noticed smiles and tears in the eyes of the older viewers and some boredom and rush to leave in the younger ones. This is a movie for parents and will probably not appeal much to the under 25 set.That said this is a beautiful heartfelt and sometimes painful story of a father recognizing and coming to grips with the reality of his parenting and his lack of control over his children's lives. It is about truth and how we try to spare others pain or discomfort. It is about how many parents still see their grown up children as small children who we are responsible for.While the supporting cast turn in good performances this is Robert DeNiro's movie. It is his best performance since Awakenings he deserved that Oscar and not just the nomination.I suspect that this film will get a lot of nominations but don't think it will win many awards. I base that on the idea that they younger voters have not yet been in the shoes of the older ones and will not be fully able to appreciate the character or his growth and understanding.".

	schema:reviewBody "How many times have you ever asked or ever were asked the question How are things? Invariably one replies everything is fine except of course it's not true. The response is a polite brushoff. This movie is about how a man decides not to accept the brushoff this time coming from his own children and as a result makes some interesting discoveries. This movie contains Robert DeNiro's strongest role in years. The entire story revolves around his character and he really brings the character to life. A brilliant performance by a great actor. This movie is like Robert Young in FatherKnowsBest deciding to really connect with his children after years of just being around. What's even better is that the movie avoids becoming trite and effectively brings the audience into this family's world as the story explores themes that are relevant to all families. Children grow up leave the home go their separate ways leaving behind memories. A wonderful movie.Ah platitudes. We're all guilty of using them. They're a polite way of telling someone to buzz off that you don't want to talk to them that they are unworthy of your time. This movie is all about platitudes most cruelly applied when it's least needed or wanted. In this movie a man wants to initiate communication with his children all of whom are adults and have long since left the home and he and his children go through a lot of changes as they attempt to bridge the gulf that separates them. This doesn't mean the children don't care about their father they do. But the emotional closeness was never there and this is what this movie is about breaking down barriers to establish an emotional connection. This movie is a Robert DeNiro vehicle. It is his reemergence onto the Hollywood scene after years of cinematic oblivion. His performance is a tour de force he deserves at least an Academy Award nomination for best actor. He carries the movie. Drew Barrymore also gives an impressive performance as one of Mr. DeNiro's daughters. Ms. Barrymore shines on the screen and proves once again that she is one of the premiere actresses in Hollywood. Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsdale also are excellent. What a great movie! Never coldshoulder your father.This is the best Robert DeNiro movie in years. His strong acting carries this sentimental story about a man trying to reconnect with his children. The movie places a strong emphasis on family relationships and does an excellent job in engaging and keeping the audience's attention as Mr. DeNiro's character embarks on an odyssey of emotional discovery. At times the story verges on becoming openly maudlin but succeeds in avoiding that pitfall. The movie also avoids becoming hokey and corny and succeeds in staying on course as the DeNiro character continues on his journey. All in all this is a wonderful movie featuring a strong performance by Robert DeNiro. After watching this movie you will think twice before telling someone everybody's fine unless you mean it.".

But it definitely didn't go down like that. There were about maybe 8 people in the theater when I went to see this movie 3 of them were me and my 2 friends.I have to say this movie was really sad and had a lot to say about childparent relations. I am only 18 years old but I love these types of films and it made me think about how I would be with my parents when I get older and it really makes me want to make sure I keep a good relationship with my parents. My dad has always pushed me and wanted better for me in school and I have always been very average and against the grain as it seems like David was.I don't know if the makers wanted the relation between Frank and his kids to seem empty but that's how it seemed to be throughout the film until the end. Even if it was lack of chemistry between actors which of course I highly doubt it was it works wonders and shows that Frank is like an alien to them and also that they are alien to him. When he learns that all of his children aren't actually as successful he seems like he's struggling within to try and understand where they're coming from instead of just showing his disappointment. When things finally come tumbling down towards the film's climax they come right back together as a family would. This movie made me tear up and really the only reason I didn't cry was because I was with friends. I could write a lot more about this but I'll just suggest that if you're looking for a good movie about family or even if you just like De Nirothat's why I saw it you should definitely see this movie. It won't disappoint.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on Guiseppe Tornatore's 1990 Italian film Stanno tutti bene writerdirector Kirk Jones has brought some of the best work out of Robert DeNiro in decades. Everybody's Fine is a fascinating tale about Frank DeNiro a widower who wants to get his four adult children together for dinner but when one by one they all cancel for good reasons or lack of a better word excuses he decides against the advice of his doctor to make a surprise trip to all their residences in New York Chicago Denver and Las Vegas. What the trip brings him however is a heavy realization that despite what his latewife told him maybe everybody's not fine.Treading heavy territory to resemble films like About Schmidt Everybody's Fine is a heartfelt emotional film that will leave you in tears. Though the narrative could come off a bit overdramatic at times there's no denying the warmth that the film conveys to family and loyalty. DeNiro is most effective in his role of Frank Goode the hardworking father whose long hours putting up coating on telephone wire may have cost him more than he thought. Director Kirk Jones makes some great artistic choices especially in the final scenes of the film. One thing however that is surprising is how the film is being marketed. Portraying itself as a holidaycomedy is going to be quite unexpected to viewers as the film is weighty with emotion and less on the laughs. The supporting players in this case the adult children are all beautifully cast. Drew Barrymore has never been sweeter in the role of Rosie a dancer in Vegas with a Daddy's Girl mentality. Kate Beckinsale is stunning in looks and adequate in delivery as Amy a top advertisement executive. Sam Rockwell who is long overdue for Oscar attention plays Robert the musician who painfully seeks his father's approval. Enough can't be said about DeNiro who gives one of his finest performances of his career. Showing a softer side yet remaining in tuned with his fatherly instincts DeNiro has redeemed some of his lesser works in the past years. He takes in some of the best and worst parts of all fathers' across the world. Worrying yet too hard at times it spills over into his children's decisions. Where the narrative misses in some aspects DeNiro makes up for with his devotion and commitment to the character. It's an outstanding turn for him in his late career.Overdramatic clich and a bit predictable Everybody's Fine shows a beating heart. There's no stupidity or attitude in its form just pure feeling. If you come from a family of secrets for the greater good which may be the majority of us this will speak volumes. ".

	schema:headline " The Return of DeNiro";
	schema:reviewBody "Everybody's Fine 2009  out of 4Robert DeNiro plays a widower who grows tired of his four children making excuses for not coming to see him so he disregards his doctor's orders and takes a trip to visit all four. Along the way he starts to think about their childhood and where their lives are at now. I remember when THIS BOYS LIFE was released it featured a trailer that would make you think you were walking into one of the greatest family films ever made even though the actual film was a dark one about child abuse. I mention that because this film is pretty much the same effect as the poster TV ads and trailer makes you think that you're in for a good time but the film is actually an incredibly depressing affair but it finally gives star DeNiro a true character and he does great work with it. Now I'm not one of those who thinks DeNiro has wasted one performance after another for the past twenty years. I think he's given several very good performances even though many of the characters weren't the strongest items for an actor of his range. The performance here is downright terrific and truly deserves to be called that old DeNiro style. DeNiro doesn't need words to show what his character is feeling and he perfectly brings to life this rather sad character who is smart enough to know there's a lot more going on with his children then they're willing to tell him. I found DeNiro to be perfect and one would hope he'd get some Oscar consideration but that probably won't happen considering how the film did at the box office but I would ask why that should matter. DeNiro gets to interact with various characters and the amount of life he brings this character will make one remember the type of work he was turning in on a consistent basis years ago. I won't ruin DeNiro's big scene towards the end but it's certainly very overwhelming. The supporting cast has Drew Barrymore Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell playing the children and they all give fine performances and mix with DeNiro very well. I do wish the actual film would have been a bit stronger because it's extremely depressing but at times I felt the film was holding back. I really can't explain what but it just never really felt like a full movie and at times there were some plot details that were a tad bit over dramatic and other times that the film pushes too hard to get its point across. While the film does have its share of problems the real reason for anyone to watch this is for the return of DeNiro and that alone makes this worth seeing. Again not the happiest film out there but at least we get to see DeNiro playing his best character in quite a while.".

	schema:headline " Sorrow and Sadness. Proving happiness is different for people you feel the emotional tears from hidden secrets.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to say that Everybody's Fine is clearly one of the better movies I've seen in a long time as after watching I was touched and even teared up almost wanting to cry. The film is certainly an emotional drama. And the performance from legendary Robert De Niro ranks as one of his finest as Bob is one of the best actors in the business. Everybody's Fine is blended well with drama and intrigue yet the themes of secrets and sorrow overshadow everything only in the end happiness is finally reached.Robert De Niro is Frank Goode a recently widowed man who misses his wife and has the house all to himself. Frank has four grown kids who all do their own thing and live in different parts of the country. Frank wants to get all of them together for a visit yet when he contacts them all three of them just can't find the right time to visit and the other one son DavidAustin Lysyis unable to be reached. So Frank decides to set out on a journey to visit them all.Frank uses many forms of travel along the way even though it was against his doctors wishes for him to journey out and travel. So he boards the train on the way up to New York City to visit artist son David and along the way Frank looks at the power lines of telephone polls to remind him of how life has passed for him over the years as laying power lines and poles was what Frank did for a living. When arriving in New York City David's apartment is empty the only memories Frank has is his flashbacks of David as a small boyas this film uses the flashback technique well with Frank seeing all of his grown children as little ones when he first meets them. So Frank then decides to journey off by bus to see his next child.This meeting happens to be with daughter AmyKate Beckinsale who as always looks so bright and sexywho's a successful advertising executive in Chicago. Everything seems normal for Amy she seems happily married while raising her young son and money seems okay as you can tell by her living space and the professional elegant clothing she wears. Only at the dinner table friction is felt and Amy tells dad she just doesn't have the time for Frank to stay at least for an extended time.Then the next journey on more buses is to the Rockies in Denver to see son RobertSam Rockwellwho plays the drums in an orchestra and he seems happy as Frank is somewhat disappointed that Robert is not the leader of the band so to speak! Anyway they talk and Robert seems happy but not happy enough to spend time with dad. So then Frank takes another journey of trains and buses with his sights set on Las Vegas. Only some roadblocks and jams come up along the way for Frank like a missed train and a somewhat dangerous encounter with a teenage thug that deprives Frank of his medicine in a big way. Interesting is seeing him hitch a ride into Vegas from a woman trucker ColleenMelissa Leowhich was comical. Now he meets daughter Rosiethe witty and quirk Drew Barrymoreeverything seems fine with Rosie nice apartment she says work as a dancer is fine yet you can spot she's a probable lesbian when the female friend brings a baby over that ends up staying for the night. Still all three siblings had no word or info on David just hidden suspicions. So Frank flies away yet hits major medical turbulence on the plane.Oddly enough awakening in the hospital bed surrounded by his children Frank discovers truths from each yet it was foreshadowed some by his before hand dream. Only he will sadly learn the tragic fate of David. Yet aside from the lonely mood and sad sorrow feel of this film it teaches important messages. Frank always pushed his children hard as he found out they turned out fine yet he learns an important factor that the definition of happiness is different for everyone as people like his kids spread their wings and live life their way on their own time. Sure secrets were kept only because they didn't want to disappoint Frank which oddly the secrets ended up providing bonding and happiness for Frank and his children in the end as proved by the holiday get to together! As Frank saw that everybody's just fine the way that they are and that was how things were meant to be as the secrets don't have to worry you and he still loves his children the same just the way they are. Overall great film with an emotional and touching performance from De Niro even though it's sad and lonely sorrow feel may dominate the minutes this picture still ends with happiness proving that love conquers all for people just the way that they are even during family secrets. Great movie that's touching and emotional you will feel like you want to shed a few tears.".

	schema:headline " De Niro makes the movie worth it";
	schema:reviewBody "If you would ask me I would have to say in all honesty everybody's fine. Everybody's fine. Kirk Jones who also directed Nanny McPhee and Waking Ned Divine directs this Italian remake from the 90's called Stanno Tutti Bene. He also is given credit for adapting the original screenplay to suit this American version better. The film works because De Niro gives a pretty powerful performance and makes you forget all the clichs the film has. Yes it is very formulaic and we know every single kid will have something to hide from his father they all have a problem and they all are withholding information from him. The journey De Niro's character is making will be revealing and teach him some lessons which he never learned in his 60 years but he will now in these few days. Everybody's Fine follows all those formulas which we have grown used to in Hollywood films but thanks to some interesting performances the movie is worth your time. It is a dramedy a movie that likes to play with our emotions but it still is worth checking out. The weakest part of the movie is the distance that De Niro's character has with his children. It is hard to believe sometimes that this is actually a family and I think the director exaggerated a bit with the coldness and distance between them and it all just ties up too neatly at the end.Frank Goode Robert De Niro is a widower who is planning on having his four children for dinner on the weekend. After making plans for preparing a nice meal he receives calls from each one saying that they won't be able to make it. Frank hasn't seen his kids since their mother's funeral and he realizes she was the one that maintained the family together so he decides to go give them a surprise visit each. Frank has a lung condition and his doctor recommends him to stay at home and not travel but he decides to go anyway across the different states on train and bus. His first stop is New York where he plans on visiting David Austin Lysy an artist. He is not at his apartment and Frank waits for an entire day without being able to reach him although he is glad to see one of his paintings at a gallery near his apartment. Frank decides to move on and visit his daughter Amy Kate Beckinsale in Chicago. She is a successful ad executive and has a nice home she shares with her husband and son. Frank then travels to Denver the next day because she is busy and visits Robert Sam Rockwell who plays the percussion for the orchestra. Frank's last trip is to Las Vegas where he meets up with Rosie Drew Barrymore a successful professional dancer. Frank realizes that his children have all been lieing to him and that they are not all fine but he wonders why they can't trust him and figures it is because he pushed his kids too hard.Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances in years and it was good to see him in this kind of role. Drew Barrymore also gives a great performance and she seemed the closest with her father and perhaps the only one who really had chemistry with him. It was hard to believe his relationship with his other children especially with Kate Beckinsale's character who was too distant. Sam Rockwell gives a good performance he is a great actor but he was much better in Moon. The movie has a slow start but after a while you begin to get involved in the story and wonder what the kids are hiding. Frank has worked hard all his life making telephone cables in order to give his kids a good education and has really pushed them perhaps a bit too much. Ironically that communication media is not used anymore by his children who all use wireless cellphones and it represents the communication between them that has been broken over the years. I think that the main problem the film has is that it tries to resolve everything at the end and it just doesn't work that well. However the story is well told and if you are into these emotional movies then you will probably enjoy this one because it has some good performances and is a very touching movie. The problem I had with it was that it was too formulaic but still worth it in my opinion.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "If you would ask me I would have to say in all honesty everybody's fine. Everybody's fine. Kirk Jones who also directed Nanny McPhee and Waking Ned Divine directs this Italian remake from the 90's called Stanno Tutti Bene. He also is given credit for adapting the original screenplay to suit this American version better. The film works because De Niro gives a pretty powerful performance and makes you forget all the clichs the film has. Yes it is very formulaic and we know every single kid will have something to hide from his father they all have a problem and they all are withholding information from him. The journey De Niro's character is making will be revealing and teach him some lessons which he never learned in his 60 years but he will now in these few days. Everybody's Fine follows all those formulas which we have grown used to in Hollywood films but thanks to some interesting performances the movie is worth your time. It is a dramedy a movie that likes to play with our emotions but it still is worth checking out. The weakest part of the movie is the distance that De Niro's character has with his children. It is hard to believe sometimes that this is actually a family and I think the director exaggerated a bit with the coldness and distance between them and it all just ties up too neatly at the end.Frank Goode Robert De Niro is a widower who is planning on having his four children for dinner on the weekend. After making plans for preparing a nice meal he receives calls from each one saying that they won't be able to make it. Frank hasn't seen his kids since their mother's funeral and he realizes she was the one that maintained the family together so he decides to go give them a surprise visit each. Frank has a lung condition and his doctor recommends him to stay at home and not travel but he decides to go anyway across the different states on train and bus. His first stop is New York where he plans on visiting David Austin Lysy an artist. He is not at his apartment and Frank waits for an entire day without being able to reach him although he is glad to see one of his paintings at a gallery near his apartment. Frank decides to move on and visit his daughter Amy Kate Beckinsale in Chicago. She is a successful ad executive and has a nice home she shares with her husband and son. Frank then travels to Denver the next day because she is busy and visits Robert Sam Rockwell who plays the percussion for the orchestra. Frank's last trip is to Las Vegas where he meets up with Rosie Drew Barrymore a successful professional dancer. Frank realizes that his children have all been lieing to him and that they are not all fine but he wonders why they can't trust him and figures it is because he pushed his kids too hard.Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances in years and it was good to see him in this kind of role.

	schema:headline " An Estranged Father Take a Lugubrious Sentimental CrossCountry Journey";
	schema:reviewBody "Family dysfunction is given a lugubrious sentimental treatment by writerdirector Kirk Jones Waking Ned Devine in what is actually a remake of a 1990 Italian film Stanno tutti bene written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore no stranger to sentiment since he made the neoclassic Cinema Paradiso. The earlier film starred the legendary Marcello Mastroianni as a Sicilian civil servant who travels throughout Italy to pay surprise visits to his children after his wife has died. This mirror version stars the equally legendary Robert De Niro as Frank Goode a former bluecollar worker living in upstate New York doing the same thing with his grown children. The first part of the plot reminds me of an even earlier classic Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story which told the story of an elderly couple who visit their grown children in Tokyo only to discover they have no time for them. That film was a subtle classic that didn't telegraph its emotional impact around contrived plot turns.The same cannot be said for this turgid 2009 drama which bears the sometimes unbearable stamp of manipulation in Jones' overly deliberate treatment with sometimes tooperfectly composed shot compositions courtesy of Henry Braham's immaculate cinematography. The plot follows Frank on his voyage of discovery as he settles into his unfulfilling widowed existence. After being rebuffed by his four children to come home for the holidays he decides to take matters into his own hands and visit each one of them despite a serious heart ailment. He begins to realize it was his wife who had been the emotional conduit that kept the family in touch despite the divergent paths they all took. Frank sets out by train and bus to surprise each of them in their locales. The first is David an artist living a bohotype lifestyle in Manhattan but he isn't home for reasons that will become clear later in the story. Then it's off to see Amy a successful TypeA Chicago advertising executive living a life out of the pages of Architectural Digest.Frank moves on to Denver to meet his son Robert a symphony percussionist whom Frank thought was a conductor and finally to Las Vegas where he visits Rosie a dancer living in a luxurious apartment. Needless to say things are not what they appear and Frank becomes aware of how estranged he truly has become from his children as revelations start to unfold like clockwork. As an actor De Niro seems to have settled into a relatively passive figure only evoking the heat of his past performances during key moments. Unfortunately that happens in the film's worst scene a hallucinogenic fantasy scene where Frank is talking to his memory of his children as toddlers only to have them talk back like their adults a bit like the classroom scene in Woody Allen's Annie Hall but without the laughs. Otherwise De Niro makes his character a befuddling somewhat endearing presence throughout. Kate Beckinsale plays Amy efficiently but not too deeply. The ad pitch during her sequence is the one unexpectedly funny bit in the whole film.Sam Rockwell fares better as the son since the sense of disappointment is palpable between father and son in his scenes with De Niro. Drew Barrymore uses her natural warmth and likability to play Rosie as Frank's obvious favorite a daughter who won't do anything to let her father down. The always watchable Melissa Leo Frozen River shows up in a convenient but touching cameo as a sympathetic truck driver who bonds with Frank over their recent spouse losses. The whole plot executes on a series of conveniences such as the blatant connection between Frank's former job in covering PVC cables and the overlapping voiceovers of the siblings on moving images of telephone wires. The 2010 DVD release is weak as these types of releases go with the only extras being seven deletedextended scenes interesting but excisable and an interview with Paul McCartney who wrote and performed the appropriately sentimental song I Want to Come Home played over the closing credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a very good film that stars a Hollywood legend playing against type as a retired widower taking a road trip along the way facing issues about his own life and those of his relationship with his offspring. 'About Schmidt' is that film's name and it is wonderful. This film is NOT that film.While 'Everybody's Fine' follows a very similar premise unfortunately it doesn't share anywhere near the same quality of theme character performances or dialogue as Alexander Payne's vastly superior film. This effort is tentative at best in its character and plot set up  the reasoning behind why the kids are so distant with their father is only barely convincing as De Nero's Frank Goode actually seems like a fairly normal kind of guy as oppose to the fastidious overbearing patriarch suggested by his off spring. My main problem with the film is its over sentimentality in the final third of the film. The director cranks up the melodrama with weepy strings on the score and some awful examples of expositional dialogue making absobloodylutely sure we have no doubt what EVERYONE and EVERYTHING means with illadvised voice overs dream sequences and only the very happiest of endings on offer which is in itself deeply unbelievable as anyone with a dysfunctional family knows you cannot undo a lifetime of bad feeling with a few Christmas lights and a wellcooked turkey. The fact that lots of these reviewers are calling De Nero's performance here the best for 15 or 20 years really just shows how far he has fallen from his truly great performances in the 70's and 80's. Soppy over explained but undercooked melodrama that really should've been better considering the wealth of acting talent available.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert DeNiro has been choosing some very poor projects since the new millennium began. I don't think 'Everybody's Fine' is a great film or a good choice for DeNiro but it is better than it could have been. DeNiro is to thanks for this. He takes this formula and makes it boil. Despite some major problems Everyone's Fine is decent enough to give a look.DeNiro makes this work and DeNiro alone. Everything else is just merely poor to mediocre. Kate Beckingsale Drew Barrymore and Sam Rockwell all give the worst performances of their career in this picture. DeNior on the other hand gives his strongest performance since 2000 as Frank Goode. DeNiro is subdued beyond anything he ever has been. Part of DeNiro's greatness has been his tremendous force and energy. In truth he has never played a character like Frank Goode before. Frank's a shell and DeNiro has the power to make him sad tragic and compelling. DeNiro plays the grandfather character and has never played one before. I kind of wish the picture was better but I think DeNiro makes it work.The direction isn't all that inspired. It kind of wants to be 'About Schmidt' and it kind of fails. I mean so many clichs are used and yet DeNiro makes it work. The idea of the telephone poles is silly the idea of the city hopping is silly and the way the relationships are handled makes every kid come off as a jerk. DeNiro doesn't see this and he saves this picture.I really found the last act to be the best of the picture. The film has some major problems in identifying what it wants to be. It isn't a comedy or a drama. The last act though is crystal clear and DeNiro is brilliant in it. DeNiro's character Frank's favorite son is David who has tragically experimented with drugs. David represents the lost part of his heart. In the end he learns David met a tragic end and he blames himself for it. This is good drama. The moment where Goode goes to buy one of David's paintings is very satisfactory. Unfortuneatly the rest of the film doesn't follow suit.I don't believe Rockwell Beckingsale or Barrymore in these roles. Placing them next to DeNiro shows their shortcomings. I don't believe they are working class people. They look like awkward movie stars trying to blend in. DeNiro even in this disappointing decade for him still is able to blend into any role given to him. While this is one of DeNiro's better performances it is the worst of those three actors who are all very respectable. They play the material for sap DeNiro plays it with honesty. What the picture should have been about mostly was the lost son. That is what I identified most with.I have to mildly recommend the picture. It's one that really makes me in awe of DeNiro. It isn't the Taxi Drivers or the Raging Bulls which make me love him. It's the Everybody's Fine's that don't work unless they have him in the lead.".

It's another example of a movie having nothing but dialogue and still being enjoyable.Frank Robert De Niro who is great as always is looking forward to seeing his children and having the family in the same house for the first time since his wife's passing. However the kids cancel on him unexpectedly citing unexpected events in their own lives. That does not keep Frank from deciding to pay each of them a visit however.Frank travels across the United States meeting Amy Robert and Rosie. He is unable to find his other son David however. During each encounter Frank discovers that the lives of his offspring are different than what he was told.The film has a nice cast. Drew Barrymore Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell each give good performances. So if you are looking for a good film try this one. It is worth watching.".

It's another example of a movie having nothing but dialogue and still being enjoyable.Frank Robert De Niro who is great as always is looking forward to seeing his children and having the family in the same house for the first time since his wife's passing. However the kids cancel on him unexpectedly citing unexpected events in their own lives. That does not keep Frank from deciding to pay each of them a visit however.Frank travels across the United States meeting Amy Robert and Rosie. He is unable to find his other son David however. During each encounter Frank discovers that the lives of his offspring are different than what he was told.The film has a nice cast. Drew Barrymore Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell each give good performances. So if you are looking for a good film try this one. It is worth watching.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a good movie and makes one think about the fact that we all respond fine when we're asked how we are doing. It also makes us realizeappreciate the relationships we have as parents and children.I wish the movie offered more. It would have been better had there been more about the 4 children growing up the interactionrelationship each had with their mother and howwhy each child chose to move so far away. Each of the children seemed genuinely caring and loving but none chose to stay in close contact with their father Robert De Niro. I found that contradictory given how the story line developed.I do think that casting was extremely well done and all actors played their roles superbly. As I read the reviews on the IMDb website I was very surprised that somemany thought this was one of De Niro's best acting roles. I found he did a very good job but he has had many superb acting roles and this is not one of his best. I believe he is a superb actor and have seen all of his films.Drew Barrymore is also a superb actor and I was not disappointed by her performance. I didn't see anyone saying that this was her best role and I would agree that she has had better.Another aspect that would have made the film better would be if they added more interactions with the siblings. They did talk via phone but there couldshould have been more.I do definitely think this movie is worth seeing. It's also one I would buy on DVD to watch again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everybody's Fine. Yes the title of the film is actually Everybody's Fine. Excited yet? Apparently director Kirk Jones wanted to preclude the silly notion of narrative conflict upfront. While the truth may be that everybody isn't entirely fine the title is still more than appropriate given that the world of the film is a sunny euphemism for life where good intentions reign and happiness is just a smile and an old photograph away. Even in portraying sexual solicitation or drug addiction Jones can't help but do so with the utmost optimism. Wanna see my legs? a prepubescent conception of a prostitute asks a neutered Robert DeNiro. Wanna see mine? he quips back. Pause for effect. That's about the height of humor in this aggressively inoffensive holiday family film.To preface DeNiro plays Frank a man who gets stiffed by each of his four grown children whom he's invited home for a family weekend. So with a chip on his shoulder and against his doctor's recommendation uh oh! Frank sets off for a spontaneous surprise visitation circuit! The spunky old coot! His visits reveal that each of his children Sam Rockwell Drew Barrymore Kate Beckinsale has been lying to him about some major aspect of their life and go to ridiculous lengths to sell their lies. Beckinsale as Amy invites her exhusband over for dinner for fear of revealing their separation to her father Rockwell as Robert is a percussionist who claims to be the conductor for an orchestra and has picked up smoking and Barrymore as Rosie borrows a friend's Vegas flat to impress her father and suppress her lesbianism. You can't make this stuff up folks. Somebody smashed open a piata of clichs and Everybody's Fine is a God damn mad dash.Then there's the matter of Frank's fourth child. I had wanted to spare you the tragicNo. No it's best that you hear it from me. Poor Tom James Frain has gone missing from his apartment and while his siblings bicker back and forth over what lie to tell their father building obvious heavyhanded tension as the film wears on they hit a wall. Tom is dead. Sure you never see him alive and thus form no emotional attachment but it's sad. It's sad. He overdoses after 'buying drugs from a bar' in South America. The language regarding the incident is vague and naive as though the writer himself can think of nothing worse than the indistinct concept of drug use. A middleschooler could have thought of a more shocking transgression and believe me would love to.However the problems with Everybody's Fine far exceed its clinical detachment from engaging conflict as it drops its toothy disposition in the final act and suddenly becomes a misguided tearjerker. Frank has a bizarre neardeath experience involving his children played in this sequence by actual children sitting around a picnic table finally speaking truthfully about their lives. The pretension of the dialogue and the schmaltzy sentimentality of the premise make the scene downright embarrassing to watch. And as if you couldn't guess Frank soon recovers and finally gets the holiday he's always wanted with his three now emotionally honest children. The camera pulls away from the warmly lit dining room and Frank's voice over kicks in. Three guesses as to what the last line is.Everybody's Fine is not funny not moving and not in the least bit original. It's troubling to see DeNiro take a film like this as even the thirdrate police dramas he's been churning out for the last decade maintain a degree of his dignity as a cinematic bad ass. Frank is just a wet noodle of a character and on the whole Everybody's Fine is blisteringly uninteresting. To be fair I suppose many big stars and great performers have received a free pass around the holidays to star in invariably awful family films. So Merry Christmas Robert I hope it was worth it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Al Pacino for some reason decided to have plastic surgery. Aside from making him look permanently shocked it ridiculous that a character actor would want to mess around with his main source of income in the same way that a physicist wouldn't drink White Ace. On the other hand Pacino's contemporary and regular collaborator De Niro hasn't touched his mug leaving him free to clean up in the lucrative grandfather and retired policemen market. In Everybody's Fine he plays the former an old man who becomes increasingly lonely following his wife's death and so goes in search of his four children hoping to reconnect with them.De Niro is Frank Goode a telephone cable maker who spent his entire life working to provide for his family whilst pushing his children as hard as he could to succeed. As a result they are all a bit resentful and cagey towards him. Everybody's fine is about his attempts to get to know them a process made almost impossible as they try to hide their problems from him not wanting him to judge them failures.It's not a fast paced film and much of its impact relies on what the characters don't say rather than what they do. De Niro does a superb job with Goode portraying him as a tired old man whose need to see his children comes into direct conflict with his natural desire to try and direct their lives. Sam Rockwell Drew Barrymore and Kate Beckinsale all perform well as Frank's children although their roles themselves are exceptionally basic requiring almost nothing from the actors which makes it fairly surprising that they signed up all testament to De Niro's still exceptionally powerful allure as an actor. Kirk Jones' screenplay requires very little from anyone except for De Niro and even then not an enormous amount. The story is not a complex one and by telling you so little about the characters he lets you read pretty much anything into them you want which can be a good or bad thing depending on whether you think Drew Barrymore's character in ET would have grown up to be a lesbian dancer. Jones does a reasonable job as a director but again it is mostly De Niro's performance that keeps you watching to the sad but predictable end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everybody's Fine sees actor Robert De Niro playing Frank Goode the name's a sly joke a 66 year old recently retired widower who embarks on a road journey across the United States. His mission? To visit each of his four children and hopefully heal the emotional disconnection that developed between him and them over the course of a lifetime.What makes the film different from similar fare is this De Niro is not some alcoholic bum or deadbeat father but a perfectly good man. Whilst De Niro typically plays tough daddy or stern patriarch roles ie the Meet The Fockers movies here he is a normal breadwinner and problem solver who has always wanted nothing but the best for his kids and who has always done his utmost to provide for them.But by showing the rather superficial relationship that exists between a father and his offspring  one borne out of respect and fondness rather than emotional closeness  the film is critiquing a kind of masculine emotional repression. And so many of the film's scenes involve De Niro's teary eyed children now adults with careers confessing that they never felt comfortable enough to bring their many problems to him. This of course relates to the film's title. Everyone's not okay but because that's what Daddy wants that's what we will all pretend.But the film also looks at the way these genderfamily roles are upheld not just by the patriarch but by the kids themselves. Both father and offspring are emotionally distant because they falsely believe it to be in everybody's best interest. What this results in is a mutually upheld illusion. And so what the film's advocating is not only a kind of emotional honesty or openness but a willingness to pass disappointment and suffering around the table. This of course is a traumatic thing to do. Humans are creatures of denial and it would take a far greater artist to deal with this subject properly.De Niro is often very bad at playing insular characters often resorting to face pulling and odd mugging but here he is excellent stand out scenes including him breaking down in a hospital bed reminiscing about his children when they were younger and a great fantasy scene around a table. The supporting cast is equally great with Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsdale  both of whom are racking up a slew of excellent independent films  and Drew Barrymore who does her usual infectious ray of sunshine routine.Aesthetically the film's direction is flat and uninspired and its symbolism is a bit forced with De Niro playing a blue collar worker who spent most of his life stringing telephone wires across the country. Get it? He has communication problems but his life's work keeps the country in touch.The film has been bashed by critics for being manipulative sentimental contrived and resemblant of made for cable movies. This is all true. But the film plays well on the small screen and does several things well at times going further than fare like Broken Flowers and About Schmidt.The film was marketed as a comedy but is not. It is quite dark and melancholic dwelling mostly on regret and disappointment with the occasional tearjerker moment shamelessly thrown in.7.910  De Niro's best work in decades. The film is heavily flawed but generally moving and will strike a chord mostly with ageing fathers and children with quietly domineering parents. IMDb statistics show that the film is ranked higher by males and females under the age of 18 suggesting that the film resonates with kids guilty over disappointing their parents.Worth one viewing. Makes a good companion piece to The Savages.".

The film saw a surprise premiere after another in the festival was canceled. The visuals are like nothing I have ever seen before spectacular epic ... words cannot describe this masterpiece of cinematography. Every scene is a work of art. The color palate is so rich from the bright orange of desert mountains to the vibrant red of a bloodsoaked sheet to the opulent green of the Indian's attire. The first five minutes of the film were arresting the haunting soundtrack the beautiful black and white images I had goosebumps.The acting seems very candid very real. The young Romania actress playing the role of Alexandria is adorable and Lee Pace as always is superb as the hospitalized paraplegic stuntman. The characters were absorbing and the story captivating. And where many films were unworthy of the title of A Fairytale for Adults this film truly is. It is about love death adventure responsibility and growing up.The sheer magnitude of this film is unbelievable shot in 18 countries spanning many years for the director to scout locations and cast appropriate actors it is a true work of genius and a commitment by all cast and crew. I just hope that the filmmakers get enough out of the commercial end of this movie to compensate them for the great effort that so obviously went into the making of this film and so that we might possibly get another like it in the future.".

Moreover this film could be watched on mute and still make a lasting impression on the viewer through its striking imagery. The Fall is the story of Alexandria an injured immigrant child wandering the hospital where she is being treated. The viewer is drawn with Alexandria into a dark and extravagant world through the story of a maimed stuntman who she befriends. The skilled interaction between the finely divided reality and fantasy is reminiscent of David Cronenberg's eXistenZ. I can not recommend this film any more strongly.".

Anyway I have just seen it and boy was I amazed. Imagine 300's picture having one of the deepest plots that have ever been made and having the independence that even the most indiest indie film would have times ten. Imagine the stories that you made up and lived in under the blanket of your bed at night when your parents were asleep. Imagine that you still have an imagination of a child and an experience of a grownup who had been struck by the truth that usually breaks people's dreams and illusions. This is The Fall. Honestly I have never seen anything like this before. Being all obsessed with movies and watching every single one that seems interesting I have never ever seen such power and independence in a film. Independent films usually have their common indie feel  a crooky picture that shows protest to all the camera glamour that most of Hollywood films have lack of dialogues filled with deep thoughtful pauses and this pretentiousness that screams this is a masterpiece protest to Hollywood!. Hell no  The Fall has nothing of that at all. Having a breathtakingly gorgeous picture it has smart dialogues and striking truth that is being told by a broken man to a little dreamful girl. This is not a protest  this is just a story one man named Tarsem had courage to tell. I may call it a genius piece of cinematography a masterpiece and something like that but loud words like these doesn't fit this experience that you will have to encounter by yourself. Believe me you won't find the right words to describe the feel that you will have after watching this one.".

Alexandria works with her family of immigrants in the harvest of oranges and she has just lost her father. When she meets the injured stuntman Roy Walker Lee Pace recovering from a fall and also brokenhearted with the loss of his girlfriend to the lead actor he begins to tell a fantastic tale about six heroes and their common enemy the hideous Governor Odious. Black Bandit that lost his brother Blue Bandit that was killed by Odious' men the expert in explosives Luigi that was outcast in his town by Odious the Indian that lost his gorgeous wife that was abducted by Odious the former slave Otta Benga that lost his twin brother in the fields of Odious Charles Darwin that receives a rare Mistica Americana butterfly killed by Odious and Mystic that hated Odious that destroyed the fauna and flora of his lands join forces to defeat the evil Odious. While Alexandria fantasizes the story projecting the images of her acquaintances in the characters the heartsick Roy uses her innocence to ask the girl to still morphine and medicines from the dispensary for him to commit suicide. The Fall is one of the most original films that I have recently watched. This adventure has a stunning opening sequence in black and white and slow motion with the Allegretto from Ludwig van Beethoven's 17701827 Symphony  7 in A mayor Opus 92 in the soundtrack. The story entwines reality and fiction burring the situations in a certain moment and may be understood in many layers therefore this dramatic feature can also been seen by children and is a great family entertainment. The cinematography sets and locations are very beautiful and bright with intense use of colors. This is the type of movie that deserves to be watched more than once to have the full understanding of all situations. My vote is eight. Title Brazil Dubl de Anjo Stunt of Angel".

	schema:headline " If you liked Cinema Paradiso and the Princess Bride then you will also love this film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie at the Toronto film festival the Elgin Theater.First off it was nice to see a film where the director had complete creative control to execute his vision. This film does not suffer the fate of marketers or no talent Hollywood producers who think they are artist or visionaries.If you liked Cinema Paradiso and the Princess Bride then you will also love this film. Tarsem's lavish imagery and fantastic locations create the atmosphere for an epic adventure while the acting of Lee Pace Justine Waddell and especially Cantinca Untaru provide the drama and laughter.First Cantinca Untaru as Alexandria is superb. I normally avoid films with children as they are usually cheesy or groan worthy. Cantinca however is much like the little boy in Cinema Paradiso a natural child. When Alexandria says things we believe her when she does things it is her child like nature we are watching come out. There is nothing stiff or unnatural about this young actress and it is a great credit to Tarsem as a director that he was able to pull this level of acting from a child. While watching the movie I was amazed at how Tarsem and Cantinca were able to move the audience from laughter to tears and back to laughter so fluidly. Lee Pace puts in an excellent show and does a great job as a suicidal patient in the hospital but Cantinca is definitely the star of this show.Tarsem has a great eye for location and he exhibits it well in this movie. It truly was shot all over the world. Along with all the great locations are the beautifully colorful costumes of fashion designer Eiko Ishioka. The costumes are larger than life and beautiful in their symbolism.So having said all that I would highly recommend this movie. This is one of those rare films that actually does have a bit of something for everyone yet keeps its integrity.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this movie at the Toronto film festival the Elgin Theater.First off it was nice to see a film where the director had complete creative control to execute his vision. This film does not suffer the fate of marketers or no talent Hollywood producers who think they are artist or visionaries.If you liked Cinema Paradiso and the Princess Bride then you will also love this film. Tarsem's lavish imagery and fantastic locations create the atmosphere for an epic adventure while the acting of Lee Pace Justine Waddell and especially Cantinca Untaru provide the drama and laughter.First Cantinca Untaru as Alexandria is superb. I normally avoid films with children as they are usually cheesy or groan worthy. Cantinca however is much like the little boy in Cinema Paradiso a natural child. When Alexandria says things we believe her when she does things it is her child like nature we are watching come out. There is nothing stiff or unnatural about this young actress and it is a great credit to Tarsem as a director that he was able to pull this level of acting from a child. While watching the movie I was amazed at how Tarsem and Cantinca were able to move the audience from laughter to tears and back to laughter so fluidly. Lee Pace puts in an excellent show and does a great job as a suicidal patient in the hospital but Cantinca is definitely the star of this show.Tarsem has a great eye for location and he exhibits it well in this movie. It truly was shot all over the world. Along with all the great locations are the beautifully colorful costumes of fashion designer Eiko Ishioka.

	schema:headline " Not Arthouse But An Excellent Film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have just seen this film in Berlin and I felt it my duty to comment on reading some comments made here about the film.One person wrote To paraphrase Hudsucker Proxy The Fall fails because there are 2 storiesone based in reality and the other fantasy. And they are equally important. One take you away visually without connection to any of the characters or emotions. The reality takes hold to your emotion but it can not hold on for long as the fantasy part resumes. That was the problem for me.I disagree completely the fantasy scenes have a very significant connection to the characters and emotions the inconsistencies in the story told by the crippled stuntman Roy played by Lee Pace reflect his unstable mental state and the dark ending portrays his disintegrating sense of morality. The story is told by Roy we see how his character develops through the plot of the story he tells for example in the closing scenes when he is manically depressedhe starts killing off the beloved characters conveying his extremely pessimistic attitude towards life in general as a result of everything that has happened to him.I found the two stories equally gripping and was engaged emotionally throughout. I found that every time it switched from fantasy to reality i desperately wanted to know and see more and vice versa. The acting was superb from both Lee Pace and also Catinca Untaru. The interaction between them was not as it usually is with child actors wooden but completely believable and natural. I wonder how Tarsem coaxed such a genuine performance from someone so young. I have never seen a movie like this and I doubt there has every been one made quite like it. The visuals are literally breathtaking i was not aware such beauty exists and it is criminal that it has not been filmed before. At the same time this film is actually quite funny i laughed out loud on a few occasions. I dismiss claims that this is an arthouse film yes the visuals are stunning but the film has to be recognised as not only a collection of beautiful images but a heartwarming epic wonderful film. This film has something for everyone I hope it does well.A truly excellent film I recommend it to anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "With a nice sprinkling of humor and an endearing quality of childhood this tale cuts between reality and the minds' of our two leads as they journey together inside a myth with bandits seeking revenge for the wrongs done to them. Much like The Wizard of Oz we see the duality of characters from the real world standing in for the heroes in the story. Young Alexandria uses what she knows to encompass herself into the fairy tale as her new friend Roy weaves a yarn of intrigue not to lift the child's spirits but instead for his own selfish gains.A big part of the film can be seen in the line from Pace's Roy Are you trying to save my soul? He jokes it after Alexandria gives him some food she stole a Eucharist from the hospital chapel yet we as an audience know the truth behind those words. While this Spanish girl is really only attempting to connect with someone that will give her attention and friendship after breaking her arm working the orange groves she is unintentionally doing just that. She is giving this man a reason to live whether he realizes it himself or even wants it at all. Injuring himself with a suicide attempt on set of his new movie this stunt man may be on the mend but his heart is still broken from his girlfriend leaving for the film's star. Still desperately trying to find a way to end his life Roy begins to tell a story of a battle against insurmountable odds a group of five bandits looking for revenge and not caring what happens to them in order to achieve it. Always stopping short at the best parts when the story gets beautiful as Alexandria says in her broken English Roy begins to use the girl in order to acquire pills for which to overdose on. He feels bad for his ruse and doesn't want the young girl to see him in his current state but the pain of his heart is too much to bear.Visually stunning the art direction is breathtaking. I don't care what bad things I've heard about Tarsem's first film The Cell I need to see it as soon as possible based solely on the artistry displayed here. Right from the start we are treated to the credit sequence in slow motion black and white beauty. Unaware in the moment of what it is exactly we are seeing the subtle melancholy of the sequence is unshakable as we begin our entry into the real world at a convalescence hospital. The imagery stays with you though and shortly you are transported back into that world of intrigue with Eastern influences vast dunes of sand labyrinthine temples and cities and clear crisp imagery choreographed with a technical genius. Every character in the story comes from a different part of the world with a specific skill and culture. We have the African slave the Indian swordsman Charles Darwin and his monkey Wallace the Teddy Rooseveltesquire explosive specialist the mystic seeker brought forth from a burning tree and our hero the masked bandit. Each costume is crafted with care and grace filling the frame with a sumptuous beauty to mesmerize you for the duration and allow the separation between this fabricated reality for the dreary one of pain and solitude always waiting to come back outside their minds.While my eyes were treated to a gorgeous display thankfully my mind was not left behind. One may anticipate this being a children's film a world of make believe as two souls come together in order to save each other. On the surface this fact can be agreed upon however this is a very dark tale that maybe undeserving of its Rrating pulls no punches as far as showing the cruelty of the world rather than sugarcoating a message into the proceedings. As Roy says everything dies. This is a very true statement and Tarsem never shies from showing the reality of that situation when necessary. Both in the real world and that of imagination we are shown instances that are very difficult to watch. Emotionally draining at times this is not your runofthemill cautionary tale it will tear your heart out and show you the pain that exists inside of Roy. Complete with a scene of stopmotion animation showing us the inner workings of Alexandria's mind in duress this film takes you to the edge and sometimes over.These moments of emotional weight hinge on the stellar performances of all involved most importantly those of Pace and Catinca Untaru. Pace has the range to play the fictional hero fighting against the evil Governor Odious and still be the broken man bedridden and finished with life. And Untaru shows an immense sense of realism as this Spanish girl listening to a tale of wonderment dealing with issues of loss and sacrifice complete with a very tenuous grasp on the English language. What at times seems too natural her quizzical looks when not understanding what Pace says to her and therefore just smiling or repeating herself becomes utter genius when we catch her lying to both mother and doctor as she plays translator between them. The poise grace and abundance of life both to smile and to cry is unbelievable and without her this film wouldn't have been near as good as it is. The two have a brilliant rapport causing the audience to giggle at their language gap and tongueincheek moments when the story is shown to be just that ever changing as the tellers evolve it and to feel the bond being forged. With a climax that is difficult to watch yet utterly entrancing through the tears and anger being let out The Fall never ceases to amaze and I cannot wait to immerse my entire being into this magical world again.".

We may never see another film like this one that uses real locations and practical effects but which has all of the other benefits of technology. Just the scope in impress of the thing makes it a thrill. Not only do we skip from one profound space to another but Singhhas selected what seems to be the very best location for the eye. Often these are Tarkovskylike so that we can see some action in the foreground and with a pan other action in the background. I doubt his DP made these decisions so the choices are more remarkable.The Cell had some powerful images but they were incoherent as if they were designed by competing art departments. No such problem here. Not only do the imaginary sequences have the same color palette as it changes even though the locations are a bewildering variety but all the other artistic values do as well. We could well have different continents mixed in the same few minutes without a situational shift. That alone is a rare and worthy experience. A second striking aspect is the narrative folding. At first glance it is simple and ordinary a nested story with blended elements. But overlain n this is a parallel nesting about stories and movies being a movie about moviemaking. And falls deliberate and staged with some deep ambiguity about which is which. And which are physical and which emotional. It isn't great art but its head and shoulders above most.And finally we have the little girl. Now I usually revolt when these are used to elicit the standard response. I gagged at Miss Sunshine because it was a weak project supported by cuteness. But this is a wholly different thing. This girl is fantastic. There are parts of the script that are embarrassing and the end is a travesty of a story setup. But she pulls it off and we hardly notice.This has one of the most impressive title sequences I have ever seen. It alone deserves praise.I would trade ten Pan's Labyrinths for one of these.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "The FallAn outrageous imagination and sense of colors combine to make this film beautiful. I think the story is too thin for adults and a little too dark for kids. There is death a violence and terrible sadness but it's also an interesting movie rich in ideas and humanity. It reminds us that fiction is real to the one who imagines it. An adult might read with detachment but kids know the truth. This film takes place in Los Angeles hospital in the 1920s. Alexandria is a curious 5 years old child with broken arm and she meets a friend named Roy Walker. He was a movie stunt man with legs paralyzed after a fall. He tell Alexandria stories including one about Emperor Alexander and the second story of six men Lury an explosion expert a Native American Indian a runaway slave an East Indian swordsman a masked bandit and Charles Darwin. They want to kill the oppressive Spanish Governor Odious for all the injustices on each of them. This is an epic story of love and revenge. This film capture each amazing setting architectural oddities and every kind of epic landscape long long trip through the museum. This film jumps from humor comedy to documentary to wrenching drama. There's no real sense of suspense in the plot beyond wondering what setting we'll arrive next. When Roy Walker asks Alexandria to steal morphine for him so he can commit suicide she steals the medicine for him and as a result he continues with the story. I think Alexandria was little confused about the morphine because she doesn't have clear idea of how Roy is going to use the medicine. When she was looking for the medicine last time she has an accident but she didn't realize the dangerous. She only wants to give the morphine to Roy because he was in depressed. All of the actors in story represent characters in Alexandria's real world. The Magic is an orange picker and the princess is a nurse. The movie also has a double function capturing both the brilliant vistas of Alexandria's fanny and the duskier shadowed limits of a hospital. Became it is something close to metaphor it's a fictions within a fiction about the curative power and possessive attract of fiction. Who own a tale? The one who tells it? Or the one who is listening? Both became invested in the telling. This film shows how you can play with your imagination and how it doesn't have limits. It also shows how you can change. I love and learn a lot from this movie.".

I only got a copy of 'The Fall' from one of my friends he didn't even watch it so i had no info from him. I'm delighted i watched this without knowing what to expect it added to the film's impact. I had no preconceptions or bias views to take into it which proved worthwhile. The film is set in a 1920's Los Angeles hospital. Our two protagonists are complete opposites a crippled stuntman with a deteriorating mental stateLee Pace and a young girl with a flourishing imaginative mindCatinca Untaru. Obviously there isn't much to do in a 1920's hospital and so RoyLee Pace begins to tell AlexandriaCatinca a mystical fantasy tale of five 'bandits' on a globetrotting quest. The film contains some of the most amazing visual imagery i have seen. And for that alone i would have rated this movie highly. However it also has a moving subplot to compliment the fantasy one of a very adult nature. Its almost like a gritty Tolkien tale. I also must take a moment to praise the acting of the fantastic Catinca Untaru. It was one of the most believable performances i have seen from a child actor since Danny Lloyd played 'Danny Torrance' in 'The Shining'. I'm sure Lee Pace had no problems working with this child actor Pace also gave an excellent performance. The two were cast perfectly. When the end credits rolled i found myself feeling empty but not because the film was poor the complete opposite. An emptiness brought on by loss i was missing the film already it felt like a friend had left. I had laughed and cried throughout the film and was now distraught to have seen it end and really isn't that the best compliment you could pay to a movie?".

I was glad I saw this in theaters on a big screen one of the most vibrant and beautiful things I've ever seen anywhere and at anytime. If you've seen Tarsem's first film The Cell you've got an idea of this directors abilities to work with both visuals and performershe mad JLo passable. Alxandria is played by one the best child actress I've seen in a very long time a 5 year old who speaks like a 5 year old which injects a good helping of humor into the story.

	schema:headline " A film for devotees of bizarre and exquisite imagery";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Fall' has an endless series of incredibly exotic and beautiful visuals and deserves to be seen just for that. Tarsem Singh's use of oddly contrasting main characters and costumes recalls Alejandro Jodorovsky and the mlange of seldomseen people and places mimics the latecareer cinematic working methods of Pier Paolo Pasolini. The trompe l'oeil landscapesintofaces obviously evoke some of the paintings of Salvador Dali. The director previously made 'The Cell' 2000 a darker film with an equally intense focus on bizarre fantasy and a blurred interface between reality and the visions of the unconscious.Even Tarsems' two main characterson whose appeal the success of the frame story dependsare again a study in exotic contrasts. They are a burly boyishly appealing American stunt man named Roy Lee Pace and a preternaturally articulate but heavily accented little Romanian girl Alexandria Catinca Untaru like him injured in a fall he off a bridge she from an orange tree. They develop an offbeat friendship in a hospital. He tells her stories which constitute the colorful side of the movie and are also an elaborate allegory or dreamvision about his own life at least in that the evil ruler he describes Governor Odius Daniel Caltagirone is his reallife love rival a silent film star named Sinclairand as time goes on many of the characters in the fantasy stories begin to turn up in the hospital as staff or visitors. Eventually the two realities slip into and out of each other with more and more dizzying regularity.The presenttime setting after all is exotic too and production designer Ged Clarke's most lavish contribution to the project. It's an early twentiethcentury California hospital staffed by Catholic nuns. Lying in his bed there Roy the apparently paralyzed stunt man tells Alexandria the tales of a set of men with revenge wishes toward the evil Odius. One of this band of warriors is Roy. The rest who may also be manifestations of him are an Indian Jeetu Verma  an Italian explosives wizard Robin Smith a magnificent black exslave called Otta Benga Marcus Wesley Charles Darwin Leo Bill accompanied by his shy genius pet monkey Wallace and sometimes a wildeyed fakir Julian Bleach. The main fantasy costumes are brilliantly conceived by the fashion designer Eiko Ishioka.Roy's purpose is to use his storytelling Sheherezadestyle as a cliffhanging device to coax Alexandria into stealing morphine from the dispensary with which he intends to commit suicide though at first she doesn't know that. Nothing is clear and nothing is resolved in the present. Eventually the real time events progressively come to seem as surreal as Roy's narratives. It's not clear to me for what purpose these stories were ultimately conceived by Tarsem and his writers Dan Gilroy and Nico Soultanakis other than to provide the framework for the astonishingly beautiful fantasies mostly depicting confrontations and battles both spiritual and physical. There is some ugly violence and yet it's all beautiful. Everything is aestheticized. Even blood is gorgeous. Red is a pretty color after all. Certain landscapes and architectural wonders linger in the mind though sometimes what happens in them is overshadowed by one's curiosity about what the location was of the 26 in over 18 countries that were used by the patient Tarsem who took years to make this and funded it out of his own money. There are many falls there is much talk of butterflies. One of the film's tourdeforce transitions moves from a butterfly into a landscape in a lepedopteral shape. Darwin's monkey by the way is a skillful lepidopterist. Among the astonishing visual tricks at one point the slave Otta Benga's back is completely filled with long arrows and he falls over backward and is suspended above ground on them. A wedding in a large spectacular orientalbaroque building is ornamented by whirling dervishes Tarsem and his cinematographer Colin Watkinson have as keen a sense of architecture as of landscape and every images is beautifully composed. The revengers are at first stuck on a little island but are rescued by a small elephant they and the elephant are beautiful seen underwater. In front of a palace in the Far East a big red teardrop design Talbot Largo lives up to its reputation as the most beautiful car in the world. A friendly black man delivers ice to the hospital from a tiny truck and teases Alexandria for trying to lick it. He turns out to be Otta Benga in an earthly form. There is more and more and yet it never seems too much because it is all so gorgeous and because constant returns to Roy and Alexandria bring us back to earth as in the 1981 Bulgarian film 'Yo Ho Ho' to which this owes a debt and Dennis Potter's 'The Singing Detective.' It seems some sequences don't mesh properly. If that's because Alexandria and Roy reimagine the storyline images trump logic in an emotionally logical wayif without final resolution.Little Alexandria is appealing and Untaru may become a wonderful adult actress but her speech is sometimes garbled and hard to follow some of the dialog with Ropuy is awkwardly improvised at cross purposes. The latter scenes between the invalid pals become increasingly maudlin weepy and sad and that sadness has already become hard to care about because it's out of focus and even comic at times.In the NY Times Nathan Lee offputtingly declared that 'The Fall' is a genuine labor of loveand a real bore. I didn't take it that way. It's no more a bore than Jodorovsky. And it has more humanity. But there's no doubt that the audacious and beautiful staging of the fantasy scenes outweighs the narrative value of the movie. A bore for some perhaps this will be a cult classic for others. It has few equals. As a visual stunner it can hardly be too highly rated.Released in the US May 9 2008 111 theaters.".

A wedding in a large spectacular orientalbaroque building is ornamented by whirling dervishes Tarsem and his cinematographer Colin Watkinson have as keen a sense of architecture as of landscape and every images is beautifully composed. The revengers are at first stuck on a little island but are rescued by a small elephant they and the elephant are beautiful seen underwater. In front of a palace in the Far East a big red teardrop design Talbot Largo lives up to its reputation as the most beautiful car in the world. A friendly black man delivers ice to the hospital from a tiny truck and teases Alexandria for trying to lick it. He turns out to be Otta Benga in an earthly form. There is more and more and yet it never seems too much because it is all so gorgeous and because constant returns to Roy and Alexandria bring us back to earth as in the 1981 Bulgarian film 'Yo Ho Ho' to which this owes a debt and Dennis Potter's 'The Singing Detective.' It seems some sequences don't mesh properly. If that's because Alexandria and Roy reimagine the storyline images trump logic in an emotionally logical wayif without final resolution.Little Alexandria is appealing and Untaru may become a wonderful adult actress but her speech is sometimes garbled and hard to follow some of the dialog with Ropuy is awkwardly improvised at cross purposes. The latter scenes between the invalid pals become increasingly maudlin weepy and sad and that sadness has already become hard to care about because it's out of focus and even comic at times.In the NY Times Nathan Lee offputtingly declared that 'The Fall' is a genuine labor of loveand a real bore. I didn't take it that way. It's no more a bore than Jodorovsky. And it has more humanity. But there's no doubt that the audacious and beautiful staging of the fantasy scenes outweighs the narrative value of the movie. A bore for some perhaps this will be a cult classic for others. It has few equals. As a visual stunner it can hardly be too highly rated.Released in the US May 9 2008 111 theaters.";

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw The Fall after hearing about it for some time and while watching it thought two things. 1 It brought to mind Pan's Labyrinth and 2 showed me that while The Fall was far from a perfect movie it points out everything that's wrong with Pan. To misquote Roger Ebert I hated hated hated that movie. That's what this review will be about and if you don't want to hear my comparisons of the two films with that slant don't read any more.Both Pan and Fall are personal stylized films that concern young girls in situations where their childhood innocence is in jeopardy and refugeof sortsis found in a fantasy world that has nebulous borders with reality. Both little girls are required to complete tasks that require them to be more adult than they are prepared to be to serve the needs of someone else and in both cases the fantasy worlds they wander in which are generally more malevolent than fanciful act as a mirror and commentary to this journey symbolic representations of their inner journeys.The first noticeable difference is in look. The Fall is jawdroppingly bright and beautiful the imagery echoes Fellini Gilliam and Jodorowsky in terms of amount of work undertaken just to get one single shot as beautifully rendered as possible. By contrast del Toro's film has a sort of Hensonesque knockoff feel to it the sort of blue and black color scheme that has been around since the 80's. The fantasy world of the film is bleak ugly and unfriendly a terrible place that no one would want to go and doesn't look much different than the real world the characters inhabit.Technically both films sport incredible attention to detail and a filmmaker in love with his art and style often to the detriment of story. Watching The Fall to the end it's clear there wasn't one wasted frame it just seemed confusing because one didn't know what the outcome was going to be ie you had to actually think a bit. Pan is full of sidetracks and tangents clearly because the director simply thought it would be neato if certain creatures looked or acted the way they did and the same with the human characters who don't resemble real people any more than the monsters.The performances of Lee Pace and an alarmingly talented Catinca Untaru in The Fall are so real and touching it's like watching a magician performit's hard to believe that what you're seeing isn't real. You like Fall's characters even though Roy is a reprehensible broken being that you should hate. Pan's sympathetic characters are so remote and unknowable you can't like them at all they're just more props for del Toro to move around like his drippingwithgoo puppets and dark etched walls.Thematically Pan presents a universe in which there is little or no hope presided over by an evil human being who has no human attributes and is All Bad All The Time. The plot exists only to point out the unpleasant and NOT universally shared belief that life is to be suffered through martyrlike in order that one find rewards and riches in the afterlife that you were denied on earth. The violence is gratuitous and mean in a way that far from being brutally honest speaks more about the immaturity of a director who couldn't stop himself from going too far for kicks.The Fall on the other hand assembles a crazy quilt of subtle clues that present a world that is complex interesting and realistic. In life unlike a scripted movie things just keep going no one knows exactly what to do and there's good and bad to be found everywhere at various times. For every answer there's a question but the sooner you learn to live with the knowledge of these things the easier your life will gosomething everyone can appreciate learning even if they don't like hearing it. The fantasy world created is a brilliant fusion of what a man is dreaming up and how a little girl interprets what he says and despite some silly humor the world is indeed very fairy tale like and magical. The violence is also gratuitous in parts but violence IS ugly and as the young Alexandria is literally forced to find out it can't always be avoided...but it can be dealt with in a world of hope. Director Tarsem obviously knows a thing or two about grief management and loss and how to battle through to come to peace on the other end. The denouement of The Fall is a beautiful moment that avoids being cloying and oversentimental while still being satisfying and very moving.Finally in Pan a young girl is forced by allpowerful unknowable forces to complete a task that doesn't make sense to her and in the end is rewarded with a crown. In The Fall a young girl is guided by an unknowable force into an interaction with a damaged soul that sends her on a journey that doesn't make sense to her but ultimately gives her tools to grow learn and lead a more fulfilling existence from then on. The choice of which is the better film is as obvious to me as a brightly colored butterfly.".

It took 4 years to make and was filmed in I think 18 different countries.The year is roughly 19151917 before troops come home from WW I and the scene is a halfoccupied hospital in southern California.One patient is an actorstunt man in silent films who was injured in a movie and is paraplegic. A 67 y.o. immigrant girl Alexandria also a patient visits him she has a broken arm from falling from a ladder while picking oranges with her family.He tells her a story in many installments about a despised Gov. Odious in a faroff country and the efforts of 5 people to overthrow him in retaliation for hurts he's made on their loved ones or them. The installments take place in many varied stunning landscapes and in many stunning architectural sites e.g. the Taj Mahal  many others.The characters and sites in the various episodes of the story are those of Alexandria's imagination. The actor for instance mentions an Indian and his squaw but for Alexandria Indian means someone from India so that's who's depicted.The photography and scenes in the tales are great remarkable. While this film has not gathered much praise from film critics Roger Ebert's is an exception please see he considers it like nothing else ever made it HAS generated MUCH praise from many viewers some of whom see it multiple times considering it one of the best movies ever. It seems on its way to becoming a cult classic.There are 2 parallel stories  one is the growing relationship between the girl Alexandria and the paralyzed actor in despair over his physical condition and the loss of his girlfriend to someone else and the other is the stories he tells Alexandria and which we view as in her vivid imagination. The narrative dips into despair until finally achieving redemption.Some violence is present but IMO most is handled in such a way as to be tolerable as an imaginary violence. For instance one character has so many arrows shot and stuck into his back that he falls backwards and lies there belly up as if a coffee table suspended by hundreds of arrowcaterpillar legs. There is also some subtle humor Darwin is one of the 5 who seek to overthrow Gov. Odious Darwin has a pet monkey Wallace from which he occasionally seeks advice. Alfred Russell Wallace sent the actual Darwin a paper proposing a similar theory to Darwin's that prompted Darwin to finally present his own together with Wallace's.A MOST unusual film like nothing else in your experience.IMO most of the film deserves a 10 for photographysettings and the intertwining stories between the stuntman and the girl together with the girl's imagined view of his stories. But I've rated it a 9 because it was hard to understand the girl's voice and words plus the ending seemed a little weak and muddy.".

William Blake travels to the extreme western frontiers of America sometime in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Lost and badly wounded he encounters a very odd outcast Native American named Nobody who believes Blake is actually the dead English poet of the same name. The story with Nobody's help leads William Blake through situations that are in turn comical and violent. Contrary to his nature circumstances transform Blake into a hunted outlaw a killer and a man whose physical existence is slowly slipping away. Thrown into a world that is cruel and chaotic his eyes are opened to the fragility that defines the realm of the living. It is as though he passes through the surface of a mirror and emerges into a previouslyunknown world that exists on the other side.";

In fact the best interpretation is that he is not quite dead but dying comatose that enables the film to work equally well on two levels.Here's the key thing the real poet William Blake had visions and wrote a book called The Marriage of Heaven and Hell geddit?. This book is written in a weird style that sounds quite like Indianspeak. In fact several of Nobody's lines are taken straight from the this book such as The eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the crow. Ironically in the film Blake does not understand any of what Nobody is saying and calls it Indian malarkey.We can take Nobody for a bit foolish in a realworld sense but in the spiritual world we must assume he knows what he is talking about. When he asks Blake did you kill the man who killed you? and Blake answers I'm not dead we can assume that Nobody's knows something Blake doesn't. In a scene cut from the final film Nobody says that he saw a bluebird drinking the blood from Blake's wound. This obviously showed Nobody that Blake's soul was worth saving  otherwise it would have been a vulture not a bluebird on his chest.Nobody  no body.

They are each more or less indestructible except that like good and evil themselves they can cancel each other out as they do at the end.Everyone met along the way shows various types of human fallibility or degeneracy and each comes to a bad end weeded out in the purgatorial process.The dead deer represents the woman he met in Machine and bears the same wound. The embracing of the deer is Christiantype imagery providing some indication of the good redeeming side of Blake's character. During his trials Nobody gives him the odd test Blake shows both good and bad aspects to his character and so at the end we can assume he drifts off into neither heaven nor hell but in limbo.There's surely more. For example the sheriff's head that Cole crushes under his boot is an exact replica of Lenin  implying that communism is more evil than Evil. And I was interested to see one reviewer mention that the name of the bar in Machine has some relation to the death of Stalin's wife.No doubt the film is worth more than one viewing. However you look at it it's a terrific creation.".

Neil Young's electric score churns like a ghost train and pushes the film farther. There isn't one performance that is wrong nor is there ever a false moment.

	schema:headline " A wonderful journey through life and death...";
	schema:reviewBody "The Western genre has always been misunderstood as a simplistic racist and misogynistic traditional genre due to the many mediocre Westerns of the 40s and 50s. However real good Westerns have delighted us with complex stories that take advantage of the setting themes the conflict between honor  law wilderness  civilization and life  death. Director Jim Jarmusch who has achieved fame and recognition in the independent film community uses the elements of the Western genre to create his very own poetical meditation on these themes giving the genre his personal touch crafting a powerful and original gem.Young accountant William Blake Johnny Depp seems to have lost everything as his parents have died and his fiance left him without a reason so he decides to take a job in Machine a town located at the end of civilization in the Wild Wild West. To his misfortune the job he applied to has already been taken and now he finds himself really without nothing. However his life will change forever after by a series of circumstances he ends up murdering a man becoming an outlaw although getting badly wounded in the process. Now traveling along an outcast native who calls himself Nobody Gary Farmer he'll begin a strange and surreal trip that'll prepare him for the next stage.Written by Jarmusch himself the film's story details Blake's trip guided by Nobody in a similar way to Dante's journey in The Divine Comedy where a series of episodes are used to explore different ideas and themes across the trip. Jarmusch subtlety mixes drama and comedy to deliver his philosophical meditation making the film an entertaining experience never becoming boring or tiresome. The Western setting is used effectively to tell this story and Dead Man toys with the Western elements in a subtle respectful and quite entertaining way that neither parodies it nor makes fun of it in any way.Shot entirely in black and white the cinematography by Jarmusch regular Robby Mller captures that feeling of loneliness and emptiness that William Blake's life has as well as his collision with the wilderness of the wild west. Jarmusch camerawork together with Neil Young's excellent soundtrack give the film a beautiful surreal look that echoes Blake's equally surreal journey across the darkness searching for light. Finally another interesting point is Jarmusch extensive care for detail in his portrayal of the American west as well as his respect for the Native American cultures that play an important role in his film making Dead Man one of the most realist Westerns ever made.Johnny Depp's performance is remarkable and probably one of the best in his career. Blake's complete transformation across the film is a real challenge and Depp makes the most of it. Gary Farmer is equally excellent and he is as effective in the comedy scenes as he is in the drama scenes showing his flexibility and talent. The supporting roles present an assortment of cameos where actors such as Crispin Glover Lance Henriksen John Hurt and Robert Mitchum in his last role appear giving outstanding performances despite the limited screen time they receive. Henriksen certainly delivers his best performance in years.Jarmusch's film is a brilliant poetical meditation of life and death but its episodic nature make it feel even more slow than it is as every vignette is separated by fade outs that break the mood created. This really damages the film's atmosphere as it feels as a forced wake up after a pleasant dream. Another problem is that fans expecting an actionfilled Western may end up disappointed so bear in mind that this film is more about feelings rather than actions. Despite his minor problems the film is still a very enjoyable experience and a whole new way to experience Westerns so even nonfans of the genre will appreciate it.To summarize Dead Man is an atypical look at Westerns that presents Jarmusch's interesting views on life and death in an entertaining attractive way. Among the revisionist westerns Dead Man is a valuable gem that is worth a watch. Even nonfans of the genre will find something interesting in it. 910".

Nobody serves as William Blake's savior doctor guide and boatman across the river. Neil Young wrote and performed the score.

Delightful cameos include Robert Mitchum Crispin Glover Gabriel Byrne John Heard and others.Symbolism aboundsthere are shooting stars downshots of a hellish factory where Blake wanders looking for a way out mines and factories of whiteman's metal plenty of dead animals including a small doe that Depp lies down with after decorating his face with its blood.But the movie doesn't fall into the trap of making white men the fall guys for everything wrong with the world in which Blake and Nobody try to make a living. Nobody mistreats Blake's bullet wound and is arguably responsible for his ultimate predicament. Nobody isn't worldly despite having seen Europe in his youth. He believes the same white people were in every town he visited. The northwest tribe visited at the end were petty people who obviously thought Blake and Nobody were not worth their attention evidenced by Nobody's imprecations to walk proud to the mortallywounded Blake and his nervousness at what might happen if he didn't. And of course there is Nobody's innocent belief that the hapless accountant is the historical poet and artist.Held together with Young's musical scoremixed a tad loud for my tasteand the deterioration of the finances and health of William Blake Dead Man is more than a picaresque but the overall theme is elusive.

Personal friendship religion wealth work technology tribe humanity God loveall mean nothing or are actively detrimental. For a movie named Dead Man that's not an unreasonable interpretation.Depp is an ideal actor to portray the reluctant gunslinger and his personality does more to hold the film together than any other single factor.

	schema:headline " Inescapable Doom at the End of the Line";
	schema:reviewBody "Heading towards a metalworks factory at the edge of the known universe a pristine young accountant named William Blake steps into the ungodly mechanical hell that is the town of Machine. And so begins this man's descent into purgatory...in the wrong place at a point where time itself is nonexistent. Blake arrives in Machine after a demented tireless train ride through what may be his own self. Spanning the beauty of epic horizons and dense forests yet ending in the bleak misery of the barren desert we meet this outofplace traveler in a tiring strange situation. His frailty is evident alone without a living heir struggling to make his way amidst the freaks and grim destination that awaits. As expected the town itself begs no welcome as the malevolent rumors prove true and leave Blake face to face with the dusty spines of inexorable destiny. In more ways than one the Wild West awaits...From this point on Blake embarks on his surrealistic journey into nothingness as he becomes a marked man running from nearly everyone and everything. Trusting in a Native friend appropriately named Nobody' the descent into Blake's rejection is juxtaposed with the realities of a truly inescapable destiny. As such the notions of ill fate and bad luck are separately defined alongside each other. Soon enough however Blake learns to cope with the road to ruin and from his relationship with Nobody he begins to transform into the gunslinging poet he never was.In these aspects  the premise the cinematic device and the endless attention to narrative and metaphoric detail  the film is simply brilliant. Watching Johnny Depp's character transformation amidst Jim Jarmusch's artistic direction of both beauty and brutality is simply exceptional despite any problems the film may contain. A feeling of purgatorial confinement is truly achieved as humor is mixed with suspense and uneasiness blends with inevitability. This is definitely one of the few movies that strangely seizes the disposition toying with it until sufficiently queasy.Nevertheless while the story acting and cinematic composition of the film are excellent certain directorial choices do prevent it from achieving perfection. The primary problem concerns the dreamlike quality interspersed through several drawnout fades while effective they are overused and only serve to impair the flow of the film and it's intended message. Another problem is the tempo of the action the characters while quick to quip and raise their weapons engage in gunfights at the speed of snails. When a shot is fired the attacker simply stands in place only to be killed by the target he missed. This particular criticism can lend itself to the film as a whole as well. In other words had the entire pace of the film been quickened perhaps Jarmusch's voyage into the depths of doom and despair may have been more effective. Lastly as in many independent films superfluous art film' shots and indie flavor overseason the picture simply to separate it from bigstudio Hollywood...though as the film progresses these moments become less apparent. Overall this film is one to be seen by anyone who enjoys a creative story with TONS of review value. Several notable faces make their way through the screen Gabriel Bryne Robert Mitchum Crispin Glover Iggy Pop and more and the dirty electric twang of Neil Young's guitar fills the gaps with a dark mechanical Southwestern gloom. Enter the town of Machine and you'll be processed as well. Just watch out for snags along the trail  they make the journey a bit annoying and certainly longer than what is warranted by the reaches of the attention span...or simply the principles of artistic efficiency.".

Spanning the beauty of epic horizons and dense forests yet ending in the bleak misery of the barren desert we meet this outofplace traveler in a tiring strange situation. His frailty is evident alone without a living heir struggling to make his way amidst the freaks and grim destination that awaits. As expected the town itself begs no welcome as the malevolent rumors prove true and leave Blake face to face with the dusty spines of inexorable destiny. In more ways than one the Wild West awaits...From this point on Blake embarks on his surrealistic journey into nothingness as he becomes a marked man running from nearly everyone and everything. Trusting in a Native friend appropriately named Nobody' the descent into Blake's rejection is juxtaposed with the realities of a truly inescapable destiny. As such the notions of ill fate and bad luck are separately defined alongside each other. Soon enough however Blake learns to cope with the road to ruin and from his relationship with Nobody he begins to transform into the gunslinging poet he never was.In these aspects  the premise the cinematic device and the endless attention to narrative and metaphoric detail  the film is simply brilliant. Watching Johnny Depp's character transformation amidst Jim Jarmusch's artistic direction of both beauty and brutality is simply exceptional despite any problems the film may contain. A feeling of purgatorial confinement is truly achieved as humor is mixed with suspense and uneasiness blends with inevitability. This is definitely one of the few movies that strangely seizes the disposition toying with it until sufficiently queasy.Nevertheless while the story acting and cinematic composition of the film are excellent certain directorial choices do prevent it from achieving perfection. The primary problem concerns the dreamlike quality interspersed through several drawnout fades while effective they are overused and only serve to impair the flow of the film and it's intended message. Another problem is the tempo of the action the characters while quick to quip and raise their weapons engage in gunfights at the speed of snails. When a shot is fired the attacker simply stands in place only to be killed by the target he missed. This particular criticism can lend itself to the film as a whole as well. In other words had the entire pace of the film been quickened perhaps Jarmusch's voyage into the depths of doom and despair may have been more effective. Lastly as in many independent films superfluous art film' shots and indie flavor overseason the picture simply to separate it from bigstudio Hollywood...though as the film progresses these moments become less apparent. Overall this film is one to be seen by anyone who enjoys a creative story with TONS of review value. Several notable faces make their way through the screen Gabriel Bryne Robert Mitchum Crispin Glover Iggy Pop and more and the dirty electric twang of Neil Young's guitar fills the gaps with a dark mechanical Southwestern gloom. Enter the town of Machine and you'll be processed as well. Just watch out for snags along the trail  they make the journey a bit annoying and certainly longer than what is warranted by the reaches of the attention span...or simply the principles of artistic efficiency.";

	schema:reviewBody "I can understand how this masterpiece of a motion picture would inspire somebody to make films. My Father is an avid Jarmusch fan and lent me the film Dead Man in 2001 when I was 16 I know I only watched it as a sexually obsessed schoolgirl longing for some Depp action but what it actually did to me was something entirely different. Atmosperically guided by a soulfully dark score by Neil Young often a lone guitar riff the film is as cool as the fingertips of God. 'Dead Man's loose coolness allows for a freedom within the script and the characters that the director wields with delicacy and expertise. By this I mean that although some of the dialogue may come across as mysterious and cryptic possibly meaningless to some the characters are given gifts in the form of perfect style that allows them to be whole. The film is perfect. How can Film Noir be Western? and how can Native American wisdom be coupled with British Georgian poetry? Obviously with some ease at the hands of a talented man. These splicings are amongst others veined through the events of the film and make up a large part of that which draws a viewer into an actual relationship with the film and fuels burning interest in it down to each single word uttered in the dialogue. Visually 'Dead Man' is attractive with the strangeness or beauty of the actors and the lighting and landscape often barren or harsh that sets a wonderful Gothic playground for Blake and Nobody and the pursuers. Almost adverse to sexy choreographed gun toting 'Dead Man' shows Blake's clumsy murders as quirky and almost innocent and they become stylised with 'cool' as Blake's poetry begins to write itself in blood. Jarmusch shows beauty in the Death that occurs in the wake of his protagonists Nobody and Blake and nothing vulgar touches them. Ugliness in the film is associated with mislaid priorities such as the emphasis on the return of the Pinto horse rather than the capture of a criminal and incessant talking as mentioned by Gary farmer's character 'Nobody' he who talks loud say nothing and embodied by the character John Scholfield who eventually dies at the hand of an unwilling listener to his permanent tide of nonsense. Mismatched as they are wonderful or funny the partnerships of the film are perfect Nobody Gary Farmer the educated tribal outcast and William Blake Johnny Depp the quiet accidental 'killer of white men' begin to illustrate the closeness of brothers through their misunderstandings and differences as they walk their destiny together. Believed by Nobody to be the true William Blake from the spirit world Bill Blake from Cleveland becomes indebted to his new friend who keeps him alive despite the difficulty of there being a fatal bullet wound in his body. The Trio of Philistinehating vagabonds the two bald marshals and the three grudging killers are amongst other wellformed partnerships that keep the plot afloat.Whilst violent but comic and perhaps at times unnerving 'Dead Man' is casual while it is gripping and involving while it is timeless and dreamlike. With the gritty beauty of an imperfect lover that is perfect to you 'Dead Man' is personal and passionately loveable. With 'Dead Man' Jarmusch has achieved an essence of poetic masterdom of all things being possible to love a murderer for example where similarly of William Blake the Georgian Poet in the words of a critic proclaimed the supremacy of the imagination over the rationalism and materialism of the 18thcentury.I watch this film a few times per year just to witness it's genius and allure the way one might perhaps visit the Mona Lisa every so often if one lived by the Louvre.".

	schema:headline " Lacking meaning or plot but beautifully filmed and scored and very intriguing";
	schema:reviewBody "William Blake is an accountant who travels deep into the west of America to the frontier town of Machine to take up a job with a metal company.  He travels on the train for many days but when he arrives he is told that his job has been given to another man.  Not sure what to do with himself he gets involved with a girl when her boyfriend Charles returns home to find her. He kills her and Blake is forced to kill him in return.  He flees the town but collapses only to wake with the Indian Nobody nursing him and telling him he is dead.  With a bounty on his head Nobody leads Blake to the water where he will cross to the next world.I first saw this film when it came out in a now sadly closed art cinema in Birmingham.  I have only seen it twice since then but it has always stayed with me and made such an impact on me.  The plot is little more than a journey a journey that is never really explained or put into any context. However it is the sheer imagination and atmosphere of the film that prevents this being a problem.  The precredit sequence of the film will tell you everything you need to know  if you are intrigued by the scene taken by the atmosphere and gripped by the intense train driver then you will love the rest of the film.  The scenes continue with the dark foreboding atmosphere and the strange but gripping cast of characters.  It is here where the film happens and it is all the better for it.The support cast of cameos are all great and their characters include a silent hitman a chatty hitman a travelling group of homosexual rapists a prophetic train driver and a gun crazy businessman.  If this gives the impression of a wacky' film then trust me it is not  it is not funny it is spellbinding.  The characters come and go but they are so imaginatively drawn that they all remain memorable.  Jarmusch's direction helps this as he gives everything an unique visual touch.  The photography is beautiful and framed really well in black and white  visually the film stayed with me since I first saw it it was so distinctive.  Of course it may not have managed that without the haunting and menacing score from Neil Young.  It works so very well and is part of the reason the film stays with me.Now that he is Oscar Nominee Johnny Depp' and not just Johnny Depp' it is interesting to look back on this film and pleasing to see that his ability to find out worthy pieces has not diminished with the odd bigger film here and there.  He is the wide eyed innocence here and is very much just the vessel we use to sail through other characters.  As an actor he impresses with his willingness to play a low key role while the support cast shine in colourful characters.  Farmer is good in his Nobody role while the best roles go to the main bounty hunters  violent and sullen Henriksen and the funny chatty Wincott.  Glover shows what a real intense performance is and is creepier here than all his efforts in the Charlie's Angels films'. The support cast features memorable turns from Hurt Mitchum Molina Iggy Pop and Billy Bob Thornton.  They along with the visuals and music are what makes this film so very memorable.Overall this is not for everyone and I'm sure it will frustrate many with it's seeming lack of plot and lack of traditional narrative.  However it is hard not to be taken in by the gorgeous black and white images presented here with the haunting score and a journey that takes in one colourful character after another.  It may not have much substance if you're after plot but it will stick in your mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dead Man is a unique piece of film. As this is my first taste of Jim Jarmusch I had no idea of what to expect but even if I had I reckon that this film wouldn't have conformed to them. Dead Man is a surreal and trippy western that peels itself away from the staples of the genre and succeeds in creating something truly oneoff and selfstyled. Lead by a score written by Neil Young Dead Man is continually satisfying and powerful and you get the impression that every scene has been fully thought through and is perfectly realised as the auteur intended. For this reason Dead Man captivates it's viewer from the moment it starts until the moment it ends and as it descends into full blown trippy weirdness you can do nothing but stare in admiration of this strange gem of cult cinema. The plot is thin on the ground and it largely lacks meaning but it doesn't matter because Dead Man is a purely aesthetic experience. Still it follows William Blake Johnny Depp an accountant from Cleveland that arrives in a town to take a job offer only to find that the vacancy has already been filled Dead Man is filmed in very stark black and white which only adds to the surrealism of the story. Had this film have been done in colour it would not have captured the same atmosphere that the black and white gives it and so this decision was an inspired one indeed. One staple of the western genre that Jarmusch is keen to retain is the use of closeups. The director spends a lot of time caressing Depp's facial features with his camera and at times even focuses on his lead actor when the action doesn't concern him. Aside from keeping in with the western tradition this also allows Jarmusch to keep the focus on the main character which keeps the viewer focused on his plight. For this film Jarmusch has put together a cast of Bmovie icons that will have Bmovie fans foaming at the mouth. Crispin Glover Robert Mitchum Billy Bob Thornton Lance Henriksen Gabriel Byrne John Hurt Alfred Molina and even Iggy Pop feature and it's great to see so many faces in the same movie. The cast is of course lead by a man who is perhaps today's best actor Johnny Depp. Depp's name on a credit list speaks for itself and I don't need to tell you that his performance is great nor do I need to point out the effortless cool that this movie exudes largely thanks to the great man's presence. My only advice is see it...see it now.".

	schema:reviewBody "During my late teens and early twenties I was taken to see many films by a friend of mine who was the son of a Persian film director.He was never interested in what I thought of a film until we were outside the cinema but told me how to watch the film during the film.One of the first films I saw was Jim Jarmusch's Down by Law in the Turkish quarter of Paris with French subtitles. We sat in the front row and roared. We were the only ones. It all seemed rather lost on the rest of the audience. All the way through he told me the things to see.Here are a few. First Robbie Muller's cinematography. Beautiful vistas moving to the pace of the film. Paris Texas springs to mind.Second the recognition of amorality in the world a world of nature red in tooth and claw. All of Jarmusch's films that I've seen have a rough diamond edge running through them. An edge where the animal response is the correct one  the place that Hitchock always alluded to but never dared go to.Third incompleteness if there is such a word. Jarmusch always leaves questions dangling Why was Carl Perkins better than Elvis or vice versa? Did Eva really go back to Hungary? Is Nobody already dead? In this sense Jarmusch is more a novelist than a film maker  he leaves much for you to fill in with your mind's eye. Quite an achievement considering how compelling the visuals of film are.For me Jarmusch's daring is that he allows the viewer to fill in a lot of the context for a scene. The context naturally defines the scene yet Jarmusch is bold enough to let the viewer place it later. Perhaps much later when you've worked it out.So when I watched dead man I was ready. The last Johnny Depp film I'd seen was Chocolat superb. I understood and appreciated Robbie Muller's approach and I had most of Jarmusch to date under my belt.Two things sprang to mind with Dead Man. The first was a Scifi novel written because the author was 20 something and needed the money. The second was the Tibetan Book of the Dead.The first occurred to me because of the way I encountered it. I was researching and building eLearning systems at the time and the eLearning crowd hailed Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card as the eLearner's scifi novel. I read it and the basic lesson is that the training has to be so real that the student doesn't know when it's really real and even then half thinks it's training.The second occurred to me as a consequence of the first. The Tibetan Book of the Dead is a manual for dying and being reborn. It has options such as getting out of the wheel of incarnation altogether or doing a damage limitation exercise on how limited your capabilities are going to be in the next life  and everything in between.One of the central premises of this yoga is that life as we know it is a simulation of the real life  a kind of Ender's game if you will. When one sees the finite from the position of the eternal the question of where one ends and the other begins inevitably arises and it's this that Jarmusch captures so wonderfully in Dead Man.William Blake the real one had none of this knowledge that we have today but what he did have is opium. Survey the poetry of the opiumheads. They all had a sense of eternal spirit  it comes with the drug. It gives the connectedness and empathy of E with the hallucinations of A but the chilled response to it all of weed.Like Jarmusch Blake Coleridge and the rest recognise the harsh reality of the nature we live in yet are still able to celebrate its beauty and the lessons that it has to teach us.The pace of Dead Man is that of an opium hit one only has to take the stuff or read the Nobel Laureate Naguib Mahfouz's Adrift on the Nile to see that. The Neil Young sound track is naturally irritating if one cannot settle down into the pace of the film. For those who understand it it is the hypnotic metronome that keeps time for days after the film has ended.Magical.".

But the last half hour is definitely to be forgotten... If only I could! Now every time I see J.Depp in a cast I hesitate to go. That guy is such a great actor why does he have to choose such weird roles ? Why are there so few that dare criticize this movie ? Because it's Johnny Depp and Jim Jarmusch ?

	schema:reviewBody "There are a number of good things about Silk Stockings but there also is a professional finality about the movie that makes it easier to observe than to be delighted by it. It was one of the last of the big MGM musicals coming from Arthur Freed's production unit. It was the last musical Fred Astaire made as the lead. It was the last film directed by Rouben Mamoulian. It was based on the last Broadway musical Cole Porter wrote. Silk Stockings also was used to make a statement about the excesses some thought were ruining films and music...the advent of rock and roll and the technological changes in films with wide screen and stereo sound. It even takes a crack at the fashion for ballet in many musicals. You've got to be very clever and original to successfully parody things which are already selfparodies. Silk Stockings even with its many entertaining moments isn't that clever. The story is based on Ninotchka the female Soviet commissar who comes to Paris and finds romance reluctantly...and then enthusiastically. Paris is presented as a place where decadence was never more innocent and persuasive. One of the things that seems so odd is that for a Fred Astaire film Astaire spends a good deal of time doing knee drops fulllength onthefloor sprawls and athletic dance moves that limit the sophisticated and smooth Astaire style. He was 59 when he made the picture and this might explain the relative shortness of some of the sequences. Still while he is assured and immensely watchable and while he can still do wonders with a cane three major dance productions he is in just seem choppy. Most of the songs from the Broadway show were retained and Porter wrote a couple of new ones. It's become routine with Porter to say that whatever his latest show was the score was never one of his best. In this case it's true. The romantic songs are great but the topical specialty numbers just seem tired. Siberia and The Ritz Roll and Rock in particular miss the mark in my opinion.Astaire as always is first class. Charisse is easy to look at and a fine dancer. George Tobias as a commissar in Moscow and Ninotchka's boss gives a sly and deadpan performance. Some of Porter's songs are very good. Mamoulian brought the film in on time and under budget. And Silk Stockings was a success with ticket buyers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fred Astaire has always been a performer who's work is very close to my heart. The last real Fred Astaire movie excluding his geriatric nonsinging nondancing or nonstarring roles is 1957's Silk Stockings.I was a little afraid to watch Silk Stockings at first. Sure it had a Cole Porter score supervised by Andre Previn and Hermes Pan choreography and sure Fred made fabulous movies even at that age the Bandwagon Daddy Long Legs but I knew it was Fred's last and I didn't want to know why. Now I know what a pleasure I was depriving myself of.Silk Stockings is a musical remake of Ninotchka a 1939 Greta Garbo picture. It's about a serious stern young Russian woman sent as an envoy to nab a Russian composer living illegally in Paris. The composer is betraying his Russian classical heritage by writing music for a low brow movie musical. The director of this movie played by Fred Astaire distracts the pretty young Russian Cyd Charisse with the wonders of Paris classy night clubs and dancing to jazz. In falling for him her strict heartless personality melts away.This movie was produced at the height of the cold war and the height of Hollywood blacklisting and it's commiebashing could make some uncomfortable. To me those jokes are anything but propaganda. The cultural stereotypes are played for laughs and should be taken with a grain of salt. Of course I'm a big fan of the top hat and tails ritzy romantic culture that Astaire's character teaches Charisse's character the joys of so it's easy for me to say.With the exception of the classics All of You and Paris is For Lovers Cole Porter's songs are comic here. But that being said they are hilarious. This was towards the end of Porter's career too. In fact this was towards the end of the movie musical as America knew it.Rock and Roll was taking over. To me the most moving moments in this movie are not the dramatic love scenes shared by Astaire and Charisse they are the self referential moments where Porter Astaire and choreographer Hermes Pan acknowledge that their era in over.Porter wrote special material just for this movie. One highlight is a tune called Stereophonic Sound. In it the singer quips about how moviegoers used to be content to see talented performers do their thing and a nice love story but these days all they want is glorious Technicolor breathtaking CinemaScope and Stereophonic sound! The song puts down all the gimmickry of the modern Hollywood and even has one verse quite obviously about Fred Astaire himself. Porter writes that these days a great hoofer in tails is not enough they want a ballet alluding to Gene Kelly's ballet dance number fad.Fred Astaire's last MGM dance number is to the song Ritz Rollin' Rock. It's Porter's parody of this new music called Rock and Roll ironically borrowing from Irving Berlin's dated Puttin' On the Ritz. This sequence choreographed by Astaire's longtime collaborator Hermes Pan ends with Fred writhing on the floor wearing his 1930's tails and top hat. As the horns hit the last big chord Fred removes his trademarked top hat and smashes it flat with his fist. The message Porter Astaire and Pan slipped into this novelty number is very powerful if you know what you're seeing.Pop entertainment changed in the sixties and the the old kings abdicated their thrones to... well... the King I suppose.Anyway if you're a Fredhead like me and you're afraid to see Fred's final fling Silk Stockings don't be. You'll be reminded why he and his period of Hollywood was great.".

Fred Astaire Steve Canfield is a movie producer who is planning a production of WAR AND PEACE with Janis Paige as his star she is Peggy Dayton a noted Hollywood swim star a la Esther Williams who will play the Empress Josephine.

Their boss George Tobias promoted since NINOTCHKA  he's now a commissar sends Cyd Charisse Ninotchka Yoschencko to keep the other three and Boroff under control. Tobias has reason to be upset. Not only is Canfield trying to corrupt the culture mission not too difficult there but also Boroff who falls for Peggy Dayton as Canfield hopes.It follows closely the pursuit and corruption of Ninotchka but there is one aspect that is shown here that was barely touched upon in the 1939 film. There Swanna's cynical use of the jewelry as a bargaining chip to keep Leon from Ninotchka sort of suggests that pure capitalism has it's drawbacks when in the wrong hands. In SILK STOCKINGS it is the cavalier use of culture for a fast buck that gets a go over.Boroff's masterpiece is called Overture to a tractor but Canfield has it changed into a song for Peggy JoJo Jo Jo Josephine...commonly called Jo. Whatever one thinks of music in honor of inanimate objects Boroff's work represents serious art. Ninotchka and the others including Boroff are furious and dismiss the glib excuse Steve comes up with many other popular songs are based on classic tunes.

Here the title song originally sung by Don Ameche on stage but here by Astaire is one of the best numbers as is Glorious Technicolor where Astaire and Paige describe all the cinematography gimmicks used to draw in the audience leading up to sterophonic sound which the film sound track blasts out. Munchkin Lorre and Granach have two big numbers the second SIBERIA being one of Porter's best comic pieces as the three culture mission people look gloomily to returning to Russia and possibly being sent to Siberia Have you seen our choice bill of fare...Please try the fillet of polar bear!.

	schema:headline " A Most Fitting Tribute to Charisse's Terpsichorean Talents";
	schema:reviewBody "With the passing of Cyd Charisse last week at age 86 it's worth seeking out what is probably her finest work on celluloid. As an actress she was bland. As a singer she was dubbed this time by the sonoroussounding Carole Richards. But as a dancer she was extraordinary. Along with VeraEllen the ballettrained Charisse was in the top echelon of the female dancers MGM showcased during the studio's golden years of which this film is one of its final stops. The clearest evidence of this claim can be found in the title tune when she dances with beauty and precision elegantly changing from her drab street clothes into silk and satin. It's a remarkable number no small feat since her costar is Fred Astaire. Directed by early musical maven Rouben Mamoulian in what turned out to be his last film the movie also marks Astaire's swan song as a musical comedy leading man. Symbolically he smashes his top hat at the end of his final solo number The Ritz Roll and Rock. The wear barely shows in his dancing where he pulls off some of his most acrobatic numbers but other than the professionalism of the two leads the inspiration seems sadly missing.The film is a partial remake of Ernst Lubitsch's 1939 classic comedy Ninotchka  in fact some scenes are repeated verbatim  although certain elements have been altered to accommodate Cole Porter's musical score. This musical translation first showed up on Broadway two years earlier but further revisions have obviously been made to tailor the story to the dancing talents of the leads. Charisse has the unenviable task of stepping into Greta Garbo's shoes as top Soviet envoy Ninotchka Yoschenko who is sent to Paris to retrieve three lesser envoys swept up by the City of Lights. They had already botched their mission to lure famous Russian composer Peter Boroff back to the mother country. At the same time American movie producer Steve Canfield wants Boroff to score his next picture a musical bowdlerization of Tolstoy's War and Peace starring comically curvaceous Peggy Dayton a parody of an Esther Williamsstyle swimming star whose been in the pool too long. As Dayton uses her feminine wiles to entice Boroff Canfield tries to seduce Ninotchka a far frostier proposition though the eventual thawing is inevitable. Porter's music has that effect or so we are led to believe.Playing another variation on the worldly photographer he played in the same year's Funny Face Astaire is still at the top of his game but his dance numbers are less elegant and appear markedly shorter than usual here. Charisse cannot compare to the legendary Garbo when it comes to line readings as a stoic communist. However her dancing truly transcends  not only the title tune but also The Red Blues an impressive ensemble number showcasing Charisse in a variety of dance styles and the two duets with Astaire to All of You  the first a romantic defrosting of Ninotchka and the second a jauntier rhythmic pasdedeux. I wish the rest of the film was as good but sadly the energy wavers and the pacing flags during its 117minute running time. The rest of the cast is serviceable in particular Janis Paige on familiar ground as Peggy nicely paired with Astaire on the energetically cynical Stereophonic Sound and George Tobias as the deadpan Soviet commissar. Peter Lorre M and Jules Munshin Ozzie in On the Town show up as two of the bumbling envoys. The 2003 DVD has some interesting extras beginning with a tenminute featurette featuring a 2003 interview with the stillelegant Charisse in Cole Porter in Hollywood Satin and Silk. Because of the Porter tiein there is also a 1934 Bob Hope short Paree Paree a silly musical comedy with Hope wooing singer Dorothy Stone. Also included is the original theatrical trailer as well as Poet and Peasant Overture with Alfred Wallenstein conducting the MGM symphony orchestra playing the Franz Von Suppe piece as an overture to the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Silk Stockings is something of an enigma. Its release came at the moment much of America had switched over to viewing television and the musical film was dying. But it was still glorious. I couldn't care less about the 'outdated Red Russia' story line this is a remake of a 1939 film and the USSR conflict was in the original as well. What're you gonna do? The main focus is on capitalist seduction first by Tobias Munshin and Peter Lorre then most beautifully by Astaire and Charisse. Note that in their first duet the nondancing Paris Loves Lovers as they sing in perfect counterpoint they appear to be undressing each other with their eyes. Later in All of You the gloves come off and our two leads seduce each other through a most graceful dance in a living room. Astaire was 56 years old Charisse was about 36 and there is still more electricity in their pairing than in some of the downright silly things passing as romantic comedies today. The undisputed highlight of the film is Ms. Charisse in a silent and sensuous expression of terpsichory as she puts on nude stockings a camisole and a flared transparent slip. OMG!!".

	schema:reviewBody "After an adaption to Broadway as the final stage musical of Cole Porter's career Ernest Lubitsch's acclaimed film Ninotchka now Silk Stockings is getting its film treatment. Silk Stockings ran for 478 performances on Broadway in the 19551956 season and starred Don Ameche and Hildegarde Neff in the roles originally played by Melvyn Douglas and Greta Garbo.For reasons I don't understand Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder's names are not given credit here. I distinctly heard a lot of lines from the original Ninotchka that came from them. I also heard some of the acid barbs of George S. Kaufman who worked with Abe Burrows on the book for Silk Stockings.Most of Cole Porter's score makes it intact to the screen but since the male and female leads were now dancers Porter wrote Fated To Be Mated and The Ritz Roll and Rock for Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse. The latter is one of my favorite Astaire numbers from his film. Porter who was no mean satirist himself was having a bit of fun at the new trend in music called Rock and Roll in a spoof of Rock Around the Clock.The plot from the original Ninotchka was changed and updated from the time of the preWorld War II Soviet Union of Stalin to the Cold War. Commissar Ninotchka is no longer concerned with selling jewels of the former nobility she's negotiating with an American producer who wants a famous Russian composer to score his film adaption of War and Peace. Curiously enough War and Peace did make it to the screen the previous year.Astaire as the producer also has a sexy but very tough minded star in Janis Paige to contend with. Janis has her moments on screen with the song Josephine and singing and dancing with Astaire in Stereophonic Sound. The big hit song from the score All of You is sung and danced elegantly by Fred and Cyd. As usual Cyd's vocals were dubbed in this case by Carole Richards who used to be a regular for a while on Bing Crosby's radio show.Peter Lorre Jules Munshin and Alexander Granach are the three commissars who Ninotchka has to bail out as in the original film. Granach repeats his role from Ninotchka. But George Tobias sets a record as the only player to appear in both film and the Broadway version. In the original Ninotchka he was the Soviet Embassy Official who balks at granting Melvyn Douglas a visa. On stage and on screen he plays the boss of GarboNeffCharisse a part that was done in the original Ninotchka by Bela Lugosi.The comedy is a lot more broad than in the Lubitsch film but with that Cole Porter music and the charm and dancing of Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse Silk Stockings is a film you should not miss.".

The 1939 GarboDouglas Ninotchka can be defined as a comedydrama the 1957 Astaire Charisse Silk Stockings as a comedymusical.Also to those who find fault with the script as an unauthentic representation of Soviet citizenry circa the Cold War era wellSilk Stockings is not meant to be a polemic on Communism soviet style. It takes elements from Soviet life exaggerates and subverts the realities for comedic effect. We're talking comedy here not documentary. Fred Astaire as Hollywood producer Steve Canfield here is an older Fred than we are used to seeing and although given star billing the film is more of an ensemble effort. Cyd Charisse as Ninotchhka is tasked with playing a prudish repressed literal minded Soviet official. Ninotchhka a personality manufactured by political propaganda is more of a one dimensional caricature a role that doesn't require great acting skill and Charisse manages her role with facility. Together Astaire and Charisse make a good dance team but the choreography is lackluster and pedestrian. Astaire at age 58 still demonstrates vitality but he's taking it easy here nothing physically innovative or too rigorous. There's no Fred wow factor that would serve to add another jewel to the King of Dance's crown.Peter Lorre one of a trio of Soviet commissars come to Paris to waylay a Russian composer's defection to Hollywood diverges from his familiar portrayals. Formerly inseparable from characterizations of the sinister sly insinuator here he's an engaging chubby comradesidekick. Janis Paige was a ubiquitous popular name in entertainment in the 1950s. She's the crass exhibitionist Peggy Dayton a concoction epitomizing the Hollywood star factory she's a proxy for the over the top gaudy commercialism of the Capitalist System. Her movie star is a manufactured product famous for showcasing her talents in the type of movie called water spectaculars most commonly confined to swimming pools or sound stage sets mimicking exotic fanciful lagoons. A not very flattering homage to Esther Williams...maybe?In Silk Stockings Cole Porter has given us song lyrics that seem forced applied with a heavy handed manipulation agonized over. The tunes are not memorable. Overall there's a turgid gimmickry at work here lacking the easy almost effortless sophisticated grace of his best work. This musical score is not representative of the best compositions in Porter's catalogue of memorable work. The most glaring bungling occurs in the cinematography and lightening. The camera work throughout is woefully uninspired filmed predominately using medium shots every scene is framed in a relentless monotony lacking visual variety. The unimaginative lightening only emphasizes the camera's deficiency further bathing everything in a uniform bright light without nuance shadow or mood. The result presents everything as if a flat page in a picture book. These lazy production values extend to the costumes and set dcor as well where Technicolor is not used to advantage. The entire movie has a flat dullness and drabness to it all. It might as well have been filmed in black and white. After finishing Silk Stockings Astaire didn't make another movie musical for ten years. After viewing the finished product it's no mystery why he made that decision. All this being said this is not the worst musical ever made and can offer some entertainment value. Just sit back and enjoy the effortless charm and courtliness of Fred Astaire and the gorgeous Cyd Charise. What woman wouldn't want her figure and those beautiful sculpted long legs?!".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the occasion recently to see Silk Stockings and Ninotchka back to back. While the musical and its Broadway antecedent is based upon the general plot line of the famous Greta Garbo comedyeach film can fully stand on its own to critical judgment.Ninotchka is considered a classic by many people and contains Garbo's first comic performance. It is also one of her most accessible roles as well as her penultimate film appearance. Acting styles have changed considerably over the years and contemporary filmgoers may be somewhat mystified as to why she was so highly regarded in her time. However in Ninotchka she created a character that is almost free of the mannerisms and affectations often found in her serious movies that turn off so many of today's viewers. The Lubitsch touch? Perhaps.Silk Stockings may not be a classic but it's a delightful and enjoyable musical film entertainment. It is interesting that in the year 1957 we saw the last traditional film musical from both Fred Astaire Silk Stockingsand Gene Kelly Les Girls as well as Silk Stockings being the last film directed by the legendary Rouben Mamoulian. Coincidentally Mamoulian directed one of Garbo's most highly regarded filmsQueen Christina back in 1933.The recent death of Cyd Charisse reminds us of what a great artist she was in her prime musical years. And while Fred Astaire may have done better work in many of his earlier films he left the musical genre excluding the forgettable Finian's Rainbow with a stylish charming and endearing performance.Personally I find the character played by Astaire considerably more likable than the one dimensional cadlover played in the earlier film by Melvyn Douglas. And while Cyd Charisse never was considered much of an actress her stonefaced Bolshevik who is seduced and in turn warmed by Western decadence compares favorably with Garbo's Ninotchkaplus she can dance! What an understatement! Silk Stockings is an underrated film from the Golden Age of musicals. Fred Astaire left to go on to other projectsand it could be argued that his several subsequent television specials with Barrie Chase extended his classic dancing work. But Silk Stockings is his last great role as a song and dance man. What a way to go!".

	schema:reviewBody "As Silk Stockings reaches the halfcentury mark it is now so dated that it can be enjoyed either as a period piece as a look at popular attitudes toward the Cold War as a rather silly but enjoyable setting for the odd couple of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire or as a chance to see character actors like Jules Munchin and Peter Lorre. You know it's an old movie when Technicolor and stereophonic sound are being touted as the new big things! Whether you like the main movie or not the DVD extras have their own charm. The Special Features section includes a short film with Cyd Charisse as narrator made about 2003 in which she talks about Cole Porter Fred Astaire and how the film came to be. Another short bw film from the thirties is called Paree Paree. This one stars a very young Bob Hope and features Cole Porter songs from the musical 20 Million Frenchmen.Another musical treat is the Poet and Peasant Overture written by Franz von Suppe played by the full studio orchestra. Both the 'Paree' film and this overture will tease you with musical strains familiar to those of us who grew up with old cartoons so be warned! Listening to this music may induce animation flashback.".

You know it's an old movie when Technicolor and stereophonic sound are being touted as the new big things! Whether you like the main movie or not the DVD extras have their own charm. The Special Features section includes a short film with Cyd Charisse as narrator made about 2003 in which she talks about Cole Porter Fred Astaire and how the film came to be. Another short bw film from the thirties is called Paree Paree. This one stars a very young Bob Hope and features Cole Porter songs from the musical 20 Million Frenchmen.Another musical treat is the Poet and Peasant Overture written by Franz von Suppe played by the full studio orchestra. Both the 'Paree' film and this overture will tease you with musical strains familiar to those of us who grew up with old cartoons so be warned! Listening to this music may induce animation flashback.";

One of several musical remakes of nonmusical pictures that the studio produced in the midlate 1950s. This is one of the best.Fred Astaire plays his usual character the playboyish bachelor in this case a film producer wanting to use a Russian composer's music for his new film. Cyd Charisse plays Ninotchka the Russian woman who comes to Paris to bring back the composer and three comrades who failed to return him to his native land. As the three comrades Jules Munshin Peter Lorre holding onto a chair as he dances and Joseph Buloff are a hoot adding good comic relief in their Too Bad and Siberia numbers. Janis Paige is a jewel as the ditzy actress hired for the new film. She radiates with Astaire in the memorable Stereophonic Sound number as well as in her own hilarious Satin and Silk.Charisse whose wooden acting is OK here is lovely as usual and has a few excellent dances including the sensual All of You with Astaire the lively Red Blues and the stunning ballet where she removes her old Russian garb for her new Parisian silks. This was the second of her two pairings with Astaire and though this is not the gem that The Band Wagon is it still sparkles nonetheless.A clever and classy musical with some very topical humor. Great songs by Cole Porter with the exception of the tacky Ritz Roll and Rock...a poor punch at rock and roll. Excellent use of color and the Cinemascope frame help to make this one of the last great musicals of the 1950s.".

However while it has its flaws it is eminently watchable and is good entertainment.The film is a handsomelooking film especially in the sumptuous sets though the colourful and expansive photography nottoobrightnottoodrab lighting and elegant costumes also delight. The music is energetic and whimsical and the songs while not among Cole Porter's bestRitz Rock and Roll is a little dull and tired are very good with memorable melodies and Porter's usual wit evident. All of You and Paris Loves Lovers are dreams come true for Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse lovers but the highlight is the enormously fun Stereophonic Sound Siberia has some funny moments but not for all tastes. Choreographically Silk Stockings is splendid but does not waste Astaire or Charisse's talents at all the songs I mentioned as highlights are also the highlights for the choreography and while Ritz Rock and Roll is tired songwise Astaire's dancing certainly is not.Also present are a very clever script where most of the humour sparkles and the romantic parts have the right balance of sweetness and magic while not feeling too much it also has a good deal of warmth chemistrywise which stops it from feeling cold and underdeveloped. The film is warmhearted goodhumoured and lightfooted on the most part and is competently directed while the cast are as splendid as the choreography. Astaire is as charming and graceful as ever and Charisse is glamour and elegance personified. Janis Paige is hilarious and comes close to stealing the show in Stereophonic Sound and Peter Lorre and Jules Munshin are amusing though both have given better performances elsewhere.It's not a flawless film though. It does get heavyhanded in places and occasionally overplotted the antiRussian jokes may leave a sour taste in the mouth and as aforementioned the Ritz Rock and Roll lacks the energy and is not as memorable or uptotempo as the rest of the film.Despite the problems Silk Songs is very watchable and fun and an above decent but inferior musical remake of Ninotchka. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Very few of the classic 1950s musicals were original stories. Most of them were musical adaptations of novels stage plays or increasingly the previous generations' nonmusical pictures. The quality of these often had little bearing on that of the original. The musical A Star is Born is for example considerably better than the original. But they could also be vastly worse than their predecessors after the rigours of plot rehash singerdancer casting and the conventions of a new era.The 1939 movie Ninotchka could only really have worked with Greta Garbo  it was built around her persona. Silk Stockings does not  and could not  have Garbo. Cyd Charisse is not a terrible actress and even does a decent caricature of a steely soviet officer speaking without moving a single other muscle in her face. Garbo on the other hand managed to get across the same idea without even such a trick as freezing up her face. She had something likable and beguiling about her even before her grim exterior was broken down. Charisse on the other hand succeeds only in presenting Ninotchka as totally robotic. That may be to her credit but it does not benefit the movie. Her transformation does not seem as plausible as Garbo's and she is not especially human even after it.And this really seems to feed into all the other problems with Silk Stockings. With the Cold War and the McCarthy scare as a backdrop there was no way the movie could be remotely equivocal about communism. As such the original story has lost a lot of its complexity and a tone that was once playful now seems belligerent. Many of the lines seem unnecessarily dumbeddown compare for example the language used by Garbo commenting on a fancy hat to the equivalent of Charisse and the stockings. There is a new subplot about a Russian composer having his music distorted for a screen musical and there are a lot of attacks on ostentatious moviemaking. But this is as simplistic as the politics never going further than disdainfully listing the ills of modern Hollywood as in the song Stereophonic Sound.Presumably the studio didn't grasp the irony of these sentiments in a picture that was itself shot in Technicolor and cinemascope. Director Rouben Mamoulian probably did apparently describing the new aspect ratio as the stupidest shape I've ever seen. For a director usually at his most brilliant and inventive in the musical genre his work is decidedly lacklustre here. The irony cannot have been lost on poor old Fred Astaire either who is not at all wellserved by 'scope. Either his feet are cut off at the bottom of the frame or he seems lost amid all the other business on screen. It's a shame this was to be his last tophatandtails performance. It's not exactly a noble sendoff.There is one nice feature of Silk Stockings and that is a sweet little performance by Peter Lorre. He's at his best here all pentup as if on the edge of a maniacal outburst. But the fact that this is the only laudable thing to say about the picture shows how generally dire the rest of it is. The Cole Porter songs are far from his best weak rehashes of material from his earlier musicals. The second great irony about Silk Stockings is that despite its waxing lyrical about the magic of true romance as opposed to bland analysis the romance in the picture feels completely flat. It lacks all of the original movie's warmth and passion not just in the love story but also in say the friendship between Ninotchka and the trio of Russian comrades. All in all this is an atrocious movie.".

Few of the song and dance numbers were that good or had much to do with the film but the tempo was even more seriously a problem.

With a few elegant dances in it Charisse is in her element in this film. Her woodlike acting as some say comes in handy.It also starrs Wim Sonneveld in his first and last big Hollywood film in the role of the Russian composer. He handles the role beautifully with a touch of zanyness or as he liked to say mesjogge. Sonneveld had only done theater work before that and one Dutch film. As a comedian he liked the role very much it fitted him. It's only too sad it didn't get him the breakthrough he wanted.I give this film a 910! The good cast plot and songs make the movie an alltime classic! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!".

He handles the role beautifully with a touch of zanyness or as he liked to say mesjogge. Sonneveld had only done theater work before that and one Dutch film. As a comedian he liked the role very much it fitted him. It's only too sad it didn't get him the breakthrough he wanted.I give this film a 910! The good cast plot and songs make the movie an alltime classic! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!";

Visconti makes an amazing directing dbut taking the uncredited plot of The Postman Always Rings Twice as a guide to the development of his own themes.It strikes us even today how ahead of its time Ossessione was. Shot in Fascist Italy during World War II think about it!! it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters  and the fact that it used the plot of a famous American novel and payed no copyright didn't help. Ossessione alarmingly reveals povertyridden wartime Italy far from the idealized Italy depicted in Fascist Telefoni Bianchi movies but it's also extremely daring in its sexual frankness with shirtless hunk Gino Massimo Girotti who definitely precedes Brando's Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire taking Giovanna Clara Calamai a married woman to bed just 5 minutes after they first meet. We watch Calamai's unglamorous matteroffact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between Gino and Lo Spagnolo Elio Marcuzzo  a very appealing actor his face not unlike Pierre Clmenti's who was shot by the Nazis in 1945 at 28 years old!...In a few words sex lust greed and poverty as relentlessly as it had rarely if ever been shown before in Italian cinema.All the copies of Ossessione were destroyed soon after its opening  it was called scandalous and immoral. Visconti managed to save a print and when the film was rereleased after the war most critics called it the frontrunner of the NeoRealist movement preceding Rossellini's Roma CItt Aperta and De Sica's Sciusci. Some other critics perhaps more appropriately saw Ossessione as the Italian counterpart to the poetic realism of French cinema remember Visconti had been Renoir's assistant especially Marcel Carn's Quai des Brumes and Le Jour se Lve and Julien Duvivier's Pp le Moko. While Ossessione may be NeoRealistic in its visual language the depiction of wartime paesan life in Italy with its popular fairs poverty child labor prostitution bums swindlers etc the characters and the themes were already decidedly Viscontian. He was always more interested in tragic passionate obsessive greedy characters in socialpoliticalsexual apartheid in the decadence of the elites than in realistic everyday life characters and themes favored by DeSica and Rossellini. In Ossessione we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films especially Senso Visconti's definitive departure from NeoRealist aesthetics and Rocco e Suoi Fratelli...Even in his most NeoRealist film La Terra Trema he makes his fishermen rise from daytoday characters to mythological figures.Ossessione is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again from their first to their last opus no matter if the scenery background or timesetting may change  Visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are well obsessively recurrent. Ossessione is not to be missed you'll surely be fascinated by this groundbreaking powerful film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll be upfront  I know nothing about Italian neorealism and the only Visconti movie I'd seen prior to this was his silly but enjoyable nazisploitation classic 'The Damned'. But I'm a great fan of James M. Cain's pulp crime classic 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' and this superb retelling of it fascinated me from beginning to end. A few crucial plot points are changed an interesting supporting character The Spaniard has been added and the movie has a very different tone from what Cain fans might expect.  The original novella and the subsequent Hollywood versions of it in '46 and '81 are thrillers 'Ossessione' isn't. It's more of a story of a doomed love affair. The basic plot is the same  a drifter has a passionate fling with an unhappily married woman and helps her murder her husband  but Visconti approaches the material in a very different manner. The movie is brilliantly filmed and the acting by the three leads are first rate. You really get a genuine insight into 1940s Italian working class life. The character of The Spaniard adds an interesting touch to the story with a possible homosexual relationship between Gino and himself. It's very subtle but it's there if you look. I thought making Giovanna pretty but not a complete bombshell like Lana Turner added to the realism and credibility of the story. I also was impressed by the small role played by the dancerpart time prostitute Gino buys an ice cream for towards the end of the picture. She doesn't get much screen time sadly but she is really wonderful.  The movie is surprisingly frank for the time and period Mussolini's Italy much more realistic and earthy than Hollywood movies of the same period. If you are looking for a straight forward thriller then the Lana TurnerJohn Garfield version of 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' is probably the better place to start but if you want to see a brilliant drama then this is the superior movie in my opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow! The sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances.  Absolutely incredible! If this was Visconti's debut film i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film. The only other one of his i've seen at time of writing is Death in Venice  which was absolutely incredible more dazzling visually than Ossessione Obsession. One of the most beautiful films i've ever seen but its story was not as involving as Ossessione. If you click on miscellaneous on this page's links there are stills from the movie on those websites. They won't really do justice to the experience of the movie such graceful camera movements such beautiful composition such wonderful faces such terrific characters such a great story development the first movie adapted from James M Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice.I can't believe this was made in 43 eight years before Brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with Streetcar Named Desire 1951. The actors in this may not have used the method technique ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves i don't know anything about it  but they're some of the best most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema. Also eight years before Streetcar Named Desire brought a new sensuality to the screen Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual! The most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema! Yes i'm being superlative but Ossessione was just that terrific.The reason Ossessione didn't cause the impact Streetcar did was that it was made in fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini and recut in America.

	onyx:emotionText "Wow! The sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances.  Absolutely incredible! If this was Visconti's debut film i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film. The only other one of his i've seen at time of writing is Death in Venice  which was absolutely incredible more dazzling visually than Ossessione Obsession. One of the most beautiful films i've ever seen but its story was not as involving as Ossessione. If you click on miscellaneous on this page's links there are stills from the movie on those websites. They won't really do justice to the experience of the movie such graceful camera movements such beautiful composition such wonderful faces such terrific characters such a great story development the first movie adapted from James M Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice.I can't believe this was made in 43 eight years before Brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with Streetcar Named Desire 1951. The actors in this may not have used the method technique ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves i don't know anything about it  but they're some of the best most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema. Also eight years before Streetcar Named Desire brought a new sensuality to the screen Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual! The most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema! Yes i'm being superlative but Ossessione was just that terrific.The reason Ossessione didn't cause the impact Streetcar did was that it was made in fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini and recut in America. American audiences didn't see its full glory till 59 eight years AFTER Streetcar.I won't say any more about it  just writing to tell you its one of the best most beautiful and exciting movies i've ever seen and tell you to go out and see it! Like another reviewer i'm going to buy it as soon as i can find it!";

	schema:reviewBody "Visconti's first feature Ossessione is an adaptation of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice. Now I'm not familiar with that book or the other film versions but I am a big fan of Cain's Double Indemnity much more so than I am a fan of Billy Wilder's film version of it in fact. The two novellas seem like they must be very similar. Both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her. Giovanna the woman in this Italian version played very well by Clara Calamai is not evil incarnate like the wife in Double Indemnity but she seems very spoiled. Her husband a great performance by Juan de Landa is a bit cruel to her but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him. He's older than her and unattractive so she's rather fickle. When Gino shows up a young muscular man it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed. She sweats she wants to be with him forever but she's stuck with her husband. They break up at first but when they meet again they apparently although this is intentionally vague plan to murder the husband. They are successful and they move back to the woman's home town to run the bar that her husband owned. Gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea. He wants Giovanna but the one thing that he certainly doesn't want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life. Their relationship quickly crumbles. Ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters. It's always fascinating but it does go on a bit too long. At two hours and twentytwo minutes I can't for the life of me figure out how it took that long! This is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that Visconti was inventing within this film. It was after all the first film that won that label. We see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life without any hurrying to the next plot point. I've seen many of Visconti's films and the only one I like better than this one is Rocco and His Brothers 1960. His direction is as great as it ever was with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect. I also feel the need to point out the film's best performance by Dhia Christiani as a young exotic dancer and parttime prostitute named Anita whom Gino meets after he begins to try to break away from Giovanna. She's only in the film for maybe five or six minutes and she has only a few lines. It's shocking how much Visconti and Christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time. She's absolutely heartbreaking. 910.".

The great directors of Italy of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium but it was Luchino Visconti a man of vision who dared to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing. He clearly shows his genius early on in his distinguished career with Ossessione a film based on James Cain's The Postman Always Ring Twice which was later made by Hollywood but that version pales in comparison with what Visconti achieved in the movie. Luchino Visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited Alberto Moravia a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings.The film has been well preserved in the DVD format we watched recently. The film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how Visconti's vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way something the American version lacked.What comes across watching the movie is the intensity which the director got from his key players. The magnificent Clara Calamai does an amazing job as Giovanna the woman who has married an older man but when Gino appears in her life all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life. Giovanna is one of the best creations in Ms. Calamai's achievements in the Italian cinema. The last sequence of the film shows Ms. Calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed.Equally excellent is Massimo Girotti one of the best actors of his generation who appears as Gino the hunky man that awakens the obsessive passion in Giovanna. Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna something that Mr. Girotti projects with such ease and sophistication not equaled before in the screen. Mr. Girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent. Juan DeLanda is seen as Giuseppe the older man who fell in love with Giovanna. In fact his character rings truer than his counterpart in the American film where he is seen more as a buffoon.The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti. They gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way Italian directors of the era favored. The original musical score of Giuseppe Rosati is perfect. Visconti a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors also includes arias by Bizet and Verdi that fit well in the context of the movie.Ossessione is a film to treasure because we see a great Luchino Visconti at the top of his form.".

I didn't know what to expect Visconti to do in his approach to the material after seeing La Terra Trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit. But this is a totally character and emotional based drama bordering on melodrama however without the conventions that bog down lesser ones and with the style in the finest path of the budding filmnoir movement Visconti creates a debut that's as involving as any other neorealist film. Neorealism by the way could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather along with De Sica's The Children Are Watching Us which that would take shape after the war. Although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neorealist efforts it's dealt with in a barebones storytelling fashion and it's laced with other familiar themes in neorealism the lowerclass death desperation.Aside from the story which is simply as it is described on this site the artistry with which Visconti captures the images and then layers them with objects a shawl over Gino Costa's profile when in guilt shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film usually over Gian and Giovanna and the feel of the Italian streets in many of the exterior scenes. Domenico Scala and Aldo Tonti who would lens some of Rossellini and Fellini's films help in envisioning the look of Ossessione which is usually moving in on a character then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly sad and dark and romantic. I think I've just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along even as I was in fear of the futures of the two leads. The two leads Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai portray all the compelling truthful and nearoperatic emotions and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes.

	schema:headline " Some viewers still crazy about its magnetism and realism";
	schema:reviewBody "When people nowadays hear of a 1940s drama they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it's another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic melancholic roles. This opinion however does not resemble Neorealist movies in particular this one directed by Count Luchino Visconti. OSSESSIONE as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others. The contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these 65 years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past. At the same time while being based on the novel by James M. Cain THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style view his own art. I have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which I'd like to entail below.First Visconti's movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life in particular those absorbed by desire. These people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face. Gino Massimo Girotti a traveler with bear like shoulders turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near Ferrara and enters the tavern. Although many people go there to have a meal Gino occurs to get something more  much more the indefatigable desire of beautiful Giovanna Clara Calamai a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar Mr Giuseppe Bragana Juan De Landa. Her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together... However are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire? Can one build love upon murder? What is love and what is loyalty? Does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession? Such questions intensely arise while watching the movie when to the core the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters. We have to love each other affectionately answers Giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything? Isn't it what we both wanted says one of the couple... it occurs that it's not. Therefore the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart. Yet it constantly remains thought provoking.Second OSSESSIONE has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power. These make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost 70 years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch. They range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots. Who can possibly skip that moment in Ferrara where Gino meets a beautiful girl a sort of Ragazza Perfetta perfect girl a dancer Anita and buys her ice cream. His desires show him totally different direction... Do viewers remain indifferent at GinoGiovanna's first meeting? The first focus of camera is on Giovanna's legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that Gino experiences. A marvel of shot is Gino and Giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look.Third OSSESSIONE can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast. Massimo Girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done yet consequently what comes out is a flawless acting. He portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim which represents conscience. His bisexuality is indicated through the character of Lo Spagnolo Elio Marcuzzo whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for Ancona. Clara Calamai who was cast in the role after eminent Anna Magnani had refused fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple. They are both very convincing. Besides I liked Juan De Langa in the role of Bragana he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art. In some of his most witty moments he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance.In sum we as modern viewers who are capable of critical view have to look at this film very objectively. It is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries yet is it educational?

	onyx:emotionText "When people nowadays hear of a 1940s drama they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it's another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic melancholic roles. This opinion however does not resemble Neorealist movies in particular this one directed by Count Luchino Visconti. OSSESSIONE as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others. The contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these 65 years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past. At the same time while being based on the novel by James M. Cain THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style view his own art. I have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which I'd like to entail below.First Visconti's movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life in particular those absorbed by desire. These people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face. Gino Massimo Girotti a traveler with bear like shoulders turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near Ferrara and enters the tavern. Although many people go there to have a meal Gino occurs to get something more  much more the indefatigable desire of beautiful Giovanna Clara Calamai a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar Mr Giuseppe Bragana Juan De Landa. Her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together... However are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire? Can one build love upon murder? What is love and what is loyalty? Does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession? Such questions intensely arise while watching the movie when to the core the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters. We have to love each other affectionately answers Giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything? Isn't it what we both wanted says one of the couple... it occurs that it's not. Therefore the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart. Yet it constantly remains thought provoking.Second OSSESSIONE has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power. These make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost 70 years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch. They range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots. Who can possibly skip that moment in Ferrara where Gino meets a beautiful girl a sort of Ragazza Perfetta perfect girl a dancer Anita and buys her ice cream. His desires show him totally different direction... Do viewers remain indifferent at GinoGiovanna's first meeting? The first focus of camera is on Giovanna's legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that Gino experiences. A marvel of shot is Gino and Giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look.Third OSSESSIONE can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast. Massimo Girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done yet consequently what comes out is a flawless acting. He portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim which represents conscience. His bisexuality is indicated through the character of Lo Spagnolo Elio Marcuzzo whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for Ancona. Clara Calamai who was cast in the role after eminent Anna Magnani had refused fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple. They are both very convincing. Besides I liked Juan De Langa in the role of Bragana he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art. In some of his most witty moments he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance.In sum we as modern viewers who are capable of critical view have to look at this film very objectively. It is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries yet is it educational? Visconti was not Fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity. In such case his films would only entertain which is of course not entirely Fellini's style too. Visconti always had something to convey. What did he want to say here? Is the film against bad marriage? Or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire? The final shocking moments say for themselves. Though you don't have to agree with the vision OSSESSIONE is really a wonderfully realistic film one of Visconti's best 810";

	schema:reviewBody "Well I'd heard from somewhere that Ossessione is a precursor to the Italian film genre and particular favourite of mine the 'Giallo'...but actually aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in Italy the two have pretty much no relation. In the sixties and seventies Italian filmmakers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful American film released. They've not done that here but Ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later American film 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' without giving the book's author James M. Cain so much as a credit! Anyway the plot focuses on Gino Costa a handsome drifter who by chance stumbles upon a caf where a woman named Giovanna Bragana works. He soon learns that she's married to Giuseppe a big fat annoying man whom Giovanna can't stand to have even touching her. He wants the pair of them to run away together but she's not so keen on the idea. However fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful...Despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it's based on it has to be said that director Luchino Visconti implements the film noir style well and in a way I even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger American noir classics. The story is as you would expect extremely strong and the Visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast. Visconti drags the film out a little bit too much however and with a running time of almost 135 minutes I felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length. I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film but it's not a 'great' film. The relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters' heads. There's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on and by not always focusing on the characters themselves the film is not as interesting as it could have been. Still it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason...although it's not as good as the 1946 version of the same James M. Cain classic.".

Visconti drags the film out a little bit too much however and with a running time of almost 135 minutes I felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length. I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film but it's not a 'great' film. The relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters' heads. There's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on and by not always focusing on the characters themselves the film is not as interesting as it could have been. Still it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason...although it's not as good as the 1946 version of the same James M. Cain classic.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Ruth Snyder  Judd Gray murder in 1927 inspired Ogden Nash to write a Broadway play called Machinal. More famously it inspired James M. Cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with  Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Both became film noir classics of the 1940's Double Indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made. Some of the reallife elements of the SnyderGray story were captured by Cain  the old age and indifference of Albert Gray Ruth's high sex drive Ruth and Judd's passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause. Missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban Manhattan  Albert Snyder being a respected newspaper editor. The numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase.Cain's Double Indemnity was filmed perfectly by Billy Wilder  let's ignore Stanwyck's ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore! The Postman Always Rings Twice however was filmed thrice and Ossessione an Italian version and Luchino Visconti's first film was the first of three versions. Before commenting on it I'll recommend the Lana Turner  John Garfield version of 1946 in its entirety and five minutes of the 1981 Jack Nicholson  Jessica Lange version for the great sex scene on the dining table.Ossessione is not as noirish as The Postman Always Rings Twice. It has a strong neorealist look which makes it a great movie but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing. It does not have lowkey lighting and unconventional camera angles. The dialog is not hardboiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization. This is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization. Its also a lot more sexual than the Lana Turner version. We have a very obvious adulterous relationship and Giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac. A new character is introduced into the story  La Spagnola  with very obvious homosexual overtones. There is also a small but very wellplayed role for a dancer who moonlights as a prostitute.This is a far greater study of the working class than of crime. The audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime. The drifter is a complete tramp the wife is no Lana Turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage. Her husband is an obscene capitalist  obese rude and arrogant. I think the casting was brilliant for this film. My only beef is with the overlong running time. Everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical. Nevertheless fans of noir and realism will definitely like Ossessione as I did.".

Also at times there is a threat that Visconti will veer into film noir territory though thankfully he never quite does so.The acting is solid though the character of the husband a fat capitalist is more of a caricature than anything else.Unfortunately pacing problems ultimately undermine the story and any tension that may be building in the narrative dissipates due to the slow tempo.The bleak scenery of povertystricken rural towns and dock sides reflects the moral squalor of the characters and perhaps shows how one feeds on the other with economic downturns leading to a breakup of the social fabric.Nevertheless the brutally ironic conclusion reinforces the theme of the transience of life and how suddenly violent death can ensure.The music is suitably minimal and the acting is serviceable but ultimately the film lacks any kind of moral centre. Later neorealism would rectify this shortcoming in the character of the young son in the Bicycle Thieves and the eponymous hero of Umberto D. but here Visconti presents a totally amoral world with only the largely characterless police representing a distant authority that can enforce any order. Perhaps rightly given the political circumstances under which the film was made they are a remote almost mechanical presence.Ultimately this is a strong film but one that is almost fatally undermined by its slow pacing.

Among the most brazen of the rebel leaders is General Cordova Raf Vallone. With his army of Mexican revolutionaries he attacks Pershing kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces. Since the United States Army cannot enter Mexico legally Capt. Douglas is sent on what is slated a suicide mission without orders and without aid from Pershing. His mission is to retrieve the Cannons destroy a rebel stronghold and bring Cordova back alive. Selecting the roughest toughest most experienced certainly the most insolent men available Douglas enters Mexico and attacks the nearly impregnable fortress. Dramatic action follows as does lots of explosive excitement. If one is asks for criticism I would say the choice of heavies. Vallone and John Larch are not very menacing.

It stars George Peppard Giovanna Ralli Raf Vallone Pete Duel Don Gordon Nico Minardos John Larch John Russell and Francine York. A PanavisionDe Luxe Color production music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Antonio Macasoli. In 1912 the border between Texas and Mexico was aflame with the raids of Mexican bandit hordes who called themselves revolutionaries. To combat them the American government dispatched General John J. Blackjack Pershing to deal with the bandit raiders one of the most dangerous of whom was General Hector Cordoba! A Paella Western crammed to the brim with machismo and action Cannon for Cordoba is in desperate need of reevaluation by the Pasta Western loving crowd. The big problem the film has is that it is so indebted to a number of other men on a mission movies it has struggled to gain credit for actually doing the format well. Undeniably the viewing experience is greatly helped if you are like me a fan of such films like The Guns of Navarone The Dirty Dozen Where Eagles Dare The Professionals and The Wild Bunch etc because this is basically the Paella version of those films. Shot on location in Spain with what now would be called a modest budget it's pacey explosive pleasing in visuals and very well performed in the traditional Pasta Western sense. While the grim textures come courtesy of torture sexual hostility and terrorism. Plot basically entails U.S. Army Captain Rod Douglas Peppard taking a very small gathering of miscreants over the border into Mexico their mission is to infiltrate Cordoba's Vallone mountain stronghold and destroy the cannons claimed by Cordoba's bandits earlier in the play. The threads that run through the plot see one of the group holding a grudge against his leader another that has the lady of the mission operating on justifiable revenge driven ends and with so many people wanting Cordoba dead Douglas is up against it since he's under orders to bring the General back alive to face public trial and inevitable execution. There's an unsubtle whiff of cynicism throughout the picture the sly asides to the Vietnam War issue carrying a glint in the eye as cheeky as Peppard's performance. Oh it's no message movie Wendkos and his team are firmly intent on tapping into the zeitgeist of those formula movies previously there for sure is no overt attempts at political lecturing but the scent is there and keeps the pic smelling wholesome. Cast are the expected mixed bag for such a production. Peppard is every inch a Spaghetti Western antihero perky blue eyes stubbled face fuzz and constantly chomping on a cigar he's the fulcrum of the viewing experience and he's great company to be in. Vallone is on wonderfully oily villain duties yet charming into the bargain as well Duel is nicely edgy and Ralli I find it hard to write her name without swooning is a sexual ball of deviousness. Wendkos favours tilted pan shots for his action scenes which work to a point but then feel like well what's the point? While Bernstein provides a robust score that stirs the blood to boiling point. Under seen and under valued? You betcha. 7.510".

This is Paul Wendkos' masterpiece. Its storyline can be retailed in a single pair of sentences. General Hector Cordoba is setting up as nearemperor in Northern Mexico and steals a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. he sends his crack mission unit divided apprehensive but determined led by George Peppard to get the cannon back and bring back Cordoba alive to put an end to the rebellion. Charismatic Raf Vallone plays Cordoba the ladies in the piece are Giovanna Ralli and Francine York with the squad even further comprised of Nico Minardos Peter Deuel and Don Gordon. Other stalwarts in the class include John Larch and John Russell. Also horning in on an already fantasticallydangerous operation are Miss Ralli and a stubborn Mexican Teniente Gabriela Tinti whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba set up on his own. The danger is multiplied when Gordon's brother as advance spy is captured and tortured to death while he has to watch...and he decides he needs to kill Peppard. The attack that captures the cannon when Peppard's orders are not obeyed by a regular army type is one of the most electrifying visual and staging achievements in cinematic history the penetration of Cordoba's stronghold the revelations uncovered there and the actions that win the mission team a chance at victoryor almost victoryare flawlessly presented. This is a beautiful color adventure film with unusually strong costumes acting lighting art direction sets and music by Elmer Bernstein. The script by Stephen Kandel is probably his best ever for a feature film. This is probably the most underrated major western at the moment but I have always appreciated its heroes as result getting hardworkers. But as Peppard reminds his group on the way home The trouble with being a herois the morning after. To find out why he says so you will have to see Cannon For Cordoba.".

The whole movie I found myself looking for these 2 and if they were in the scene I was watching and hushing the room. But then Gordon has always played a great heavy and Duel....Well too bad we did not get a chance to see him push his way to the top He definitely seemed to have the talent to have gone much further. so basically I liked it but I like action movies  the plot was OK and if your a Peppard fan its a must.

Basically Cordoba is a version of Pancho Villa who raided the American border in New Mexico and brought the wrath of President Wilson and the U.S. Army down on his neck. European actor Raf Vallone of Obsession makes an impressive as well as villainous Cordoba. Cordoba's men infiltrate the town where Pershing's cannon are parked and they shoot it out with the Army. This battle is skillfully lensed and staged by Windkos with bravado. Mind you this isn't a minor shootout but a major one in terms of the numbers of men that bite the dust. Captain Douglas George Peppard of The Blue Max saves Pershing's life during the raid when the Mexicans surprise the Army and try to kill Pershing. Once Cordoba's troops have stolen the guns they take them to a remote outpost in the mountains. Douglas and his group of ragtag guard house reprobates set out on a dangerous mission with a Federale captain. The Federale captain brings a lady friend of Cordoba along with him when he enters Cordoba's impregnable fortress.

	schema:reviewBody "Animal Crackers is one of the best films ever done by the 4 Marx Brothers. For a start the comedy completely works on screen especially considering that the film was adapted from the musical stage play. And although Zeppo's comedy has always been underrated and underplayed in the five films that the 4 Marx Brothers did for Paramount Pictures he proves in this film as well as the four other movies he appeared with Groucho Chico and Harpo that the 4 Marx Brothers made better films when the four of them worked together as opposed to when it was just Groucho Chico and Harpo. All the Marx Brothers films which included Zeppo were zanier films and to me the best of their work. Verbally Groucho is at his razorsharp best in Animal Crackers with almost every oneliner dripping with comedic insults and sarcasm. Chico and Harpo perfectly add to the mayhem. The direction by Victor Heerman showed the type of skill needed to professionally control the 4 Marx Brothers to make Animal Crackers the tremendous success that it was. Though the Great Depression was taking hold on the American psyche in 1930 Animal Crackers was the perfect comedy which allowed ordinary Americans to enjoy the spoofing of America's 'Hoi Polloi'.Though the 4 Marx Brothers' succeeding films Monkey Business Horse Feathers and Duck Soup were even more of the Hollywood filmstyle comedy successes which crystalized their zaniness and onscreen craziness one should not underestimate the cinematography of George Folsey Sr. who made the film look like a movie written especially for the screen. The look of the film specifically the sets makes one feel like he or she wished they had been invited to Mrs. Rittenhouse's party in honor of Captain Spaulding. Lillian Roth never looked better and the best song in the film is her musical number with Hal Thompson Why Am I So Romantic?  which was the theme music for the entire movie. Animal Crackers is one of my favorite films that the 4 Marx Brothers did for Paramount Pictures  although all five films made at Paramount are absolute gems. I strongly suggest getting the Marx Brothers' Silver Screen Collection which is now on DVD. They are a must for your film library!".

I was working as manager of the Paris Theatre on 58th Street when Animal Crackers opened at the Sutton and because both houses were part of the Cinema5 circuit I was always able to get passes.  In this case because I had also worked as 'relief manager' at The Sutton on many occasions I was well known to the staff and had entry to that theatre whenever I wanted. During the 'opening' run of Animal Crackers I often walked over to The Sutton when my day's shift was complete at The Paris.I can tell you that every screening of Animal Crackers that I attended was packed. And every time I was present for the film's end I witnessed a standing ovation something that many film producers can only dream of. I often tried to imagine myself attending a 'live' performance of this show. As many have mentioned here Animal Crackers was a hit Broadway show starring the Marx Brothers long before it was filmed by Paramount.Rather than complaining that this film is stagey many who comment here would do well to remember that a film like this is as close to a Broadway show as millions of people will ever get. The annoying penchant some viewers have for wondering why the film version of a Broadway hit show especially a musicalcomedy isn't more openedup is both tiresome and moot.Also the constant comparison of Animal Crackers to other Marx Brothers films especially the later MGM films is an 'applestooranges' kind of thing. It would make far more sense to compare it to other early filmedversions of it's Broadway contemporaries such as Rio Rita or Flying High or Girl Crazy.... Although the stage show of Animal Crackers was on Broadway long before I was born and the film's initial premier predates me by almost as long I am forever gratified to have been able to attend the 1974 reopening of the film in New York and to see feel and participate in the audiences' jubilant reactions. I rated this film 1010. It's a perfect comedy with theatregoers will recognize this honesttogoodness Broadway music and with Lillian Roth too. Animal Crackers is a great show in every respect.Hungadunga!".

	schema:reviewBody "Animal Crackers was the second of two Broadway shows that starred the Marx Brothers and was done at the Paramount Astoria Studios. After they went to Hollywood with the exception of Room Service all their material was original for the screen. The Brothers were doing Animal Crackers on Broadway in 19281929 and it had a respectable run of 191 performances. In fact while they were doing Animal Crackers on stage for a part of 1929 they were shooting The Cocoanuts at the Astoria Studios. Unlike The Cocoanuts nearly the entire Broadway cast was used in the film with the exception of the juveniles Lillian Roth and Hal Thompson. Also unlike The Cocoanuts nearly the entire Bert KalmarHarry Ruby score was discarded with the notable exception of Groucho's immortal theme Hooray for Captain Spalding. Kalmar and Ruby did write the ballad that Roth and Thompson sing Why Am I So Romantic for the screen version.Margaret Dumont as Mrs. Rittenhouse of the Long Island horsey set is throwing a party and the guest of honor is Groucho with his secretary Zeppo as Captain Spalding. Crashing the party is Chico and Harpo.But not only is Captain Spalding on display Dumont is giving an unveiling of a famous painting for which two people have brought copies for different purposes. Of course the original does get stolen and there's no use me going on any further because the plot just dissolves with the various monkeyshines engaged in by the Marx Brothers.My favorite bits are Groucho when he does a devastating lampoon on Eugene O'Neill's Strange Interlude. It turned out to be too good a satire because when the play made it to the screen two years later no one took it seriously.Secondly is Chico and Harpo mercilessly threatening to expose hoity toity art critic Louis Sorin who they knew back in the day as Abie the Fishman. Actually that's kind of sad in a way because Sorin may be a snob now but he did in fact educate himself out of peddling fish and rose in an honorable to a legitimate living. But you don't think about that while Chico and Harpo are doing their thing.Although like The Cocoanuts it's a photographed stage play Animal Crackers works a whole lot better. The play itself was primarily on one set on the stage and it transitions better to the screen than The Cocoanuts did.The brothers are at their most anarchistic and zany here try not to miss it.".

It turned out to be too good a satire because when the play made it to the screen two years later no one took it seriously.Secondly is Chico and Harpo mercilessly threatening to expose hoity toity art critic Louis Sorin who they knew back in the day as Abie the Fishman. Actually that's kind of sad in a way because Sorin may be a snob now but he did in fact educate himself out of peddling fish and rose in an honorable to a legitimate living. But you don't think about that while Chico and Harpo are doing their thing.Although like The Cocoanuts it's a photographed stage play Animal Crackers works a whole lot better. The play itself was primarily on one set on the stage and it transitions better to the screen than The Cocoanuts did.The brothers are at their most anarchistic and zany here try not to miss it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first two surviving Marx Brothers films were based on their second and third major Broadway successes THE COCONUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS. As early movies they suffer from the rigidity of the early talkies. Papers used as props on the set had to be wet in order for the crackling of paper to be reduced as much as possible from being picked by the microphones. It is remarkable that the films survived to continue to bring pleasure to audiences. In the case of ANIMAL CRACKERS for years it and the later A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA were tied up in copywrite problems that prevented them being released to the public. I did not see it until I went with my sister to see the film in 1974 in Manhattan.This film is the one that established Groucho Marx's theme song Hooray For Captain Spaulding. Groucho's Jeffrey T. Spaulding has just returned from Africa and has been invited to the Long Island estate of Mrs. Rittenhouse Margaret Dumont. Her guests include the noted art collector and expert Roscoe W. Chandler Louis Sorin. He's going to reveal a masterpiece of art that he has purchased. Mrs. Rittenhouse's friend and rival Mrs. Whitehead plans to steal the painting and hide it to embarrass her hostess. Her daughter and her exbutler Hives Robert Greig are in on this plot. Meanwhile Mrs. Rittenhouse's daughter Arabella Lillian Roth is trying to help her boyfriend John Parker Hal Thompson a struggling artist prove his abilities. Other guests include the musician Signior Emmanuel Ravelli and the Professor Chico and Harpo and Spaulding's secretary Horation Jamison Zeppo.There are many similarities between this musical's book and THE COCONUTS such as both having detectives named Hennesey and both naming Zeppo Jamison. The struggles of Roth standing by her struggling painterboyfriend mirror the struggles of Mary Eaton supporting her struggling architectboyfriend Oscar Shaw. But here Groucho is a visitor not the hotel ownermanager. And here there is more use for Zeppo. In fact except for the third film MONKEY BUSINESSand the fifth film DUCK SOUP Zeppo never had as much to do that was funny in any of the Marx Brothers movies than here. He has to take dictation from Groucho regarding the legal team of Hungerdunger Hungerdunger Hungerdunger Hungerdunger and McCormick pronounced Hoongerdoonger. It is a classic Marx routine. There are some topical humor. Roscoe W. Chandler is a spoof on the noted millionaire and culture maven Otto Kahn head of the Board of the Metropolitan Opera. Kahn was trying to find a location for the new opera house in the late 1920s and we hear Chandler and Groucho discussing possibly putting it into Central Park. Kahn was from the old Wilhelmine Empire and was an immigrant though one who made good in banking. Chandler in one stunning moment with Chico turns out to be Abe Kabible a fish peddler from Czechoslovakia Chandler has to pay some blackmail to Chico and Harpo about this but he does shoot back at Chico an inquiry of how long he's been an Italian!. Another topical jab is regarding Eugene O'Neill's STRANGE INTERLUDE where O'Neill had characters speak their minds separately from the regular dialog with each other. In fact Groucho even admits he is going into a strange interlude of his own. His comments are spoken in a clipped sad voice and include a final set of lines where he sounds portentous  talking about strange figures weird figures. Then he starts giving stock quotations!The film is a little slow at spots as was THE COCONUTS but the brothers do well as does Lillian Roth and Margaret Dumont. The film is very entertaining and it is good that it is still around.".

	schema:reviewBody "BluRay restoration of preCode Animal Crackers  Wonderfully sexy with newly added scenes!!!Animal Crackers has been my favorite Marx Brothers film since the first time I saw it on the Big Screen back in the late 1970s after it was rediscovered. Animal Crackers has more quoted lines from it than any other Marx Brothers feature and for good reason. The writing in it sparkles. It was only their second sound film but it was the last based on one of the Marx Brothers Broadway plays. It was a smash hit on stage because the brothers had time to polish the script their delivery and added improvisations based on the live audience reactions. All of which was built on their decades long Vaudeville career and their recent Broadway smash Coconuts also turned into one of the finest musical comedies ever let alone 1929!SPOILERSBut the recent BluRay restoration added several censored lines that have been missing for decades. I noticed at least four 1 At the party scene at the beginning of Groucho's speech about going on safari in Africa he talks about a rhinoceros aiming a gun at Groucho. When asked what he did he answers married the rhinoceros' daughter. 2 At the dictation scene at the beginning of Groucho's letter he mentions a girl getting scratched. 3 At the end of the letter Zeppo as his secretary mentions a girl getting scratched and Groucho says it's the other way around the man scratches the girl! 4 In the scene where Harpo wakes up on the bench sleeping on the paintings the neighbor lady tries to get the stolen paintings away from him saying she knows what a woman wants and Harpo then spanks her rear end using the painting.Bottom line A very funny film with some preCode risqu lines put back in. 10 stars!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Marx Brothers' second movie is one of their funniest despite suffering from some of the same limitations of the early sound era as their first film The Cocoanuts. It's a great movie with the Marx Bros. at their zany best. Groucho is Captain Spaulding Chico is Signor Emanuel Ravelli Harpo is The Professor and Zeppo is....well who cares who Zeppo is? He actually gets a funny scene in this movie taking dictation from Groucho. That's uncommon as he was usually just the straight man. The movie's plot such as it is revolves around a painting stolen at a party thrown by a rich dowager Margaret Dumont for famed explorer Capt. Spaulding. The guys are all funny and the movie's full of memorable sketches songs and oneliners. Lllian Roth is enjoyable as half of the obligatory romantic subplot. That's a rarity for the Marx Bros. movies where typically the two young people shoehorned in for a romantic subplot are the worst part of the picture. Roth's charming presence makes it more bearable this time. Special mention to the amazing Margaret Dumont who was a vital part of the success of the best Marx movies. Here she even gets to do some physical comedy in a hilarious scene with Harpo.I love the Marx Bros' Paramount films for their energy and eccentricities. From this movie until Duck Soup the boys were at their best in my opinion. Yes they made some good ones after that but they were more polished and structured than the Paramount movies. Animal Crackers is a classic with many great jokes and routines including Hello I Must Be Going breaking the fourth wall the bridge scene elephant in my pajamas and pretty much every line of dialogue Groucho has.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Marx Brothers' second movie is one of their funniest despite suffering from some of the same limitations of the early sound era as their first film The Cocoanuts. It's a great movie with the Marx Bros. at their zany best. Groucho is Captain Spaulding Chico is Signor Emanuel Ravelli Harpo is The Professor and Zeppo is....well who cares who Zeppo is? He actually gets a funny scene in this movie taking dictation from Groucho. That's uncommon as he was usually just the straight man. The movie's plot such as it is revolves around a painting stolen at a party thrown by a rich dowager Margaret Dumont for famed explorer Capt. Spaulding. The guys are all funny and the movie's full of memorable sketches songs and oneliners. Lllian Roth is enjoyable as half of the obligatory romantic subplot. That's a rarity for the Marx Bros. movies where typically the two young people shoehorned in for a romantic subplot are the worst part of the picture. Roth's charming presence makes it more bearable this time. Special mention to the amazing Margaret Dumont who was a vital part of the success of the best Marx movies. Here she even gets to do some physical comedy in a hilarious scene with Harpo.I love the Marx Bros' Paramount films for their energy and eccentricities. From this movie until Duck Soup the boys were at their best in my opinion. Yes they made some good ones after that but they were more polished and structured than the Paramount movies. Animal Crackers is a classic with many great jokes and routines including Hello I Must Be Going breaking the fourth wall the bridge scene elephant in my pajamas and pretty much every line of dialogue Groucho has.";

T. Spaulding Groucho Marx the African explorer accompanied by his personal secretary introduced but a film adaptation to the 1928 Broadway play by George F. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind starring those four Marx Brothers inHoratio Jamieson Zeppo Marx and Roscoe W. Chandler Louis Sorin a fish peddler posing as a wealthy European art patron who is to exhibit Beaugard's famous painting After the Hunt valued at 100000. Also in attendance are musicians Emanuel Ravelli Chico Marx and his partner the Professor Harpo Marx who spends much of his time chasing girls. Mrs. Rittenhouse has a vivacious daughter named Arabella Lillian Roth whose romantic interest is John Parker Hal Thompson an struggling young artist who has made a copy of the Beaugard while as a student in Paris. Because John's painting looks so much like the original Arabella stumbles upon an idea of switching the paintings in hope that at the unveiling his work will be recognized so that they could get married. She hires Ravelli and the Professor to help with the switch. At he same time Grace Carpenter Kathryn Reece who has also made a copy of the painting while in art school decides to make the switch as well with the help of Mrs. Whitehead Margaret Irving a society friend of Mrs. Rittenhouse. Hives Robert Greig a former employer of Mrs. Whitehead with a questionable past now under Mrs. Rittenhouse's employ agrees to assist her with the switch. When the painting is discovered missing Inspector Hennessy Edward Metcalfe and his men are called to investigate but after the paintings are recovered confusion arises when no one is able to determine the copies from the original.ANIMAL CRACKERS spoofs high society eliminating much of the songs originated from the play focusing more on the comedic gags than plot stretching its limited scenario to 97 minutes becoming longest of the Marx comedies for Paramount. The surviving tunes composed by Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar include You Must Do Your Best Tonight sung by Robert Greig and The Music Masters I Represent sung by Zeppo Marx Hello I Must be Going sung by Groucho Marx Hooray For Captain Spaulding sung by Groucho Zeppo Margaret Dumont and guests Why Am I So Romantic? sung by Lillian Roth and Hal Thompson harp solo by Harpo Marx. Of the songs two have become synonymous with Groucho Hello I Must Be Going used as a title of one of his biographies and Hooray for Captain Spaulding becoming the opening and closing theme song to Groucho's 1950s radio TV game show YOU BET YOUR LIFE.Besides its stage origins COCOANUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS each have something in common both were filmed at Paramount's Astoria studios in New York younger brother Zeppo assumes the character name of Jamieson the plot involves thievery followed by the presence of a police inspector named Hennessy. Unlike the other Marx comedies ANIMAL CRACKERS was the only one unavailable for viewing due to some sort of copyright dispute with the sad possibility of never to be shown again again. After many years of uncertainty ANIMAL CRACKERS was finally resurrected in revival theaters in 1974 much to the delight of many Marx Brothers fans and premiered on network television CBS on that historic evening July 21 1979. Afterwards it was presented on numerous cable channels such as Arts and Entertainment American Movie Classics 199192 and finally Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere December 17 2001. Due to its sortafter popularity it was one of the first Marx Brothers comedies distributed on video cassette in the 1980s and can currently be seen and appreciated in its DVD format.Although a huge success during its initial release ANIMAL CRACKERS is not as funny as the Marx's previous effort. Production values have much improved over its prehistoric visuals of THE COCOANUTS but as Groucho points out while looking towards the camera Well all the jokes can't be good. You got to expect that once in a while. He's so right. It's not so much the odd mixture of good and bad jokes combined that weakens the film but some dated doings that are a total loss for viewers today namely Groucho doing a Strange Interlude by speaking his thoughts out to the audience or making a reference to character actor Chic Sale. Who? The GrouchoChico exchanges don't come close to the height of hilarity as their Why a Duck skit from THE COCOANUTS particularly with Chico's deduction of the painting stolen by left handed moths. What? Of the leading ladies assisting in the romantic subplot Lillian Roth is a welcome change of pace from the sophisticated straightforward actresses due to her downtoearth and lively screen presence. She and Hal Thompson do get a chance to have a duet song to themselves. It's no highlight but not bad either. Margaret Dumont's encounter with Groucho's love makingalong with her card game with Chico and Harpo are truly memorable. And poor Zeppo. While he's the first Marx Brother to make an appearance he's more offscreen than on. In conclusion ANIMAL CRACKERS remains an amusing vintage Marx comedy that will never disappear again. Hooray hooray hooray! ".

Having been adapted from one of their Vaudeville shows many of the comic bits drag on too long or don't work as well as they would have on stage.

	schema:reviewBody "Groucho Marx in one of the Marx Brothers' Classics surrounded by the usual cast of High Society bubble heads delivers what many consider their very best work. The lunacy begins when Groucho arrives back from an African Exploration just in time to be the guest of honor at a Society Dinner Party. The craziness is fueled by some twists and turns about a valuable painting which seems to be easily copied onto what appears like a roll of wall paper. The predictable plot keeps rolling along while Groucho seems to consume 95 of the script with oneliners.In 1930 this may have been a welcome distraction from Depression Era humdrum life. I tried to find the same amusement a lifetime later and can't agree with the critics. Aside from a few clever even risqu jokes I was missing the rollingonthefloorwithlaughter effect. Animal Crackers left me only with Lukewarm feelings while I found the other Marx Brothers Classic Duck Soup hilarious. I would rather see Duck Soup 5 more times than view Animal Crackers ever again. Not a total loss of 1 12 time but don't expect any mirror scenes because this film doesn't have any.".

I suspect that they probably had a lot of fun filming this movie. I literally felt like I was going hoarse from laughing during the few minutes leading up to the card game but I managed to keep my breath. Along with the anarchic humor the scenes of Chico playing the piano and Harpo playing the harp are almost mystifying.So this remains an important part of cinema history.

	schema:reviewBody "Day of Anger is an incredible western. Not only is it one of the 3 or 4 best nonLeone spaghetti westerns It also has just about the best nonMorricone music score I have heard.Lee Van Cleef is at his very best in this movie as Talby the slick intelligent and ruthless gunfighter. As is the case with many spaghetti westerns this movie draws a very thin line between good and evil. Talby is a killing machine who is out for his own personal gain yet he is also very likable in many ways. When he takes Scott under his wing and teaches him not to put up with being treated with disrespect from the good citizens of Clifton Talby actually becomes the only person who represents any real sort of justice in the whole town. Then we find out that the pillars of the community have something to hide and Talby delivers his own brand of justice to them also.Giuliano Gemma always delivers a great spaghetti western performance and he is at the top of his game here as well. In the role of Scott Mary he has to play a character who goes through a lot of different emotions and a couple of lifechanging events. When Scott becomes a gunfighter like Talby we relate to him and like him even more as he demands and gets respect from the people who used to spit on him. Talby's comment to the townsfolk of Clifton sums up why He was born a wolf but you made him rabid. What a great line! The final showdown at the end is one of the classics. It is wonderfully choreographed with the film's music and has that artistic operatic quality that the very best spaghetti westerns possess. There's lots of emotion going on in this one as it is plain to see that the two men squaring off still have respect and admiration for each other. On some level it even still seems like they are friends but this moment was inevitable like an uncontrollable force of nature. As Talby says once you start killing you can't stop. Talby's killing finally draws that thin line Scott ends up on the other side of it and the final showdown begins. I will say no more.Riz Ortolani's score is awesome. I love the opening theme and the pictures and movements on the screen that accompany it. It pulls you right into this film before the story even begins. Not only is the music great it is very original as well. It is not a Morricone ripoff at all. Ortolani's style here is all his own. It is much more of a swinging 60's sound that retains just enough western flavor to make it appropriate for this type of film. This is a soundtrack I would like to have on CD.This is one of those movies that I just can't say enough about. I would recommend it to anyone and if you like spaghetti westerns you really need to own it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been trawling through the spaghetti western back catalogue lately and it seems I've missed quite a few hidden gems. Day of Anger is one of them. Tonino Valleni's western is more American in its approach although the staples of the spaghetti genre are still here. Close ups violence altough not as glorifying as you'd expect from your typical spag a languid jazzy score by Riz Ortolani a departure from the typical operatic Morricone scores and great performances by Lee Van Cleef and Giulliano Gemma.Giulliano Gemma is Scott the garbage boy for the quite peaceful town of Clifton a town where the sheriff wanders about without his gun and residents are surprised to hear the sound of gunshots. Scott is constantly pushed around and ridiculed until gunslinger extraordinaire Talby strides into town. Van Cleef is typically superb as Talby who takes Scott under his wing and teaches him the art of gunslinging by laying out the 9 rules of the gunfigher. Talby and Scott will come back into Clifton to get the 50000 a crook called Wild Jack owed him. Wild Jack was sold short by Clifton's higher class citizens so Talby will have to get the money back in his own way.The story follows both Talby's gradual usurping of the city and Scott's progress from a green boy to a man who stands his ground. The interaction between old experienced gunslinger and enthusiastic apprentice is executed very well. All in all a solid if a little predictable spaghetti western that eschews the conventions of your typical spag for characterization. It's well worth tracking down in its uncut 109 minutes version. It's a shame that quite a few spags were lost amidst the truckloads of similar flicks churned out by the Italian studios in the genre's hayday. This is among the best. And it's one even the American horse opera fans will love.".

	onyx:emotionText "I've been trawling through the spaghetti western back catalogue lately and it seems I've missed quite a few hidden gems. Day of Anger is one of them. Tonino Valleni's western is more American in its approach although the staples of the spaghetti genre are still here. Close ups violence altough not as glorifying as you'd expect from your typical spag a languid jazzy score by Riz Ortolani a departure from the typical operatic Morricone scores and great performances by Lee Van Cleef and Giulliano Gemma.Giulliano Gemma is Scott the garbage boy for the quite peaceful town of Clifton a town where the sheriff wanders about without his gun and residents are surprised to hear the sound of gunshots. Scott is constantly pushed around and ridiculed until gunslinger extraordinaire Talby strides into town. Van Cleef is typically superb as Talby who takes Scott under his wing and teaches him the art of gunslinging by laying out the 9 rules of the gunfigher.

It doesn't share the extreme closeup's of Leone's work but builds it's fair share of tension climaxing in an inevitable yet thrilling climax between teacher and student. The film is superbly filmed backed by a ridiculously catchy score by Riz Ortolani from which the title song was used in Django Unchained 2012. But the film's biggest boast is in the performances of Van Cleef and Gemma the former proving he can play as good an antihero as any of his peers and the latter convincing throughout his massive character shift.

	schema:headline " Day of Anger Is One of Lee Van Cleef's Best Spaghetti Westerns";
	schema:reviewBody "Tonino Valerii's Day of Anger ranks in the lower half of the ten top best Spaghetti westerns. This intelligent superbly made marvelously lensed formulaic saga about the rise and fall of a notorious gunfighter holds its own against comparable American horse operas partially since veteran Hollywood villain Lee Van Cleef of High Noon stars as the leadslinging antihero who is as fast on the draw as he is deadly accurate with his aim. This lean mean gritty 95minute sagebrusher is one of the three best Spaghettis that Van Cleef appeared in with Death Rides A Horse edging Day of Anger out as the best while For A Few Dollars More closely follows in third place. As far as I know no American western has gone into as much detail about the rules of being a gunfighter as Day of Anger. Indeed Day of Anger recalls both the Henry Fonda and Anthony Perkins relationship in Anthony Mann's The Tin Star 1958 and Brian Keith and Steve McQueen in Henry Hathaway's Nevada Smith 1966 where an old gun teaches a young gun the rules. Frank Talby Lee Van Cleef delineates the nine things that Scott Mary costar Giuliano Gemma of Fort Yuma Gold must learn to survive as a gunfighter. First never beg for anything from another man. Second never trust anybody. Third never come between a gun and its target. Fourth like bullets punches in a fistfight must be first if you want to finish the brawl. Fifth if you wound a man then you'd better finish him off otherwise he will try to kill you. Sixth you must aim your bullets well and always shoot them at the right time. Seventh take a man's gun away from him before you untie his wrists. At this point Scott Mary interjects a rule that he contrived on the spot Don't give a man any more bullets that what he needs. Eighth sometimes you will have to accept a challenge or lose everything. Ninth when you start killing you cannot stop it.Scenarists Renzo Jungle Holocaust Genta and Ernesto My Name Is Nobody Gastaldi along with director Tonino Valerii based their Day of Anger screenplay on a German novel by Ron Barker entitled Der Tod Ritt Dienstags. Valerii and company waste no time establishing the primary setting in the inhospitable frontier berg of Clifton Arizona and we meet an illegitimate fellow simply known as Scott Giuliano Gemma of The Master Touch who was raised in the local bordello and now serves as the community's garbage collector. Everybody looks down their collective noses at woebegone Scott. Scott's life is grim unrelenting drudgery until gunfighter Frank Talby Lee Van Cleef rides into Clifton and pays Scott a dollar to stable his horse. Later in the saloon after Talby has given Scott his dollar he invites the youth to have a drink. The outraged saloon owner refuses to serve Scott and another gunman challenges Talby. Talby guns him down and an inquest clears him of murder. The irate townspeople beat up Scott for testifying on Talby's behalf. Scott flees the town on his mule to track down Talby. He finds him in the border town of Bowie where Talby is demanding that Wild Jack Al Mulock of The Hellbenders pay him back the 50thousand that he owes him. Jack explains that he just got released from prison where he served a 10year sentence. Talby has no sympathy for Jack until he explains that the robbery that he staged was planned by the pillars of community in Clifton and that they sold him down the river. Eventually Talby has to shoot Jack and then he sets out to blackmail the pillars of Clifton to obtain his 50thousand. Scott helps Talby out of a scrape afterward by tossing him a gun after three bandits have dragged him through the sagebrush on his belly. Of course Talby wipes them out and Scott and he become thick as thieves. Only in the final quarter hour do Talby and Scott Mary have their first and final falling out over Talby's decision to gun down Scott's friend the elderly lawman. The shoot'em up finale reiterates the nine gunfighter rules. Riz Ortolani's jazzy energetic orchestral score is a welcome departure from the Ennio Morricone staple and Enzo Beyond the Law Serafin's widescreen cinematography captures the primitive quality of the west. At one point in the plot Talby burns down a saloon that he has halfownership in and kills his partner. The saloon that Talby orders built is probably the most distinctive saloon in the history of western movies both foreign and domestic. What stands out about the facade of the saloon is that huge handcarved and painted Colt's .45 sixguns serve as the facade uprights.Although this Lee Van Cleef  Giuliano Gemma western is serious from start to finish Day of Anger gets its best joke in early in the action but you have to be a Spaghetti western fan to appreciate it. Scott grabs his mule to ride after Talby. Scott Mary calls his mule 'Sartana' the name of an invincible gunslinger in Spaghetti westerns. Valerii and his scribes has fashioned an oldfashioned western that owes more to Hollywood than Europe. Essentially Day of Anger amounts to a morality play wherein the hero is rewarded for his virtue and the villains are penalized with death for their perfidy. Lee Van Cleef excels as Talby and Gemma is convincing as the green kid who grows up fast. Talby remains a static character while Scott changes over time from a nobody to a somebody something rare in Spaghettis. Nothing in Day of Anger is unrealistic. Valerii stages a great joustlike duel on horseback where the rivals must load black powder rifles with cap and ball while riding hellbent at each other and shoot to kill. The dialogue doesn't consist of snappy repartees and violence isn't glorified as it usually is in most Spaghettis.".

This intelligent superbly made marvelously lensed formulaic saga about the rise and fall of a notorious gunfighter holds its own against comparable American horse operas partially since veteran Hollywood villain Lee Van Cleef of High Noon stars as the leadslinging antihero who is as fast on the draw as he is deadly accurate with his aim. This lean mean gritty 95minute sagebrusher is one of the three best Spaghettis that Van Cleef appeared in with Death Rides A Horse edging Day of Anger out as the best while For A Few Dollars More closely follows in third place. As far as I know no American western has gone into as much detail about the rules of being a gunfighter as Day of Anger. Indeed Day of Anger recalls both the Henry Fonda and Anthony Perkins relationship in Anthony Mann's The Tin Star 1958 and Brian Keith and Steve McQueen in Henry Hathaway's Nevada Smith 1966 where an old gun teaches a young gun the rules. Frank Talby Lee Van Cleef delineates the nine things that Scott Mary costar Giuliano Gemma of Fort Yuma Gold must learn to survive as a gunfighter. First never beg for anything from another man. Second never trust anybody. Third never come between a gun and its target. Fourth like bullets punches in a fistfight must be first if you want to finish the brawl. Fifth if you wound a man then you'd better finish him off otherwise he will try to kill you. Sixth you must aim your bullets well and always shoot them at the right time. Seventh take a man's gun away from him before you untie his wrists. At this point Scott Mary interjects a rule that he contrived on the spot Don't give a man any more bullets that what he needs. Eighth sometimes you will have to accept a challenge or lose everything. Ninth when you start killing you cannot stop it.Scenarists Renzo Jungle Holocaust Genta and Ernesto My Name Is Nobody Gastaldi along with director Tonino Valerii based their Day of Anger screenplay on a German novel by Ron Barker entitled Der Tod Ritt Dienstags. Valerii and company waste no time establishing the primary setting in the inhospitable frontier berg of Clifton Arizona and we meet an illegitimate fellow simply known as Scott Giuliano Gemma of The Master Touch who was raised in the local bordello and now serves as the community's garbage collector. Everybody looks down their collective noses at woebegone Scott. Scott's life is grim unrelenting drudgery until gunfighter Frank Talby Lee Van Cleef rides into Clifton and pays Scott a dollar to stable his horse. Later in the saloon after Talby has given Scott his dollar he invites the youth to have a drink. The outraged saloon owner refuses to serve Scott and another gunman challenges Talby. Talby guns him down and an inquest clears him of murder. The irate townspeople beat up Scott for testifying on Talby's behalf. Scott flees the town on his mule to track down Talby. He finds him in the border town of Bowie where Talby is demanding that Wild Jack Al Mulock of The Hellbenders pay him back the 50thousand that he owes him. Jack explains that he just got released from prison where he served a 10year sentence. Talby has no sympathy for Jack until he explains that the robbery that he staged was planned by the pillars of community in Clifton and that they sold him down the river. Eventually Talby has to shoot Jack and then he sets out to blackmail the pillars of Clifton to obtain his 50thousand. Scott helps Talby out of a scrape afterward by tossing him a gun after three bandits have dragged him through the sagebrush on his belly. Of course Talby wipes them out and Scott and he become thick as thieves. Only in the final quarter hour do Talby and Scott Mary have their first and final falling out over Talby's decision to gun down Scott's friend the elderly lawman. The shoot'em up finale reiterates the nine gunfighter rules. Riz Ortolani's jazzy energetic orchestral score is a welcome departure from the Ennio Morricone staple and Enzo Beyond the Law Serafin's widescreen cinematography captures the primitive quality of the west. At one point in the plot Talby burns down a saloon that he has halfownership in and kills his partner. The saloon that Talby orders built is probably the most distinctive saloon in the history of western movies both foreign and domestic. What stands out about the facade of the saloon is that huge handcarved and painted Colt's .45 sixguns serve as the facade uprights.Although this Lee Van Cleef  Giuliano Gemma western is serious from start to finish Day of Anger gets its best joke in early in the action but you have to be a Spaghetti western fan to appreciate it. Scott grabs his mule to ride after Talby. Scott Mary calls his mule 'Sartana' the name of an invincible gunslinger in Spaghetti westerns. Valerii and his scribes has fashioned an oldfashioned western that owes more to Hollywood than Europe. Essentially Day of Anger amounts to a morality play wherein the hero is rewarded for his virtue and the villains are penalized with death for their perfidy. Lee Van Cleef excels as Talby and Gemma is convincing as the green kid who grows up fast. Talby remains a static character while Scott changes over time from a nobody to a somebody something rare in Spaghettis. Nothing in Day of Anger is unrealistic. Valerii stages a great joustlike duel on horseback where the rivals must load black powder rifles with cap and ball while riding hellbent at each other and shoot to kill. The dialogue doesn't consist of snappy repartees and violence isn't glorified as it usually is in most Spaghettis.";

A rich and detailed world with good solid action sequences longpanning shots of gorgeous desert and an iconic soundtrack await. This film holds its own amongst some of the Sergio Leone and Corbucci classics like A Fistfull of Dollars and Django.Their are also multiple versions of the film available. My first viewing was the original English dub there is another one as well. I have not yet viewed the Italian dub yes both feature dubbing.

In a little time  Talbydevil demonster that any gun can play. And you can see the transformation of a quiet man but with gun in his heart in a furious man of revenge that finds a father in the old gunman. At the end Mary understand that the law of Talby wich is the law of west can't go on. So father and son meets theirself in a duel. Valerii's direction is good and there is no only the Leone lesson. Actors are in role and secondary charachters are discreet. Only Gemma is a problem for me but is not very miscast he have the face of a good boy unlucky that for an instant meets a change of fate.";

Don't ask me how that matchup was booked but I went with a couple of friends and thanks to the new release paired with it the place was nearly packed. Old school singleplex with 1000 or so seats. Everyone was hushed and into the story until Lee Van Cleef stomped into the scraggly bar in the scraggly village banged on the wooden plank serving as the bar and demanded Get me Wild Jack! For a moment the theater remained hushed. Then from a few rows behind us a guy yelled out WILD JACK! What kinda name is that? Suddenly taken by the overthetop melodrama the crowd turned the whole experience on its end and started howling at what now seemed to be a selfreferential satire on the spaghetti western genre. Of course I didn't think in such highfalutin' terminology at the time I just thought it was funny. With all due respect to serious aficianados of the genre it was just one fun night. One of the guys I went with suggested that we go back and repeat the astonished WILD JACK! comment the next night but we figured I think rightly that you had to be there it was a one shot thing with perfect timing that had us laughing too hard to take it seriously when poor Scott Mary finally had his day in the sun and finished off his mentor while reciting the final rule of the gunfighter.".

The storyline is packed full of adventure in which Bill saves the day but when Bill is hit by a truck and taken away from young Kathy Elizabeth Taylor Bill becomes an army dog in the second World War. I think this is the only Lassie film to have a female girl as the dog's primary master. There are also some happy parts of the movie showing the deep friendship that the young girl and collie share. This intertwined with Lassie saving sheep in a snow storm and becoming a war hero makes this a good film. It's not as good as 'Lassie Come Home' but it is still worth a watch if you enjoy films about dogs.".

I think this is the only Lassie film to have a female girl as the dog's primary master. There are also some happy parts of the movie showing the deep friendship that the young girl and collie share. This intertwined with Lassie saving sheep in a snow storm and becoming a war hero makes this a good film. It's not as good as 'Lassie Come Home' but it is still worth a watch if you enjoy films about dogs.";

Yes we should all know that Lassie was played by more than one dog its obvious that thats the way they make dog movies isn't it? that Lassie was a female all that geeky stuff I say whatever. I was not expecting anything from this movie and had it on in the background as I was surfing the web this morning and doing other tasks I ended up getting very focused on this film! It's just another testament that if it's a Lassie movie it's good entertainment. I wish I had watched this with my now teenage daughter while we had the opportunity I know it would have strengthened our relationship at least just a little. Work overseas and divorce tell me that wont happen any time soon if ever. If I ever get the chance no matter how old she is I'll try to see this at home with her. It has Liz Taylor and her pet's loving bond in Lassie which is very wholesome it also has a lot of adult overtones with war and such so it should keep any mature adult interested. In todays overly skeptical world I'm happy I have not fallen into the trap to not really enjoy a Lassie movie. 8 of 10.".

Obviously the filmmakers were still not sure how to use Lassie as a name so it's implied that the dog you love as Lassie is playing Bill but it's really Pal playing Lassie playing Bill and it gets even more complicated in the film.Since it is 1946 we'll just have to go along with Lassie being drafted but is this Lassie Come Home from World War II  is Lassie an unpatriotic deserter? Then the poor dog comes down with Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome becomes a killer and goes on trial. On the plus side Lassie is terrific as usual the dog tries to make a bad script hunt. Elizabeth Taylor and the film look very nice in color and Frank Morgan feels like a good substitute for Donald Crisp who was in the last Lassie film and will be in the next one  Courage of Lassie 72446 Fred M.

	schema:reviewBody "First there is no character in this film called Lassie! although Lassie may have been the mother of Bill sometimes called Duke who starts out as a puppy. Like the first 2 of this film series the collie whatever its name is gets lost for part of the film has a series of adventures and eventually finds its way home......Apparently most of the shoots were taken around Lake Chelan a long narrow former glacial valley with substantial mountains on either side located in north central Washington state.......This time 14y.o. Elizabeth Tayloras Kathie serves as Bill's nonmilitary master while Tom Drake as Stg. Smitty renames the dog as Duke and serves as his master while in the army. In training Duke to be a War Dog the screenplay is repeating the main plot of the previous film Son of Lassie. This time the dog's unit is assigned to the Aleutians to fight the Japanese......Some reviewers question the wisdom of the long20min initial section in which the future Bill is accidentally separated from his litter mates and spends months judging from his size progression as a wild dog in the forest not seeing any humans. We are treated to seeing various wild animals some of which Bill interacts with. This should be especially interesting to children but I found parts interesting too. No mention is made of how Bill manages to survive as such. Presumably he would be poor at chasing and killing substantial prey although he stole a fish from a bear! Also he would be subject to predation by carnivores such as cougars coyotes or wolves and maybe even hawks and large owls. Also when Kathie finds him wounded from a gunshot and picks him up she should have been wary that he might be a wild dog and bite her. When recovered she trains him to be a sheepdog. But one day he is run over by a truck. The driver takes him to a vet but makes little effort finding his owner. So after a couple months of rehabilitation it's decided to give him to the army and make a war dog out of him rechristening him as Duke. On duty one day he is assigned to carry a message from a patrol in trouble to another patrol traveling under heavy fire. He is hit and the message lost. He grows weaker and his legs are covered with mud making walking more difficult. He collapses as he reaches his goal. Strangely there seems to be no radio contact between the 2 patrols. Thus they ask the exhausted dog to guide them to the patrol in need of ammunition and more personnel. Slowly he makes his way. He is considered a hero for his extreme effort. However he then turns mean toward his handler and others. He's suffering from PTSDor shell shock. It's decided to send him back to Washington state for some RR. Serendipitously he manages to jump off the train exactly when it passes Lake Chelan! But he doesn't immediately find anyone who recognizes him. To survive he steals chickens from various people. When he is finally found by Kathie initially he's hostile. But there is a sudden change in him when she is knocked unconscious from a fall. He is now back to his old self. But the victims of his raids want him declared a public nuisance and put away. A trial is held and it looks bad for Bill. But Frank Morgan a friend of Kathie's notices a marking on one ear and someone identifies it as a war dog ID. Morgan calls up the nearby dog training center and asks for Bill's record finding that he is regarded as a war hero. This told to the judge he decides to suspend the expected death penalty and place him under the supervision of Kathie and Morgan. Note that it's not clear whether he still belongs to the army or whether they want him released. This is not discussed. By the way it would be nice for the owner whoever it might be to pay for the damage which was not denied.......Now suppose Bill were a man a homeless veteran with a good record who stole some chickens to keep from starving. Would he have received the same leniency? Should the past character of a person who has committed a crime be considered in sentencing? I think so.......This film is currently available in economical 3 and 4 packs of MGM Lassielike films.".

In this film he loses his mother gets shot gets run over gets sent to war and almost dies...and naturally ends up losing his mind. While the term was never used he obviously was suffering from PTSD...and the film was actually a metaphor for the millions of damaged soldiers coming home from Europe and Asia following WWII...which ended the year before.Fortunately the film is not just one series of torment after another for good 'ol BillLassie. When he's not suffering he's living with a lovely little girl Elizabeth Taylor and loves her dearly. But he gets lost and goes through the worst before he ultimately is reunited with her. The movie is enjoyable and the scenery AMAZING...having been filmed in the Pacific Northwest in beautiful color. And because it was a prestige project after all Lassie was a BIG star at MGM the studio used some of its best supporting actors Frank Morgan Harry Davenport and Tom Drake among others and it really is a lovely film. But some might tire of seeing the animal going through torment so it's not nearly the film as Lassie Come Home!Finally although I liked the movie I really would have loved a scene with Lassie lying on the couch being psychoanalyzed near the end of the story!".

The Courage of Lassie is a time capsule that reveals the decency of where we came from who we were who we truly are and who we still can be  because goodness is a root of us all. The Courage of Lassie also provides beautifullycrafted lessons in adaptation and the resiliency of both human and animal spirit.Everyone should be positively touched by this film and should be bettered by it. However it seems that those who lived at least part of their lives during the 1940's and 1950's will be especially emotionally struck by the realization of what has been lost what's been gained as well as by the automatically ensuing calculations of whether the gains were worth the losses.Every character in this film plays his or her parts naturally and flawlessly including Lassie. The changes in circumstances action and locales should rivet all viewers of the film to the film from beginning to end. The only iffy scene in this film is where Lassie was a target of countless enemy riflemen but never got hit  somewhat like Kevin Costner in Dances with Wolves. Other than that single stretchThe Courage of Lassie is a magnificent gift!The Courage of Lassie is Americana at its best!".

His mother's master rescues the mother and the rest of the litter but doesn't see Bill who then grows up in the wild. The wild which is populated by a trained bear and some other animals. After growing up to adulthood Bill is surprisingly nonferal and is discovered by a 14 yearold Elizabeth Taylor. Right after Taylor finds him Carl Alfalfa Switzer shoots him with bird shot. Taylor cares for him until he's well again with the help of Frank Morgan. Then Bill is hit by an Army truck the poor damn dog can't get a break. After he regains his strength again the Army guys take him to Japan or maybe Europe where they use him as I don't know a decoy to draw enemy fire. He finally gets back to America and finds his way back to Elizabeth Taylor but not before he kills some farm chickens. He's put on trial ! and gets the death penalty. Frank Morgan saves him after discovering he was an Army dog and understanding he has posttraumatic stress syndrome. Anyway this is obviously mindnumbingly stupid and it provides a few good laughs that way in its run. It's filmed in a pretty Technicolor. But it's not worth seeing obviously. As I suppose I watched this in honor of Taylor I should say a brief word about her. She's a sweet kid and like in National Velvet a pretty good actress already. The film is so silly though and she's not really in it that much that she can hardly save it.".

That the rest of the movie is rockygoing and her costar is no match for her is unfortunate but not fatal.Apparently the director Joshua Logan was able to create a relatively peaceful environment where Monroe could completely let go and allow her natural fragility and sex appeal to take over. When she's on screen it's impossible to take your eyes off her not just because she's beautiful what starlet from the 1950's WASN'T beautiful? but because she's laying bare her character's soul for the camera and in the process much of her own soul as well. She isn't just reading lines with various inflections or doing bits of business like so many actors do she's bringing the character to life.Unforgettable is the moment where she finds herself perched on the shoulder of the crazy lovestruck cowboy watching a parade and she's trying to pantomime to a friend in the crowd how she wound up up there. Or the way she keeps shushing the loudtalking bus driver so that he won't wake up the sleeping cowboy as she's planning her escape. Or the way she can't make eye contact or get her lazy backwoods accent that is incredibly charming to sound firm enough when she keeps trying to tell the cowboy to get lost. Her comic timing is just sublime and unteachable. Don Murray's performance as the cowboy criminally and inexplicably Oscarnominated is cloying twodimensional and geared for the stage not the intimacy of film. He needs to provide some hint of vulnerabilty before he's humbled in the fist fight with the bus driver but he is tragically not up to the task. His Beauregard is the kind of loudmouthed uncouth buffoon that only a greatly skilled comic actor can make sympathetic and Murray simply doesn't know how to finesse the comic moments and make them work.Monroe receives fine support from Arthur O'Connell as Beau's older wiser friend Virgil Blessing but this is her show all the way. She makes it a good movie but one can't help imagining how much better it could have been had it been directed by someone like Kazan and costarred possibly Rock Hudson.".

	schema:headline " In Praise of Don Murray";
	schema:reviewBody "While I'm in agreement with the consensus view on Bus Stop that it is one of the better films with Marilyn Monroe and I like Monroe as much as the next classic film fan or as much as the next guy with overactive hormones I've noticed a relative downplaying of Don Murray's work in the filmoften critics outright dismiss him characterizing Bus Stop as a film that works despite Murray's character and performance. I couldn't disagree with that more strongly. Not to detract from Monroe but what really pushed Bus Stop over the top for me in terms of qualityin addition to the fine allegorical storywas the hilariously overthetop performance of Murray and the sheer absurdity of his character.But maybe my different view on this and why I love the film so much is because I'm a huge fan of absurdism. Bus Stop is the tale of Beauregard Bo Decker Murray and Virgil Blessing Arthur O'Connell. They're headed from their ranch in Montana to Phoenix Arizona to participate in a rodeo. Bo is quite skilled at ridin' and rustlin' so Virgil is taking him off of the farm for one of the only times in his life to give the rodeo a shot and more importantly to get him a bit more worldly experience especially with women. Bo's experience with the fairer sex had been pretty much limited to pictures in magazines. Virgil seems to just want Bo to lose a bit of his innocence but Bo has in his mind that he's going to find an angel and take possession of her. Because he's only been on a ranch that's the only way he knows how to relate to anything. He figures once he finds an angel he'll just rope her up like a calf and take her home. As we see from the beginning of the film Bo has a tendency to be brash and yell at everyone like he's hollerin' instructions across the range at his partner before they lose control of their cattle.Enter Monroe as showgirl Cherie. She's a hillbilly heck we learn that she even almost married her cousin from Arkansas whose made it as far as Arizona where she's playing a dive girlie club in Phoenix trying to earn enough money and gumption to one day make it to L.A. Once Bo sees her he decides she's his angel. Needless to say that doesn't go over so well.The bulk of the film consists of Bo trying to ride everything in the world like a bucking bronco while others including Cherie try to figure out what's wrong with him. For me this material was gutbustingly funny. I had to hit pause on the DVD player a number of times because I was laughing so hard.This is not to say that Monroe doesn't turn in a great nuanced performanceshe does despite the reported difficulties filming her. According to scriptwriter George Axelrod she would repeatedly break out in tears become extremely frustrated forget her lines yell profanities and director Joshua Logan couldn't call cut during her scenes or she'd take it as a personal affront so Logan would let 900 feet of film just run out while he talked to her coaxing a performance out of her. And it's not to say that Monroe and Murray do not have chemistry togetherthey do if they hadn't the film wouldn't have worked.But without Murray's bizarre but funny character which he plays to a tee I'm not sure I would have thought Bus Stop was a 10. In fact there was one section where I felt that score might be in jeopardyduring the latter part of the relatively quiet climax set in Grace's DinerBus Stop when Murray tones down a bit. The film is still good at that pointstill definitely a 9 but I found myself slightly missing the hyperactive comedy of the earlier scenes.The story for Bus Stop was originally a oneact play by William Inge called People in the Wind. Inge later adapted People in the Wind for a larger scale production on Broadway now retitled Bus Stop. It opened at the Music Box Theater in New York City on March 2 1955 and ran for 478 performances. It was quickly adapted for film by Axelrod who changed the play quite a bit including dropping major characters.The cinematography in the film is lush and evidences that we're still in the early days of the anamorphic widescreen process known as Cinemascope. Logan makes use of some broad landscapes and wide shots of the rodeo crowd and such but the best uses of widescreen in the film are subtler. Probably the best shot arrives in that quiet section mentioned above when Cherie has her head on Grace's bar her torso stretched horizontally. Bo ends up putting his head on top of hers aligning his body similarly and together they fill the screen naturally conforming to the aspect ratio. Logan's direction is great throughout both for camera work and his actor's performances.As for Monroe perhaps reflecting barely offscreen problems at the time she easily paints a complex almost tortured soul. Her performance underscores one of the main subtexts of the filmloneliness accompanied by a kind of melancholy hope. Every character who has more than a couple lines is experiencing this in some wayeven Bo who is covering it up with his boisterousness. Logan and Axelrod also emphasize ironiesone beautiful instance is when Bo announces Cherie as his angel while she's singing That Old Black Magic in a very suggestive costume. And there are nice unrealized by the characters parallels in their questsin their loneliness and hope they're really all looking for their own angels often not recognizing when they're right in front of them.".

	schema:headline " Dumb Story  Murray's Stupid Role Overshadows Marilyn";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw a tribute to Marilyn Monroe and it was mentioned that Marilyn called Bus Stop her favorite film in which she acted. She thought she did her best work in that film and it legitimized her as a serious actress. This was one of the few films of hers I had never seen so I was very anxious now to see this especially on widescreen. Well it was disappointing not because of Marilyn  she was fine  but the story was incredibly stupid.Part of the problem might be the way our society has changed although I doubt even 50 years ago  when this film came out  a guy could do what Bo Decker Don Murray did in here and get away with it. Nonetheless to watch this brainless idiot  in a crowded nightclub  chase a woman down rip off half of her dress break into her dressing room follow her out the window to a bus station lasso her and kidnap her by dragging her onto the bus.....and have NOBODY even attempt to stop him during all of this and more is a real insult to any viewer's intelligence. No police? No security? No harassment et al? The story like Murray's character who has fewer brains than the rodeo animals he's battling is just plain dumb. Monroe Cheri and friend Eileen Heckart Vera are fine as is the other main character Virgil Arthur O'Connell but Murray is so loud abrasive and stupid that he ruins the movie. He  not Monroe  dominates the film unfortunately.Thankfully Monroe is.....well Monroe so all is not lost watching this movie but this screenplay is so dated and so moronic you'll cringe watching the film.".

Marilyn Monroe plays the same type of character that she more or less played for her entire career but she does it very well she and Hope Lange provide the only good performances. Don Murray's unsophisticated cowboy was so obnoxious he practically ruined any enjoyment to be had from the movie. The supporting players are decent but that's all.

She is absolutely superb here ditching the breathless dumb blonde of earlier roles and playing a hardened Southern chanteuse in search of true love. She manages to convey a whole range of emotions which is testament to her time spent at Lee Strasberg's Actor's Studio in New York. As usual she sparkles and it's difficult to take your eyes off her but there is a depth and sympathy to her playing that makes you take note of the performance and not simply the curves.However Bus Stop is a relatively simple picture of unrequited then requited love. The comedy moments don't often work that well and Don Murray's Beau has to be one of the most irritating characters I have ever seen in a film. Him and Cherie coming together at the end of the picture is unbelievable and spoiled the movie for me...I always wanted her to get away!Bus Stop is more enjoyable from the Monroe point of view as her playing is spellbinding and marked a turning point in her career.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bus Stop is named for the setting of the last halfhour of this film the bus stop in the snow somewhere in Wyoming where Beau finally gets his 'comeuppance' right before he and Cherie reconcile.  If this movie had not been made in 1956 but instead in modern times it would have received a very laughable reception. As it is I consider it a cult classic in the genre of The Rocky Horror Picture Show so horrible and fake are the characters and the dialog. However Marilyn Monroe in her 26th film playing a simple showgirl from Arkansas does very well with her role. Don Murray as Beau in his very first film is so obnoxious that by the time he apologises for his bad behavior we no longer care about him and Cherie's accepting him just doesn't make sense. Hope Lange has a small part as Elma on the bus in this her first film. She and Murray married afterward in real life but it didn't last. Murray made a number of other films including the father in Quarterback Princess in 1983 with Helen Hunt.The reason to see this film is Marilyn Monroe in her prime almost 30 and only 6 years from her death. The story of the possessive cowboy who decides to marry Cherie and haul her away to his ranch in Montana is pretty simple and pretty implausible. The scene in the bus stop where he finally kisses her for serious was also featured in an episode of Northern Exposure with Chris playing Beau and Maggie playing Cherie for a community theater production they were rehearsing for.".

	schema:headline " Ooooo really bad";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this yesterday and I'm still in shock. Monroe began to ripen as a dramatic actress just mere days it seems before she died. For sheer hilarity and dramatic weight she never surpassed her role in Some like it hot. For dramatic power she was very impressive and powerful in The Misfits. This film earlier in her career has been hailed as an early dramatic performance.I am not familiar with the play from whence this film came from. I just watched it and took it for what it appeared. I found Don Murray's characterization of the cowboy to be a negative distraction largely because instead of a real person he came across as a living comicbook character. There was not a moment when he was on the screen except for his quiet moments of remorse at the end when he was not sounding like a lunatic. Other commentators have noted that this over the top performance was supposed to be this way deliberately to be funny. Well in my time at the end of 2006 this type of behavior looks stupid ridiculous and unbelievable. Further Murray spends almost every second in the film shouting at the top of his lungs as if this is the way most cowboys fresh off the farm act when hitting the big city for the first time. Ahhhhh no I don't think so. The director Logan must have encouraged him to act this way and for me it makes him look like an imbecile. Honestly his acting just made me so uncomfortable from the beginning to the end I wish I could have stopped the film.Then we have Monroe. She looked as she always does beautiful. But I did notice that she kept changing the inflection of her voice as if not quite yet sure of how to morph from a blondebombshelldimwit into a real person a dramatic presence. She just comes in and out of the place and it strikes me now as quite a fascinating moment in her career almost at the cusp of breaking out into better acting. Her attempts at an accent come and go and if we were not so distracted by what she looked like we'd take closer note of it. Her skin looked so white next to the cowboy that she almost looked sickly. The best moments were when she was staring into a mirror very well set up shot and the doubts and fears that crossed her face felt every bit as real as one could imagine.All in all I was shocked at how bad the film looked given the age in which we live. The cartoonish characterization that Murray gives just looks ridiculous and hence hard to relate to. I just could not imagine any cowboy acting like a wild baboon on steroids. Sorry but this just made me cringe. You compare a great dramatic effort like The Misfits and the contrast makes everything clear. If Joshua Logan wanted to make a drama here then he destroyed it with the creation of a character right out of the comic Bizarro. This film just does not age well.".

In this day and age the shenanigans pulled by Don Murray's character would land him in jail practically before the opening credits finished up. With that said the first thing one must accept before seeing this film is that it's a film from almost 50 years ago and things were different then.Still though it's hard for me to imagine audiences even back in 1956 thinking that Don's character Bo the chauvinistic cowboy was humorous. As Cherry or Sherri or ShareREE Marilyn's character is humiliated kidnapped mistreated and whatever else by Bo. It is played for laughs but unlike the John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara films that employed this routine nothing here clicks. Bo is an extremely unlikable character right up to the Hollywood ending which didn't help the believability film any either. Marilyn is fine but can only go so far in trying to save the film. The few moments she's given to show her comedy skills are overshadowed by Don's irritations. The single funniest line of the film is given by the bus driver in the snow but by then this film's pretty much a lost cause. I gave this film a 5. That's one point for the scene in the snow near the end two points for Marilyn one point for some wellexecuted rodeo scenes and one point for the DVD extras.".

Monroe went to the Actors Studio for a year to study and then made this film. Why? Her character is one of the weakest most shallow women ever portrayed on film. This role was even more antifeminist than the gold digging bimbos that Marilyn played in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How To Marry A Millionaire. At least those women were smart.I wonder if Marilyn made this film for a contractual obligation or she actually chose the role. I do admit that she gave a good performance and it helped to prove she was a real actress. However her accent came and went and was a bit overdone. I think a much better example of Marilyn in a serious role is the film Niagra with Joseph Cotten. Coincidentally the screenplay for Bus Stop was written by George Axelrod who also wrote The Seven Year Itch in my opinion another extremely overrated film.I can't finish this without saying how much I hated Don Murray's character. From the moment he first appeared on screen I wished someone would shoot him in the head. Bo has to be one of the stupidest most irritating characters of all time. The story was weak and I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of the players. About the only good thing I can say about this film is that Hope Lange was cute.Don't stand in any lines for this Bus!".

The character Bo is supposed to be roguishly nave and charming I guess but he is far from it. He is a plain criminal severely lacking in manners so bad that he doesn't know how to behave inside the limits of the law. Sure times have changed but kidnapping was illegal then as it is now.The movies story is having two major faults the first being completely predictable. The end and entire development is evident from the first moment Bo and Cherie meets. She will detest him to the end when she suddenly and without any real reason just start loving him and go off to marry. But is shouldn't go that far because as Bo acts in broad daylight in front of people and security guards no less he should be in jail several times over and for a long time. That he isn't is completely implausible.Can't say the movie got a happy ending. Bo is such an unsympathetic character that having things going his way is like Lex Luthor winning over Superman. That is all the time I wished for Bo to be beat. And even if my opinion is partly based on the character I can't really believe that Don Murray was nominated for an Oscar.Don Murray is making his screen debut along with Hope Lang and starring alongside Monroe perhaps the only reason to really watch this.410".

The quality of the cinematography particularly in the outdoor shots is stunning and is a reminder of the unexcelled quality of the late lamented expensive Technicolor process. Throw in the vista of Cinemascope and we have a first rate example of what Hollywood at its height could produce. The second reason is Arthur O'Connell's performance as Virgil which exemplifies what a fine supporting actor he was. We are put in remembrance of all his wonderful roles in other movies. The bad news is the story and the acting. This is reputed to be perhaps Marilyn Monroe's finest performance and it is certainly the best work I have seen from her. Still she is no Kate Hepburn. And they might have eased off on whatever they painted on her to give her that unearthly pale quality. And then take Don Murray. Please. His cringingly overthetop performance as Beau can I suppose be partly attributed to the script but some attempt on his part to tamp down the outlandishly aggressive naivete of the character would have been appreciated. This role reminds us why he never attained top stardom. Lastly there is the story which has not an iota of credibility. This truly stupid and unbelievable tale of unrequited love defies belief throughout and the completely phony resolution in the last 10 minutes is on a par with the unbelievability of the rest of the movie.".

Cherie is seemingly equally stupid. I just find the whole film disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. I'm lead to believe that it is a comedy but I didn't laugh once. It's not simply because of the age of the movie that I don't find it amusing. I love Laurel and Hardy movies old Bilco shows even I Love Lucy... but where is the humour in this film.It is the first Marilyn Monroe film I've watched and I was staggered by her acting skills. Yes I know the style of acting has changed over the years but it just seems like a poor performance. She looks awful... was she constantly powdered with talc during the filming? she is so white! I know this is fiction and of course it's not a documentary of everyday life in 1956 but surely even back then someone had acted like Bo... he would've been arrested or repeatedly punched in the face by passing strangers.This is probably the worst film I've seen in a long time. How anyone can rate this film over three stars is beyond me.Anyway watch it for yourself you may have to scoop out most of your brain with a spoon or have very low expectations but you may enjoy it.".

After all the film is almost 60 years old. The culture has changed a lot. The boorish but likable hooligan is not exactly in vogue these days. Did I say likable. There's nothing likable about this cowboy. Its just too unbelievable even for 1957. In my opinion the sweet last scene in this movie is not enough to save the painful 95 of the time taken up but the unbelievable over the top acting  lousy screen play.

	schema:reviewBody "'Bus Stop' is a cheerful and romantic oldstyle film with part of the action centering around a bus stop and bus journey. Bo a notverybright cowboy does not know anything about love but has his heart set on bringing a woman back home with him. He sees Cherie played by Monroe at a bar and falls instantly in love but she does not quite feel the same way about him. The film explores this romance and the lessons that Bo and Cherie has to learn in order to 'grow up'. It takes him several mistakes and character flaws to overcome but with the help of Marilyn Monroe everything comes to a happy and quick ending like most 1950s films.Overall 'Bus Stop' is an engaging and funny film and it is worth a watch. However there are some problems. One of the problems is that I found Bo to be extremely annoying in places. He is too 'in your face' I am not sure whether Bo's innocence was overplayed by the actor or if it was written in the script. The other problem I had was the ending. Older films typically have a rushed ending at least when compared to the present day. It just seems to abrupt.The film also has some amuzing adult humor and this is subtle so there is not a chance of a child picking up on it. Look at the float in the parade! Overall 'Bus Stop' is an allaround enjoyable tale about an age past.".

I approached this film from a different angle attracted by the apparent similarity in source material to the 1943 'The Lady Takes a Chance' a busrodeoset romantic comedy starring John Wayne of all people which to my surprise I had very much enjoyed.In this case I was disappointed.The first ten minutes of the film is pretty fair comedy material the last thirty finally introduces some muchneeded emotional subtlety and character development. The intervening hour constitutes a onejoke wonder  boorish cowboy ropes and carries off woman  that rapidly shades from monotonous to actively annoying.Frankly this is the type of film calculated to elicit comments of I'm not a feminist but    By the time it got to the showdown in the cafe I was almost convinced from the preceding plotline that young Beau would whip his aging opponent with the brutal strength of youth then ride off with a suddenly heroworshipping bride. The fact that events much to my surprise and relief don't turn out that way is not sufficient to justify the tedium of what has gone before. As others have remarked it is only from this moment that the characters gain any emotional depth  with the possible exception of Monroe's brittle damaged Cherie.  I'll grant though that the final denouement does however manage to be both touching and convincing which is an achievement under the circumstances.Personally I'd say that the entire centre section of 'Bus Stop' is a waste of time. I suspect that a perfectly good film and one more appropriate to the title! could have been constructed by omitting all the scenes save those taking place in the bus or 'bus stop' itself and substituting a brief account of intervening events via dialogue.The most charitable view I can take of this film is that too long is spent in settingup for its few worthwhile scenes. The sexual politics shown have nothing to do with the film's era  again see 'The Lady Takes a Chance' for a superior contemporary take on the clashofthesexes theme  and far more to do with unfunny slapstick humour. And sadly I can't really say I found Marilyn Monroe as seductive as the screenplay clearly assumes.An interesting piece for Monroe fans but lacklustre entertainment.".

I love Marilyn Monroe she's my hero but this was NOT her role.  She plays this mountain hick slut but she can't maintain the accent.  Even if she could that's not the kind of thing I want to hear coming out of her mouth.  Her voice is one of my favourite things about her so naturally I couldn't look at her the same.  And someone had the idea to put this clown white stuff all over the entirety of her exposed body which was pretty cool until she was sitting side by side with a normally complected person.  Too strange.  While it pained me to watch and listen to her deliberately horrid performance of the Black Magic song it took talent to do it that frightfully.  I gained a great deal of respect for her after that scene.The plot makes you want to kick whoever wrote it.  I hated Bo's character. Hearing him yell 'CHERRY!!!  CHERRY!!!' makes me cringe.  I hated the ending.  Good things?  It has a few undeniably pleasant moments that one line from Bo in the end made me cry and ooze!!! but otherwise I am of the belief that it should not have been made.".

Monroe was embarrassingly bad and Murray's character would be punched or shot if he acted that way in public whether in 1956 or 2014 so it was totally unbelievable. Overacting would be a nice comment on this cast. Just horrible.I really felt that I wasted two hours of my life watching this. I think people may be reviewing this movie from memory and not rewatching it to see how bad it actually is.".

Beyond the issue of Akhtar Leylomah is most concerned with how to feed her baby. She cannot provide milk for her baby as her own hunger is preventing her from lactating. Nogreh however aspires toward a life in a western styled democracy. Although the Taliban are no longer in power in Afghanistan traditional forces are still active in the country. Nogreh often displays signs of rebellion such as wearing a pair of white pumps instead of the traditional slipper beneath her burqa. But mostly Nogreh wants to be educated. Without her father's knowledge Nogreh is attending a secular girls school. Ultimately she wants to become President of Afghanistan. With the help of a Pakistani refugee who likes her as a woman Nogreh tries to understand exactly what forces led to current world leaders being elected those forces which she wants to emulate.";

The story of Noqreh who dreams of becoming president while hiding her school attendance from her conservative father is very intense. Togehter with the sisterinlaw and her sick child Noqreh and her father are looking for a place to live in the ruins they briefly stay in a crashed airplane and the bombed parliament building before leaving the city for a more traditional country side... The camera observes taking its time to capture the essence of the moments and the characters including a staged debate between the two presidential candidates in the girl school. While the women start discovering some freedom sunumbrellas dressing shoes the men are struggling with keeping their faith in the new realities and everybody including truck loads of returning refugees from Pakistan  is only trying to survive. At the moment when a few helicopters flying over the head of the traveling family and they look up I realized how deeply drawn I was into the movie and its very sad reality  so out of place seemed this modern technological machine compared to the muledrawn carriage in a harsh landscape. Highly recommended if you like Rohmer Tarkowski or Mambety  9 out of 10 stars!".

On the one hand she attends a school where the teacher encourages girls to become doctors engineers and even President. At the same time Nogreh must wait until she steps out of her father's home before she lifts the veil of her burka and trades flatsoled shoes for high heels.Nogreh is a very idealistic and ambitious young woman who emulates Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan and dreams of being President of her own country some day. Yet she has been kept in a state of childlike naivety and ignorance about politics at home and abroad due to the teachings of the Koran Shariah Islamic law and the Taliban.It is exciting to hear the young girls debate the status of women in their country. But the film is also sympathetic and understanding toward the old Afghanistan symbolized by Nogreh's father. He bewails that Blasphemy has overrun the city and the world as he knew it has ceased to exist. To add pathos to the situation he feels he can confide his feelings only to a dumb animal  his donkey who knows nothing but hay.The film's title echoes a recurring verse from Federico Garcia Lorca's poem Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejia about the goring of a bullfighter. Like Lorca's poem At Five in the Afternoon is clouded over by a somber atmosphere of tragedy death and despair. Yet the film remains remarkable for its astonishingly hopeful  and indeed radical and revolutionary  vision of hope for Afghanistan and indeed all of the Arab world.".

It is easy bullshitting arrogantly about this film while sitting in the airconditioned cinema eating pop corns and feeling sleepy. Samira Makhmalbaf went to Afganistan after the Taliban regime was toppled and decided not to stay a silent observer of a hard life she faced with. Together with her famous father Mohsen Makmalbaf wrote over 30 scenarios and directed about 20 films she developed the script and was determined to film it in Afghanistan. It was difficult to find the actors especially a native woman who would interpret the main character who shows her face as the country lacks professional actors. Keeping all this in mind it all ended pretty well with nonprofessionals. I am not telling that this film is a masterpiece but it has its value and deserves respect. This is a tale of a young woman who despite his father's religious fanaticism and prohibition that she goes to school insists to get educated to become the president of the republic. She goes to school without her father's knowledge putting on the white high heels and uncovering her face. The shoes actually pretty ugly and unsuitable for walking through the ruins have strong symbolic meaning of her rebelled femininity. Ms. Makhmalbaf follows her heroine and hers family through the hard times of loosing illusions about the possibility not only for social advancement but simple survival. I knew this strange country only by bad news on TV. This film served as a window on its other hidden side  the ordinary people's life struggle  and that's its most admiring part.".

Even from the start there are subtle hints that this is just a delusion and as the movie progresses this becomes more and more obvious.

The human soul can survive the most unheard of cruelties and repression yet still have the capability to hope and dream even the biggest dreams. Under the most incredible circumstances the most unexpected people rise up to be heroes. This young girl who has recently regained her voice yet is still afraid to use her new found freedom is our hero. She daydreams of becoming president of war torn Afghanistan the only vision of power that she can imagine that could truly change her current situation. We catch a glimpse of her spirit while witnessing her hardships. In the end we are left with hope hope that when her young voice does eventually speak out it speaks loud and clear for all to hear sounding a message that transcends borders nationality and religion. The true epitome of the phoenix rising from the ashes. Hats off to the simple tale of the complex truth.".

The director does get amazing performances from the nonacting cast but occasionally the lack of experience does tell and you sense their just repeating what they've been told to say without really knowing why. It also felt a bit too long and would have been better without some scenes which were too similar to others. Not as good a film as 'The Apple' but worth seeing as there are some nice moments and it still manages to have a sense of humour despite the obvious terrible hardship these people have endured. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Nogreh Agheleh Rezaie is a young woman living in a postTaliban Afghanistan. She ultimately seeks to be educated and finds solace in a girl school promoting new ideals and attitudes to women. Even though the Taliban have been defeated in the country old ways are still present and burqa's are still preferred. She lives with her Conservative father and her sisterinlaw Leylomah who is searching for her missing husband who has not returned from war. Also Leylomah has a baby who she is struggling to feed after her milk dries up. Amongst these struggles Nogreh is running for class president and uses a Pakistani refugee to help with her ultimate goal which is to become President of Afghanistan.The title comes from Federico Garcia Lorca's poem Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias which tells the story of a famous bullfighter tragically coming to an end in the ring. It is repeated several times by the Pakistani character named 'Poet' Razi Mohebi. Mejias was a real and popular figure in Spain who returned to bullfighting after a long spell out only to be killed. The character of Nogreh has high hopes after Afghanistan is rejuvinated only to be disappointed by a country set in its ways. Although it is clearly an improvement attitudes to women are still the same and are seen as the inferior sex. This is most evident in the scene where she poses for photographs which she plans to use in her class president campaign only to have the photographer laugh in her face upon discovering she wants to eventually run for President of the country. While Lorca's poem is tragic and romantic At Five in the Afternoon is observant and naturalistic.It would be easy given the recent history of Afghanistan to weave a tale of despair and woe but director Samira Makhmalbaf tells a story that is full of hope. This hope comes from the character of Nogreh who is brilliantly portrayed by Rezaie. Although she is ultimately looked down upon and is scared of her father finding out about her radical attitudes she is determined and represents Makhmalbaf's hope of a new generation of women that will rise up and compete against the men who have dominated the country for years and have ultimately led to the deaths of thousands of its inhabitants and many wars. The underlying messages aren't rubbed in your face they are instead laid out in real situations. The film won Jury Prize at Cannes and is a shining light in what will hopefully become a New Wave in Middle Eastern filmmaking  God knows they have stories to tell.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

This is the good part of the movie it tries to tell us something.The bad part is its style. It has a documentary approach which works at first but drags on so long and so slow that it turns tedious. There is never any background music and conversation mainly only in the beginning of the movie. It is good to sleep while you're watching this movie because you'll wake up and see that almost nothing has happened so you can safely eat some popcorn and continue sleeping.If there had been an improved script to this movie which dared to throw some serious blame along with some serious and thoughprovoking theme music this movie would have been magical and revolutionary.

	schema:reviewBody "About Adam received new life after Kate Hudson became almost famous. But while Hudson plays a key role this film is quite literally about Adam as played wonderfully by Stuart Townsend. The film begins with young Irish singing waitress Lucy as played by Hudson with an Irish accent that comes and goes meeting the mysterious Adam. She immediately falls for him and their new romance proceeds happily along. Lucy brings Adam home to meet the family and here things get turned on their head. After seeing the story play out from Lucy's perspective we go back and revisit the same time period from different points of view those of Lucy's two sisters and brother. It soon becomes apparent that Adam is not quite what he seems and that he has become much closer to Lucy's family than she would ever believe.Frances O'Connor as the quiet bookish Laura and Charlotte Bradley as the unhappily married Alice will each strike up their own serious relationship with Adam. As we see each of the sisters' stories unfold it puts a new spin on all that we have seen before. Even Lucy's brother finds himself oddly attracted to Adam while Lucy floats along completely oblivious to all that is swirling around her. Each of the key roles is performed well and enough time is given to allow us to explore the motivations of each of these characters. If we didn't really get to know these people and what drives them everyone involved could come off rather badly especially Townsend's Adam. But the director makes each character sympathetic enough and it all ties together very well.A clever script mostly terrific acting intriguing characters wonderful Irish scenery and a very smart plot device that adds a unique twist to everything...About Adam has a lot going for it. It's a smart funny enjoyable ride.".

It soon becomes apparent that Adam is not quite what he seems and that he has become much closer to Lucy's family than she would ever believe.Frances O'Connor as the quiet bookish Laura and Charlotte Bradley as the unhappily married Alice will each strike up their own serious relationship with Adam. As we see each of the sisters' stories unfold it puts a new spin on all that we have seen before. Even Lucy's brother finds himself oddly attracted to Adam while Lucy floats along completely oblivious to all that is swirling around her. Each of the key roles is performed well and enough time is given to allow us to explore the motivations of each of these characters. If we didn't really get to know these people and what drives them everyone involved could come off rather badly especially Townsend's Adam. But the director makes each character sympathetic enough and it all ties together very well.A clever script mostly terrific acting intriguing characters wonderful Irish scenery and a very smart plot device that adds a unique twist to everything...About Adam has a lot going for it. It's a smart funny enjoyable ride.";

Indeed there is so little specifically Irish about this film that with a change of accent it could easily be relocated to London New York or Los Angeles.The film is told in a number of episodes each seen from the point of view of a different character. The central character Adam is a handsome charming young man who is engaged to a waitress named Lucy but nevertheless seduces not only Lucy herself but also her two sisters Laura and Alice and her brother's girlfriend Karen and comes close to seducing the brother himself.A plot like this could easily be the stuff of tragedy but here it is treated strictly as a comedy. Unfortunately it veers between two different comic genres the romantic comedy and the sex comedy with any humour there might be getting lost somewhere between the two. On the one hand Adam is a promiscuous womaniser on the other he is the romantic gallant who wins Lucy's hand. The director and scriptwriter try to get round this contradiction by presenting Adam's behaviour not as exploitative but rather as liberating for the women concerned. The bookish academic Laura the unhappily married Alice and the prim virginal Karen are all shown as benefiting from their sexual experiences nobody gets hurt and all ends happily with a big white wedding.For all its modern urban setting this film is about as realistic as one of Grimm's fairy tales. It is set in a fantasy world where everyone is goodlooking where jealousy does not exist where sex especially promiscuous sex is an unqualified force for good where a man can bed every woman he meets and still end up marrying the girl of his dreams and where a woman's surest way to find happiness is to get laid preferably by Adam. And leprechauns exist and there really is a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow. If you like urban legends about knights on white chargers or pale blue Etypes bringing sexual happiness to womankind you will love this film. I am afraid it did nothing for me. 410.".

	schema:reviewBody "'About Adam' is a male counterpart to Gerry Stembridge's classic TV drama 'the Truth about Clare' his innovative film about Ireland and abortion.  In that film three characters tried to grope through memories prejudices egotism blindness etc. the truth about the title character a pregnant woman who died following an abortion in England it is still illegal in Ireland here four characters try to capture the essence of the elusive Adam a jack of all relationships but mastered by none. A knowledge of Stembridge's previous more sober film gives this breezy comedy a darker edge  its tale of a family being given everything they sexually desire is an appropriate metaphor for a society like Ireland currently going through an unheardof economic boom creating a culture of extreme selfinterest.  The dangers of this selfinterest are plain to see  a few weeks ago another Stembridge TV satire was aired about Ireland's racist treatment of refugees.  We have never had this much prosperity before and we don't want anyone else sharing it.  Similarly the last person this film is 'about' is Adam.  Like 'Clare' the film is structured around the personal narratives of each character involved with Adam  Lucy Kate Hudson and I'm afraid the hype for once is spoton  she IS adorable the spontaneous singing waitress with a new boyfriend every week who finally settles down to a 'great passion' Laura Frances O'Conner  can there be any doubt now that she is our finest actress? the pretentious uptight English postgrad doing a thesis on repressed Victorian women writers who is 'loosened up' by Adam her assumptions revealed to be a lie David the brother dating a prim virgin enlisting Adam's help and finding himself sexually attracted to him Alice the elder sister trapped in a prosperous marriage to a pompous dullard intrigued by Adam but unwilling to lose control like her siblings that easy.  Each narrative is tailored to each witness' personality like 'Dracula' an ironic allusion throughout in the way each story is shaped in the stylistic devices employed in tone but most importantly in the perception of Adam.  'Clare' for all its excellence played to that ageold myth the mystery inscrutability unattainability unknowability of woman. 'Adam' the first man remorselessly documented throughout thousands of years of masculine culture is suddenly the mystery the woman the sphinx the passive black hole.  Adam which may not even be his name is the blank onto which the various characters project their fantasies  he is literally what they want him to be.  Naturally plot points overlap within the four stories and our interpretation of them changes with greater knowledge but paradoxically our knowledge of Adam diminishes helped by the lies and stories he spins about himself.  Who is Adam?  Besides the obvious pleasure of bedding three beautiful women why does he do it?  In fact forget that 'besides' that's probably your answer.  As well as alluding to his own work Stembridge cleverly remodels two other classics of sexual amorphousness.  Like Terence Stamp in Pasolini's 'Theorem' Adam is a stranger who enters a bourgeois household where everyone has a stereotypical role they adhere to and which Adam smashes forcing them to review their lives and the assumptions they live by.  This has a liberating effect but also a joyful one  this is a remarkably angstfree film.  With his blank good looks his white suit and bleached blonde crop Stuart Townsend hi Celia! is a ringer for the young Stamp. The other allusion is to 'Alfie' that freewheelingly amoral sexual cad lying his way through a score of beautiful women.  Except Adam is the antiAlfie he does not humiliate or diminish women they're the ones who develop and he lacks the controlling power of narration but he does limit them reducing them to 'mere' sexual urge.Significantly both these films were key artefacts of the 1960s and there is an optimism a freshness a vigour a lightness to 'About Adam' that resembles the swinging 60s as if Ireland belatedly has entered its own hedonistic decade.  Both films equally significantly were warnings or analyses of that decade's fatal complacency and in the exhilerating shots of Dublin that dot the film we cannot fail to notice the looming cranes the building activity that suggests this story isn't quite finished this culture hasn't quite reached maturity.".

'About Adam' for a thankful change shows Ireland how it really is  modern stylish and prosperous. The people in the film aren't weeping throughout the entire film because their potato patch is unproductive they are just like ordinary modern Irish people  well we don't all go shging our fiance's entire family  but other than that it's real. The film is very witty and entertaining if only a little slow at some parts. Kate Hudson has a surprisingly good Irish accent and Stuart Townsend is a wellcast star with a bright film throughout the film industry here and abroad. 'About Adam' is a very positive and encouraging leap forward for the Irish film industry and is an example of how more Irish films should be made in the future  we're sick of dwelling in the past  it's the positive present and bright future people want to see. 'About Adam' bears more of a resemblance to 'American Pie' and 'Road Trip' than to 'The Field' and other such films. All in all a good show. I encourage all European American Australian etc to see this film  not just because I'm Irish but because it is a genuinely enjoyable funny movie.".

Actually I'm a heterosexual female who enjoys ORIGINAL romantic comedy but I also have half a brain and expect some degree of intelligence from films.The Laura character summed this film up pretty thoroughly for me. She is an English actor meaning that two of the main characters including of course THE main female lead were not Irish. I can't be bothered repeating why this is extremely sad  it's been said so many times  but the marketing machine behind most movies will not change it's mind about shoving Americans or Brits into the leads in foreign films no matter how much people complain. They want the bucks you know and a famous names DOES mean more bums on seats. Sad but true.I found this film uninspired. There were perhaps 2 or 3 genuinely amusing and surprising lines. The characters were pretty much laughable in a bad way. Adam's justification for his machiavellian behaviour I found ridiculous and unconvincing. This guy is not altruistic  that much should have been patently obvious to anyone with a brain half the size of an ant's bls.I hung on to the end. Lord knows why as I tend to advise if you don't like a movie turn it off. Maybe I'm feeling rather masochistic today or maybe I kept hoping something was going to happen to make it worth my while. It didn't.That said if you don't care about intelligent scripts or whether a movie rehashes themesstylesplots that have been done better elsewhere many a time and if you like fluffy pointless romantic comedy no matter what then watch and enjoy! 410".

	schema:headline " A Charming Rogue is still a rogue";
	schema:reviewBody "All About Adam has the makings of good dark comedy but for some reason that is not the tone that the movie maker chose to use. Instead an attempt was made to make a light comedy about a man who does some really ugly things. This supposed romantic comedy veers wildly into Jerry Springer territory while seeming to assert that bad things that result in good outcomes for you are okay. Indeed this film is wholly dependent on good outcomes for its characters. Even one bad outcome in this film would result in totally exposing how big a cad and creep Adam really is. It would also show how unsound the film's premise is.Wild child Lucy cuts a swath through the available men that she encounters through a series of one night stands and shortterm relationships. She's a heartbreaker who engages and drops men at will uncaring of the damage and pain that she causes. This continues until she encounters the toogoodtobetrue Adam. She is immediately smitten. Is this a movie about Lucy receiving her comeuppance for her past behaviors? No Lucy spends the movie blissfully unaware of all of the perfidy swirling about her. And oddly enough in a comedy based on amorality Lucy is the only individual who seems to have a conscience. In truth Lucy ends up being the victim.Adam you see is a manipulative seducer who works his way through her familyworking his will on her sisters her brother and the brother's virginal girlfriend. Only the mother is spared and he will probably get to her later. Why does Adam do this? We are never given an opportunity to really know Adam's motives and motivations. Instead he serves as a cipher for others. We only get to see how others react to Adam in a Roshomon style retelling of his tale from the viewpoints of the various characters. Adam himself only offers that he has a gift for helping others. And help them he does. Sister Laura learns to be less repressed and to live her life experientially rather than intellectually David is able to connect sexually with the girl of his dreams and to move their relationship on to another level and elder sister Alice relearns sensuality and affection after a tryst with Adam a few hours before his scheduled wedding. The problem for the movie is that all of Adam's help is of a sexual nature. There are no kind words no hand holding and no words of wisdomjust sex. His stated desire to help is more selfserving alibi and justification than anything else.In the film Adam is extremely charming. He spins tale after tale lies that put him in the best light. Improbably people except for Alice eat it up. Perhaps this is his true gift. Ulltimately this film only works as a light comedy if you can like and identify with Adam and I couldn't. He presents to me as a smoothtalker who cares little about the consequences of his actions. In the real world families are destroyedpeople get divorced and are killed for activities such as these. These thoughts might not have been so prominent in my mind if the filmmaker had not made the unfortunate choice of tacking a sentimental traditionalromantic comedy staple to the end of the filmthe interrupted wedding. It does not fit into the rest of the film. The words spoken ring hollow and lack sincerity given the things that came before it. Adam is uninterested in Lucy's secrets only because his are far more egregious. It is not a discussion about the boundaries and limits of love.The final scene only makes it worse. The sense is that there will only be more of the same and no larger lessons were learned. Somewhere over the horizon the till now avoided disaster awaits them and when it strikes the last seen smile and smirk on Adams face is sure to be wiped away.Finally if I were a woman I would find this film offensive. The assertion that all of a female's emotional problems personal insecurities and dissatisfactions can be solved with a few wellplaced lies and a few nights of good sex has an undertone of misogyny. Have doubts about those undertones? Make the Adam character a female instead and have her tearing through a group of brothers and see what images it conjures up for you. Neither a sex comedy nor a romantic comedy this hybrid floats like a leaden balloon if you look at it too carefully. A charming creep is still a creep. When I look at Adam that is what I see.".

	schema:headline " Farce not Comedy!";
	schema:reviewBody "'About Adam' is billed as a comedy but it's safer to classify it as a farce. It's set in Dublin and it focuses on a family of three sisters and one brother who all become besotted with Adam a charming Lothario who insinuates himself into their lives. Unlike most American films where men end up chasing a beautiful woman 'About Adam' turns the tables and we're treated to the farcical machinations of women who can no longer control their passions when attracted to that one special 'mysterious' man.'About Adam' has a Rashomonlike plot where the story is told from the successive points of view of each sibling. We start off from Lucy's point of view Kate Hudson who meets Adam at her place of employment where she works as a waitresssinger. Lucy is looking for a man who will sweep her off her feet. I'm not sure how Adam manages to press all the right buttons of these women but they all become besotted with him. The initial seduction of Lucy goes on for way too long and after awhile her obsession with him becomes tiresome the first 30 minutes is the weakest part of the film.After about half an hour into the film conflict finally emerges. Soon after meeting Lucy Adam decides to seduce Lucy's sister Laura Frances O'Connor. Laura is more intellectual than Lucy studying for her PhD in poetry. And of course Adam is familiar with the very obscure poetry Lucy has been studying at school and recites it to her pressing her buttons. Before you know it Laura is stripping off HER clothes for him! Adam isn't finished. Brother David finds himself attracted to Adam and fantasizes having a bisexual affair with him. He doesn't actually act upon his fantasies but Adam somehow engenders a passionate spark in him and he ends up with a new invigorated love life with his girlfriend. Finally there's Alice trapped in a loveless marriage who also has a child. Alice is aware that Adam has been playing around with BOTH of her sisters and when she finally gives in to Adam before his marriage to Lucy it's on HER terms. She knows it's just a fling but the brief affair with Adam awakens her long repressed sexual passions.For those who were 'offended' by this film they completely miss the purpose of farce. In the words of the noted drama critic Eric Bentley in farce one is permitted the outrage without the consequences! Farce allows its audience to experience deepseated desires vicariously! While the sisters feel there is some deeper meaning in Adam's name noting that Adam is the name of the progenitor of all men one should liken him more to the Greek God Pan famous for his sexual powers and often depicted with an erect phallus.The world of 'About Adam' features no recriminations. While some feelings are ruffled none of the characters suffer any permanent psychic damage. Even Laura probably the most besotted and jealous of the sisters accepts Adam's marriage to Lucy and we see her holding hands with her school supervisor at the end of the film now ready for a mature romance in the real world. And although Adam is always lying to each of the women about his background the lies are white liesinconsequential again resulting in no harm Adam even suggests to Lucy who is having second thoughts about getting married just as they're about to tie the knot that people don't always have to know each other's secrets that way petty jealousies are averted!.'About Adam' is like a gentle breeze. It's a lighthearted farce not to be taken too seriously for all of you offended by its alleged 'immorality' I say get a life!. In addition it's an original take on the desire for passion in our lives. On the other hand by the end of the film we realize that the film's tension has dissipated. All that fun 'passion' unleashed in each sibling by the charming rake Adam has become a bit repetitious and overdone. In other words we get the point! By the end there are no more surprises! Since 'About Adam' is a bit offbeat and goodnatured I give it a '6'. But honestly while 'About Adam' is definitely worth watching one viewing is enough.".

The story of a charming mysterious man who makes every member of one family fall hard for him simply by being there and expressing the interest to each person's problems troubles and needs has been told many times but I personally was amused and smiled more than once while watching this little comedy and I found it if not a bright lost gem but a nice way to spend an hour and half following the adventures of a nice guy  every girl's dream come true who could make women happy because he knew exactly what each of them wanted needed longed for lacked in her life and dreamed about.

So I basically was expecting some Ok a lot of lowbrow humor a decent plot to keep rolling through and to laugh throughout the movie. This movie provided just that.  It wasn't the greatest comedy in the world or a landmark motion picture and it wasn't made to be that.  Colleen Haskell's skills at acting reminded me of when they put a famous nonactor on Saturday Night Live and don't give them too much to do in the skits. She's only in the movie probably a total of 15 minutes but does what they ask of her and does a decent job of it.  The movie is a hoot and doesn't actually stoop to every joke being a ft joke.  I laughed about every 34 minutes and enjoyed the ending as well.  If you're expecting something similar to Deuce Bigalow you won't be disappointed.".

The Animal is produced by the brilliant Adam Sandler who also has a really funny cameo as a Townie in this movie which stars Rob Schneider who also wrote the screenplay here. Rob really funny. Schneiders love interest is Colleen Haskell from the US reality TV show Survivor.After the awful Freddy Got Fingered I wasn't to sure what I would make out of The Animal but it was good.

It is truly brilliant.First off there is Schneider himself with the acrobatic dexterous slapstick genius that is only equalled by Keaton and Chaplin while his characterisation of a failing loser police office evidence clerk is the equal to any performance put in by Brando Olivia Hopkins or Curry.The production values while not overly high portray an attention to detail unrivalled by any feature length live action slapstick animal based comedy that came out that year. Whilst the script is as cutting and contemporary as anything produced by a Hollywood studio the directing demonstrates a brilliance that a comedy even of this calibre rarely get the luxury of having.The over loud animal noises the nob gags the bum gags the brilliant juxtaposing of 'funny' animal related physical jokes and human social events that on the face of it a 7 year old could have wrote but in reality could only have been penned by a genius.The plot is brilliant inspired and in places truly emotional. I don't want to spoil this truly great movie so don't read on if you haven't seen it.Mourning the loss of his father Marvin has to come to terms with his inability to find a companion and his spiralling out of control lack of self confidence. Ostracised by his work colleagues ritually abused by his neighbour and her viscous dog and devoid of any and all satisfaction personally and professionally. Its to this backdrop that Marvin suffers a hideous debilitating car accident but is miraculously saved by having his DNA spliced with an unknown amount of domesticated animal DNA and having some body part replacement.The movie covers politically hot topics such as whether using animal DNA in humans is acceptable the ethics of breeding animals for body parts the threat of hunting on animal populations and the cost of animal conservation that cannibalism is acceptable and that bestiality isOK. This is not to mention the exploration between god man and animal and the questions regarding animal consciousness.This is apart form the everyday elements of work place rivalry racism fatism sexism gun control murder meat eating and monkey jokes.On a personal level I have watched this movie 1000 times and have yet to not find it funny I literally end up doubled up in pain crying.....with laughter its just that good. I challenge anyone to get through this movie and not laugh at one joke its not possible. Brilliant brilliant brilliant.The bit where the scientist suggest Marvin get rid of his latent aggression fuelled by his sexual urge by sleeping with a chimpanzee in a pink tutu is possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life...my life!! If you don't laugh at this movie your just dead inside.Mr Schneider we salute you another fantastic movie lets hope he ignores the billions of ignorant critics the unjust reviews and the failing box office returns and goes on to make the animal 2 and 3.

Colleen the tribe has spoken you are not a good actor! As far as I can tell Haskell has only three different facial expressions. None of which are appealing. The person who hired her needs to extinguish her torch and ask her to leave the acting business immediately. So what kind of grade do we give The Animal?

A funny premise that borders on the obscene as Rob Schneider's animal instincts take over after a zany mad scientist puts him back together with animal parts and glands after a nearfatal car crash. Originally meant as an Adam Sandler vehicle Rob does a masterful comical performance in a really silly movie actually funnier than Ace Ventura Pet Detective. Because of his special abilities The Animal can smell heroin being smuggled in an airplane passenger's body and saves the mayor's child from drowning. He is hopelessly harassed by his boss as he tries to survive probation on the police force. Right up there as a farce reminiscent of The Man with Two Brains. Like Blazing Saddles it even has several uncomfortable black prejudice comments by the only black man in the film. Look for Ed Asner as an old policeman in a very insignificant role. Collen Haskell is really cute as the love interest who ends up being part Animal herself. We have the same doctor. Rob tries to hump everything in sight gorges on cattle and wakes up in a butcher shop window stuffed with salami and ham. It even makes fun of the Frankenstein movie's torchlit mob scenes. A short funny movie very well done but with lowclass humor to be sure. Not for young children although much more is suggested than actually shown.".

We follow Marvin as he tries to get his big break and become a policeman.  Standing in his way are other cops and also his lack of physical prowess.  That is until he has a horrendous accident and is repaired by a mad scientist played by Michael Caton.  He suddenly has the abilities of different kinds of animals and also there instincts.  That's the funny part about this movie as he tries to control these conflicting feelings going through his head.  Colleen Haskell plays his love interest in the movie and she comes off as the sweet innocent she is supposed to be.  Her main goal in life seems to be to save as many animals as possible.  This is one more in a fine line of comedic performances for Rob Schneider who seems to have found his niche playing the underdog role.".

This too tells us it is a comedy. It also stars Colleen Haskel who was the forgotten Survivor of the TV show. This tells us that the movie is not a comedy. It tells us it is a director and writer combination that wants desperately to be the Adam Sandler movies from the early 90's. The movies I am referring to are BILLY MADISON HAPPY GILMORE THE WEDDING SINGER and BIG DADDY. These right here were the movies that started the trend. And now every single star of SNL just has to have thier own movie.Aside from the notsogood DEUCE BIGALOW MALE GIGOLO this is Schneider's big moment. We even had Chris Farley doing his movies good movies I might add back in the very early 90's that even dragged David Spade along for the ride. Now that Farley is gone Spade has to have his own movies. This brought us the terrible JOE DIRT. What brought us THE ANIMAL? Answer Tom Brady. Again the guy who wrote episodes of The Simpsons is the man responsible for this atrocity of a comedy that IS sometimes funny I will admit. Director Luke Greenfield was also pretty unexperienced as some of his only other film credits are attributed to a 'Swimsuit' video made for Sports Illustrated I think.Edward Asner the guy from HARD RAIN was hardly in the movie at all. His scenes mainly consist of him entering a room as if he wanted to talk about something and sees somebody doing something stupid and then he delivers an unfunny oneliner and then just walks back out again. The end of the movie is what saves it. The whole end of the movie is comedic brilliance. It is very funny I never thought I would say that about this movie and is actually entertaining. The whole end of the movie made me actually want to see more. But since this was the end of the movie this did not happen.While the movie was not all good it was not all bad either. It was ordinary and just plain average. It is a good comedy one to take off the shelf every now and then when you are in the mood for something different or for something you haven't seen for a while. THE ANIMAL gets 35.".

	schema:reviewBody "No it's not wellmade as such.  And perhaps its greatest virtue is purely negative contrary to what you would conclude from the fact that it was released in 2001 and concerns a man who has been given powerful animal instincts it DOESN'T rely  not even once so far as I can recall  on grossout tactics.  The closest we come is when Marvin takes out a package of raw mincemeat and eats it when he thinks nobody's looking.  Really that's the closest we come.  It's NOT nasty it's NOT unpleasant.  And to move on to positive virtues it's actually funny.  Yes I was as surprised as anyone else.The writers are often content to stand back and let the premise do the work but at least the premise and the fairly obvious situations that follow from it are inherently amusing.  A man humping a goat isn't funny a man fighting his urge to hump a goat because he knows it will be frowned upon is ... actually this particular part of the movie isn't THAT funny but other parts are and it's because the principle is the same throughout.  When the animal humour wears thin there's often a good unrelated gag to supplement it.  That's good badger milk says Marvin as though badger milk were like wine and he wasn't certain what kind he was going to get.  Don't be ashamed son says the police chief.  I'VE eaten out of the garbage too...  Not THE greatest line I'll admit but Ed Asner gets points for delivering it in an inspired way.  And there's the guy who asks a series of questions that reveal the shy delight and eagerness he feels to be part of a mob.I didn't know before reading other people's comments that Colleen Haskell was a star of one of those schlocky reality TV shows and that this was her first acting role people who DID know this it seemed noticed all manner of deficiencies in her performance that simply weren't there.  Haskell plays the cute chick who ends up falling for the hero.  The ROLE is limited.  I honestly don't see how Haskell could have played it any better than she did. In fact more experienced actresses usually get it wrong and Haskell doesn't.  And at least she unlike most actresses called upon to play this kind of role really is gorgeous.".

And perhaps its greatest virtue is purely negative contrary to what you would conclude from the fact that it was released in 2001 and concerns a man who has been given powerful animal instincts it DOESN'T rely  not even once so far as I can recall  on grossout tactics.  The closest we come is when Marvin takes out a package of raw mincemeat and eats it when he thinks nobody's looking.  Really that's the closest we come.  It's NOT nasty it's NOT unpleasant.  And to move on to positive virtues it's actually funny.  Yes I was as surprised as anyone else.The writers are often content to stand back and let the premise do the work but at least the premise and the fairly obvious situations that follow from it are inherently amusing.  A man humping a goat isn't funny a man fighting his urge to hump a goat because he knows it will be frowned upon is ... actually this particular part of the movie isn't THAT funny but other parts are and it's because the principle is the same throughout.  When the animal humour wears thin there's often a good unrelated gag to supplement it.  That's good badger milk says Marvin as though badger milk were like wine and he wasn't certain what kind he was going to get.  Don't be ashamed son says the police chief.  I'VE eaten out of the garbage too...  Not THE greatest line I'll admit but Ed Asner gets points for delivering it in an inspired way.  And there's the guy who asks a series of questions that reveal the shy delight and eagerness he feels to be part of a mob.I didn't know before reading other people's comments that Colleen Haskell was a star of one of those schlocky reality TV shows and that this was her first acting role people who DID know this it seemed noticed all manner of deficiencies in her performance that simply weren't there.  Haskell plays the cute chick who ends up falling for the hero.  The ROLE is limited.  I honestly don't see how Haskell could have played it any better than she did. In fact more experienced actresses usually get it wrong and Haskell doesn't.  And at least she unlike most actresses called upon to play this kind of role really is gorgeous.";

However it has enough welldirected funny interludes to keep you going.  But just to watch Rob's screen presence is amazing. See it many times and I'm sure you will agree Rob is the next big thing in Hollywood comedic film.  Who knows? after another 8 or so of these he will move into dramatic acting.  As this film has made back its money bigtime at the box office we can be sure to see many more of these. Keep it up Rob !  Great job!My favorite scene ?

The director clearly understood what Foley is since the gunshots have all been added postproduction but I guess they just didn't have the time or money to dub the vast majority of the film after shooting. And it needs it. Badly.The acting is uniformly terrible. Not bad. Terrible. Alan Bragh doesn't even rise to the level of fourth grade pageants. Whitney Moore is cute as a button and is aided by a bit of cameltoe in at least one scene but she's the best of a poor lot. All the supporting cast is give your financial backers a small part bad.If you want to explain blocking editing framing sound markers continuity reverse shots and other film terms to your friends this is the film to use. None of it is done correctly.While the CGI and I use the term in only the broadest sense birds are hilarious my favorite scene is the retirement scene. I think that the word retirement is used six times in just three lines. Watch for it. It's hard to miss.BUT...it's strangely watchable. In contrast to many bad movies it's not boring. Consider it a train wreck that you simply can't tear your eyes from. Even the boring scenes and there really aren't that many have some aspect poor sound hilariously unrealistic dialogue odd things going on in the background that fascinate.

And after about a half hour of almost nothing going on between these two pieces of cardboardasactors the birds finally arrive.... oh yes how they arrive.What I mean by my uncertainty of what I was seeing it felt like a doubleedged sword. I kept thinking during the film 'either Nguyen is a total genius crafting the most intentionally bad movie in recent memory or he's quite possible the most sickening hack you've never wanted to meet.' It's one thing that the film was shot on a shitty camcorder. It's another that the actors appear to be nonprofessionals or at best from community theater Alan Bagh is so stiff he just might make your eyes bleed Moore is too hot to have that happen though her talent is just as nill.But it's something else how absolutely and surprisingly consistently awful the filmmaking is. Even if you've never taken a class in proper lighting or sound or stage direction or editing Birdemic shines so mightily in its crapness. Scenes start and end without a proper marker as if the editor didn't know how to flow from one scene one SHOT to the next. Sound is completely mismatched from one shot to the next. The music is the kind of synthesizer work that cranked up loud enough could drive BinLaden out of his cave they even go as far as to ripoff the John Lennon song Imagine for a girl character wearing a Imagine Peace shirt. And the birds... oh boy the birds if you need further proof watch the trailer do yourself a favor and get it out of the way.Now again experiencing this film especially in the case I had in a theater with people perhaps anticipating its awfulness based on the trailer or the website or the claim by Nguyen to be a Master of the Romantic Thriller Trademarked. I'm not kidding that this is perhaps just a brilliant prank a satire of epic proportions. Certainly the message part of the movie and it's wielded with such a sledgehammer it would make Stanley Kramer look like Jim Jarmusch  is done to such a ludicrous extent with characters appearing for walkon scenes like a Oldman Biologist who appears to explain that the birds were caused by man's harm to the planet or the TreeMan in the woods who has a treehouse home and finds the birds don't attack him because he's in the woods and not out on the road like the rest of stupid mananimal civilization. Not to mention the rather listen to us now attitude of the main characters driving their hybrid cars and seeing An Inconvenient Truth I st you not this is in the movie and their silly solar panels. Who ever heard of that working really well? All of this could potentially really be just a puton of such a magnitude that I would want to shake Nguyen's hand for pulling off such a feat. But no Nguyen took himself very seriously during this production only slightly changing his tune after the fact of people seeing the film like the audience in The Producers seeing Springtime for Hitler for the first time if you need proof look at this NY Times article quote I never went to film school Mr. Nguyen said. But I did go to what you'd call the film school of Hitchcock cinema.. I'll give him that he had persistence in getting the film out there even showing it in bars around the Sundance film festival when he couldn't get in. The masses of sober people puking all around him should have given him a clearer idea of what he had though.Oh don't get me wrong Birdemic is absolutely hysterically historically gloriously funny. It's a magnificent fresco of horrible CGI the birds just float like a screensaver and nonexistent acting and plot that... wait what plot? And who needs an ending that makes sense either or shots that match up? It's so funny that I ended up feeling just a weebit guilty by the end. It's easy to mock this movie like a bully on the playground mocking the kid with Cerebal Palsy. If the film isn't an intentional antifilm then it's just a really bad ManosEdWood level movie and all of the hilarity that ensues from it is kind of expected. It's not even worthy of Asylum DVD status. Alongside The Room After Last Season and Severed Ways it's one of the real nobudget badmovie finds of the past ten years. A mustsee for every wrong reason imaginable.".

Who ever heard of that working really well? All of this could potentially really be just a puton of such a magnitude that I would want to shake Nguyen's hand for pulling off such a feat. But no Nguyen took himself very seriously during this production only slightly changing his tune after the fact of people seeing the film like the audience in The Producers seeing Springtime for Hitler for the first time if you need proof look at this NY Times article quote I never went to film school Mr. Nguyen said. But I did go to what you'd call the film school of Hitchcock cinema.. I'll give him that he had persistence in getting the film out there even showing it in bars around the Sundance film festival when he couldn't get in. The masses of sober people puking all around him should have given him a clearer idea of what he had though.Oh don't get me wrong Birdemic is absolutely hysterically historically gloriously funny. It's a magnificent fresco of horrible CGI the birds just float like a screensaver and nonexistent acting and plot that... wait what plot? And who needs an ending that makes sense either or shots that match up? It's so funny that I ended up feeling just a weebit guilty by the end. It's easy to mock this movie like a bully on the playground mocking the kid with Cerebal Palsy. If the film isn't an intentional antifilm then it's just a really bad ManosEdWood level movie and all of the hilarity that ensues from it is kind of expected. It's not even worthy of Asylum DVD status. Alongside The Room After Last Season and Severed Ways it's one of the real nobudget badmovie finds of the past ten years. A mustsee for every wrong reason imaginable.";

	schema:headline " The worst movie of the decade and probably the most preachy";
	schema:reviewBody "I just got done watching Birdemic for the first time I knew it was made on 10000 dollars and it is regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. This same day I also watched The Happening and The Crawling Eye MST3K version so maybe I was feeling masochistic. This movie was all around bad in every aspect. It looks like it was shot on a fairly cheap digital video camera and it's obvious that the sound was recorded from the microphone built into the camera instead of a boom mic. I know that because the sound is very awful the actors have to be pretty close to the camera to be heard right and there's way too much loud background noise which in post production they played a lot of public domain elevator music to drown out the background noise. The worst audio issue was when they film on the beach because the sounds of the beach are 5 times louder than the actors voices.The movie itself is very slow paced the first half of the movie is just the main guy meeting his dream girl and building their relationship. The problem is that nobody in this movie can act and the writing was pitiful so what we get are very bland characters not even vanilla more like tofu bland. We get no reason to care about these people in any way and to make them less likable the main guy has to talk about solar panels hybrid cars global warming and even the war in Iraq as much as he can. The script is almost a love letter to Al Gore. This feels like an eternity where it goes from his boring job that he is way too enthusiastic about his obsession with a greener world and his dates.The second half of the movie is when the birds finally go on a rampage. Lots of 2D computer generated birds that fly around in circles and attack their prey by hovering in place while moving their wings up and down and making the same noise looped over and over the whole movie. Somehow these berserk eagles can set house on fire as well as kill people in one swoop. The couple ends up meeting another couple who lets them ride in their van this van has everything from handguns and two AK47 assault riffles with unlimited ammo I'm guessing the van has Game Genie as well as medical supplies and anything the plot requires. Most of the movie has these people gunning down birds and searching for survivors. The survivors they meet all have long boring monologues about how it isn't the eagles we should be afraid of it's global warming and mankind's use of fossil fuels that is responsible for this disaster.As far as the action goes it's about as lame as the trailer makes it look. When someone dies it's just a bird hovering in front of the person and they fall down with blood make up on them. There's also some really pointless scenes there just to raise the body count like a man who pulls a gun on them even though they still have an assault riffle that they seem to forget about for the rest of the moviewho wants their gas which they say cost them 100 dollars a gallon. There's a whole lot of nothing interesting going on. At least companies like Troma can take a 10 cent movie and throw in lots of nudity over the top gore and comedy. The people behind Birdemic have the worst CGI effects since the old Star Trek movies and long speeches about the environment. If you watch it bring some friends and laugh at it because it works in that regard. Other than that it's Duck Hunt The Movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's be honest if you even got as far as reading this review then you're not looking for a good movie so there's a good chance Birdemic is the movie for you. On the other hand let me give you some practical advice just start the movie at minute 47 because nothing of any real importance happens in the first half. It's entirely spent establishing an implausible relationship between a Nathalie Whitney Moore a hot fashion model and a Rod Alan Bagh computer geek. I know this sort of thing is a staple in horror and sci fi movies but usually the nerd has some hidden charms. Rod is basically just annoying and full of himself. Also the relationship normally develops in the context of the plot and involves at least some dramatic tension. In this case they meet and she is immediately swept off her feet by his complete lack of charm and affected speech patterns. Oh yeah he's also just landed a big business deal that will make him a millionaire. So much more Nathalie's wholesome image the little gold digger! Anyway this whole process takes about 5 minutes. Where the other 40 go is a mystery. OK they do find one dead bird on the beach. Consider yourself foreshadowed.On second thought start at minute 44 to catch the movie's only redeeming feature a gratuitous slow pan of Moore in her underwear. But then immediately jump to minute 47 to escape the most awkward and unconvincing love scene in the history of cinema. Don't say you haven't been warned.Then the action starts. After a night of passion they awake to a full scale attack by badly rendered CGI birds which terrorize people and occasionally dive bomb the ground exploding on impact. I don't mean they burst apart in a shower of bird guts I mean they actually explode with fire and smoke like little Kamikazee pilots! This is never explained.And that's pretty much it. The rest of the movie is basically spent running from these birds and occasionally fighting them off  first with coat hangers and later with the the stash of firearms and almost limitless ammo that one character inexplicably produces. Sometimes there's a variation on the explosion theme where the birds splatter people with something that appears to burn them like acid. They run into a couple of people in their travels who explain this is all caused by global warming. This shameless pandering to social relevance loses any sympathy the film maker might otherwise have had. Also I can believe that climate change might make birds aggressive but could it really make them explode?Just how bad an actor is Alan Bagh? Well it should tell you something that he couldn't project any credible passion in a love scene with our scantily clad heroine. His dialog is delivered in a uniform stilted monotone and he seems to avoid eye contact with either the camera or any of his fellow actors. In fact even the scenes when he and Moore are walking in silence  and there are an annoyingly large number of these  are somehow not at all believable. I mean seriously how hard is it to walk in a convincing manner? If I saw someone walking like that on the street I would assume he had suffered some sort of head trauma.Almost all of the actors are more or less equivalent to Bagh with the arguable exception of Moore. Don't get me wrong she's not great but since she's the only person in the movie with any acting ability whatsoever she comes across like Merryl Streep. Really you find yourself longing for her speaking parts because it's the only dialog that's doesn't literally make you cringe. Also did I mention she's got a gratuitous underwear scene at minute 44?A lot has been said about the poor quality of the CGI birds but nothing can prepare you for how bad they really are. If Ed Wood had made this movie he would have interspersed stock footage of flocks of birds with stuffed birds thrown in from off screen  and the result would have been much much more effective!Anyway since they're worried about bird attacks you would think they would I don't know stay indoors! By no they're outside as much as possible. Part of this is because in the one day since the birds attacked civilization has completely crumbled and they're forced to forage for food. Just when you're continuing to wonder how they're going to end this this thing the birds simply fly away with no explanation. Huh?Truly a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Birdemic Shock and Terror has made a splash in the underground community of masochists that enjoy atrocious cinema. With a tag line of Why did the eagles and vultures attacked? people have mistakenly believed this is the newest so bad its good title. As evidenced by the midnight screening I attended these people are or will be very disappointed. The incompetence on display here is remarkable. Director James Nguyen has no idea of simply techniques like writing a coherent story including sound in every shot knowing when to end shots or incorporation of special effects. Nguyen is a Vietnamese immigrant and had no training of any kind in filmmaking. He was apparently inspired to create this film due to his affection for The Birds.The film opens with an extended driving sequence where the camera hovers at an odd angle for no reason. It is tilted slightly to the right for almost eight minutes before anything at all happens. It's almost a loving homage to the opening of Manos The Hands of Fate which was also directed by someone who had no idea of how to make movies. After this unbearable sequence we are introduced to the main character Rod. He works for a technology company and has apparently earned stock options. He notifies us of his success about every ten minutes and uses it as a way to pick up an attractive fashion model named Natalie. This was the first role for both actors and they are so artificial in their delivery it's as if Nguyen told them to eliminate any emotion their characters should have experienced. Whitney Moore who plays Natalie appears to have a little bit of acting ability. She at least smiles sometimes.The first half of the movie contains no bird attacks. This is the romantic part of the movie if you could call it such. Nguyen insists calling his movie a romantic thriller instead of a horror movie. For seemingly no reason at all eagles and vultures interrupt the couple while they have sex without removing their clothes. These creatures are floating GIF images and hover over the screen. They are so poorly incorporated into the live action that they never actually give the presence of third dimensionality. They are stuck to the frame until the next scene begins. This is amusing for about five minutes and then becomes monotonous not only because of the repetition of seeing the birds but also because a looping chirp plays whenever they are on screen. We later learn the birds are attacking because global warming has somehow affected them. I honestly cannot recall what the explanation was in detail because I had difficulty hearing it. Nguyen didn't use anything to amplify dialog so you will strain to hear what characters are saying most of the time.Birdemic is an unusually bad bad movie. It's a lack of imagination mixed with a lack of technical competence only made worse by a runtime of an hour and a half. If that wasn't enough to ensure its infamy promotional material listed it as Bidemic. It's actually worse than the TV sequel to Hitchcock's film that was later disowned by its director.Not Recommended".

The scenery of Half Moon Bay is agreeable for one thing and Ms. Moore has at least a modicum of charisma also anyone who appreciates a stylish blue hybrid Mustang rolling along in a stately manner gets to savor that very sight in many lingering shots. All positive aspects of this film.Less positive aspects of this film are legion so much so that I'm reminded of my wish that IMDb.com would allow a vote on a scale from 1 to 100 rather than 1 to 10 in which case Birdemic would rate at least a 3 out of 100 for the reasons mentioned and perhaps a 4 for meaning well though the message about global warming comes across in a preachy and hamhanded manner. Still something about the profoundly amateurish quality of this film makes it feel a little unfair to rate it at all  in much the same way that it would feel wrong to grade a term paper on the basis of some rough notes jotted down before writing the paper rather than the paper itself. This film very much reminds me of a rough draft  a sort of rough visualization of what the film would have been if the producer had more resources at his disposal thus making the upcoming largerbudget sequel all the more intriguing.Yet I wonder if this film might have been less entertaining if it were better made. If it featured better sound editing writing acting direction and special effects it might just be a forgettable homage to The Birds its very flaws elevate or should I say depress? it to a special level otherwise occupied by a few special films like The Room and Manos the Hands of Fate  the legendary realm of films that are so bad they're good. So giving it the benefit of the doubt as a real film and not just a rough draft I tender my vote of 1 out of 10 and hope that other fans of this film will also give it an appropriately low vote and insure its rightful place on the Bottom 100 once it gathers the requisite number of votes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know where to begin so I'll say this. I've heard The Room reviewed as the Citizen Kane of bad movies. After watching Birdemic Shock and Terror The Room will actually seem as good as Citizen Kane.Birdemic Shock and Terror is a cult film waiting to happen. The low budget the amateur cast and crew the goofy holeridden plot but what this movie has that classic cult films like The Room and Troll 2 for example don't is a complete ineptitude from the standpoint of all involved in this movie. I could watch Troll 2 and The Room and I could picture in some alternate dimension that everything that was wrong with those movies was tweaked and they actually weren't half bad but Birdemic Shock and Terror is different.First of all the editing in this movie is worse than your average high schooler's film studies project. Almost every perspective change in a scene is accompanied with a long awkward pause and an obvious change in sound even on the television. I'm pretty sure the directorproducerwriter of this atrocity James Nguyen just used the builtin mic on his digital camcorder. Also every scene is shot with a pan to the right. Believe it or not though if there's one thing I'll give credit to in this film is the music. It's actually decent considering the small budget. The song played during the awful bar scene comes to mind because it's really catchy and actually has some really good musicianship. However the film score is often repeated and in the case of the beginning credits is obnoxiously repeated.Next the plot and writing. If you haven't seen the movie the plot is that an aspiring software salesman meets a girl and they hit it off only to have their wonderful love be cut short by killer birds. The plot is somewhat coherent as it's pretty easy to figure out what's going on with the love story and it's also pretty clear why did the eagles and vultures attacked quoting a movie flier made by Nguyen himself. Thankfully there aren't any subplots in the movie unless you count the career ventures the characters make pretty early in the movie which brings me to the writing.In the pile of steaming crap that is this movie this has to be the smelliest part. Nguyen was inspired by two movies supposedly Hitchcock's The Birds and Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. I read about that before I watched the movie and I had a hard time thinking how those two could be combined then I watched this film. The most out of place out of context plugs for unrealistic green technology absurdly cheap solar panels 100 mpg Ford Mustang can are uttered in this movie to the point where it's almost offensive. This is a part of the movie that you need to see to believe because I'd easily be over the word limit if I had to describe all these scenes.Finally we'll talk about the acting. There's not much to say here except that they aren't good actors. Thankfully we don't see awkward characters or overacting like in other bad films that have acquired cult rating but we do see bad actors nonetheless. I honestly don't feel like I can make a true judgement of their acting because of the terrible script and editing but I can only imagine what I'd think if I got a true performance from them. If I had to pick the top 3 actors in this film I'd pick the treehugger Nathalie and the nightclub singer.Basically I suggest you watch this movie. This is probably the worst featurelength film of all time and I've seen some bad films.".

Food of the Gods? Beyond Atlantis? Troll 2? All of them laughably bad and just kinda fun to watch when you realized their stink going into it...

You know? I'm just going to fore go the review and list my favorite parts in no particular order1 During their date the stop for a moment to admire the birds landing in the trees... the birds look like they are moving in slow motion and are our first glimpse into how bad the CGI is going to be...

There are PLENTY of other cars driving down the road... you have to wonder what these folks thought was going on!4 The birds are capable of explosion inducing dive bombs! They make the sound of a dive bomber from WWII movie too... No Really!5 MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE... People are stuck in a bus and are being terrorized by the birds... our heroes pull in to save the day. They are facing the bus and the birds are between the bus and our heroes. What do the heroes do? Pull out their M16 and just start SPRAYING with NO REGARD. In the real world both bird and passenger would be dead... In Birdemic? Not so much. 6 The Tree Hugger... he hears a mountain Lion so he has to get back to his tree!In sum this movie felt FAR longer than it actually was.

My thought is usually You really don't know what 'bad' is do you? Birdemic Shock And Terror is bad. It is as bad as what people say it is. It is almost unbelievably bad and I can believe a lot. It is gobsmackingly awful  this coming from a fan of Ed Wood.Rod and Nathalie are two former schoolmates who happen to come across each other and proceed to fall in love also happening to find out that they just happen to have neutral fans who also just happen to be in love.Nothing occurs in the first half of the film. Nothing. After the opening credits where a tinny tune is played on a continuous loop we are treated to deadening acting although in defense Whitney Moore isn't too bad atrocious dialogue horrible sound and dreadful editing. This all makes it vastly entertaining for those who are fascinated by such ineptness.After this first half of routine and dreadful drama the birds start attacking. Just like that. There are a couple of references to strange things happening in nature earlier but really it could have all just been a 'straight' so to speak love story beforehand.It could be that filmmaker James Nguyen a selfproclaimed Hitchcock fan tried to take a leaf out of the Master's book here where Hitch sometimes had his thrillers trundle along in an unalarming way for a while until almost casually things would start to happen and before we knew it the thrills were on.The difference is of course that Hitchcock did it with style wit and panache.To say the birds attack is a very loose statement. In reality they are superimposed on the screen bouncing up and down while the actors wave various articles at them. When one thinks about it this is not really very surprising. If a scene of two people talking in a restaurant can't be handled above the level of complete incompetence how could we expect more from the special effects later? As we go on our heroes fire guns with unlimited ammunition at the birds while driving around aimlessly trying to help others including picking up two children.These children have just seen their mother killed by the birds. And yet before long they're sitting in the back seat of the car playing computer games and demanding Happy Meals! Other people get killed by birds suddenly flying past them and seeming to clip them with their beaks or claws which is enough to drop them on the spot.And the ending. The ending... It's utter meaninglessness suits the film perfectly. As someone who is fascinated by true badness not just in movies Birdemic transcends such things for me. Everything that could possibly be wrong in filmmaking again with the possible exception of Moore is on display here. Everything. Maybe one day Tim Burton will do a sequel to Ed Wood and call it James Nguyen although it would be harder to pronounce. But surely it would be worth the admission price.".

It is gobsmackingly awful  this coming from a fan of Ed Wood.Rod and Nathalie are two former schoolmates who happen to come across each other and proceed to fall in love also happening to find out that they just happen to have neutral fans who also just happen to be in love.Nothing occurs in the first half of the film. Nothing. After the opening credits where a tinny tune is played on a continuous loop we are treated to deadening acting although in defense Whitney Moore isn't too bad atrocious dialogue horrible sound and dreadful editing. This all makes it vastly entertaining for those who are fascinated by such ineptness.After this first half of routine and dreadful drama the birds start attacking. Just like that. There are a couple of references to strange things happening in nature earlier but really it could have all just been a 'straight' so to speak love story beforehand.It could be that filmmaker James Nguyen a selfproclaimed Hitchcock fan tried to take a leaf out of the Master's book here where Hitch sometimes had his thrillers trundle along in an unalarming way for a while until almost casually things would start to happen and before we knew it the thrills were on.The difference is of course that Hitchcock did it with style wit and panache.To say the birds attack is a very loose statement. In reality they are superimposed on the screen bouncing up and down while the actors wave various articles at them. When one thinks about it this is not really very surprising. If a scene of two people talking in a restaurant can't be handled above the level of complete incompetence how could we expect more from the special effects later? As we go on our heroes fire guns with unlimited ammunition at the birds while driving around aimlessly trying to help others including picking up two children.These children have just seen their mother killed by the birds. And yet before long they're sitting in the back seat of the car playing computer games and demanding Happy Meals! Other people get killed by birds suddenly flying past them and seeming to clip them with their beaks or claws which is enough to drop them on the spot.And the ending. The ending... It's utter meaninglessness suits the film perfectly. As someone who is fascinated by true badness not just in movies Birdemic transcends such things for me. Everything that could possibly be wrong in filmmaking again with the possible exception of Moore is on display here. Everything. Maybe one day Tim Burton will do a sequel to Ed Wood and call it James Nguyen although it would be harder to pronounce. But surely it would be worth the admission price.";

	schema:headline " Top Forty Things I Took From Birdemic";
	schema:reviewBody "1. Angry birds do in fact drop bombs. Only they explode. Literally. I'm not kidding.2. Shock and Terror? Check and Check.3. All film class's first assignment should be a full length movie such as Birdemic so by the semester's end you can see why you really did need the class.4. Make that if Birdemic was your intro film then go ahead and pay for the same course for another three semesters. Actually just drop out.5. Repeating a 30sec music track in order to fill up a 4min opening credit screen does not deserve a Music by recognition.6. Sometimes 20minute films that stem from a 2minute idea can sadly be stretched to 90 minutes.7. If Hitchcock was resurrected to watch this remake 'Birds' he'd only sue the people who brought him back.8. To close a 1000000 sales call simply thank them for their business hang up and smile.9. To persuade investors to give 10 million dollars a oneslide PowerPoint presentation should seal the deal. Remember just to keep pointing at it for emphasis.10. Kids prefer HappyMeals over seaweed. Go figure.11. Nintendo's DuckHunt not only had better graphics but actually produced more realistic birds and guns in combat.12. No real birds were harmed in the production. I repeat No real birds13. Al Gore not only changed his stance on GlobalWarming following Birdemic's release but he spit on DirectorWriter Nguyen before converting to Republicanism.14. At least Tommy Wiseau's The Room was trying to be funny. At least Piranha3D knew what kind of movie it was.15. As bad of actors that were in this feature they must've learned something for acting scared of these birds that were as menacing as finches. 16. Sure it's billed as a Birds reduxit's just as much a Beauty  the Beast remake Just check out daughter Nathalie and her monster of a mother. 17. At least M. Night does make the effort to edit something. 18. Twilight now seems surprisingly more romantic. 19. I don't have the 10000 budget this movie had but if I did I'd sooner risk it on one pull of a slot machine than what this movie would net. 20. My guess is whenever the director yelled Cut! or That's a Wrap! the actors were seeing the connection to their future. 21. It's sad when while laughing as hard as possible at a movie you still think this would have worked perfectas a 15second Family Guy cutaway. 22. SYFY Channel Productions is in the process of suing for deformation of character. 23. Wearing green does not equate going green. Heck it's not even a believable subliminal message. 24. Not all blame can be put upon the director. These actors did appear to be conscious. 25. 5gallon for gas this summer? Ha! Call me when it becomes 100gallon. 26. In a postapocalyptic world credit cards work just fine. 27. A movie about mysteriousunexplained bird attacks needs some time to get to that. The first 50 minutes out of 90 should be just the right about of time to watch people drive turn left fill up their gas tank dance to a cruiseship reject singer fall in love in conjunction with making fake love in a motel make one company rich enough to sell while simultaneously building another from scratch and land a Victoria Secret gig. 28. MST3k wouldn't know where to begin. 29. If someone tries to steal your gas can simply wait until they without cause begin walking backwards from you and their own getaway car so the birds can ironically take them out.30. Knocking off 1000 off a 20000 home solar panel is a steal. 31. Using two different Thai restaurant fronts in two simultaneous shots doesn't just equate a mistake it makes you stupid. 32. And on with the traffic report 'Well traffic is running smoothly on Cabrillo Highway but make sure you watch out for tons of cars on the shoulder that contains what looks like moving dead people. Nohehthey're not zombies but even if they were the couple with the toy guns should take care of them.' 33. Find yourself under attack from birds but that darned tourist bus just isn't holding up? Well listen to a stranger and gather your thoughts in the fresh air under the blue skyin plain view of the very birds you're trying to avoid. 34. If a bird scientist tells you to stand back simply walk up to him and just ask him to talk. It will throw him so far off he'll have no choice in attempting to fill some plot holes in your movie. Unsuccessfullybut still. 35. Dialogue should never be plagiarized from Bazooka Joe Comics. 36. Sound effects and boom mics should be used to enhance the feature not cause further ridicule. 37. These birds seem more bent on revenge than Jaws did in his fourth installment. 38. Long before Birdemic was made and someone asked the director when it was supposed to be made his response should've been The Day After Tomorrowrepeatedly. 39. Why can't we just give peace a chance? is not a good movie quote in this weapon of mass destruction of a film that should've been dropped over the Taliban. 40. Dissecting this movie on everysingleflaw is only fruitless to anyone other than a film school teacher  believe me it would take me HOURS to scrutinize everything wrong here. Instead grab a beer or thirty gather some friends and laugh away an hour and a half of purely hilarious entertainment.".

No killer birds no laughs and i was not at any point entertained this movie was just a complete waste of time and the money used to make this garbage could have been used to feed starving children.

	schema:reviewBody "Last night I went to a local movie rental store with my grandparents to rent some movies to watch. We rented two movies. First we rented Saving Mr. Banks. It's a fantastic movie I suggest you watch it. Second we rented this. This was more for my pleasure because I knew neither of them would like it. So this morning I sat down and saw it. Oh boy This movie stars a guy named Rod. He's your average marketer until he meets the girl of his dreams. They go out for a little bit and then all of a sudden a huge swarm of birds attacks the city! And that is literally the entire plot. The story is just so random. It's almost like a really crappy sitcom for a while then BIRDS! HOLY CRAP BIRDS! What I love most about the plot of this movie is that the first forty minutes or so is completely worthless. This movie is about birds attacking the series so why is there so much relationship and work drama? Plus there are scenes that don't make sense. For example at one point in the movie a guy goes to the main character's house about making a deal to install a solar panel to the house. What does that have to do with the plot? Absolutely nothing. Nothing new was added to the plot none of this is ever mentioned again so why? What's the point? The cinematography is absolute crap. The camera never steadies and focuses on the right thing. Every shot looks like it belongs in a home movie. There are some shots that feel completely random and just out of place. It just looks awful. The editing is even worse. The scene transitions are beyond choppy with so many many jump cuts. There are literally four jump cuts in the same exact scene at one point. Plus this movie has that audio static you get when recording with a low budget camera only in this movie between every scene the level of static changes. And sometimes it goes away altogether. Hey Nguyen I don't know if you've ever heard of this before. It's called a boommike? It's really neat! It makes all the sound sound much crisper without all that audio static. But I see you wasted your entire 10 dollar budget on CGI so what's the point of telling you this? Speaking of CGI ugh the CGI is poop! It's the kind of bad that you can't describe just because of the sheer amount of awful it withholds. It's just bad. All the CGI is put into birds explosions and blood effects. Do you think you could've tried a little harder? The birds are absolutely ridiculous. Not only are they animated like crap but they just make no sense. These birds literally divebomb towards the city kamikaze style and explode on impact. Also they have no actual entrance or exit in the movie. After forty minutes of the bullcrap that is the story the birds just appear and start attacking everybody. No explanation why they just do. And at the end they just fly away like it's nothing. There's no reason why they should. There's no indication of anything that happens that would drive the birds away. This plot hole makes the movie all the more pointless. Now I have to touch on the acting. The acting rendered me speechless. Wooden does not begin to describe the acting. Everyone seems like they're phoning it in and even that is being too generous. Everyone does an absolutely awful job. Especially the main character. He brings a whole new level of awful to the table. I've seen better acting from the people that are in the home videos on AFV. And they aren't even acting! I just I I can't! I can't do this! Overall Birdemic Shock and Terror is horrendous. The acting sucks the CGI sucks the story or what little there is anyway sucks there are scenes that make no sense the cinematography looks like it was done by a toddler the audio is grating the characters are annoying everything just sucks! And do you know what the cherry on top is? THIS MOVIE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE. I'm serious. The characters in the movie say that global warming is the cause of all this. Bullcrap! What a copout! In terms of quality this movie is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. I still like it better than Battlefield Earth though. Score 1.010".

Every shot looks like it belongs in a home movie. There are some shots that feel completely random and just out of place. It just looks awful. The editing is even worse. The scene transitions are beyond choppy with so many many jump cuts. There are literally four jump cuts in the same exact scene at one point. Plus this movie has that audio static you get when recording with a low budget camera only in this movie between every scene the level of static changes. And sometimes it goes away altogether. Hey Nguyen I don't know if you've ever heard of this before. It's called a boommike? It's really neat! It makes all the sound sound much crisper without all that audio static. But I see you wasted your entire 10 dollar budget on CGI so what's the point of telling you this? Speaking of CGI ugh the CGI is poop! It's the kind of bad that you can't describe just because of the sheer amount of awful it withholds. It's just bad. All the CGI is put into birds explosions and blood effects. Do you think you could've tried a little harder? The birds are absolutely ridiculous. Not only are they animated like crap but they just make no sense. These birds literally divebomb towards the city kamikaze style and explode on impact. Also they have no actual entrance or exit in the movie. After forty minutes of the bullcrap that is the story the birds just appear and start attacking everybody. No explanation why they just do. And at the end they just fly away like it's nothing. There's no reason why they should. There's no indication of anything that happens that would drive the birds away. This plot hole makes the movie all the more pointless. Now I have to touch on the acting. The acting rendered me speechless. Wooden does not begin to describe the acting. Everyone seems like they're phoning it in and even that is being too generous. Everyone does an absolutely awful job. Especially the main character. He brings a whole new level of awful to the table. I've seen better acting from the people that are in the home videos on AFV. And they aren't even acting! I just I I can't! I can't do this! Overall Birdemic Shock and Terror is horrendous. The acting sucks the CGI sucks the story or what little there is anyway sucks there are scenes that make no sense the cinematography looks like it was done by a toddler the audio is grating the characters are annoying everything just sucks! And do you know what the cherry on top is? THIS MOVIE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE. I'm serious. The characters in the movie say that global warming is the cause of all this. Bullcrap! What a copout! In terms of quality this movie is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. I still like it better than Battlefield Earth though. Score 1.010";

Birdemic is just plan awful. It's doesn't even belong in the 'it's so bad it's good' group of bad movies. It's lacks any sense of entertainment. At first I thought this was a student film due to it's windows movie maker CGI effects wooden acting audio conflict and bad editing shots but no this movie was just produce by James Nguyen the modern day Ed Wood with Tippi Hedren serving as his Bela Lugusi. He never received any formal training in moviemaking but instead grew up watching the movies of Alred Hitchcock including his 1963 picture 'The birds'. It took the director four years to make this movie and it's still awful. Please James Nguyen learn how to make a movie please. Birdemic Shock and Terror starts with the shocking and terrifying Rod Alan Bagh who the camera loves to show driving and walking over loop music badly made sound effects or blank silence. Rod meets up with aspiring fashion model Nathalie Whitney Moore and begins dating her. The dialogue between the two wooden actors are just bad. It's like a hurricane blew through the script and devastated every line in it's path. The whole idea of the two main characters being a couple is just awkward as both have no connection with each other it felt like the actress didn't really wanted to be there. The whole love story is just painfully to watch due to it's dullish. The first part of the movie is so boring with non needed scenes bad fade in and fade outs and long pauses when cuts are needed. Most of the audience is just waiting for the birds to attack and kill these folks just because the movie need some type of entertaining value. Rod and Nathalie woke up to find that their town Half Moon Bay is under attack from CGI photoshop eagles and vultures that spit acid disappear in end of shots and explode into flames upon striking the ground. I'm not a naturalist like Charles Darwin but I don't think birds explode or spit acid due to Global Warning effects. The movie love to mention Global Warning but doesn't really do a good job on explaining it. They even had a badly written doctor on a bridge to try to explain it and he wouldn't do the job. Even Al Gore would hate this movie. The whole plot is directless and the movie tries to pay tribute to 'The Birds' but felt like a cheap knock off of that. The sound is horrible there are scenes where the movie go silence yet in others such as the one at the beaches. The sound of the waves crashing makes the movie hard to hear. Don't get me started on the annoying sound during the attack and things rubbing against the microphone. Oh god the bird screams my ears are bleeding. I wasn't even aware it was possible to fail this badly. It fails as a romance and it really fails as a horror flick. I try to look for any good notes for the film and I can't find anything worth noting. That's how bad I dislike this film. I can't believe that they are even thinking of making a 2nd movie Birdemic 2 The Resurrection. Birdemic is just pure cinematic failure on absolutely every conceivable level. I'm surprised it wasn't written produced directed and starred in by Alan Smithee. This movie makes Troll 2 look like Orson Welles 'Citizen Kane' or Tommy Wiseau 'The Room' look like Godfather. Check it out at your own cost. It's worth watching if you like your eyes prick by GIF clipart birds.".

Maybe that's what makes it fun to watch because of its honesty in trying to make a horror film with very limited resources. The pacing is atrocious though in that you will finally see the birds attack about 45 minutes through the movie and the birds look like Windows 95 screen savers. The sound editing...it's like every shot you will hear the difference in the background noise and by the time you see them firing guns your ears will explode due to the intensity of the sound. Forget about the plot because it doesn't even need one. All in all I can say it's a great movie to laugh at even when you are not drunk.".

Don't get me wrong I think you should see it but it is truly the worst movie EVER.Okay the CGI is HORRIBLE the sound transitions between scenes are so bad you will think somebody switched the channel and none of the actors have any real talent. The plot is more made up of mistakes than an actual story all characters are one dimensional and boring at best. The best part of the movie is the worst part of a porn movie seeing the chick in her underwear.Why I still think you should watch this is because of the leading role Rod or whatever played by Alan Bagh. I think a cardboard cutout of the They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me! Oh my GOOOOOOOOD!guy from troll 2 search it on youtube if you haven't seen it would do a better job than this guy. He can not do a single movement naturally seriously everything he does looks ridiculous. EVERYTHING. He can't walk talk get into a car or even stand still like a normal person.The first half hour of the movie no birds yet is hilarious because of him stumbling around like someone who is recovering from a severe stroke and had most of his brain removed. Moore tries to save it and she's actually not half bad okay she's pretty bad but so much better than Bagh but it just doesn't work because she has to act like she likes him. HE IS THE MOST BORING ZERODIMENSIONAL CCKSUCKER EVER WHY WOULD ANYONE GIVE A SHT ABOUT HIS HOBBIES OR HIS STUPID JOB.The plot is total garbage of course but what bothers me most is the TOTAL LACK OF SENSE on Nguyens part. At one point they find a dead bird on the beach but instead of getting a dead chicken somewhere they use a CGI bird. IT LOOKS TERRIBLE. WHY WOULD YOU DO SUCH A THING.This movie makes 2012 Ice Age look like Avatar. In comparison to this Mega Shark Vs. Giant Octopus is worthy of 10 Oscars. It is unbelievable that anyone would produce this did no one with a milligram of sense and taste watch this before it was brought out? Nguyen and everyone he knows should be whipped severely for making this hell spawn of a movie.Bottom line Go watch it and be amazed at the unbelievable amounts of incompetence one can show in just 90 minutes.

Personally I broke my rule of a minimum of 7.0 rating due to the fact that Kevin Spacey was in the picture. Very glad I did so. In fact I am going to cancel all rulings based on this movie alone. Before I go on I must say that it is understandable why the movie is underrated. The movie develops at a slower pace than what the average movie fan is used to and it definitely lacks the suspense moments action thrills and so on. However it has so much more to compensate for it. Intricate character development superb acting deep and very well though through screenplay and dialogues makes this movie a brilliant and yet simple unique creation. It makes you think about your own lives the lives of those around you. Everybody has got problems everyone has got issues its not just on the big screen. Often the stories of those around you are far more profound than what you see on the screen. The screenplays and movies have tried nearly every possible scenario every possible plot. Directors and screenwriters alike try to deliver ever more complicated and twisted plots that the movie watchers would be surprised by. This movie strikes all that it forgets Hollywood and delivers something unique and true to humanity. It brings you down to earth and sheds light into the lives of those around you on something that happens to a lot of us everyday. As always Kevin Spacey delivers a top notch performance. This is the movie that you would want to see more than once maybe it is one of those movies that you would be willing to watch twice in a row. I believe that there is something to be found in this movie upon each new time that you watch it. It is definitely one of the best movies in the past year or so. Simply brilliant.".

It makes you think about your own lives the lives of those around you. Everybody has got problems everyone has got issues its not just on the big screen. Often the stories of those around you are far more profound than what you see on the screen. The screenplays and movies have tried nearly every possible scenario every possible plot. Directors and screenwriters alike try to deliver ever more complicated and twisted plots that the movie watchers would be surprised by. This movie strikes all that it forgets Hollywood and delivers something unique and true to humanity. It brings you down to earth and sheds light into the lives of those around you on something that happens to a lot of us everyday. As always Kevin Spacey delivers a top notch performance. This is the movie that you would want to see more than once maybe it is one of those movies that you would be willing to watch twice in a row. I believe that there is something to be found in this movie upon each new time that you watch it. It is definitely one of the best movies in the past year or so. Simply brilliant.";

Characters were brought in Robin Williams being one for side stories which never quite connected to the main plot. Pot addiction is shown as a series of untimely naps which is not realistic. The audience never gets a glimpse into the main character's despair or the circumstances surrounding his wife's death. A love interest is developed and then never followed through. Characters walk in and out of the story without strong reasons. The ending is trite as if they just needed to wrap it up. Too many loose ends and a waste of some good talent. Nonetheless because of Spacey and a nod to the welldeveloped friendship with his drug dealer that was fun to watch I hung in there happily right to the end.".

Alas it doesn't last. Too many characters are introduced too often the movie jumps around back and forth too abrupt and radical the atmosphere of the movie changes. For example As much as i like Robin Williams but what purpose had his character in this movie? It just added another storyline distracting from the main story of the movie.The saddest part is the finish though. I did expect a twist to solve the whole situation but this superficial solution just left me speechless. I felt angry that i felt sympathy for the protagonists! A Hollywood flick has to end good of course i understand that.

It's essentially a Hollywood dramedy revolving around the couple of individual lives including Dr. Henry Carter played oh so charismatically and sharply by Kevin Spacey with many other characters such as Jeremy an ongoing writer played by Mark Webber and Jemma an emotionally struggling teenager girl played by the very identifiable star Keke Palmer. Be aware though I watched this on T.V and was very close to passing this up due to it's notsoappealing 24 star rating on Dish but I really felt like I needed to see this at least once due to its interesting premise and after watching it I was proud to say to myself that it exceeded beyond any shortterm expectations I may have had for it at the moment. The most identifiable trait that really characterized it is that it may be just over an hourandahalf but it feels just over 2 hours most people would assume that's a bad thing and would immediately go on to bash it for its slow pace I prefer to call it STEADY pacing since the characterizations are done so right considering director Jonas Pate's very realistic and should I say very TRANQUIL style. You really hang on throughout this whole journey of a movie embracing what next step each of these people have to face in their lives and I couldn't help but feel satisfied by the end of the movie which is indeed the sure plus way of knowing it was a good movie wait change that a fantastic movie.".

You really hang on throughout this whole journey of a movie embracing what next step each of these people have to face in their lives and I couldn't help but feel satisfied by the end of the movie which is indeed the sure plus way of knowing it was a good movie wait change that a fantastic movie.";

The cast is strong but Kevin Spacey's character Dr. Henry Carter is still most elaborated and visible on screen however it is not among the best roles Spacey has performed. Moreover there are also good small supporting roles Robin Williams as Jack Holden Robert Loggia as Dr. Robert Carter Henry's father.I presume it is well accepted in the U.S. where seeing a shrink is almost a regular element of life and success.

He needs more help than they do. Even his father who is... yes you guessed it... a shrink can't seem to do much to help.The movie is set in L.A. and does a great job in reinforcing the picture that the rest of the world has about many people in L.A. especially those who are Hollywood connected who seem always to be wallowing in a mix of selfpity and helplessness and who are dependent on drugs and shrinks or should that be shrinks who are themselves dependent on something or somebody else?.I don't rate 'SHRINK'. Kevin does his very best to deliver weak lines and he must have been fed up that the director could only think to show how screwed up he was by making him either slump in a chair for hours endlessly puffing on cigarettes and marijuana or sitting for days in car with a low life drug pusher gaining buying both more drugs and homespun therapy. In fact the director struggles throughout to make something of this script and screen play. Probably because he is tasked with showing people having problems who really don't have any bigger problems than millions of others around the world in or outside L.A. Robin Williams appears in a cameo role as... well himself as far as I could tell. His appearance adds no weight to the movie whatsoever in fact the opposite and the producers should have saved his fees and given a less well known actor a chance. The feelgood ending is nothing more than a convenient way to finish. No. The director of SHRINK should not be too proud of himself. As a movie Shrink fails to deliver any meaningfull story or memorable experience. The only smiley aspect of the whole production was the movie producer character who is paranoid over cleanliness and calamity. That added a light humorous touch but it was not enough to redeem the director in general and he should never be forgiven for the unimaginative way he handled the 'kicking over the motorcycle' scene. Even my parrot knew that was coming.Shrink fails to convince the viewer that anyone in the story has such a serious problem that can't be solved by sipping a nice cup of tea and chatting with a sensible friend.Watch it but don't expect too much.".

Now is the time to cope and that is something that he just cannot deal with. Instead he goes into a downward spiral of self pity denial and drug use.Basically it is going to take a lot for Dr. Carter to see what he is doing to himself. What unfolds is a Crashlike web of interweaving stories that end up coming together in the end. There is the agent his taken for granted secretary the up and coming movie star the aging movie star the drug dealer the distracted and misguided teenager the young talented and undiscovered writer and of course the shrink. I might have even missed a character or two.This film means well. It has some good characters and a good direction of where it is going. The only problem is that it has too much going on. Films like Pulp Fiction and Crash have a lot of characters and subplots going on but the material is so rich and powerful that is can support big twists connections and revelations. This film just doesn't have enough umph to get off the ground.Spacey does a pretty decent job at portraying Dr. Carter. He is mostly deadpan and emotionless with the exception of a few revealing scenes. Other than that he doesn't show off too much of his skill just fulfills the role of his character. I was pleased with Robin Williams performance as the aging actor trying to find himself during a late midlife crisis.What would have made this film better would be to limit the number of stories going on following just a few or maybe even one. I think Spacey's conflict is enough to carry a film. It also would have given him more freedom to explore his character. There is a lot going on under the surface that we only get to see for a little while. I wanted more. I wanted something like in American Beauty where we get to see everything that the character has to offer. It's like watching the metamorphosis of a butterfly. Each stage is so defined and clearly labeled. Here we just see a few rises and falls and that's about it.It's a pretty run of the mill indie dramedy with a few laughs here a few tears there and nothing really outstanding going on otherwise. I wouldn't say avoid it but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. You will not need therapy after viewing this that's for sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film twice. Oddly enough each time i was able to pick up something else. Perhaps the most important thing that left a big imprint was closure and how it can be achieved sometimes with the help of others who are suffering and looking also for closure by themselves. The cloud of marijuana smoke can't numb the pain of the main character Hollywood shrink Henry Carter played by Kevin Spacey who is alone and living on top of the hills of LA rich and famous with the city at his feet but still a wounded man in search for closure after the death by suicide of his wife. Kevin Spacey with his face alone does an excellent job showing to the camera the progression of the emotional decay which Dr. Carter is experiencing.All this framed by a city LA and Hollywood with all the loneliness and empty feeling of their manicured lawns and beautiful houses.His network of friends are now patients and he's alone but without knowing that all his patients are in one way or another seeking for the same closure.Jemma Keke Palmer is experiencing the same emotional anger for the lost of her mother but instead seeking refuge in movie theaters and dreaming of one day be part of that world.Shamus Jack Huston perhaps channeling Colin Farrell the hot new Irish actor of action films is hurting because he wants to be taken seriously even if he doesn't know what that means.Jeremy Mark Webber the aspiring writer suffering from Writer's block in search for an idea and a new love.Kate Amberson Saffron Burrows realizing that is too old for Hollywood but still young to feel love again.Jack Holden Robin Williams in a rare cameo appearance portraying the aging macho actor in search for the last round at the sex game to prove that he still has it.And I left for last Dallas Roberts with his character of Patrick the movie agent with a compulsive disorder and a talent for hurting others people feelings. All that done in a incredible job with all the mannerisms and talk of Hollywood.As the films moves on you can see some of the same synergies showed in Good Will Hunting between shrink and patients but in this case is more concentrated on the side of the doctor the healer.All these characters come along and resolve their issues sometimes by themselves sometimes with the help of the each others and in the processthey achieve the most important objective to heal the healer Dr. Carter.This movie is a small gem with very good character description and excellent acting especially from Kevin Spacey and Dallas Roberts perhaps not as powerful and strong but it achieves what the director had in mind in a very subtle and consistent way. I agree with a comment expressed before Shrink is small in hype but big in quality.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this film twice. Oddly enough each time i was able to pick up something else. Perhaps the most important thing that left a big imprint was closure and how it can be achieved sometimes with the help of others who are suffering and looking also for closure by themselves. The cloud of marijuana smoke can't numb the pain of the main character Hollywood shrink Henry Carter played by Kevin Spacey who is alone and living on top of the hills of LA rich and famous with the city at his feet but still a wounded man in search for closure after the death by suicide of his wife. Kevin Spacey with his face alone does an excellent job showing to the camera the progression of the emotional decay which Dr. Carter is experiencing.All this framed by a city LA and Hollywood with all the loneliness and empty feeling of their manicured lawns and beautiful houses.His network of friends are now patients and he's alone but without knowing that all his patients are in one way or another seeking for the same closure.Jemma Keke Palmer is experiencing the same emotional anger for the lost of her mother but instead seeking refuge in movie theaters and dreaming of one day be part of that world.Shamus Jack Huston perhaps channeling Colin Farrell the hot new Irish actor of action films is hurting because he wants to be taken seriously even if he doesn't know what that means.Jeremy Mark Webber the aspiring writer suffering from Writer's block in search for an idea and a new love.Kate Amberson Saffron Burrows realizing that is too old for Hollywood but still young to feel love again.Jack Holden Robin Williams in a rare cameo appearance portraying the aging macho actor in search for the last round at the sex game to prove that he still has it.And I left for last Dallas Roberts with his character of Patrick the movie agent with a compulsive disorder and a talent for hurting others people feelings. All that done in a incredible job with all the mannerisms and talk of Hollywood.As the films moves on you can see some of the same synergies showed in Good Will Hunting between shrink and patients but in this case is more concentrated on the side of the doctor the healer.All these characters come along and resolve their issues sometimes by themselves sometimes with the help of the each others and in the processthey achieve the most important objective to heal the healer Dr. Carter.This movie is a small gem with very good character description and excellent acting especially from Kevin Spacey and Dallas Roberts perhaps not as powerful and strong but it achieves what the director had in mind in a very subtle and consistent way.

Kevin Spacey stars as Hollywood Psychiatrist Dr. Henry Carter who loves to smoke his shrinking marijuana joints and indulge in selfpity due to his wife's recent suicide. Dr. Carter is a psychiatrist to many Hollywood types including movie stars inspiring writers and narcissistic agents. A few of those fill in the intertwined supporting story lines of the movie which were nontherapeutic to the nonexistence viewing pleasure of Shrink. Thomas Moffett was definitely off it with his mindnumbing screenplay. Just 10 minutes into the movie I wanted to enlarge my DVD remote control's shrinky mute button to get to it faster so I would not have to hear more of the Shrink atrocious screenplay within the numerous story lines. I cannot fathom that the multitalented Kevin Spacey would be crazy enough to be a part of this unauthentic narrative. He did what he could in his starring role as Dr. Carter but I would have counseled Mr. Spacey to skip his acting session with this stinker of a movie. The supporting acting was in need of some thespian therapy and the only act it called for was an Actor Baker Act. However I must commend Dallas Roberts for his amusing performance as the selfindulged Hollywood agent Patrick. Patrick's session with Dr. Carter discussing his obsessive compulsive disorder was the only worthy scene of the movie. Director Jonas Pate's disorderly direction of Shrink was an exercise in inferiority this Jonas Brother hit all the low notes. All of this negativity is a shame because I was psyched about the premise of Shrink but after seeing the shambles of it all it should have been institutionalized in the scared straight to DVD department.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1989 in Medellin the prostitute and killer Rosario Tijeras Flora Martnez has an affair with the playboy Emilio Manolo Cardona and is introduced to his best friend Antonio Unax Ugalde in a nightclub. The relationship of Rosario with Emilio is limited to sex and she befriends Antonio who is in love with her. After the death of her brother Jonhefe Rodrigo Oviedo Rosario and Antonio become closer and she falls in love for him. But Rosario is chased by her enemies from the past.I had a great expectation for this movie based on the awards highlighted on the cover of the DVD but after watching it it became a huge disappointment. The plot has a promising beginning mostly because of the erotic scenes with the sexy Flora Martnez and her naked body. Her mysterious character is intriguing in the beginning. However the dull story goes nowhere and I had trouble to write a summary since nothing happens but a silly triangle of love in the landscape of the underworld of Medellin in a messy soapopera. The characters are awfully developed for example Rosario Tijeras is one of the most ambiguous characters I have ever seen. Is she an expensive prostitute and a killer and also a drugdealer or what? Where is her money charging large amounts for sex and murders? She seems to be a powerful and cold woman in the beginning but she is disclosed extremely fragile like a housewife along the story. Is the upperclass Emilio just a playboy? And who is Antonio? Why are these guys connected to the underworld of drugs? The celebration with the dead body of Jonhefe is funny but totally out of the context. The dinner at Emilio's home is another terrible moment of this forgettable flick. My vote is five.Title Brazil Rosario Tijeras".

	onyx:emotionText "In 1989 in Medellin the prostitute and killer Rosario Tijeras Flora Martnez has an affair with the playboy Emilio Manolo Cardona and is introduced to his best friend Antonio Unax Ugalde in a nightclub. The relationship of Rosario with Emilio is limited to sex and she befriends Antonio who is in love with her. After the death of her brother Jonhefe Rodrigo Oviedo Rosario and Antonio become closer and she falls in love for him. But Rosario is chased by her enemies from the past.I had a great expectation for this movie based on the awards highlighted on the cover of the DVD but after watching it it became a huge disappointment. The plot has a promising beginning mostly because of the erotic scenes with the sexy Flora Martnez and her naked body. Her mysterious character is intriguing in the beginning. However the dull story goes nowhere and I had trouble to write a summary since nothing happens but a silly triangle of love in the landscape of the underworld of Medellin in a messy soapopera. The characters are awfully developed for example Rosario Tijeras is one of the most ambiguous characters I have ever seen. Is she an expensive prostitute and a killer and also a drugdealer or what? Where is her money charging large amounts for sex and murders? She seems to be a powerful and cold woman in the beginning but she is disclosed extremely fragile like a housewife along the story.

The character is so raw so corrupted but they demonstrate the beauty that can come from someone who's lived in her own hell. My family is originally from Colombia so I understand the situations well. I saw a comment on a message board here saying that she wasn't a convincing hitman...obviously you aren't familiar with the situations in Colombia I've known of many female hit men that were beautiful...they just grew up in the wrong neighborhoods. Beauty isn't only found in the highclass society...it's everywhere and if anything her beauty gives her even more power. The fact that the movie goes back and forth always returning the beginning of everything and relating it to the end keeps you in tuned its clever that the director chose not to point out the changes in time throughout the film...it keeps it flowing...no interruptions from the world that this movie has sucked you in. The main character has such a beautiful pain within her you come out of the theater in love with her...whether you're are a man or woman..she'll dazzle you. The actors in this movie did an incredible job as well.Overall this movie mixes the drama of life and laughs at it at some points. You're guaranteed to cry laugh gasp claw your nails in your seat...and come out replaying all the scenes in your head.".

	schema:reviewBody "In MHO this is probably the best film shot in Colombia to date. This film excels primarily due to the electrifying performance of the Colombian actress Flora Martinez in the role of Rosario Tijeras a young and dangerous girl that works as a hitwoman to the Medellin drug cartel in the late 1980's. Not only does the beautiful and talented Ms. Martinez realistically portraits the tormented girl that always gives a kiss before shooting to death his victims but the rest of the cast gives a highly convincing performance. I didn't blink seeing the picture and neither will you....Spanish actor Unax Ugalde gives an excellent performance as Antonio the only pure soul to come close to the starcrossed Rosario. Some failings in pronouncing the local 'paisa' accent of Medellin IMHO doesn't in any way diminish his convincing performance.Colombian actor Manolo Cardona acting as Rosario's boyfriend Emilio did also a very powerful performance although he doesn't reach his costars levels. Equally convincing are the performances of Mexican actor Rodrigo Oviedo as the hitman Johnefe Rosario's brother and of Colombian actor Alonso Arias as the dangerous Rosario's former boyfriend Ferney.The Mexican director Emilio Maill did a very good job in this his first full length feature film. Congratulations! The Marcelo Figueras's adapted script from the original novel by Jorge Franco maintains all the elements of this tale which will become part of Latin America's mythology. In my opinion the Figueras's script clears some blind spots of the bookFilmed on location in Medellin including the old living quarters of the henchmen of the Medellin drug cartel this MexicanAmericanColombian production never looses pace in a frantic and crude vertigo of sex drugs tragedy and violence.Don't miss it!".

	schema:headline " Rosario Tijeras";
	schema:reviewBody "Very good film. After it to have seen 4 times I believe that I can give a commentary on the matter. Film based on the work ROSARIO TIJERAS of Jorge Franco. A woman of low class in Medelln  Colombia in 1989 tells the history of Rosario in the heat of apogee of Pablo Escobar. Rosario is a young woman who has had many traumas in her childhood and all that influence of its JhonF brother and his circulate social Communes of Medellin a sector of Medelln of invasion in which there is much violence takes them very noticeable in her. Rosario is killer aggressive dominant and has had many men but at the same time she is sentimental and tender with whom it wants. On the other hand Antonio and Emilio are inseparable friends of high class who know themselves from children. The ideology of Antonio front to the love is seen very noticeable then it has the ideal of a perfect love that transfers the barriers until contemplating to give the life by Rosario. Antonio is timid sentimental and a little introvert. In spite of being paisa and to be influenced by a cultural current Machista Antonio is all the opposite.Emilio is a little dominant is brave dangerous and most of the time he has luck. Also he is very mujeriegohe had so much women until Rosario arrives that returns it totally crazy. All become crazy by Rosario. These different personalities Intercross in a fascinating history of action drama love pain and death.OPINIONThis film is spectacular. The way in which they worked in the details surprised to me. Details like the color of the nails the earrings with letter R of Rosario the clocks the light the necklaces the handle of leather that always took Rosario in its left arm to cover its scars the Cdulasdocument of identity old the dollar in which Emilio took the drug the oration that said JhonF before going to make its work the makeup the motorcycle old in which Emilio and Rosario went to speed the aquarium in the Bar the hour of the clock in the hospital music the atmosphere the representation of San GregorioDoctor Sant etc. And the subjects work them of excellent way like for example the naked ones the religion in relation to the killers the social classes the murder the pain and the violation was impeccable the representation with the fried egg. I believe that no other actress had served for this paper like Flora Martinez did it. That is worth the trouble to see Colombian cinema although in fact it has really been ColombianMexican production.COMPARISON BOOKMOVIEThe film definitively has many differences with respect to the book in spite of being based on this.1 In the film JhonF gave a necklace to him to Antonio. And Antonio gave it to Rosario before they buried to JhonF. By the opposite in the book it does after they bury it.2 In the film Ferney killed Rosario. On the other hand in the Ferney book it died before Rosario.3 In the film Rosario it has the white skin. In contradiction in the book to her they describe of skin cinnamon to it.4 In the book JhonF orders to Antonio that takes care of of Rosario and soon it kisses it on the mouth. Whereas in the film they omit the kiss.5 In the film it spent almost 1 year so that Rosario and Antonio will be refind again themselves. On the other hand in the book they happened more than 3 years.6 In the film Antonio knew where it was left the house of Doa Ruby because it was accompanying to Rosario when JhonF died whereas in the book nobody knew where Doa Ruby lived.7 In the film the hour of the clock is 330 and in book 430.  It could continue with many more comparisons but there is no sufficient space.CLOTHESThe clothes do not fit with the time. Then in 1989 still they were not used Jeans Descaderados and Rosario uses many of these.PUBLICITYWithin the film there is very violent publicity of the beer Pilsen appears in two takings 1 When JhonF goes in motorcycles it appears a truck that takes the logo of Pilsen. 2 When Antonio arrives at a house to the outskirts where this being left Rosario it takes in the hand a box of the same beer. Also it is possible to be said that that beer did not exist at the time at which history is developed. Publicity to COLOMBIANA soda water can be observed in addition that by the certain thing I am very well because the package is old.FILLINGS And INTERFERENCESDefinitively I leave much to be desired the paper of Catalina Aristizabal Creta then she was the annoying friend of Emilio. CONCLUSIONThe film ROSARIO TIJERAS is very good I recommend them. I recommend to them that if they are going it to see read the first book or the contrary. As for me hardly that leaves the original DVD I will buy it. ANNOTATIONS Paisa person of the interior of Colombia that is located from Antioquia to the Eje Cafeterosector of Colombia. Machista masculine current that tries to demonstrate the power of the man on the woman. Mujeriego that it has many women.BY JORGE BARROS EMAIL jorba60hotmail.".

In my opinion Unax Ugalde did a very good acting job but then again I didn't notice his poor paisa accent. The first part really was excellent. I loved the way the movie jumped back and forward in time which added greatly to the suspension. It's a pity that the movie seemed to loose some of its direction in the second half. Still a memorable picture and hopefully it'll get the international distribution it deserves. Does anybody know if there's a release planned in Europe or elsewhere?".

	schema:reviewBody "I knew close to nothing about the movie when I decided to see it so I didn't have any particular expectations. Thank God because the disappointment was easier to bear.Let's start with the most important aspect the story. It's a drama. A true drama that anyone can create something so dull and uninspiring. What we get is a beautiful girl from a rough neighborhood who earns her living as a prostitute and a killer. Wow! What a mix! I believe that was supposed to make the protagonist more ambiguous. The only person that cares about Rosario and Rosario cares about is her brother. They share an apartment and he occasionally acts as her pimp. Cute. This unconventional young woman attracts the attention of two upperclass boys. Will their friendship survive this test? Will Rosario find happiness with either of them? You get the idea right? Basically Marcelo Figueras feeds us with an indigestible soap opera spiced up with some coke booze nudity and a few more or less random killings. The biggest problem is that it's a love story and it's hard to find a love story interesting when you totally don't care about the characters.With such a pathetic material the rest of the crew couldn't do much to turn the flick into something watchable. So they didn't try. The directing is very uneven with some pretty good scenes as well as the whole funeral sequence which unintentionally turned out quite funny and the dinner at Emilio's house which was just unbearably bad.The editing comes on par with the screenplay. The transition between the sequences is so smooth as a sand paper. Maybe that was supposed to give the movie a more documentary feeling but it just made it still harder to watch.Now the acting. The miserably boring story was a challenge that no actor could have come up to. Noone could have played those characters in a way that would appeal to the audience. Even the greatest artist had to fail in this particular case.To sum up the main reason for the review is to help me release the unendurable frustration caused by watching Rosario Tijeras. I was very angry with myself for spending time and money on the flick and I really had to do something about it. Unless you're a hard core fan of the book maybe it's good I don't know I didn't read it or an upperclass young man with a crush on a murderous prostitute stay away from the movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was watching this movie the other day... A friend of mine gave it to me from a screening of this movie that took place in Colombia... and I gotta say.. its quite a packer!!!! It tells the story of a woman who kills for hire.... Rosario Tijeras. Rosario Tijeras is a story of the world of assassins life in Colombia love and lust. Rosario is an assassin... she is surrounded by lust and when she meets a guy thats different from all that have been in her life she falls in love with him... but she is too deep into the dirty underworld and it might just be too late for her... What I like about this movie its that sometimes its funny in anoverdramatized funny macabre kind of way. For example when Rosario's brother gets killed they throw a party forwith him.... his corpse anyway...... go rolling with him even take him to have a lap dance..... but thats the life he lead and so thats his friends way to pay respect to their fallen friend. Overall this is a good movie to watch if you like actiondrama movies...... kinda reminds me of City of God... the way the story was told thru flashbacks... although in City of God the flashbacks were over many years and in Rosatio Tijeras its meer months in between...... and also City Of God is way better than this one. Take nothing away from this one... the director did a good job in this movie although it sometimes can be a little confusing its one of the better Spanish movies that have come out in some time... a good Latin movie to indulge in!!! I give it an 8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't read to book so I'm just reviewing this movie as its own independent piece.The story is not told in a linear fashion instead it moves back and forth between several episodes and sometimes it is not clear when something took place.We first see a guy bringing a bloody girl to a hospital his shirt is also drenched in blood. Then we are taken to earlier times when some playboy guy Emilio who gets all the girls walks into a club and meets up with his buddy Antonio who's the nice guy and doesn't get any. While trying to avoid the chicks after him Emilio spots a girl Rosario dancing seductively on the floor. She then disappears upstairs in the VIP section. Emilio makes it his goal to get her. At some other time he sees her again and dances with her and they hook up so to speak. And then some strange role reversal takes place. He doesn't just want sex with her he wants to know her. She in turn is interested only is casual sex with him and tells him that it's better for him to know nothing about her. He think they are somewhat of a couple she doesn't.It all seems simple so far she's a drugusing escortprostitute and guy falls for her and wants her to himself. Then there's a shooting in the club and she drags him out. Later we rewind and see how the shooting happened and why. She shot some low class guy because she wanted respect. So there's more to this girl than we thought. She is from the lower socioeconomical classes but her activities at the club allow her to move up. Emilio on the other hand is upper class and he takes her to meet his snobby family and that ends up pretty bad.So far so good. Then or rather earlier in the story we meet some of the people Rosario hangs out with who are sicarios killers thugs who kept the city of Medellin on the edge in the past and who often did driveby shootings. In this case this fellow who is related to Rosario apparently a brother of hers commits a motorcycle driveby. At some point later he gets himself shot and the familyfriends mourns him like some saint. In what is the most surprising original and bizarrely funny part of the movie Rosario wants him to go out with a bang. They drag the corpse to a club giving it booze and have it get a full nude lapdance. Eventually they bury the casket Mariachi music shots fired and all. Why this is so important in the movie is not clear. We don't know much about her family other than an early hint at her perhaps being the victim of abuse by her father? Far later in the movie she confront her mother about that.From here things go downhill. Her relationship with Emilio completely fades into the background. She gets closer to Antonio as her life spirals out of control in violence. At the mass for the death of her brother's killer she shows up and fills the corpse with bullets. She kills some judge  lover who was protecting her and as result ends up hiding in a country farm with Antonio.Eventually the police grab her. Once she's out of jail she makes arrangements to meet Antonio at the club. But some thug gets to her first. And now we are back at the beginning and know how she got shot.I'm not convinced the back and forth between the present and various pasts worked out so well. In fact I'm not sure there's much of a story here. No doubt movies with far less script have been made. It's just that what is missing here is something to keep the audience interested or someone for the audience to care for. The climax is the story is lost in the time shuffle. I think the fact that she's a violent criminal while appearing as a high class whore would have made for a more effective twist in the movie. Why the whole story line with Emilio? He becomes irrelevant rather quickly.The movie is long and rather depressing and surprisingly unfunny for a Colombian movie. There is no colorful funny character even though we are dealing here with a couple of streetwise characters. Rosario's brother could have been such a character but he gets most screen time once he's dead and is not likable while alive. Rosario too during her good times is somewhat on the depressed side except when she's on some chainsmoking powertrip. Perhaps she imagines that there are few ways out of her life.Technically this movie is excellent the sound the cinematography it's all first rate work. I just think that the director's vision for the story didn't work. Perhaps that's how the book is as well. In any case there was material here to work it into a good action drama movie with a twist. But instead we have an ambitious movie with a story that is butchered by the nonlinear telling with a whole lot of dull characters.".

While trying to avoid the chicks after him Emilio spots a girl Rosario dancing seductively on the floor. She then disappears upstairs in the VIP section. Emilio makes it his goal to get her. At some other time he sees her again and dances with her and they hook up so to speak. And then some strange role reversal takes place. He doesn't just want sex with her he wants to know her. She in turn is interested only is casual sex with him and tells him that it's better for him to know nothing about her. He think they are somewhat of a couple she doesn't.It all seems simple so far she's a drugusing escortprostitute and guy falls for her and wants her to himself. Then there's a shooting in the club and she drags him out. Later we rewind and see how the shooting happened and why. She shot some low class guy because she wanted respect. So there's more to this girl than we thought. She is from the lower socioeconomical classes but her activities at the club allow her to move up. Emilio on the other hand is upper class and he takes her to meet his snobby family and that ends up pretty bad.So far so good. Then or rather earlier in the story we meet some of the people Rosario hangs out with who are sicarios killers thugs who kept the city of Medellin on the edge in the past and who often did driveby shootings. In this case this fellow who is related to Rosario apparently a brother of hers commits a motorcycle driveby. At some point later he gets himself shot and the familyfriends mourns him like some saint. In what is the most surprising original and bizarrely funny part of the movie Rosario wants him to go out with a bang. They drag the corpse to a club giving it booze and have it get a full nude lapdance. Eventually they bury the casket Mariachi music shots fired and all. Why this is so important in the movie is not clear. We don't know much about her family other than an early hint at her perhaps being the victim of abuse by her father? Far later in the movie she confront her mother about that.From here things go downhill. Her relationship with Emilio completely fades into the background. She gets closer to Antonio as her life spirals out of control in violence. At the mass for the death of her brother's killer she shows up and fills the corpse with bullets. She kills some judge  lover who was protecting her and as result ends up hiding in a country farm with Antonio.Eventually the police grab her. Once she's out of jail she makes arrangements to meet Antonio at the club. But some thug gets to her first. And now we are back at the beginning and know how she got shot.I'm not convinced the back and forth between the present and various pasts worked out so well. In fact I'm not sure there's much of a story here. No doubt movies with far less script have been made. It's just that what is missing here is something to keep the audience interested or someone for the audience to care for. The climax is the story is lost in the time shuffle. I think the fact that she's a violent criminal while appearing as a high class whore would have made for a more effective twist in the movie. Why the whole story line with Emilio? He becomes irrelevant rather quickly.The movie is long and rather depressing and surprisingly unfunny for a Colombian movie. There is no colorful funny character even though we are dealing here with a couple of streetwise characters. Rosario's brother could have been such a character but he gets most screen time once he's dead and is not likable while alive. Rosario too during her good times is somewhat on the depressed side except when she's on some chainsmoking powertrip. Perhaps she imagines that there are few ways out of her life.Technically this movie is excellent the sound the cinematography it's all first rate work. I just think that the director's vision for the story didn't work. Perhaps that's how the book is as well. In any case there was material here to work it into a good action drama movie with a twist. But instead we have an ambitious movie with a story that is butchered by the nonlinear telling with a whole lot of dull characters.";

I suspect there's been a lot of men who aren't into these types of movies that have been forced to watch it with their girlfriends and have then given it low ratings because it definitely leans towards being more of a soppy romantic comedy than a gritty one.It's definitely not a 'fairytale soppy romantic' movie by any means. I would class it as having a realistic amount of soppyness which is what makes it good. The main cast are pretty diverse in their personalities so most people will be able to relate to someone in the movie but even if you can't it's got enough comedyfun in it to keep you entertained.I think racially this movie is fantastic and it makes a lot of very positive statements. We have a mostly black cast with a very middle class FriendsTV series'ish feel to them with 2 white guys in the group 1 of whom has a black girlfriend. There's a couple of light racially inspired jokes at the expense of one of the white guys in the group which further emphasises that race just isn't and shouldn't be a serious issue in the group.It's really nice to see a movie like this with a nice intelligent middleclass group of African Americans. Too many movies focus on the gangster element of African American culture these days so I think this is a really positive and refreshing movie.I definitely recommend it to everyone except those who are put off by a bit of soppy romance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am sure that a lot of folks will think that this is a film to plug Steve Harvey's book but trust me when I say that the book does not need plugging since it made the best seller list just wanted to get that off my chest. This is one of those films that I am going to have to watch again because the audience was laughing so loud and long that I fear I missed some of the jokes. That being said .. Kevin Hart Cedric is a fool in a good way. He had me and the rest of the audience cracking up. His comic timing and expressions are priceless. The relationship between Dominic Michael Ealy and Lauren Taraji P Henson was probably the most honest compared to the others. I like the reference that they made to For Colored Girls classic. I have always considered Michael Ealy to be very sexy and he did not disappoint in this film Yum. Michael Terrance Jenkins was a true mama's boy almost to the point of being sickening but Candace Regina Hall did what she had to do to rectify that situation. The longtime relationship between Jeremy Jerry Ferrara and Kristen Gabrielle Union is one that a lot of couples will be able to relate to. Finally Zeke Romany Malco. What can I say there are a bunch of you out there and I am glad that Mya Meagan Good stuck to her guns. The only negative thing that I would say about the film is that I am not sure that Alex Chris Brown needed to keep popping in on the scenes. It was kind of redundant since the film already had a playa. Wendy Williams Gail and Sherri Shephard Vicki had small roles in the film but it was good to see the talk show hosts represent. I think that a lot of people may see this film as a chick flick but I like to think of it as a great date movie. I think that the implied war of the sexes will appeal to all and if nothing else Kevin Hart will keep you in stitches. This film is well worth the price of a ticket. Put down the book and get out and see this film because this will be the one that they will be talking about next to the water cooler on Monday. I am giving this film a green light.".

Kevin Hart Cedric is a fool in a good way. He had me and the rest of the audience cracking up. His comic timing and expressions are priceless. The relationship between Dominic Michael Ealy and Lauren Taraji P Henson was probably the most honest compared to the others. I like the reference that they made to For Colored Girls classic. I have always considered Michael Ealy to be very sexy and he did not disappoint in this film Yum. Michael Terrance Jenkins was a true mama's boy almost to the point of being sickening but Candace Regina Hall did what she had to do to rectify that situation. The longtime relationship between Jeremy Jerry Ferrara and Kristen Gabrielle Union is one that a lot of couples will be able to relate to. Finally Zeke Romany Malco. What can I say there are a bunch of you out there and I am glad that Mya Meagan Good stuck to her guns. The only negative thing that I would say about the film is that I am not sure that Alex Chris Brown needed to keep popping in on the scenes. It was kind of redundant since the film already had a playa. Wendy Williams Gail and Sherri Shephard Vicki had small roles in the film but it was good to see the talk show hosts represent. I think that a lot of people may see this film as a chick flick but I like to think of it as a great date movie. I think that the implied war of the sexes will appeal to all and if nothing else Kevin Hart will keep you in stitches. This film is well worth the price of a ticket. Put down the book and get out and see this film because this will be the one that they will be talking about next to the water cooler on Monday. I am giving this film a green light.";

Being based on a selfhelp book this screenplay was crammed with nothing but onthenose dialogue that left me bored and fidgety for the most part. Outside of Kevin Hart there wasn't a single thing funny about this film. Okay maybe once or twice I laughed but one time it was at something I don't think was meant to be funny actor Romany Malco singing with his guitar. You can't call a film a comedy where only one character was remotely or should I say barely humorous. I found more humor in dramas like American Beauty City Lights and The Graduate.This film seemed to just flatline from beginning to end. When I say flat I mean literally flat. Nothing happened until the guymeetsgirl moments and that took a while to get to. Once the relationships started the weak conflicts seemed to be limited to the superficiality of Steve Harvey's best selling book. No inner conflicts not even conflict on the extrapersonal level.I could've done without most of the characters which can read like a list of players on a football team. They had no purpose and added nothing to the telling like the married guy amongst them Bennett played by Gary Owen. I know a lot of people loved this film. But can anyone seriously say they got to know any of the characters? Also I had a hard time buying most of the relationships. The worst of them all had to be Jerry Ferrara with Gabrielle Union. It was like having to suspend your disbelief watching them together and that didn't even work for me. I didn't believe they even knew each let alone them being in a 13 year relationship. At a glance I would faster believe Union was Ferrara's babysitter or nanny not her man. It was one big spoof to me.The next absurd relationship was Regina Hall and the guy from 106 and Park Terrence Jenkins. I didn't believe he and Hall went to high school at the same time. In fact she could've passed for his mother as well.Taraji Henson's relationship with Michael Ealy was also hard to stomach as I had trouble believing a woman with her success in business wouldn't question Ealy's facade.I liked the relationship between Meagan Good and Romany Malco but it was so contrived like everything else about this film.And the next black film made showing black friends discussing their relationships while trying to play basketball should have littletree car refresheners hanging from theater ceilings for the sake of audiences. Why? Because such expository scenes are a load of steaming crap. Guys don't stand around on the court discussing such things or play ball while having those kinds of conversations. I know they did it in The Brothers 2001 and it was b.s. then as it still is now.The telling had no direction no pointofview. It could've been anyone or anything's story at any given time which left me confused and disengaged. I was waiting for the fire hydrant's storyline eventually.I really wanted to like it but I couldn't. In the end I was dissatisfied and utterly annoyed.".

There are plenty of cameos that make the film fun but Kevin Hart deserves special recognition because he absolutely shines! He redefines the term scene stealer by being the most enjoyable character every time he appears on screen. Although many people will consider this a Black romantic comedy this film is really too strong to be pigeonholed into that genre.

I will go a step further and say it's a big ol' thataboy from Steve to himself. Gag me now.The plot is nonexistent. The movie is just an array of vignettes that sloppily intersect and form silly lessons from the great one Harvey about relationships. The characters are just there.

The list goes on of things that make this movie forgettable.Howeverthere are small but significant peeps of light through the otherwise dark cloud that is this ode to Harvey. The allstar cast tries really hard and sometimes succeeds at making this horrible script entertaining. I will highlight Michael Ealy's character as a ray of sunshine. The combination of his looks including those piercing eyes and his acting chops make his character appealing and dreamy despite his being mismatched with the olderlooking Taraji Henson. Gabrielle Union does a decent job with her character and she and her beau have the most interesting believable story line of the movie. The numerous cameos would be kind of cute if they didn't leave you with the impression that their inclusion is just yet another way for the great one to show he is somebody and that he knows people. I digress as I find myself getting back to the negative even in the paragraph I had reserved to show the few positives of the movie.Bottom line this is an egodriven I love myself fest of Steve Harvey. I am wholly disappointed in the Rainforest crew who produced it as I thought they would have grown more in their moviemaking than they have apparently. They are still putting out lowbudget poorlyconstructed films. It seems the only difference is that they are getting paid more now to do so. It's a shame.

	schema:headline " The date night from hell";
	schema:reviewBody "In 2009 entertainer game show host and radio personality Steve Harvey released a book called Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man What Men Really Think About Love Relationships Intimacy and Commitment and after plugging it on The Oprah Winfrey Show it quickly climbed to the top of the bestseller's lists and soared in popularity with women everywhere. This sudden surge in demand for a book exposing men for what they really are led Harvey to create a followup novel called Straight Talk No Chaser How to Find Keep and Understand a Man but considering how this film became a surprising box office success it wouldn't surprise me if we'll be talking about that film in a matter of time.In my above sentence I put the word exposing in quotations because I am unable to fathom why Harvey's selfhelp book has gained so much notoriety amongst single women. It seems everything that is discussed in the film about men wanting sex wanting a looser relationship and wanting less constraints in a commitment is something most people knew before this book surfaced. Did someone just need to print them and spell them out for people? Did it really need to ostracize men as the soul source of many relationship problems and continue to feed the idea that all men are cut from the same cloth? I'm not sure but as a film motivated to take the idea of a selfhelp book and incorporate its ideology into a film counterpart it's labored and shockingly uninteresting for the most part.The film follows the lives of several couples whose relationships are failing because of course it's the males efforts or lack thereof that are soiling the chemistry and the recipe for success. We have Dominic Michael Ealy a capable but unmotivated soul a trait that his new business executive girlfriend Lauren Taraji P. Henson can definitely change. Michael Terrence J a man so attached to his mother that the girlfriend becomes the second priority. His high school crush Candace Regina Hall a single mom as well whom he recently reconnects with feels that in order to make a relationship work she'll need to fix this. Jeremy Jerry Ferrara is dating Kristen Gabrielle Union who is upset because he is reluctant to pop the question and is very fearful of committing to anything. And who could forget Zeke's Romany Malco dilemma? His girlfriend Mya Meagan Good puts him on a love lockdown meaning that since he is known as a player and a complete and total ladies man that he will be prohibited from sex until ninety days of knowing each other.It's also an obligation that these pals have a wiseass best friend who in this case is Kevin Hart's Cedric recently divorced and frequents many strip clubs. He's definitely the most interesting character here but look at his competition. Uninteresting males accompanied by equally uninteresting females in a contrived plot serving as extended product placement for a surprise bestseller. Put that on the back of the DVD.So it takes the men a little while to piece together why their girlfriends have become vindictive and overcompensating and soon they realize they have unwillingly become victims to their new passingphase which is the selfhelp novel. They decide to read it and use Harvey's ideology against the women as a defense tactic for themselves. Color me not surprised but heartbroken. Two wrongs don't make a right and this is where contrivance triumphs logic reason and humanity.Think Like a Man is also plagued with the most hopelessly unbelievable setup of the year so far. Even more asinine than our sixteenth president being a cold blooded vampire hunter. As we watch this film we see women who appear to be compassionate understanding and for the most part goodnatured. One impossibly tries to grasp the idea that these women would become gridlocked to the rules of the genius of Steve Harvey that they'd begin to live their life by his advice and tips. One finds it almost shiveringly absurd that an independent freethinking individual would not realize that these ideas of men being motivated by sex and ego along with requesting the loosest possible rules by women have existed for the past hundred years and will probably lurk around for another hundred years.

	onyx:emotionText "In 2009 entertainer game show host and radio personality Steve Harvey released a book called Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man What Men Really Think About Love Relationships Intimacy and Commitment and after plugging it on The Oprah Winfrey Show it quickly climbed to the top of the bestseller's lists and soared in popularity with women everywhere. This sudden surge in demand for a book exposing men for what they really are led Harvey to create a followup novel called Straight Talk No Chaser How to Find Keep and Understand a Man but considering how this film became a surprising box office success it wouldn't surprise me if we'll be talking about that film in a matter of time.In my above sentence I put the word exposing in quotations because I am unable to fathom why Harvey's selfhelp book has gained so much notoriety amongst single women. It seems everything that is discussed in the film about men wanting sex wanting a looser relationship and wanting less constraints in a commitment is something most people knew before this book surfaced. Did someone just need to print them and spell them out for people? Did it really need to ostracize men as the soul source of many relationship problems and continue to feed the idea that all men are cut from the same cloth? I'm not sure but as a film motivated to take the idea of a selfhelp book and incorporate its ideology into a film counterpart it's labored and shockingly uninteresting for the most part.The film follows the lives of several couples whose relationships are failing because of course it's the males efforts or lack thereof that are soiling the chemistry and the recipe for success. We have Dominic Michael Ealy a capable but unmotivated soul a trait that his new business executive girlfriend Lauren Taraji P. Henson can definitely change. Michael Terrence J a man so attached to his mother that the girlfriend becomes the second priority. His high school crush Candace Regina Hall a single mom as well whom he recently reconnects with feels that in order to make a relationship work she'll need to fix this. Jeremy Jerry Ferrara is dating Kristen Gabrielle Union who is upset because he is reluctant to pop the question and is very fearful of committing to anything. And who could forget Zeke's Romany Malco dilemma? His girlfriend Mya Meagan Good puts him on a love lockdown meaning that since he is known as a player and a complete and total ladies man that he will be prohibited from sex until ninety days of knowing each other.It's also an obligation that these pals have a wiseass best friend who in this case is Kevin Hart's Cedric recently divorced and frequents many strip clubs. He's definitely the most interesting character here but look at his competition. Uninteresting males accompanied by equally uninteresting females in a contrived plot serving as extended product placement for a surprise bestseller. Put that on the back of the DVD.So it takes the men a little while to piece together why their girlfriends have become vindictive and overcompensating and soon they realize they have unwillingly become victims to their new passingphase which is the selfhelp novel. They decide to read it and use Harvey's ideology against the women as a defense tactic for themselves. Color me not surprised but heartbroken. Two wrongs don't make a right and this is where contrivance triumphs logic reason and humanity.Think Like a Man is also plagued with the most hopelessly unbelievable setup of the year so far. Even more asinine than our sixteenth president being a cold blooded vampire hunter. As we watch this film we see women who appear to be compassionate understanding and for the most part goodnatured. One impossibly tries to grasp the idea that these women would become gridlocked to the rules of the genius of Steve Harvey that they'd begin to live their life by his advice and tips. One finds it almost shiveringly absurd that an independent freethinking individual would not realize that these ideas of men being motivated by sex and ego along with requesting the loosest possible rules by women have existed for the past hundred years and will probably lurk around for another hundred years. I hate to say this but the film stereotypes men into careless unfeeling slobs and doesn't leave much redemption for the women. C'mon this is sitcom stuff.Think Like a Man was written by Keith Merryman and David A.

	schema:reviewBody "Talk about overkill. With more than two hours of screen time this  drama looks like it has the potential to buck the Hollywood trend of  stuffing too much into a short film. The problem is they follow the  relationships of six friendsfrom both sides. Trying to show more than  ten angles in two hours is simply impossible. Still they try. In the  end this movie turns into a mess of dialogue that wouldn't have been  good even if the storyline was worth it and it most defiantly wasn't.  When you base the entirety of a movie off of stereotypes the movie  should be a comedy. In a drama stereotypical characters are far too  flat for the audience to care about. In the beginning of Think Like A  Man each character is labeled according to how they would be in  described in the book. There's The Player Mama's Boy and much  much more. Since there are so many characters on screen you never get  any more depth to these characters. By the end of the movie you will  find yourself hoping that they all end up alone so that movie ends  faster.  I honestly want to see how long the script is for Think Like a Man. The  characters never stop talkingand often talk fast and over each other  in order to fit everything in. This might be okay if the screenwriter  we decent. Unfortunately they were nowhere near. I cringed multiple  times and found myself in awe that anyone truly believed certain lines  would ever actually be uttered by a sane human being. How any of these  actors looked at the script and thought it was a good idea is beyond  me.  This movie is also sellout. Not only is it terrible but the product  placement goes overboard. The men meet in a bar constantly and are  always drinking Dos Equis. When they are on the basketball court they  always wear Air Jordan's They even talk about Air Jordan a couple  times as well. They reference a couple Tyler Perry movies for no  apparent reason. How do they expect us to care about a movie when it  feels like a commercial?  Don't see this movie. Please. I laughed oncekind of. The dialogue is  bad. The acting is lackluster. Even the idea is terrible. Every few  scenes they cut to the author of Act Like A Lady Think Like A Man so  that he can give advice to the women. Every time this happened I found  myself looking around the theatresimply wondering if anyone else  realized that this was a horrible idea. I hope they did. This goes down  as one of the worst movies of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "So far as I can tell the intended purpose of Steve Harvey's book Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man was to give women relationship advice from a male perspective which in turn would help them find the right man. While I have no opinion on his words of wisdom I do have a thing or two to say about Think Like a Man a film that injects Harvey's book into the plot of a romantic comedy. Silly and uninspired it doesn't analyze his concepts in plausible satisfying ways instead it applies them to manufactured vignettes in which the men are immature brats and the women are conniving and manipulative. There is no truth to any of the characters in this movie. They serve primarily as comedy relief goofballs we're made to laugh at instead of with.Taking place in Los Angeles the film is essentially a series of interconnected subplots all examining relationships between specific categories of men and women. Steve Harvey makes continuous appearances on television screens in homes and bars with the specific purpose of promoting his book the women intrigued all decide to buy a copy and apply whatever advice they glean to the men in their lives. At first the men are thrown for a loop. Then one of them catches wind of what their women are doing leading them to buy the book and attempt to beat them at their own game. And so we must wade through an implausible and childish battle of wits before reaching a conclusion so neatly giftwrapped that it seems to have transplanted from a thirdrate sitcom.Here's a rundown of the couples featured in this film. There's a realestate agent named Kristen Gabrielle Union and her boyfriend Jeremy Jerry Ferrara who still hasn't popped the question after nine years of being with her. Not only is she eager to motivate him apply for a job he's qualified for she also wants him to stash his collection of scifi memorabilia so that she can redecorate to her heart's content. This would include getting rid of his couch which has a colorful history to say the least. There's Mya Meagan Good who's fed up with onenight stands and decides to try out Harvey's ninetyday plan on her new boyfriend Zeke Romany Malco. This will not be easy for him a smooth talker who knows all the good pickup lines he's an unapologetic lothario with nothing on his mind apart from sex.There's a caterer named Dominic Michael Ealy who's known for his lofty dreams. His current dream is to be a chef and indeed he has a talent for cooking. Into his life enters Lauren Taraji P. Henson a powerful executive who wants a man with a sixfigure income and his own sense of power. Desperate to impress her Dominic tells her that he already is a chef and is deciding between two restaurant offers. And then there's Candace Regina Hall a single mom and Lauren's best friend. She starts dating a man named Michael Terrence J who's domineered by his mother Jenifer Lewis. Needless to say no woman is good enough for her son least of all a single mother. Incidentally Candace's son while perhaps a little too inquisitive gets along splendidly with Michael.Serving as both narrator and the annoying fifth guy character is Cedric Kevin Hart who spends most of the film acting like a fool and mooching off of Zeke. He's in the process of finalizing his divorce from his mostly unseen wife and claims to be all the better for it. All five guys are friends and spend most of their time either in a bar or on a basketball court where you guessed it they waste much of their energy complaining about the women in their lives. Tagging along is a superfluous man played by comedian Gary Owen who serves no real purpose other than to be the butt of PG13appropriate racial slurs. There's even time for completely unnecessary cameo appearances by NBA players Metta World Peace Shannon Brown and Matt Barnes. Former WNBA player Lisa Leslie joins them as they successfully emasculate the main stars in a basketball game.You know me. I'm usually the first to let a romantic comedy slide simply because I accept them as nothing more than fantasy. But in this case something went wrong. Think Like a Man regards genuine relationship advice as fodder for a series of inane jokes. The characters are so shallow it's as if writers Keith Marryman and David A. Newman know absolutely nothing about men or women. For all I know maybe they truly don't. Whenever Harvey appears on one of the many conveniently placed television sets he always gives a piece of advice each one had the potential to be applied to a complex and thoughtprovoking vignette one in which the characters have a bit more depth to them. How sad that his book served as the basis for a film that shows no interest in real relationships. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

Women complained about men. Men complained about women. I LOVE Kevin Hart and Michael Ealy and I've just gotten more hip to Romany Malco after hearing him on The Breakfast Club saw 40YearOld Virgin but I couldn't have told you his name by heart up until that interview. And as much as I enjoy watching Taraji Henson act her hair looked GREAT in the film respect La La Anthony and Gabrielle Union Regina Hall was who I wanted to see most on the women's side mainly because she was absolutely hilarious in the Style Magazine interview. Her comedic face and timing are way underrated and not taken advantage of in this film. But with that said this turned out to be a great film for reasons I didn't expect.1 I had no idea Morris Chestnut was even in the film. Spoiler alert I have been on that MorrisChestnutdate. It is the WORST so I buried my head reliving it while watching this movie. 2 Michael Ealy and Taraji Henson had some seriously juicy makeout scenes. They weren't as memorable as the one with Halle Berry in Their Eyes Were Watching God but there was definitely tongue action involved. Two hot people in a hot scene made for great Oooh look at them! moments.3 Kevin Hart If I need to explain anything past his name you need to do some comedic research. Everything about Kevin Hart in this movie was great. And my gawd his wife...I was NOT expecting her to be in the film either but those two are almost equally nuts.4 Jerry Ferrara is someone I didn't know before this film and I probably wouldn't have put him and Gabrielle Union together but those two were too cute on film. I got the impression he was shorter than her but those two were the second most fun couple to watch.5 I was really impressed with Terrence J.'s acting. I saw Stomp the Yard 2 and thought it was terrible but in this movie he did a great job. Jenifer Lewis is going to bring out anybody's personality when she's next to him but Terrence J. held his own all by himself.6 The guest appearances from some major stars like Kelly Rowland Chris Brown and Arielle Kebbel were fun to see. Kelly impressed me with her acting. I already knew Chris Brown was a very good actor. And I'm a HUGE The Vampire Diaries fan so anything with Arielle Kebbel in it is going to make me happy to see her. You'll also see some popup appearances from other popular comedians like Tony Rock Bruce Bruce and Luenell.Steve Harvey wasn't kidding when he said some of everybody was in this film. There are cameos everywhere but they all make sense. People are really playing parts not just thrown in to say look I'm a celeb and I'm in this movie too. Fellas will go for the comedy and the beautiful women love Meagan Good's hair too. Ladies will go to crack up laughing at Kevin Hart and point out which one of the women they are FROM Steve Harvey's book. Or they'll applaud the guys for making fun of the book there are two extreme sets of readers for this book. Either way it goes it's a great film and I like the way it ended including that Morris Chestnut date that was too close to home for me.".

I don't necessary agree with a lot of the insight and perception on males and females. But at least it tried and to a certain extent I could somewhat understand it. Even if the one dimensional characters ruins it. But with the running time I guess they did what they thought was right. The climax was super rushed and just seem to happen out of nowhere. Overall I thought this movie was pretentious and annoying. And almost not watchable but since I didn't fall asleep while watching this I give it a 3.510. Well at least it's better than Grown Ups.3.510".

His writing definitely shows the BALANCE that emerges from a relationship in which one partner supports and encourages the other partner's dreams and we saw how empowered and motivated it makes the other partner feel to know somebody has your back in your relationship. I liked the way they showed the player continuously playing until he woke up realized this is not a game this is LIFE!!! ALL of the characters gave different mature  immature points of view about their relationships thus bringing the movie to a whole new level each time something new was revealed. I like the fact that every one's role was diverse in that each of their personalities brought out a real sense of how we actually do think act and date in the real world. Some of us may have learned some new ways of thinking and responding to situations we may be in now.Thank you Tim Keith  Steve for using your genius writing and comedic skills to give us a blockbuster comedy that will forever have our eyes and ears open as we become involved in future relationships that may just lead to happiness!!! 5 Stars!!!".

I quite like Tyler Perry movies but this movie is beyond comparison.Frankly I've NEVER been to a movie where I laughed from beginning to end. It was HILARIOUS. Kevin Hart is an absolute scene stealer and almost none of the jokes in this movie fell flat. Yes it does follow the conventional Hollywood romantic comedy formula. And the fact that all these beautiful women would seek romantic advice from a book is a bit contrived. But overall the ensemble is beautiful and talented and at no point in the movie did it feel lagging.I was disappointed by the low overall rating on IMDb so I decided to write a review. Perhaps the other voters didn't see the same movie that I did. This is hands down the best romantic comedy I've seen in recent years emphasis on comedy with original and unexpected quips. In my humble opinion this movie should at least have a 7 out of 10. And let me add that I am Asian. Two days before watching this movie I tried watching The Science of Sleep  a movie that was annoying pretentious and frankly disappointing coming from the director of the fabulous Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. That movie is rated a whopping 7.3 on IMDb which I think  pardon my French  is total crap. There is no way that Think Like a Man should be rated lower than this movie thus Think Like a Man must truly have a higher rating than 7.3!But definitely if you enjoy witty and unexpected humor from a romantic comedy watch this movie because you will not regret it! I think too many people judge movies based on the demographics that they seem to target which is a shame. You might really miss out on a wonderful experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Tailor of Panama is an atmospheric wellcrafted thriller in which the actors have an infectiously good time with their characters especially an excellent and hilarious Pierce Brosnan as Andy Osnard a roguish British spy who is sent to Panama superbly described as Casablanca without heroes to keep out of trouble and get back his government's trust. However even in postCold War diplomacy you have to play the game and earn your wage.  The diplomats still have to listen to their sources.  Osnard selects British expat tailor Harry Pendel Geoffrey Rush to be his information source using Pendel's hidden past to get his cooperation.  Pendel is wellplaced as his wife works for the director of the Panama Canal Company but he also has friends formerly in the antiNoriega ranks.  Osnard passes on what Pendel tells him to his superiors. These two characters start to spin a web of exciting misinformation that they start to revel in but this has consequences which escalate beyond their control. The background of Panama from its laundromats banks to its seedy nightclubs suits the characters and the story perfectly and gives the film an atmospheric richness of the type director Boorman excels in.  It is a treat for those who love international political intrigue and who may have traveled or lived in such places. This is a thriller which relies not on hitech filmmaking gimmicks and there are many opportunities to but on characters interesting enough to follow all the way through the film.  It has an oldfashioned feel and an wry and mischievous humor.  Some may see some implausibility in the final conseuences of Osnard's and Pendel's actions but on the whole the shamless good time they have bring these almost antiheroes to life is infectious. Great fun.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Tailor of Panama is an atmospheric wellcrafted thriller in which the actors have an infectiously good time with their characters especially an excellent and hilarious Pierce Brosnan as Andy Osnard a roguish British spy who is sent to Panama superbly described as Casablanca without heroes to keep out of trouble and get back his government's trust. However even in postCold War diplomacy you have to play the game and earn your wage.  The diplomats still have to listen to their sources.  Osnard selects British expat tailor Harry Pendel Geoffrey Rush to be his information source using Pendel's hidden past to get his cooperation.  Pendel is wellplaced as his wife works for the director of the Panama Canal Company but he also has friends formerly in the antiNoriega ranks.  Osnard passes on what Pendel tells him to his superiors.

For example Andy Osnard the British secret agent played by Pierce Brosnan who else? is a scheming sociopath not a patriotic hero.  The title character Harry Pendel played by Geoffrey Rush is a liar and an exconvict.  Don't be put off by these flawed characters though.  In the great tradition of John LeCarre's characters these devious selfish people are endlessly interesting  and believable.  I suspect that those who did not like this film reacted as they did because of a lack of heroes and because the outcome of the machinations it depicts are sadly grotesque. Nevertheless this is the thinking person's spy movie.  Highly recommended 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "How nice to see Pierce Brosnan as a rotter. Without the mantan make up you can actually see his freckles.A coproduction of the Irish government and Columbia Pictures The Tailor of Panama is an oldfashioned British espionage film that is Eurolight on the violence and silhouettediscreet on the sex. No skitzy MTV editing and no hip hop trendy hits. Which may be heaven for some and limbo for others.Starring along with the current James Bond is Geoffrey Rush and Jamie Lee Curtis. Pierce is still handsome as hell and he's still a spy. This time he's been exiled to Central America to cool his heels. Overly ambitious he latches on to local tailor to the rich and powerful and starts to squeeze him for information becoming more ruthless and despicable with every turn. The colorful Rush obliges him with making stuff up and this leads to all kinds of intrigue. Jamie Lee reprises her wifewhodoesn'tknowherhusbandisaspy role that she did in True Lies but without the little black dress. The humor is very dark and very British. The plot is reminiscent of the 1960 Alec GuinnessErnie Kovacs gem Our Man in Havana an early spoof of the Bond saga.Tailor is taken from the '96 Le Carr novel of the same name. John the spymaster shares screenplay credit along with Andrew Davies and the veddy British director John Boorman most famous for Deliverance. Yes this is the man responsible for Dueling Banjos. Receiving Acad noms for directing Hope and Glory and the Banjo movie he also has a producing credit here.This is the first film done on location in Panama so the look is fresh and it's beautifully shot by veteran Phillipe Rousselot who is currently working on Planet of the Apes.This film is getting almost no hype and no promotion. Again it's very low key with no gunfire car chases or blood. The politics of Panama are in the forefront with more than one reference to the 'Frankenstein' Noriega and how he was set him up by CIA Head George the First Bush that is. Ah hem.There are some splendid character actors in the supporting cast like John Polito of TV's Homicide and Martin Ferraro of TV's Miami Vice. Playwright Harold Pinter is in the strangest cameo role you may see this year. Scoop du Jour in the role of the Tailor's son we get a look and the kid who will star in the Harry Potter film Daniel Radcliffe.There is some stock footage of the political unrest and references to the thoroughly corrupt Central American government with lines from the Tailor like 'you know what the poor call those?' pointing to the city's skyline 'Cocaine towers! And the 85 banks? Launderettes!' You can easily understand why the media isn't getting behind this thing. But then again Traffic didn't win best picture Gladiator did.".

	schema:reviewBody "In The Tailor of Panama' Pierce Brosnan plays a sort of evil version of his James Bond persona a womanizing British spy more concerned with his own personal aggrandizement than with duty to queen and crown and all those virtues we parochially tend to think of as uniquely Western'  virtues like liberty freedom and democracy.Based on John Le Carre's novel of the same name The Tailor of Panama' is not quite so positive in its assessment of the West's innate benevolence. It is in fact an attack on the evils of the modern nationbuilding process wherein developed countries like the United States and Great Britain engage in all sorts of covert skullduggery in an effort to protect their own strategic interests in the Third World community. If this involves propping up or installing immoral regimes  or toppling potentially moral ones  that as Le Carre sees it is all part of the game we naively call international diplomacy.'The setting of the film is Panama City right after the takeover of the canal by the Panamanians.  Fearful that its interests might soon be threatened the British government sends one of its own secret agents Andy Osnard to ferret out some British citizen who may have contacts with the authorities in the city and may therefore be privy to information pertinent to their concerns.  Andy alights on Harry Pendel a goodnatured idealistic tailor who does indeed seem to have some entree with the higherups in the local government.  Harry also happens to be married to Louisa Jamie Lee Curtis who actually works supervising the canal so of course Harry can be quite an informative source of information if he happens to put his mind to it. Andy knowing that Harry has a few major debts to pay off moves in for the kill and engages Harry's efforts.  The only problem is that Harry beyond being impeccably moral also loves to spin a fantastic yarn or two and Andy has to figure out whether the information Harry is feeding him is really the truth or just the product of an overactive imagination.The complexity of the plotting works both for and against the film.  On the one hand the audience has a fun time following the narrative along its complicated mazelike path meeting interesting people and visiting unusual sites along the way.  Moreover we are afforded a fascinating glimpse into the sleazy world of backstage nationbuilding in a socalled Banana Republic.'  On the other hand we often find ourselves a bit confused as to the why and wherefore of many of the actions and far worse the movie never establishes enough of a quality of credibility to make us believe it all.  This is certainly the case in the film's final stretches when the tooeasily duped U.S. and British governments launch an allout attack on the city based on only the flimsiest of evidence.  Yet perhaps that is Le Carre and director John Boorman's thesis  that such takeovers are often rooted in causes that are circumstantial prefabricated or totally beside the point.  If this is the case both the writer and the director have failed to create the tone necessary to pull off such a sophisticated idea. For although there are flashes of sharp humor shot throughout the entire film the general ambience is never farout and witty enough for us to classify the work as satirical.  As a result the final scenes seem somehow more silly than provocative.This is not however to suggest that The Tailor of Panama' is not a worthwhile and interesting film.  In fact it succeeds almost on the strength of its performances alone.  Brosnan does a superb job poking fun at his signature spy persona as he utilizes his trademark suavity to get exactly what he wants  be it information a load of cash or a roll in the hay with a gorgeous female companion.  As the title character Geoffrey Rush delivers yet another outstanding performance somehow managing to make Harry seem both incredibly weak and amazingly strong at the same time.  In fact Rush quite literally carries this film earning the audience's sympathy from beginning to end.  Curtis turns in her usual fine performance although her role seems a bit undernourished compared to those of the two male leads.The Tailor of Panama' although ultimately unsatisfying comes pretty damn close to being a worthwhile success.".

I'm not talking about the movie but rather the people who have critically lambasted this intelligent stylish adaptation of John Le Carre's novel.  Kudos to John Boorman Pierce Bronsnan Geoffrey Rush and a stellar cast.  If you looking for an alternative to braindead blockbusters and regurgitated teenage comedies then you've stumbled upon the right film.  Imagine the complete antithesis of James Bond a man who puts self before king and country and loves them and leaves them with relish  enter Brosnan's Andy Osnard.  Sit back and watch with sheer delight as this corrupt British spook pulls the strings that sets the U.S. on course for a second invasion of Panama. Misinformation is the game and Osnard is planning to get rich on it.  His pawn is the tailor of the title Harry Pendel brilliantly played by Geoffrey Rush.  The film moves a snappy pace the dialogue is witty and often times hilarious and the cinematography music and editing are all first rate.  Who cares if two shots of a jet in the air scream bad CGI? That's not what this film is about.  We're talking intelligent plotting great writing excellent acting and another sexy devilish turn for Brosnan that is slightly reminiscent of his Thomas Crown character.  Brosnan in my opinion always fares best when he's playing against Bond type  and here he excels.  DO NOT listen to the naysayers on this one  unless GODZILLA or ARMAGGEDON are your favorite movies.  If you appreciate the dense textured films of the late 60'searly 70's then this one is for you.  They sure don't make them like this anymore and you wouldn't know that they had with regard to Tailor since Columbia's flying this one way under the radar.  As always they must be figuring that it'll play to the over 35 demo so why even bother promoting it.  Sad times these are folks when a first rate entertainment like this is ignored at the box office and ignored by its own distributors.  But there's always another Scream American Pie and Halloween around the corner so viva la cinema.  Highest rating.".

Into his world comes Osnard played by Pierce Brosnan. A morally corrupt selfserving MI6 spy sent to Panama as a last chance after seducing a Euro diplomats wife. Many were bowled over by the irony of casting Brosnan so associated with James Bond as this much realer creepier Bond alter ego. A man who is handsome and selfconfident but whose endless seduction of women seems smarmy not sexy and who delights in screwing other people while profiting himself. For me the casting was actually problematic. Brosnon's terrific but the irony is so distractingly obvious that it pulled me out of the story and made me think too much about film and our hero images instead of simply accepting the character. Beyond that Osnard is drawn a little too broadly for my taste. He's so transparent I have a hard time he gets anyone to trust him even for a moment. If his inner selfserving pig were a bit better hidden it might have given the audience more to unravel and make other characters' willingness to do his bidding a bit easier to buy. The mix of tones also was a bit of a misfire for me. Never quite darkly funny enough to ascend into true satire but certainly never edgy enough to be taken seriously there's a lack of danger here. Unlike 'Dr. Strangelove' we never really think Harry and Osnard's games will reduce Panama to a pile of rubble and the intimation of it seems false and a bit silly. Yet all that complaining is because the movie is good enough smart enough brave enough and entertaining enough that I felt frustrated it didn't quite work as brilliantly as is should. But I'd certainly still recommend it in spite of my long winded misgivings and I'm also willing to give it another look.".

He draws stunning performances out of his actors apart from the ever annoying Jamie Lee Curtis. Brosnan shifts character bewilderingly but by the end his roguish charm has been fully shed to reveal the horror of the man beneath making Geoffrey Rush's exploitation believable and pathetic. This ranks along with the Killing Fields and Salvador I'm sure I've forgotten many other worthy examples as one of my favourite angry antiwar antiinterventionism films arguing that where the justifying intelligence isn't good enough the rich and powerful states do not have the right to interfere at least unless their motivations are purer than self interest. On the other hand it is a great human drama with the country which serves as its backdrop used to great effect to emphasise the human tragedies played out within. Watch and enjoy but you may find the first 1015 minutes difficult until you have settled with the style  definitely worth a second watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the surface The Tailor Of Panama is a bit of a contradiction. It's based on a novel by John le Carre famed for his gritty and realistic spy thrillers yet stars the man famous for playing the exact opposite of le Carre's thrillers James Bond. But those contradictions are just on the surface with the film itself resulting in a few surprisesPerhaps the biggest surprise of the film is Pierce Brosnan. Given that he's playing a British spy and that the film came out in the midst of his tenure as James Bond one might assume that he would be playing a slightly different take on 007. Nothing could be much farther than the truth. Andy Osnard is a character who is almost unlikeable arrogant cursing sexist and ultimately a man with no loyalty except to himself. Yet despite being unlikeable Osnard and Brosnan is the one you can't take your eyes off of in whatever scene he's in. He's the corrupt heart and soul of the film and the film is ultimately better for it.The rest of the cast does well for the most part. Geoffrey Rush as the titular tailor of the title Harry Pendel gives a fine performance as the good with a checkered past who drawn into Osnard's sphere of influence begins setting a series of events in motion that threatens to unravel everything around him. There are also good performances from Catherine McCormack and David Hayman as well as Leonor Varela and Brendan Gleeson as two old revolutionaries drawn into the events around them and worse off for it. There are also some nice pseudocameos as well from Dylan Baker Jonathan Hyde and noted playwright Harold Pinter as the proverbial spirit of the late Uncle Benny who acts as the conscience of his nephew Harry. The weak link of the cast is Jamie Lee Curtis who for reasons that are unclear has little to do in the film.If Osnard is the film's physical heart and soul then its metaphysical one is the script based on the novel of the same name by John le Carre. By le Carre's own admission The Tailor Of Panama is a take on Graham Greene's Our Man In Havana updated from 1950s Cuba to late 1990s early 2000s for the film Panama. At the film's heart is a tale of how one man Osnard and his corrupting influence of those around him told through the prism of a spy story. Intriguingly the film in retrospect almost seems like an odd premonition of events leading up to the invasion of Iraq set in another part of the world British intelligence that is ultimately dubious as is its source is used to justify a US invasion.Yet the film suffers from a glaring flaw. The film's tone is all over the place as director John Boorman has the film bouncing around between serious spy thriller black comedy and domestic drama. The three in this case don't sit well next to one another which can lead to undermining of otherwise key moments such as when Harry yells at those in his shop as the film begins to head towards its conclusion. The result is a film that is uneven to the point of fault.Despite the tonal issue the film has plenty going for it. From Brosnan's performance to the strong script from the le Carre novel The Tailor Of Panama is still an intriguing film. While neither the best spy thriller nor the best le Carre adaptation for those who enjoy either the film is certainly worth a viewing.".

	schema:headline " Neither fish flesh fowl or good red herring";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Tailor of Panama' is a hamfisted attempt at satire that only manages to fumble and stumble over its own large concept and inept script. There are shades of 'Dr Strangelove...' James Bond and 'All The President's Men'. Bits and pieces of tiredout antiAmerican antimilitary dribblings sugarcoated in glossy cinematography of Panama City looking like every other American city that popped up in the 80s and 90s. A city that is as anonymous and nondescript as this mess of a movie.Not even Geoffrey Rush's fine acting can save this turkey from boring the viewer to sleep. The script is clichd and choppy the attempts at clever satire fall flat as dayold cheap champagne. There is gratuitous sex that fails to titillate and pseudoviolence and threatening thugs who fail to alarm or disgust. Failure is the operative word for this dreadful movie. I admit I was expecting much more from John Boorman one of my favorite directors and John LeCarr one of the best writers of the English language in the past 50 years. So the disappointment was acute when I realized that this movie wasn't going to amount to much more than one those adolescent Leslie Nielsen big gun showcases made more than 20 years ago for the teenage crowd.'The Tailor of Panama' has a halfcomplete feel to it. The characters are like cartoon creatures who run around exhibiting lots of angst and tragedy only to be dropped down a hole to use one of LeCarr's favorite phrases and forgotten. The ending comes all of a sudden as if half the third act had been excised after a drooping second act.Lots of money obviously went into this pile of offal. I wonder if the money might have been better spent on the third world victims of tyranny this movie purports to support rather than giving a nice holiday for the filmmakers in Panama City and environs.Pierce Brosnan plays a vile antihero who neither conjures up total disgust or invokes allout laughs which Leslie Nielsen to his credit could always do. This movie is neither clever intelligent or exciting and is a complete waste of time.Not one of Boorman's or LeCarr's finest hours to say the least.See for yourself but rent don't buy.".

	onyx:emotionText "'The Tailor of Panama' is a hamfisted attempt at satire that only manages to fumble and stumble over its own large concept and inept script. There are shades of 'Dr Strangelove...' James Bond and 'All The President's Men'. Bits and pieces of tiredout antiAmerican antimilitary dribblings sugarcoated in glossy cinematography of Panama City looking like every other American city that popped up in the 80s and 90s. A city that is as anonymous and nondescript as this mess of a movie.Not even Geoffrey Rush's fine acting can save this turkey from boring the viewer to sleep. The script is clichd and choppy the attempts at clever satire fall flat as dayold cheap champagne. There is gratuitous sex that fails to titillate and pseudoviolence and threatening thugs who fail to alarm or disgust. Failure is the operative word for this dreadful movie. I admit I was expecting much more from John Boorman one of my favorite directors and John LeCarr one of the best writers of the English language in the past 50 years. So the disappointment was acute when I realized that this movie wasn't going to amount to much more than one those adolescent Leslie Nielsen big gun showcases made more than 20 years ago for the teenage crowd.'The Tailor of Panama' has a halfcomplete feel to it. The characters are like cartoon creatures who run around exhibiting lots of angst and tragedy only to be dropped down a hole to use one of LeCarr's favorite phrases and forgotten. The ending comes all of a sudden as if half the third act had been excised after a drooping second act.Lots of money obviously went into this pile of offal. I wonder if the money might have been better spent on the third world victims of tyranny this movie purports to support rather than giving a nice holiday for the filmmakers in Panama City and environs.Pierce Brosnan plays a vile antihero who neither conjures up total disgust or invokes allout laughs which Leslie Nielsen to his credit could always do.

Here he's not likable not even a little and he plays it well. You might say he's still a scoundrel but this time bearing the full negative connotation.

It survives with different complications than just two economical and political poles fighting each other and quoting a great character from a memorable film in this war the winner isn't the one with the most bullets but the one who controls the information. And it is this still chaotic world post Cold War that an apparent simple tailor might cause a significant turbulence on a country that still crawls as being a democratic nation.In The Tailor of Panama Geoffrey Rush plays Harry Pendel a British tailor highly requested for his services by the powerful authorities of Panama a man who seems to know anyone and everything and he's recruited by Andy Osnard Pierce Brosnan a Brit secret agent at one step to finally get retired who needs good informations about what's going on in the country with the awaited return of Canal of Panama's control by the country's officers and no longer controlled by the U.S. Reluctant but wanting to save himself from his debts Pendel accepts this mission and the money that comes with it but since there isn't much going on he decides to spice things a bit by inventing that the Canal is being sold to the Chinese and that there's a silent resistance group led by the drunk Mickey Abraxas Brendan Gleeson that wants to take over the power and stop the deal. Pendel's plans get to a lower level when he's forced to spy his own wife Jamie Lee Curtis who works for the government. Trouble is set when Osnard shares the amazing information with his bosses that'll share it with their American cousins then...chaos again! John Boorman's film loses itself as being a comedy with two or three laughs with not much depth but staying close to the original work written by John Le Carr who paid a tribute to Graham Greene's Our Man in Havana. When it gets serious towards the ending the plot gets some credibility. It can be said that the film followed the book's quality and intentions since it's not one of Carr's greatest works it's quite plain with plenty of humor but not much interesting. Same thing the movie that on a first view will confuse its viewers with many plots that aren't so great to follow. A good film yes but not on the same level as other Carr's film adaptations such as The Constant Gardener The Russia House and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy all intriguing attractive seductive and interesting to follow despite the enormous spiderwebs formed by the plots. Through here we're able to see that small ordinary people can create huge problems that might affect a country's national security for the most stupid of reasons. Also there's a sharp criticism to agencies of intelligence so concerned about their reputation and immersed in believing in everything they hear that they forget about their liabilities check the facts instead of following rumors. It's all about who controls the information to win the war even if this war is just a personal cause like getting retired in style or pay all your debts but always remembering that many will suffer with those lies even yourself like Pendel realizes later that things got out of control.Mr. Rush shines as the title character certainly the great pleasure of watching the film Gleeson steals the show in his brief appearances Curtis is almost purposeless as the tailor's wife there isn't much she can do here Brosnan plays this irresponsible agent as a James Bond with plenty of women but without the action and the fast cars an irony since Bond is hated by Carr who considers 007 as being a prostitute. Completing the casting there's Catherine McCormack Harold Pinter Gerard McSorley Jon Polito Martin Ferrero Dylan Baker Jonathan Hyde and Daniel Radcliffe way before of his Harry Potter fame playing Pendel's son.Here's an amusing and intelligent work from the same director of Deliverance and Hope and Glory that deserves a view. 710".

It's too shallow as a family drama and there are not enough jokes to make you laugh for 2 hours.

In my opinion though his greatest fault is that his work is very inconsistant  one book might be great and the next notsogreat.Of all his books I think that The Tailor of Panama has to be my least favorite. Its based on Graham Greanne's novel Our Man In Havanna and it is meant to be a tragicomedy. It is the story of Harry Pendel a tailor who is a hopeless storyteller and an exconvict recruited by a British spy named Andy Osnard to be the head of a spy network in Panama. The whole thing turns out to be a massive congame with Harry lying to Andy about the socalled silent opposition in Panama and the two of them raking in money from England. However things turn sour when England and America act on Harry's intelligence and he loses everything he holds dear to him.The movie fails on a variety of different levels. First of all Pierce Brosnon is far too much of a pretty boy to play the role of Andy Osnard who in the books is portrayed as fat notparticularly handsome but possessing a certain animal sexuality. The director tries to convey this by having him sweat alot and walk around with his shirt tails out but it doesn't work. Also casting Jamie Lee Curtis as Harry's wife who was supposed to be halfPanamanian was another absurd piece of casting. Although both Brosnon and Curtis are good in their roles they just don't seem to fit. Secondly the ending of the book is VERY different from the ending of the movie. The ending of the book is tragic but hopeful. Harry loses everything but goes off into the world seeking a kind of redemption. The climax of the book is very important to the story in that everything has been building to this one moment. It is depressing as all get out and since it also didn't jibe with recorded history I think they changed the ending to the movie to something much more up beat. In doing so they made most of the movie irrelevant since it was building towards something that never happens.Since this got a very limited release when it first came out I went out of my way to see it. I expected to be depressed but not as bored as I had become after the first fifteen minutes. Had the theatre been less crowded I would have walked out. It was an immensely unsatisfying movie.".

The plot is a combination of satire and spy thriller with a certain amount of comic absurdity thrown in and with this in mind I can understand why it has garnered mixed reviews.

No the film is interesting and engaging but it is far from perfect and sort of flops in the middle of everything it seems to be trying to achieve. I was still more or less held by it for the majority but I can understand why many viewers wondered what the makers were trying to do. One of the main reason it is worth checking out is for the cast.The casting is eclectic to say the least. I'm not sure if it had anything to do with his next Bond being his last but Brosnan clearly relishes the opportunity to play with the MI6 spy character and is convincingly selfseeking and greedy. Rush is more subdued and controlled with his character being a form of mockery of colonial ambition while also working as a character within the story itself. Although his is the title character the film does rather belong to Brosnan. Curtis has a small role that was a good but strange choice for her. Gleeson is a strange bit of casting although he is as effective as Varela. Pinter popping up regularly is another example of the weird casting along with people like Margolis Radcliffe Fortune Polito Baker Jenkins and others in mostly small roles.Overall then a strange film that is far from being successful. The cast suggests greatness but although it has good moments it doesn't really work as a total film. Brosnan makes for a great central performance and holds a lot of it together just a shame that the film doesn't make better use of the material to back him up.".

None of these movies are Oscar worthy but they are all good fun horror films. What he was thinking when he directed the Day of the Dead redux is beyond me.A small Colorado town is overrun with the living dead following a flu like virus that has swept across the land. As soon as the virus kills someone their skin immediately decays and they become superhuman beasts. These zombies don't just run a modern zombie element which has caused a lot of controversy in recent years they jump shoot weapons and somehow manage to crawl on walls and ceilings. At the forefront of this superzombie apocalypse is Mena Suvari who phoned in her part and Nick Cannon who should have as well as a few other meaningless characters. People die things explode and an hour and a half of your life is wasted as you watch this deplorable film.Honestly if this film had carried any moniker other than the classic Day of the Dead I would have given it a bit higher of a rating. I'm thinking 3 or 4 mostly because some of the makeup fx are pretty nifty. Instead the filmmakers decided to take everything Romero created and turn it on its head. Experimentation is a good thing but not in this case. This should not be called a remake...or even a reimagining for that matter. It has nothing to do with the original film aside that there are zombies involved and the military has a presence. I say pull it from the shelves now and send it out retitled. George Romero really shouldn't have to put up with this nonsense anymore.".

It's not long before the situation takes a turn for the worse though as those infected start to die  come back as flesh eating zombies Sarah leads a small group of survivors as they fight for their lives against hordes of flesh eating zombies  try to escape to safety...Directed by Steve Miner I would imagine many horror fans will be horrified by Day of the Dead. Lets start at the beginning shall we? A filmmaker called George A. Romero made the ground breaking Night of the Living Dead 1968 which changed the face of horror films literally overnight he then made one of the greatest films ever in it's sequel Dawn of the Dead 1978 then he made a brilliant third film in the trilogy called Day of the Dead 1985 before an OK fourth Land of the Dead 2005  more recently a fifth film in the series Diary of the Dead 2007. Right Night of the Living Dead 1990 was remade to great effect Dawn of the Dead 2004 was next to be remade to fun if unspectacular results  Day of the Dead was initially given a sequel called Day of the Dead 2 Contagium 2005 which wasn't a sequel at all  was terrible  that brings us bang up to date with this Day of the Dead which is touted as a remake but in reality isn't anything of the sort. The script by Jeffrey Reddick is more akin to something that I would have expected to find on the scifi channel rather than a reworking or reimagining of one of the greatest zombie films of all time in fact George A. Romero isn't even mentioned during the opening credits which gives you some indication that this Day of the Dead is a million miles from his. Gone are the brilliant character's replaced with a almost entirely teenage cast with even the army soldiers are fresh faced teenage recruits gone is the oppressive atmosphere biting social commentary  sense of gloom replaced with lots of 28 Days Later... 2002 shaky camera hyperactive shrieking zombies attacking from all angles as well as Resident Evil 2002 style genetically created virus's that infect a small town turning everyone into zombies  gone is Tom Savini's ultra realistic gore  zombie effects to be replaced with CGI blood splatters. Having said that if you take Day of the Dead on it's own terms then I don't think it's a bad way to pass 90 odd minutes at all the character's are mostly likable  good looking enough although the gore doesn't compare to the original there's still a fair amount of blood there's more action in this at the expense of story though  above all I thought it was quite fun  for what it is pretty entertaining. So shoot me.Director Miner did actually have a Hollywood career at one point with films such as Friday the 13th Part 2 1981 Friday the 13th Part III 1982 Halloween H20 20 Years Later 1998  Lake Placid 1999 to his credit he does alright here  despite some shaky camera moments Day of the Dead looks pretty good  is competent if nothing else. While the gore isn't as good or as extensive as Romero's film there's a fair amount of blood decapitated heads rotting zombies gory bites a few severed limbs  mutilated bodies on show. The special effects vary from good prosthetic makeup effects to poor CGI computer ones. Day of the Dead goes for action setpieces rather than scares tension  atmosphere which won't please lovers of the original but there you go.With a supposed budget of about 18000000 Day of the Dead is well made but does have that slightly cheap madeforvideo look about it it looks OK but won't last long in your memory. Shot in Bulgaria to keep the cost down even more. The acting isn't great it's alright  the largely teenage cast are attractive enough. Having been in the Dawn of the Dead remake Ving Rhames also appears in this as a much toned down Captain Rhodes one of the few direct references to Romero's original Nick Cannon is the obligatory rapper involved.Day of the Dead if under any other mundane title such as Virus of the Dead or Dead Rising or something that has nothing to do with Romero's original would stand a good chance of being a well liked fast paced zombie horror unfortunately by saddling itself with the Day of the Dead name it made a rod for it's own back as it could never come anywhere near Romero's original. Taken for what it is I liked it as a remake of one of the greatest zombie films ever it's a travesty.".

	schema:reviewBody "The reason this movie sucked royally was not because it didn't have the potential to be a good movie it was mainly casting. I don't understand why mainstream Hollywood horror movies cast ridiculous people in roles that don't fit them. The casting of Rhodes was absolutely dumb considering Ving was in the Dawn of the dead remake so it confused everyone into thinking that he survived or something of that nature. Also if you want a sure shot at ruining your movie just cast Nick Cannon in any part and he will say ridiculous lines like by the power or gray skull or some random curse word when he kills his hundredth zombie because apparently he is a super zombie killer as soon as the outbreak occurs. He was quite possibly the worst actor i have ever seen and i just don't understand why he was even cast. The same thing happened with Busta Rhymes in Halloween Resurrection when he said Trick or Treat Motha F. When these dumb lines were barked out by these no talented actors the entire movie lost all credibility in my eyes. Granted both of these movies are not that good but at least would have been watchable if these no talented ridiculous actors were cast. It is just a recipe for disaster with respect to a horror movie.Now for the movie itself i literally feel like the only redeeming factor in the whole film was Mina Servari excuse spelling if its wrong because she was the only actor that i believed deserved credit. I think Ving was just looking for a quick pay check and the rest of the cast i don't think have any experience and thats all this was for them. I don't blame them for taking the roles because they probably didn't know this crap fest was going to be as bad as it was considering the success of the Zack Synder remake of Dawn of the Dead. The zombie's in this film must have been bitten by radioactive zombie spiders because they develop powers very similar to spiderman when they turn. My brother and I laughed out loud as the chaos happened because it was a mockery of any zombie film ever made.I also want to point out that i very rarely will comment on films because it is almost pointless but this film was one of the biggest let downs in all of the movies I have ever seen. I am an avid Romero fan and this did nothing but make a disgrace of his life's work.".

This is one of those zombie movies that changes the characteristics of the zombies to suite the scenes. Mostly its just rabid insane 28 days later type movements. Oh but they can sometimes walk on walls and ceilings how? why?. Oh and listen to radios and understand what is being said. The Bub character is ridiculously used in the plot. One of the soldiers is infected turns into a zombie but they decide to keep him around and drive around with him in the car because he might be useful. Thats right they pile into the back seats and he is sat in the middle of them. Zombies throwing themselves at the car everyone screaming but the one I am sat next to? No problem! The final scenes are just ridiculous and I felt that at this point they had run out of ideas so they made it up as they went along. One line summed the whole movie up for me. They discovered that one of the scientists who worked on the project that started the virus has now become a zombie and is in the complex they are in. A colleague of his says 'If what you said about them retaining some of what they were is true then we are so fcked'.".

Oh but they can sometimes walk on walls and ceilings how? why?. Oh and listen to radios and understand what is being said. The Bub character is ridiculously used in the plot. One of the soldiers is infected turns into a zombie but they decide to keep him around and drive around with him in the car because he might be useful. Thats right they pile into the back seats and he is sat in the middle of them. Zombies throwing themselves at the car everyone screaming but the one I am sat next to? No problem! The final scenes are just ridiculous and I felt that at this point they had run out of ideas so they made it up as they went along. One line summed the whole movie up for me. They discovered that one of the scientists who worked on the project that started the virus has now become a zombie and is in the complex they are in. A colleague of his says 'If what you said about them retaining some of what they were is true then we are so fcked'.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like many of you I got really excited when I heard about this film. After the incredibly good effort that was the Dawn of the Dead 2004 remake this film is an extremely cheap attempt to cash in on the name. It's extremely important to keep in mind that this film it's not a remake as much as it's a bythenumbers zombieinfected flick with a fancy name on it.The film stars Mena Suvari and has a short cameo by Ving Rhames. While I'll watch anything with Mena Suvari in it  even Loser  this is a stretch. While Suvari does a decent job with a flat lifeless no pun intended script the other actors are incredibly stiff awkward and unconvincing. Rhames plays basically the same character he played in the Dawn of the Dead remake although he only appears for the first 15 minutes or so.The film itself is extremely boring and the action and special effects are haphazard. I can honestly say that I've never felt so bored during an action sequence before. The climax if you can call it that runs on for about 5 minutes more than it should. Even worse the film doesn't even attempt to redeem itself by being a tad funny.. it tries but fails with flying colors. The script is absolutely ridiculous not even making relative sense in the world of the film.If you've ever wondered what vegetarian zombies eat feel free to watch this movie. If you want to see a new spin on Romero wait for Diary of the Dead to come out in wide release by the man himself. I'm giving this one a three for Mena Suvari alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Remake of George Romero's original Day of the Dead 1985 no way! How could you. Well I'll admit I didn't mind Steve Miner's superfluously clichd straighttoDVD bgrade take but it's far from a traditional scene by scenescenario remake with the film only sharing the same title even though most of the zombie action centres around night time featuring zombies who bestow very impressive psychical abilities like sprinting leaping and thinking and having a character named Captain Rhodes played by the commanding Ving Rhames in nothing more than a support role. Really that's it but also shares some common similarities to Romero's 1973 'The Crazies' which a remake is on the horizon as it features the US army postingguard in a virusinfected small town turning the locals into blood crazy zombies. I don't seem to share much of the hate towards it maybe hearing a lot bad things before hand to work in my favour as I didn't have expectations for it although I agree it does have some dumb plot devices mainly centring that of certain zombie soldier but is it any worse than the 'Bub' creation in the original film? but despite that and its formulaic patterns. I remained easily engrossed.The talented Meni Suvari is agreeably sincere in the central role but does feel a little misscast. Her turn is better than what the stereotypically thin material and there's no social commentary here and lazy script It's complicated offers up. The performances are mediocre at best but some do standout more than others like Nick Cannon as a macho guntooting soldier with a smart attitude Stark Sands as the clumsy private and Ian McNeice as the town's radio DJ. As for Ving Rhames he's wasted in what ends up as a nothing part for such an infamous character.Director Steve Miner's orthodox if tight handling is broken up by kinetic editing flash camera tilts that keep on the move and jerky action placement where surprisingly random stages manage to hold a certain amount of chaotic tension. At least the story gets right into it and at only 80 minutes it doesn't seem to sag much well towards the end its persistent style wears thin and the ending was feebly done. Now the bloodsoaked gore naming its self under day wasn't good. While having moments of bloody carnage and some decent makeup FX it's rather watereddown with overthetop CGI taking over the show. The CGI wasn't bad but it's no substitute for latex.Sure it doesn't come close to the 'Dead' franchise and as it stands it better off as a standalone but for cheap quick brainless entertainment it's adequately done.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I started watching this movie I was a tad worried it being a remake of one of my favourite zombie movies of all time however I found myself kinda enjoying it. That is until the zombies came out to play. Really what were the cast and crew thinking when they were making this? Nothing was done well even the presence of Mena Suvari could not save the movie from the dregs of shoddiness. Bad CGI wooden acting zombies with superhuman abilities a lazy script and clichd characters all contribute to make this remake a mess. I mention remake that way because it bears very little similarity to George A. Romero's dark violent claustrophobic 1985 film. The nods to the original include character's names one line spoken by the main character and the last 20 minutes being set in an underground bunker.Day of the Dead opens with four teenagers in the woods doing what any teen in a horror movie would be doing. Meanwhile the army have got the city quarantined due to a flu outbreak although we know it is so much more than that. Corporal Sarah Bowman Mena Suvari is put in charge of three younger soldiers although one disappears after a minute introduction. She takes one of the them Bub Stark Sands to pick up her sick mother and take her to the local medical centre. Along for the ride is her younger brother Trevor Michael Welch and his girl Nina AnnaLynne McCord. When they arrive at the hospital all hell breaks loose when the virus is unleashed and turns most of the town into zombies. From here on the movie is a standard actionhorror flick with the survivors going from one place to another trying to find shelter.First things first the zombies in this film are stupid creations. I do not know who thought that zombies should be able to not only run but climb walls and ceilings jump out of twostory windows without damage drive cars and shoot machine guns. These were like superzombies that for some reason decayed massively when they turned but lost no strength. No explanation was given for these zombies except for the fact it was a biochemical weapon surprise. Not only were the undead unbelievable but they were CGI...and bad CGI at that. I have never seen so much digital blood and gore it was poor and only added to the straighttoDVD feel. The entire cast were bad Mena Suvari looked like she just needed the money as her performance was dull and bythenumbers. Nick Cannon should never be allowed to act but he was not assisted by the dumb script with some appalling oneliners by the power of grey skull? and rather confusing scenes of civilians becoming master gunman in mere seconds.Basically this is a bad movie whether you consider it a remake of Romero's film or a standalone zombie flick. It is not even so bad it's funny it is just bad. Sure it is not the worst movie ever made and it is fast paced enough to never become boring but there are so many other zombie movies out there that Steve Miner's Day of the Dead should be at the bottom of the needtosee list.5".

These were like superzombies that for some reason decayed massively when they turned but lost no strength. No explanation was given for these zombies except for the fact it was a biochemical weapon surprise. Not only were the undead unbelievable but they were CGI...and bad CGI at that. I have never seen so much digital blood and gore it was poor and only added to the straighttoDVD feel. The entire cast were bad Mena Suvari looked like she just needed the money as her performance was dull and bythenumbers. Nick Cannon should never be allowed to act but he was not assisted by the dumb script with some appalling oneliners by the power of grey skull? and rather confusing scenes of civilians becoming master gunman in mere seconds.Basically this is a bad movie whether you consider it a remake of Romero's film or a standalone zombie flick. It is not even so bad it's funny it is just bad. Sure it is not the worst movie ever made and it is fast paced enough to never become boring but there are so many other zombie movies out there that Steve Miner's Day of the Dead should be at the bottom of the needtosee list.5";

	schema:reviewBody "A Film by Steve Miner. Now let's begin there. I honestly like Steve Miner. He's directed Soul Man Friday the 13th parts 2 and 3 as well as producing the original and The Last House on the Left. That's not a bad resume. That aside he hasn't done anything worth noting in about 20 years. Screenplay is by Jeffrey Reddick who wrote all the Final Destination screenplays so that can't be too bad right?Let's talk casting. Mena Suvari American Beauty Spun Nick Cannon Drumline Michael Welch Joan of Arcadia AnnaLynne McCord Made quite a splash on NipTuck last year Ian McNeice HBO's Rome Ving Rhames Mission ImpossibleAltogether not a bad looking cast.So that in mind we start the film...We begin our journey on a lighter note typical of the '80s slasher flicks in an abandoned barn in Leadville Colorado. Full of candles and horny teenagers and there's nothing wrong with that. One couple decides to explore the rather creepy barn.The movie actually starts out alright. Decent directing acting dialog if it keeps up like this it might not be such a bad movie after all... but lets keep watching... where angels fear to tread...First lets discuss spider monkey zombies. Now we have become so accustomed to Romero's slow moving zombies that the atmosphere has been set in stone for the standard but I see nothing wrong with trying new things in horror in fact I long for it. Now this isn't the first time fast moving zombies have been done but it was probably the best explained of the type out of the ones I've seen.The first few kills are fantastic and holy the zombies were pretty scary and in all honesty I haven't been scared of a zombie in a long time.But the show must go on even if it goes on like spider monkey zombies on crack.If you want this to be just like the original go watch the original. I have yet to read one decent complaint about the movie. The faces decaying rapidly through the change was really unique I don't think I've ever seen that used before so I thought that was pretty cool.I actually enjoyed the movie for what it was. It had good pacing took liberties and took zombies into a new direction which is pretty hard to do these days. I've seen a lot worse. A whole lot worse. I love how the people who can't let go of the idea of walking zombies thinks walking zombies is more realistic like any kind of zombie can be realistic. If this movie had not been called Day of the Dead I guarantee it would have been better received because die hard fans expected it to stay true to Romero's zombie mythology which it did not do.And though this was not adhering to Romero's preconceptions it had a few things going for it. It brought it's own ideas to the table which worked. Such as the people going blank just before turning. As the last particle in the blood stream switched them on. I thought that was rather realistic and a nice little piece of detail. The action was fairly non stop with good pacing. And in all honesty it was far more enjoyable than Diary of the Dead. A movie that turned out to be a huge disappointment as was Argento's latest installment Mother of Tears. The two horror masters have taught a new generation well it seems.Now not to downplay Romero the original Night of the Living Dead is a classic that will likely never be topped. And the mood of the original Dawn of the Dead is intensely scary but for a direct to video movie it was pretty good.Now the idea of When there's no room in hell the dead will walk the earth was never intended to be true. It is the religious reasoning to unreasonable things. But we also must conclude that there is a scientific explanation as well and zombie movies these days attempt to take the genre in a direction of the more realistic explanation.And it isn't specific to the horror genre either. We see how it worked for Ang Lee's Hulk and Nolan's Batman we must be able to appreciate it here as well.For all the differences between this and Romero the one that stands out the most in my mind is the lack of political and philosophical importance which Romero is famous for including in his films. And while I respect that in a film though this remake lacked that angle entirely it was at least enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "In my review of the original DAY OF THE DEAD I suggested if there was a better screenplay and better actors it would have been a very good film . As it stood it was the least of George A Romero's zombie trilogy . I didn't know that there had been a remake until it appeared on tonight's schedule on one of the minor ITV channels so I checked it out on this page and was pleased to see its budget was quoted as being 18 million dollars  along with a cast featuring actors I'd seen in other movies . Certainly this made me optimistic that this version  if not surpassing the original in every field  would at least have improved production standards One warning sign appeared at the opening credits .  Produced by Boaz Davidson  a man responsible for bringing such disasters to cable TV stations and DVD stores as CROCODILE 2DEATH SWAMP and SHARK ATTACK 3 . This didn't look too promising  especially when you don't see the name of George A Remero appear . Early in to the film something else became painfully clear and that is it doesn't sit anywhere in the continuity of the DEAD universe . The original film had the entire human race facing its last days as the zombies outnumbered them 400000 to every human . Here the movie starts with the National Guard quarantining an area of Colorado . I had thought maybe we'd be watching something similar to THE CRAZIES but the more the story continues the more you realise that Romero's subversive and nihilistic hand hasn't touched the film and is a straight forward zombie horror Taken on its own terms then DAY OF THE DEAD isn't too bad but neither is it great . Danny Boyle was accused of ripping off the original DAY OF THE DEAD with 28 DAYS LATER and since then horror movie producers have returned the favour by making every zombie run faster than Usain Bolt on steroids . The ones seen here can also jump around like Carl Lewis which makes them extremely formidable foes for the humans to battle . The film works best when the people at the hospital become zombified and attack the humans . Watching this happen is similar to watching the alluded to scenes of 28 DAYS LATER when Jim lies in a coma . Unfortunately  and perhaps understandably  the film is unable to keep up this pace and just becomes a long sequence of  How are our heroes going to get out of this one ?  So in conclusion DAY OF HE DEAD isn't so terrible but isn't great either . Romero's lack of involvement is very much a mixed blessing . He's not a great director but it he is a very good ideas man and one had wished he could have contributed to the screenplay at least . As it stands this isn't a remake  or even a reworking of it  and anyone coming to it thinking it has something to do with the DEAD trilogy might feel a little bit disappointed not to mention cheated".

I don't think anyone should do a remake unless they stick to the original story and double the original budget...and leave the computer effects out.Not that this is really a remake as it has nothing to do with the original with the exception of zombies and the docile zombie BudBub. This could have done very well on it's own not really needing to associate itself with the superior original. I usually rant and rave against remakes but i actually liked this one. I just mentally removed the fact that it was a remake of the kicka original sat back and enjoyed it for what it was...a low budget zombie flick. And you have to remember Land of the Dead was pretty craptacular so even Romero seems to have lost his edge...probably some years ago.I have to address the key issue with the Humvee though. Anyone in the military would know that in a civilian setting if you left your vehicle you would padlock the steering wheel if you had to leave it. Seeing as you don't need a key to start it anyone could take it. Also if these guys are in the Army the hats are wrong berets as are the tshirts brown not blackblack is Air Force. I could go on because military inconsistencies really bother me but I leave it with the prior two.While the hyper speed freak zombie creatures are so popular at the moment I still don't like them. Why do they need to crawl walls and super jump? How does a virus change the human form so drastically that this is possible? Things like this really bother me. Logic people logic! Negatives aside I still like this movie. The acting wasn't all that bad for this caliber of film. I didn't think the script was too shoddy either certainly there is far worse. I really enjoyed the FX because of the use of REAL latex not CGI garbage. There was some CGI but it was far better than usually used in this caliber of film.Go into this with no connection to the original and you will enjoy it. Eventually someone will come to the rescue of the zombie genre and right things.".

This could have done very well on it's own not really needing to associate itself with the superior original. I usually rant and rave against remakes but i actually liked this one. I just mentally removed the fact that it was a remake of the kicka original sat back and enjoyed it for what it was...a low budget zombie flick. And you have to remember Land of the Dead was pretty craptacular so even Romero seems to have lost his edge...probably some years ago.I have to address the key issue with the Humvee though. Anyone in the military would know that in a civilian setting if you left your vehicle you would padlock the steering wheel if you had to leave it. Seeing as you don't need a key to start it anyone could take it. Also if these guys are in the Army the hats are wrong berets as are the tshirts brown not blackblack is Air Force. I could go on because military inconsistencies really bother me but I leave it with the prior two.While the hyper speed freak zombie creatures are so popular at the moment I still don't like them. Why do they need to crawl walls and super jump? How does a virus change the human form so drastically that this is possible? Things like this really bother me. Logic people logic! Negatives aside I still like this movie. The acting wasn't all that bad for this caliber of film. I didn't think the script was too shoddy either certainly there is far worse. I really enjoyed the FX because of the use of REAL latex not CGI garbage. There was some CGI but it was far better than usually used in this caliber of film.Go into this with no connection to the original and you will enjoy it. Eventually someone will come to the rescue of the zombie genre and right things.";

This movie however is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is bad for a zombie it is bad for any movie i'd rather watch godfather 3 than watch this hell i'd rather watch Santa Claus Vs the Martians. You are undoubtedly think it can't be that bad but you'd be wrong. Where to begin well this movie bears not relation to the plot of Day of the Dead and seems like a poor cash in by the copyright holder of that on the success of the Dawn of the Dead remake also starring Ving Rhames but more of that later. The plot actually feels like it was lifted from the Res Evil games meshing elements of 1 2 and 3 the military quarantine a town virus runs amok secret experiments etc. This might fill you with hope if it does your'll be sorely disappointed. So whats wrong with the film well the acting is bad even for a zombie movie the script can only of been written by a child or a group of the higher primates and if its the latter then i guess that would deserve some respect and the camerawork and editing is so bad at points its hard to tell whats happening. The cardboard characters consists of three marines how they became marines is beyond me of Mena Suvari as Jill valentine coming back to her hometown after leaving apparently its complicated but never explains why a Ghetto Stereotype and newbie aka zombie bait aka bub the only reference to the original an evil government doctor who habitually lies for no apparent reason like claim not to have a car and is evil to emphasis this a nurse begs for help by his car in the zombie infested parking lot but he just pushes to some waiting zombies for some reason? plus some towns folk like Mena's brother and his girlfriend or something. At this point you might be wondering why i haven't mention Ving Rhames character Black Authority figure thats because it really was only a cameo no doubt in a effort to link this to the Dawn of the Dead remake he appeared in when the best character in a zombie movie dies 5 minutes in to the actually zombie attack you got start questioning the film. So after what is a pretty terrible build up apparently stoners can hang out at abandon missile silos housing secret military labs who knew?At the hospital you half expect Hugh Laurie to gait by on his cane as the film liberal steals ahem homages from House with a scene apparently show the activation of the virus. Most of the special effects are sub par not bad enough to make you laugh just poor and i expect this was because they wasted most of the SFX budget on the House cgi. So the zombies aren't zombies not really coming somewhere between the comedy zombies of night of the living dead and the those of 28 days later but what they most remind you of is deadites and its at this point you realise this movie could of been awesome if they had cast Bruce Campbell and rather than stealing the plot of Res Evil stole the plot of Fistful of Broomsticks but alas this is not to be. The Zombies have superpowers like crawling on ceilings are smart they can hide bodies in cupboards pretend to be a corpse understand directions given over a radio and in the case of one zombie dodge bullets like Neo honestly though he is apparently the zombie messiah since scientists are know for the physical prowess oh and they fall in love zombie love story i wonder if the zombie virus can be sexually transmitted?. Thats right Bub the newbie moron soldier get bitten and smitten and apparently doesn't attack people because he was a vegetarian in life. However Bub does reckon the best part of this movie Mena Suvari arse thats it the sole good point of this movie is her Arse for the ladies there's nothing unless your into black stereotypes women or rotting corpses in which case you got a whole other set of problems. This movie is like a parody without the comedy the only way this could be redeemed is by a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 commentary or if they recut it to star Bruce Campbell.In conclusion if you like Mena Suvari rent American Pie or Beauty if you like Zombies rent the original.".

Anyone that has enjoyed Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror or Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later will easily enjoy this movie even if it doesn't quite reach the quality of these 2 named movies it is acceptably close.The scares were plentiful and the tension was kept high throughout. The comic relief character you'll know whom I refer to adds some wellneeded appropriate humor moments to help soften the tight tension that is built throughout.Mena Suvari was great and convincing in her military role. Ving Rhames is as always very solid I only wish his role had been bigger but still a nice contribution to the flick. And frankly the whole ensemble of supporting actors were great but I don't want to spoil your experience by describing too much. If you like horroradventures this movie will be very satisfactory.My one complaint is simply in the attempt to market this movie as a remake of the original Day of the Dead which frankly seems pretty inaccurate as aside from containing zombies the plot has nearly no resemblance whatsoever to George Romero's original zombie movie.
