The gay scene in Crusing is sheer hell and I have to believe that it reflected the Country's mood of the day. In not such subtle ways Cruising tells us about the depravity of one group threatening the other. If you think I'm wrong why then the gay sex and enviroment is wrapped in violent rock music in which actual feelings are not even present but the heterosexual sex scenes between  the always wonderful Al Pacino and the beautiful Karen Allen are wrapped in lyrical classical music all feeling tenderness and light. As soon as the film ended I had to wash my face and pour myself a double scotch on the rocks. I was kind of angry and definitely disturbed. Oops maybe I recommending Cruising without meaning to.".

I very much doubt that Pacino or Sorvino regret making this film. It is riveting. For one characters are not even gray they are a mystery. Sorvino's character for instance is so blank that you even wonder if he cares about anything including Burns' fate. Pacino's character is pretty ambitious but other than that he is completely controversial. Although he shows some kind of goodness towards his neighbor for instance the ending even kinda questions that was it because he had sexual intentions with the guy or that he just wanted to do some good?. Also he sometimes feels overwhelmed by the undercover job I don't know if I can do this but then he starts to adapt. One of the possible ideas of this movie is you dance with the devil and then you start to like it. In any case it leaves conclusions to the viewer. The atmosphere and especially the music are truly amazing and original. 910".

	schema:headline " a feelbad epic from a subversive misanthrope";
	schema:reviewBody "William Friedkin is a mysterious often mystifying filmmaker. Although he rose to prominence at the same time as the rest of the socalled 'movie brat' generation of directors Coppola Spielberg Scorsese DePalma et al. he stands apart even from a group as essentially disparate as this one. For one thing his films lack the intertextual references and cinematic stylisation common to most of the other members. If he has an overriding aesthetic it would be the ugliness of the majority of human existence. He's not interested in prettifying his images or indulging in styleforstyle's sake which is not to say that his film's don't exhibit inventive and effective technique just that this technique is always at the service of the story he's telling and is often blunt and brutally effective in it's employment. All of this no doubt arises from his start in documentary filmmaking. Friedkin is particularly good at depicting the menace of urban environments and the locales of a lot of his films are frightening tangibly real places. Witness the sequences involving Karras' aged mother in 'The Exorcist' which for me are the most disturbing scenes in an often terrifying film. As we observe the elderly lady living alone in her shabby apartment in a crimeridden neighbourhood we realise that this is the existence that many millions of people are forced to endure and it's oppressiveness adds immeasurably to the psychological impact of the film as a whole. We share Karras' fear and traumatising guilt that she died alone in such circumstances and the special effects trickery of the climax is lent a genuine resonance. Because of the stark seemingly 'artless' force and apparent misanthropy of much of his work a number of otherwise perceptive commentators dislike Friedkin intensely. Pauline Kael was extremely cool about 'The French Connection' and absolutely hated 'The Exorcist'. David Thompson described him as essentially incompetent bludgeoning the audience with blatant and obvious effects. In fact Friedkin's best work is highly sophisticated in it's use of sound and music and employs often visceral imagery to telling and subversive effect. However some of his films ARE genuinely bloody awful or at least depressingly mediocre. The very inconsistency of his work lies at the centre of the mystery that is his career. He seems to me to be a fiercely intelligent man whose art is driven by his life rather than the culture of film and whose reportedly quixotic often selfdestructive personality in no small measure accounts for the expansive peaks and troughs of his cinematic achievements. Friedkin has reassuring or comforting his audience way down the list of his priorities. In the case of 'Cruising' he neglected to add them at all. Because of this 'Cruising' is a very difficult film to watch. Most filmmakers were they making a film set in such an alien and frightening environment would go overboard on providing us with at least one protagonist we could identify with. But Friedkin takes the very opposite route and presents us entirely with characters who are abhorrent sleazy or totally ambiguous. Indeed ambiguity is the film's raison d'etre  we are never sure of anything and this becomes both the pictures great strength and source of much audience frustration. It seems that unlike say Spielberg who continually seeks the approbation of his audience Friedkin actively resents his or rather their preconceptions and certainties leading him to consistently challenge and upset them. This can be exciting to those who value such seditious manouveres but dispiriting and destabilising for those that don't.The major problem with evaluating 'Cruising' is that the film as it currently exists is seriously incomplete apparently having been shorn of some 40 minutes of footage by the censors!. I suspect that a 'directors cut' should it ever emerge although no doubt clarifying certain issues would overall fail to dispel the central ambiguity that is so infuriating and troubling to the majority of the audience and that lies at the heart of Friedkins vision. What interests me is the very thin line between good and evil the director once said when asked to provide a thematic overview of his work  and this is the core of 'Cruising'.I would urge you to watch the film. It is a uniquely dark brave piece somewhat compromised by well documented production difficulties and the censors scissors. It has a sinister compelling momentum and wonderfully ugly grainy textures that seep into your pores leaving you uncomfortable and unsettled. Sometimes a feelbad movie can be as bracing as a winter morning. 'Cruising' is such an experience and a fascinating provocative one at that.".

If I had never seen this movie the reviews left about it everywhere on the net would surely have made me miss it at every opportunity but luckily I only came across them looking for more information after its viewing.The first thing that really got me was the fantastic soundtrack. This is American punk rock at it's best and most glorious and I cannot think of a more apt context for it than the New York gay SM scene. This my friends ... is punkorama.This is not a gay film ... nor is it a porno film ... this is an in your face horror much like William Friedkin's other classic The Exorcist ... but not a hammer horror nor a gore filled voyage through some fiery kissing the devil's ass hell but a very real slice of a very real life that exists in every major city in the world as well as some smaller ones. This is a film about a world so few know anything about that it is far above common criticism ... yet at the same time the directions and nuances are all too common. I would say that any fans of the movies of David Lynch might enjoy the somewhat lost disenchantment of this flick as it slides further and further into the darkest realms of the grotesque. As well anyone who's enjoyed the backwards pleasures of watching the cult classic Je'Taime ... Moi Ne Plus starring Jane Birkin would also find a little gem here.Cruisin' is pure subversive genius.Futuristsurrealism!Pure ART".

This my friends ... is punkorama.This is not a gay film ... nor is it a porno film ... this is an in your face horror much like William Friedkin's other classic The Exorcist ... but not a hammer horror nor a gore filled voyage through some fiery kissing the devil's ass hell but a very real slice of a very real life that exists in every major city in the world as well as some smaller ones. This is a film about a world so few know anything about that it is far above common criticism ... yet at the same time the directions and nuances are all too common. I would say that any fans of the movies of David Lynch might enjoy the somewhat lost disenchantment of this flick as it slides further and further into the darkest realms of the grotesque. As well anyone who's enjoyed the backwards pleasures of watching the cult classic Je'Taime ... Moi Ne Plus starring Jane Birkin would also find a little gem here.Cruisin' is pure subversive genius.Futuristsurrealism!Pure ART";

	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost Cruising is not a film about gay men in general. Friedkin explains this perfectly on the DVD  it's a murder mystery of a cop going undercover that just happens to have a gay element in it. To those familiar with the 70s Italian giallos Cruising is a U.S. giallo  a successful combination of murder mystery sex alternative lifestyles and subcultures with that and how getting into something too out of your element can affect you. Unlike the Italian giallos that often featured a gratuitous lesbian tease Cruising gave us a masculine leather theme instead.The controversy and protests surrounding Cruising were based on misinformation and unfairly gave the film a bad reputation though lately many critics that originally panned it have since recanted their negative comments finding more to appreciate about the film.Two things factored into why people were uncomfortable with Cruising First the murder story was not the real reason. Frankly they saw not effeminate stereotypes but masculine gay men dancing kissing and experiencing SM activities. When gay characters are weak and fey many heterosexual men feel safe. They want nonthreatening characters that will be kept in their place. The disclaimer that appeared before the film that has thankfully been removed on the DVD was to appease gay men that felt the film would be perceived as a representation of the whole gay community. If that's the case then films like The Birdcage and TV's Will  Grace should have disclaimers as well that say not all gay men are effeminate fingersnappers that watch Desperate Housewives are drag queens nor are FABulous wellgroomed cleanshaven cutie boys.Second the locations and activity in the bars was as it actually was and still is to a degree in many places. The characters and extras were real for this story  bearded leathermen enjoying what they do instead of buffed party circuit boys dancing to the latest diva tunes. To add to the darkness and mood of the story the bars were blasting with serious harddriven songs by Willy DeVille John Hiatt Rough Trade The Germs The Cripples and others instead of loopy diva dance music. Some gay men as well as straight had a problem with this thinking it was not a decent representation of what gay men should listen to. To date this is still one of the coolest soundtracks around I cherish my vinyl LP copies of it.Yes this film was brutal. It will leave an impression on you. THAT'S A GOOD THING! It's what film is supposed to do. Amidst all this the journey of Al Pacino's out of his element slip into a different mindset was a great touch. It affected his whole being his treatment of his girlfriend his whole outlook. And it wasn't just because he got to dance with some leathermen it was because the murder investigation he was doing was so horrifying. What you were expecting a sweet ending? The only reasons Pacino distanced himself from this film was because footage was cut that he felt fleshed out his character better and the protests during filming distressed him.And think of it this way if this were a film about lesbians it would be hailed by hetero guys as an erotic masterpiece. But when it's about masculine gay men it seems hard for some of them to handle it. This may sound clich but I know many straight guys that actually understood Cruising and have told me on IMDb as well as in person they thought it was quite a cool film.After all these years Cruising still packs a punch and does what it sets out to do unnerve you. It's a taut thriller and a mindblower in its complexities. That's quite an achievement and while many films are forgotten this one still seems to be well remembered no matter what. I for one love this film and think Friedkin and company deserve much praise for their effort.The DVD released in 2007 can be considered a bit of a director's cut since Friedkin made some additions and changes. For a thorough article on the exact changes and where they occur check out the magazine Video Watchdog 152 November 2009.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler Alert I write this because this film was one of the most engrossing and powerful films I have seen in recent memory. I also write about this film as its pedigree is amazing. And finally I can't believe I've not heard of it even in a Heavens Gate this must have been professional suicide sort of capacity.The film is from 1980 and it is directed by William Friedkin Exorcist  The French Connection. It stars one Al Pacino no C.V. required. It is called Cruising. Basically it is the story of a gay serial killer and Al Pacino is the cop who must go undercover to try and find him.I was a bit drunk a bit stoned and a bit bored when I was channel flicking one night in UK. I came across the start of this movie. The story starts in a club in New York that is very much like the Blue Parrot in the Police Academy movies except there is nothing funny about this place. It is a proper underground S  M gay club where anything goes. A young Italian Stallion picks up a guy who is in the full leather get up. Cap and glasses obscuring his face and chains that clink whenever he walks. They go back to the stallions flat. Off screen sex occurs. The next shot is the young guy naked having his hands tied behind his back. He doesn't like this but is being talked into it by Chains. Next Chains draws a thin knife from his boots and starts playing with it. Young guy is frantic now and begs to be let out but Chains is now teasing him. Chains then stabs the young guy repeatedly in the back. This is graphically shot and you see the knife going in and the young guy screaming. This was a really really intense scene. I was now hooked on the story and had to know where it ended.I am not gay and I am liberally minded. Having been to Thailand Ibiza and Amsterdam I have had my arse felt a few times in dance clubs. I am not bothered by this as long as it stays each to their own but I have no knowledge of the proper underground gay scene. The closest I get is working with a gay man at work and enjoying watching Will  Grace. Like the brilliant 8 Mile this film was an introduction to a world I knew nothing about. The depiction of the activities in the Gay Club left nothing to the imagination. Never shown but implied were scenes of fisting and watersports. This as well the very graphic violence meant this film was still quite close to the bone no pun intended! in 2003 so I could barely imagine what an impact this had in 1980's America.The police are now on the case but more gay men start turning up brutally stabbed. A Harvard professor has already been murdered and a Hollywood stylist gets brutally stabbed in a cheap peep joint when he had been picking up a stars dress for an awards ceremony. These are respectable people who were not known to be involved in this extreme scene so the political pressure gets turned up.In comes Al to the proceedings. He wants to be a detective but hasn't been given his chance yet. He is offered accelerated promotion to Detective branch if he agrees to go undercover as he is the same type of Italian Stallion that the perp seems to target. What comes next is a wonderful example of both acting and directing as young naive straight Al Pacino starts his undercover role. Reporting only to his chief Paul Sorvino and getting set up in a flat in a gay area of New York it is riveting stuff to see Al Pacino learn from his mistakes when he visits the gay club. He learns that different coloured neckscarfes worn in either the left back pocket or the right back pocket mean a different sexual taste! It is funny in a black comedy way watching him try to pick some one up to see if they are the killer when it is quite clear he doesn't want to pick them up because he is not gay.Al has a girlfriend played by Karen Allen who only knows he is undercover but she doesn't know where or what he is doing. Al's character starts to go deepcover and begins to lose himself in the culture. He starts to empathise with the gay community and even gets hassled by prejudice cops. This is brilliantly handled by the director and the actor. A sympathetic approach to hardcore homosexuality in 1980? No wonder it disappeared.Meanwhile the killer is still on the loose. You see Chains picking people up in parks and by toilets or you see him visiting the bar. You can never see him properly. You can only hear the distinctive clink of his chains. This started to make me apprehensive whenever I heard the rattle of his chains. Now that's good direction!Al Pacino starts to lose himself as he goes deepcover but starts making progress on the case. I wont give away anymore in case someone watches it.I found this movie to be a really rewarding experience. It reminded me why I love movies in the first place. It is not an easy movie to watch and its subject matter is made to make you squirm but this movie really got to me! To watch all the way through when all I was doing was channel flicking is a real test of a movies quality in my humble opinion.So there you go. Not a new movie but a bloody good one that most people may have missed. IMDb has not been too kind to it but hey what do I know?".

	schema:reviewBody "I was ten years old and an old movie house not far from my home was playing a double feature. It was Empire Strikes Back and Cruising. After nagging to my grandma for days she took me and a friend because we were huge Star Wars fans. The matine was at 1200 p.m. and they started with Cruising. The movie starts the place is packed and the bar scene were the killer picks up his first victim plays and my grandma storms out of place with me and my friend and I don't know if the guy my grandma confronted was the manager or the ticket seller but she ripped him a new one. She told him that he was trash that she was going to call the cops that he was not a man everything. My friend and me were stunned and beg my grandma to calm down and wait in the lobby till Cruising was over. We waited and we saw Empire. It is disturbing that the place was full of little kids and nobody else walked out. Anyway I tracked the movie down when I was in college and watched it.It still is a shocking experience and the bad reputation that this movie earned is a little uncalled for because I think Friedkin captures the reality of that world as it is. My cousin had a friend who was homosexual and part of the SM leather gay culture. He was a flight attendant and whenever he flew to New York went to this clubs and my cousin tells me that the things his friend told him pale in comparison to what Friedkin shows us. The flight attendant died of AIDS in 1983. Pacino and his perm realistically portray the confused cop that ultimately becomes a killer out of the brutal repression his gay feelings suffer. This movie after 25 years continues to provoke discussions among film fans and any movie that does that is a good film. I really would like a DVD of this movie with a few extras to witness the backlash this film created. Watch it and witness the closing of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s in this murder mystery that will no doubt open your eyes to the brutal the cruel misunderstood and innocent sides of human beings. P.S. Nobody complained in 1984's Police Academy which the Blue Oyster Bar about the portrayals of leather gay men. BA BA BA BUM BA BA BA BA BA BUM BA BA BAM PARARARARARARARA.theme song.

It is disturbing that the place was full of little kids and nobody else walked out. Anyway I tracked the movie down when I was in college and watched it.It still is a shocking experience and the bad reputation that this movie earned is a little uncalled for because I think Friedkin captures the reality of that world as it is. My cousin had a friend who was homosexual and part of the SM leather gay culture. He was a flight attendant and whenever he flew to New York went to this clubs and my cousin tells me that the things his friend told him pale in comparison to what Friedkin shows us. The flight attendant died of AIDS in 1983. Pacino and his perm realistically portray the confused cop that ultimately becomes a killer out of the brutal repression his gay feelings suffer. This movie after 25 years continues to provoke discussions among film fans and any movie that does that is a good film. I really would like a DVD of this movie with a few extras to witness the backlash this film created. Watch it and witness the closing of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s in this murder mystery that will no doubt open your eyes to the brutal the cruel misunderstood and innocent sides of human beings. P.S. Nobody complained in 1984's Police Academy which the Blue Oyster Bar about the portrayals of leather gay men. BA BA BA BUM BA BA BA BA BA BUM BA BA BAM PARARARARARARARA.theme song. I know I'm an idiot.";

An ambitious young cop goes undercover and hangs out at the gay bars and nightspots to lure the killer out but finds himself being changed by the scene he becomes part of.Based on a book by Gerald Walker this is an intriguing and daring for the time delve into the NYC homo underground of leather bars and pickups in Central Park and is a great preAids snapshot of a particular era of the city's history. Unfortunately as a crime thriller it's pretty pedestrian the murders are bland the investigation boring and the suggestive ending just plain confusing. Friedkin is a very stylish director but here he deliberately abandons that for a documentarylike approach this adds to the drama but kills any suspense although James Contner's ultradark photography is terrific. Pacino is likeably believable Sorvino does a gritty textbook job of a police captain who hasn't slept in a week and the supporting cast are good. Ultimately however this film is more interesting as a prepoliticalcorrectness depiction of a particularly sordid corner of society. As with other urbanghetto films of the time Busting Fort Apache  The Bronx etc it was crucified by the white liberal arts media as queerbashing propaganda but of course it's not  they just didn't like the way it depicts the specific social scene the story is set amongst.

The story centers around Al Pacino going undercover to find a serial killer in the gay BDSM culture of late 70's NYC. The story seems simply enough right? Well it's deceiving as what Friedkin does is take the audience into a dark abyss of sordid sex extreme debauchery and brutal violence. It is quite honestly one of the more uncomfortable American films of the period to sit through.The problem with the picture are the character motivations are vague for virtually all involved Pacino the killer and the police chief. Why is the killer doing this? Why is Pacino starting to lose it? What is the deal with the police chief? Does he care about Pacino or not? Everything is so opaque and mysterious that the film is both fascinating and aggravating at the same time. And perhaps that was done on purpose but considering reportedly 40 minutes was cut from the film I would imagine that many of those questions I posed were more clear. The ending itself is even more strange and confusing and I would suspect that while the ending wouldn't have been wrapped up in a nice little bow for the audience nor would I expect that in a Friedkin film the viewer could at least attempt to make more sense of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A deranged serial killer is on the loose and is killing patrons of gay SM clubs. Officer Steve BurnsAl Pacino is chosen by the chief of police to go undercover as a gay male and find this mad man. The idea of going undercover to Burns at first sounds simple enough. However this new bizarre world he has become a part of slowly begins to affect his mind and his psyche as he begins to question many things about himself and what he thought that he was before. Before he was simply just playing a role but soon his work completely takes over his life as he becomes a part of the gay underground world.William Friedkin's early80s shocker CRUISING has been called one of the most despicable and offensive films ever to be put out by a major motion picture studio. It's been voted as one of the most homophobic films ever made along with Paul Verhoeven's trash classic BASIC INSTINCT and Gaspar Noe's experimental revenge thriller IRREVERSIBLE. While I can certainly understand where the hatred for this film is coming from I still find it to be a very effective and haunting piece of filmmaking.I found the scenes involving Al Pacino at the clubs to be so full of realism and so raw that at times it was difficult to watch. These scenes are where the true horror of the film come to life. So much of what he sees disturbs him and indeed it disturbs us as well. The several glimpses of public sexoral sex anal sex fisting BDSM etc in these leather clubs are stomach churning in how different the world of these places are to everyday life.The whole film is quite disturbing and fascinating to watch all the same but the explicit nature of the scenes as well as Al Pacino's reaction to them give the film a real documentarylike sense of realism. The scenes in which the serial killer strikes are equally disturbing in their realism. They come off extraordinary in the blunt and heartless way they are shown. The fact that multiple frames of gay pornography are spliced into the gory violence further makes clear the idea of the knife penetrating the body and at the same time will probably raise a few eyebrows from many folks who are offended at such gestures.Indeed this is definitely a film that tends to be gleefully tasteless at times. I am certainly not surprised that many folks found the film so offensive. The gay lifestyle is not depicted in a particularly positive light. Most of the gay characters in the film are either perverted violent rude or insane. The sole gay character who seems to be a shining light of purity is Pacino's neighbor in the film Ted Bailey Don Scardino a rather young and sweetnatured writer who is terrified of the leather bars. Ted is the one lamb in the crowd of vicious billy goats so to speak.Despite the Ted character and despite the raw visual style of the film the scenes of actual police procedure come of a tad weak when juxtapose with the scenes in the leather bars. While they do have just as much an uncanny realism to them as the undercover scenes they feel a bit lifeless and ugly. In addition Karen Allen in the role of Pacino's wife comes off slightly overshadowed alongside the other bizarre and interesting characters in the film. Despite this however she does help make the climax of the film far more terrifying and shocking.Despite the homophobia and despite the flaws CRUISING is a fascinating film. It remains one of the darkest and most challenging mainstream films I've ever seen. I loved the realism of the film and I loved how shocking the last hour was in particular. It is definitely a film that works! While I can't say that I would be able to fully stomach a second viewing I can safely say that it is a film that will affect you whether you love it or hate it. You will not forget this film very easily.".

Therefore leaving out is stronger in terms of storytelling than showing. Quite the contrary to contemporary movies I'd say. The advantage of this story is thus the suspense built up on lack of knowledge. There is no flirting with the audience you do not know in advance who dunnit.

With no leads in the case Captain Edelson offers Officer Steve Burns the chance to go undercover on the basis that Steve looks similar to the victims that the killer tends to pick.  Steve goes undercover with no badge and no gun only reporting to Edelson meanwhile the murders continue as Steve begins to lose himself little by little.I had never seen this film until just a few weeks ago but I was looking forward to it as I remember it being one of the movies that was reviewed by critic Mark Kermode on his cult corner' he used to do as a weekly part of a radio 1 show  he liked it and generally I trust him.  The film opens with a similar enough premise cop goes undercover to try and catch a killer.  We have all seen this genre before and think we know where it is going to go  cop will start to go native' gradually and will struggle with it even after he has caught the killer  right? Well yes and no.  The film tries to do this but it manages to make a real pigs ear of it throughout coming across like it really didn't know what it wanted to do.  I am aware that there is another version of this out there somewhere and that this was mercilessly edited but I cannot know that that would be any better without seeing it.The film is all over the place.  Burns' investigation goes nowhere for the vast majority of the time and just seems to focus on gay clubs with lots of men in leather or jock straps.  Meanwhile the killer continues to carry out his murders and the rest of the police sort of float around in the background.  It is difficult to really get into the film because the narrative is so very disjointed and it is almost impossible to have anything to follow or care about basically the first 90 minutes is there's a guy out there killing and a cop going to gay clubs  oh look what they do' and then the final 20 minutes is oh we got him now'  and that's it!  So with no traditional narrative I assume that the film wanted us to follow the character of Steve. However Steve is a nonentity even being played by Pacino!  He has no character and we see nothing to suggest that he is really being either attracted or repulsed by the life he sees.  The end of the film is so open in regards him and just doesn't make sense.  With these two threads going nowhere all that remains is a film that looks at the gay scene in the city.In this regard I was worried that it was going to be all PC when the film opening with a disclaimer that I assume was put on to placate gay groups. However I immediately understood why the makers had put this caption onto the film  and it wasn't even enough!  The homosexuals in this film are to a man deviants who all hang out in clubs having anonymous sex with multiple partners in clubs and parks.  I know the film apologises for this but it doesn't excuse the sheer lazy clichs that it wheels out and seems to just hope that we are shocked by the repeated graphic image.  The seedy nature of the film means that it hasn't lost it's shock ability even with gay relationships no longer a taboo in the media or normal life  but if this is all it has then it is hardly worth it.  If Friedkin had a vision then it has been lost because there is no sign of life in this film  by the end of the film everyone seems to have given up on it and it just well grinds to a halt.  I won't even go into the various threads that just seem to go nowhere  DiSimone turning up all over the place for no reason for example.Pacino is a great actor but he cannot do anything with a character he cannot understand.  He is absent from the film and is given nothing to work with. Certainly the slow burn' he is required to do is not fitting his style but it is made harder considering the script doesn't know about Steve either and Pacino has nothing to build to.  Sorvino is OK but has nothing to do likewise Allen is just floating around as well.  The only thing that really kept my interest was how many famous faces were in early roles here  Powers Booth Mike Starr Spinell and Weeks to name a few.Overall I was looking forward to this film and wanted to enjoy it. I was not let down when it failed to do the usual things I expected from the genre setup but I was letdown by the fact that it did nothing else with it. The plot is all over the place and the performances are poor simply because they have no characters  Steve is impossible to understand and every gay character is a clich. An amazingly inept film when you consider the names attached to it.".

Something else is amiss here not mere amorality. What is it? Matters of sex and violence are tricky subjects. Safer perhaps to illustrate using sex but nonetheless the two of them are governed by the same dynamics this goes far beyond the hysteria against 'torture porn'. Because the main sensation is so overpowering but at the same time so readily available so the desire for it is strong but often haphazardly squandered it's not often very clear what it's all about.Sexual dynamics are about exchanged energy more pronounced and pure in the DS lifestyle.Good sex is the around the exchange. It sharpens and clears mind. Bad sex is simply waste of energy. Your partner may have attractive skin but the mind wanders and the chemistry is all wrong.This is bad sex and even worse DS. That is probably because the main atmosphere is horny guys soliciting antsy sex and guys are guys so all the sex is primarily visually aggressive forceful and completely without a tease of sophistication and on top of that the filmmaker is a macho guy so there is absolutely no trace in the world of the film of something truly ecstatic that is concentrated prolonging surrender or meditation. it's quick and sloppy like a handjob at the park.The most memorable scene is murder in a seedy porn cinema with penetrative thrusts of a kitchen knife spliced together with footage of gay porn. It highlights the main effect of the film jarring meaningless excitement that is quickly forgotten.Al Pacino is the one good note here. That was from the time when he was still exciting to watch and didn't just bellicosely bellow. He probably sought this out as his Taxi Driver and put serious effort to that effect. He has layers internal dimensions builds an ambiguous personality that prolongs our anticipation. He must have consciously grasped that he's playing an actor who has consciously grasped a role but has to internalize having done so so he steadily internalizes having grasped the role. We are eventually unsure if it is still a role or not.He is the complex  feminine center that anchors Friendkin's aimless waste of energies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gay characters began to reach the American screen in the 1960s but they would not be portrayed with any validity until the 1980s. Curiously one of the most homophobic films created by Hollywood would mark the transition the 1980 William Friedkin CRUISING starring Al Pacino Paul Sorvino and Karen Allen.Based on the novel of the same name CRUISING might best be described as a sexual thriller. Police officer Steve Burns Al Pacino is sent undercover into the gay community to attract and identify a serial killer who stalks New York City SM bars slashing and sometimes dismembering his victims with a serrated knife. But even as the killer strikes again and again Burns becomes more and more entangled in this extremely dark world comes to identify with the killer and eventually selfdestructs in a particularly nightmarish way.From an artistic standpoint CRUISING has several things going for it. Director Friedkin has an interesting eye and the film has an unexpectedly gritty at times almost documentarylike style. It also has tremendous atmosphere it is adept at making the viewer feel unsettled. The cast is also effective in heightening the disturbing tone of the film as a whole. What the film does not have is a coherent plot nor does it have anything approaching a decent script and it is grotesquely insulting to the gay community in several ways.CRUISING equates homosexuality with an extreme sexual lifestyle and what emerges is a portrait of nasty men doing nasty things in nasty bars. Does such a subculture exist in the gay community? Of course it does just as it does in the heterosexual communitybut CRUISING posits this as the norm for homosexuals. Even more distastefully what ultimately emerges is the idea that a heterosexual man can be seduced into the gay community in which at least according to the film extreme sex insanity and violent death all go hand in hand. And it was precisely this that so outraged many in the gay community when the film was made. Film shoots were repeatedly disrupted by protests and director Friedkin tried to calm the matter by stating that CRUISING was not about homosexualsan extremely bizarre statement that only fueled community ire.A number of gay organizations greeted the film with boycotts but as it happened their efforts were unnecessary. Few critics and even fewer moviegoers liked the film and it soon faded from view. Seen today it reads very much like a snapshot of American homophobia in 1980 and little more. But CRUISING does have a certain historical significance by and large it would be the last major Hollywood film to present the entire gay community in a wholly negative light.The very outrageousness of the film seemed to prompt American film makers to a much needed reevaluation of the way in which gay characters were portrayed on screen. Although gay man equals bad man characters have cropped up in a few films sinceKevin Costner's NO WAY OUT and several of Mel Gibson's films come to mindthe overall reaction to CRUISING killed the stereotype. And so the film in an accidental sort of way is significant from a historical standpoint film historians and movie buffs will find it interesting and I give it three stars for their sake. But just about everyone else should leave it alone.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

Once straight cop Al Pacino is assigned to the case going undercover in New York's gay leather bars to find the serial killer of homosexual men I found the picture akin to cheap porno ugly depressing degrading repetitive and finally boring. A few good scenes here and there Pacino practically forcing a man into sex because he thinks he's got the murderer with the cops bursting in too soon the interrogation scene of that unfortunate guy who is achingly humiliated. Karen Allen in her debut has a nice squirrelly presence as Pacino's girlfriend and the pseudodramatic ending got a laugh out of me for its sheer dumbness. Pacino himself isn't shown to good advantage here he's acting showing off but he's not in character because there really is no character. The movie has a foreboding presence but doesn't utilize it to build any kind of momentum. Alas as a thriller Cruising is impotent. 12 from ".

	schema:reviewBody "Keep in mind when you watch this that William Friedkin based a lot if not most of the events and characters on real crimes of late 70's New York. Often dialogue was put in verbatim as he remembered hearing it. Knowing cops and criminals helped him gain insight and access to a world most of us never see in person. One thing is certain. Gay men were and are being murdered in many cities sometimes by closeted men other times by those who hate homosexuals and get away with it because homophobia still resonates in police departments and these deaths aren't always a top priority to solve. Arthur Dong's brilliant film Licensed To Kill was powerful in letting us simply watch these kind of felons explain their horrific crimes in their own words. Cruising is a murder mystery where no form of justice can punish the guilty. Al Pacino turns in his darkest work here showing Patrolman Steve Burns as a young cop given an assignment no one should envy. Pose in clubs where men who looked like him met a man that butchered them. Paul Sorvino indeed shows what Friedkin calls profound sadness and is Burns' sole police contact for this incredibly dangerous mission. Burns undercover as John Forbes meets people he likes and others he doesn't and they all have one thing in common. None know who he really is and that is the ultimate mystery of Cruising.

With the controversy of it long past I remember the atmosphere in Los Angeles was so tense at the time that once in West Hollywood several friends and I were treated to the sickening sight of a bunch of homophobes in a passing car screaming threateningly to a group of bar patrons Are you waiting in line to see 'Cruising'? one can look at the film somewhat more dispassionately. Unfortunately such remove makes one see the film for what it is a routine detective thriller that plays out a little like Basic Instinct in the way it tries to divert from its pedestrian plot by shrouding it in a world of titillating sleaze.Nothing wrong with that but after viewing the film I can't fathom what the whole thing is supposed to add up to. It seems to have very little to actually say about homosexuality homophobia violence or even sex. Like the 1968 film The Detective it seems content to let public curiosityrepulsion to homosexuality in this case the SM leather subculture provide the atmosphere and mystery.I don't find the film to be either more or less homophobic than most of what comes out of Hollywood it just strikes me as sensationalistic and out of touch.SPOILERS Other posters have pretty much covered all that needs to be said of the film which holds an odd interest despite not being very good but here are a few points I haven't read anything about yet1 Did anybody else notice that during the first murder and the one at the film arcade the director who demonstrated his fondness for subliminal shots in The Exorcist inserts shots of anal sex? I wasn't sure if I saw what I thought I saw and so I replayed the DVD copy I made and sure as shooting there are closeups of a penis entering a backside intercut with shots of a knife going into the victim. Not only is this cinematically irresponsible but truly a case of overkill no pun. There are few weapons as phallic as a knife the inserted shots What are we to make of them? Are we to be repulsed? Stimulated? strikes one as merely abusive of the subliminal power of film.2 Am I the only one who remembers the handsome Arnaldo Santana the first murder victim as the 70's porn actor Malo who appeared in 1979 film Dune Buddies under the name Pepe Brazil and later a much heavier version but unmistakable as a henchman in Brian De Palma's Scarface?3 What the hell was that scene in the interrogation room with the guy in the cowboy hat and jockstrap? It seemed like a personal fantasy sequence Freidkin wanted to shoot and have the studio foot the bill for. Even in this loony film that scene stands out as soooo over the top!".

The film makers had many creative and simple ways to better depict the gay community without being a bland public service announcement.The undercover cop has a gay neighbor who is a nice character played by a terrific actor but is not really given much to do except be brutally murdered.Franky even the film's stars are not really given much to do largely because the film removed much of character development motivation and story arches found within the novel.As a crime drama we have a depiction of the New York City police department that is frankly down right scary.I am surprised that members of law enforcement are not as outraged as the gay community is on how this film depicts them. 'Criminal Minds' or 'NCIS it ain't.The 'investigation' into a serial killer basically boils down to one straight man posing as a regular bar at kinky gay bars in the hopes that the killer will try and pick him up.Basically this means paying a straight man to dance in sweatysmoky bars and then being awfully surprised that this is not an effective way to track down a serial killer.Apparently all that late night dancing to some funky disco and punk music gives the undercover agent a sexual identity crisis which in turn transforms him into a gay murderer.After the gay serial killer is caught the gay neighbor is killed apparently by the undercover cop.Yup our film's hero becomes a gay serial killer after catching a gay serial killer because....um...er....I have no idea. He hung out with gay and bisexual men? His girlfriend dumped him? He listened to punk rock music? The homophobia sexism and goodoldfashion bad writing in this film makes for a rather tragic triad.Tragic because the film has got a great cast and crew involved with it. The novel itself could be adapted into a great film. I even enjoyed the retro 1970s music.Film audiences  gay or straight  deserve better. Fans of gritty crime thrillers deserve better. Heck fans of vampires or the SM scene deserve better.".

	schema:reviewBody "PROPAGANDA is based on a true story that happened in Turkey in 1948. The newly appointed customs officer Mehdi comes back to his native village of Hislinisar with an order from Ankara to build a border to separate Turkey from it's Syrian enemies.The only problem is that the village's only doctor teacher and prostitute live on the other side therefore in Syria. Despite this huge mistake the civil servants blindly obey Ankara's orders without informing the villagers. Soon the families from the other side who used to coexist with the other villagers can only enter Hislinisar with a passport that they can't get. Just like the Berlin Wall these fences will separate friends lovers and even sheep. Mehdi has to learn to enforce the law at the detriment of his marriage and friendships.This movie is hilarious. The ways that Mehdi and the villagers deal with this new border are really funny even though the impact it ultimately has on them is really sad. Overall it's a really refreshing movie.I gave it a 910. I saw it in Turkish with french subtitles. If you ever get a chance to see this great Sinan Cetin film please do so it's worth it!".

Friends and lovers are separated blind bureaucrats are taking over and everyone  even the bureaucrats  has too deal with this new age they are not yet ready for in their naive way.I really loved this movie and in my humble opinion it is one of the best Turkish pictures ever. It depicts the warmth and passion of the Turkish temperament although it is a sarcastic comment on stubborn bureaucracy not only in Turkey but everywhere! The cast is great with the beloved Kemal Sunal died much too early like all good people and the wonderful Metin Akpinar. They both are comedians who are usually playing funny often touching parts with a morallesson like to learn what the really important things in life are.It is indeed a realistic picture because in the 1940's people who thought they were neighbors were separated this way. Everyone handles this situation in a very naive way even the officers do not really know what a passport looks like because everything is so new. As for the pregnant girl who is still accepted by her family although she is not married I am sure even in those days there were people who were not so dumb and stubborn to put family honor above love for the family members. The fathercharacter portrait by Akpinar is a simple but wise man who is loyal to his beloved ones.One last point This is a modern movie about old Turkey so you get a bit of both worlds. You find the positive stereotypes as well as the negative ones. Half the Turkish population are modern westernoriented people who are aware of their own culture but also open to others. The fanaticislamist people are stubborn and intolerant and as such a group you can find anywhere in the world and they will always be there as you see in this movie. We should end all prejudices for a better tomorrow! But with each passing day this feat seems to be more out of reach than ever. What a shame!".

But Propganda is gentle yet politically sharp fable. Kemal Sunal a great Turkish comic actor moves away from the slpastick that made him an idol and gives a very touching performance here. Metin Akpinar who was part of a famous duo with Zeki Alasya is also quite good here. The film deals with TurkishKurdish problems which a number of dramas like Yilmaz Guney's SuruThe Herd 1978 have dealt with in much more direct fashions. But unlike Guney's films Propaganda is an all too rare positive film about Turkey. The film admits there are problems in Turkey but it shows that the spirit of the Turkish people can overcome such obstacles. I do admire Guney Ali Ozgenturk Serif Goren and Zeki Okten. They are great TurkishKurdish filmmakers who have made some of the best films in Turkish history. But it is good to see a Turkish film which has hope and resolve in it.

The director has the notorious background of imitating Hollywood style and making films which do not have the depth a work of cinema should have in order to be considered as a work of art. My criticism for Eskiya applies to this movies also The movie is more a critic of the Turkish bureaucracy rather that a commment on the Southeastern life. The film is quite unrealistic and it seems as if the degree of such an unrealism is the director's struggle to add some comic relief a funny dimension to the movie. However what happens is a bad mixture of failed surrealism yes.. remember the barren landscape and Coloradorunawayplot and pregnantbutacceptablegirl with farfetched social commentary. The film ends with the most ridiculous eway it could do. You cannot help but ask what will happen when they break the border. You do not leave the theatre relieved but rather with a more troubled and worried mind. What's more I guess the performance problems of Kemal Sunal is much more serious that that of the film itself. He seems to have ended his career artistically with this movie  I do not mention Cumbul and El Roman who even did not start serious artistic careers at all. His acting lacks enthusiasm and is artificial. Do not expect to see the Saban performances. I could go on forever talking about the gaps in the plot errors in cut and badly done act and cinematography problems. At the bottom this movie is a good example of how you can start with good actors a good story a good director of photography nice setting but end up messing them all. The director etin's appearance and his mockKurdish speech later mixed with English cusswords reveal that the movie is not serious at all. Sorry for those who liked it but this is just another Sinan etin moviewhich tries to reach fame with a quick gathering of few popular names rather than focusing on the artistic and cinematographic quality.".

I think we have all seen ENOUGH movies where out of wedlock pregnancy is automatically a disgrace.There is much in government that doesn't make sense but we go along with it perhaps thinking well it doesn't make sense to me but it does to everyone else so I'm not going to question it. i.e.  the electoral college in the US.  This is a movie that points out the nonsenses of bureaucracy.The installation of fences and the definite marking of boundaries was a new process in the 40's.  Certainly the government made mistakes and didn't think everything through at the onset.  It is not difficult to imagine that there was no immediate process for citizens that were living on the other side.

She does this so that she will continue to receive the stipend or pension that goes along with the title of Marquis. Dona Candida uses this money to keep their home in a welltodo neighborhood and to maintain a rather comfortable lifestyle for herself and her lovely daughter. However problems and comedic situations arise after the PeralvilloCozumel Trucking Company builds a new terminal right outside the uppercrust family's front door.

	schema:reviewBody "This was not one of Julie Christie's greatest roles as she plays a very prim and uptight British governess who goes to work for a rich family in the Argentine countryside in 1930. She has little opportunity to show any emotion and spends most of her time trying not to. It is a strange tale and a strange film. The direction by Maria Luisa Bemberg is rather wooden and uninspired. The editing is absolutely terrible and when a train pulls out of a station you can be sure we see too much of it doing so the concept of cutting away seemingly having little grip on the editor's awareness. Several of the Argentine cast of this film which is mostly shot in English are very good but as their names mean little to those of us in other parts of the world there is little point in mentioning any of them individually. There are some bizarre political statements as fullscreen text at front and back of the film which make no sense the last informing us that after 1945 Peron transformed Argentina forever. I don't know what that has to do with the price of tea. Was the film made under censorship rules? Who knows? Several times members of the rich family ask Julie Christie 'Do you think we have too much money?' Perhaps the script writer was a closet socialist? Are we meant to be witnessing the decadence of the rich? This is never made clear. The madness of the mother and the older daughter are tragically portrayed and the acting is good. The puppy love of the son for Julie Christie is extremely well done and the actor most convincing. Most of the fascination of this film which jumps confusingly back and forth in time over a period of 15 years is the intense portrayal of the claustrophobic atmosphere of the rich family in their huge house in the middle of a very flat nowhere surrounded by servants and cattle and with too little to do. We get sucked into this partially because a real house and real locations are used and it is all so authentic. The costumes are impeccable and all the men spend all their time in perfect white suits which are never soiled and do not seem to wrinkle. The mad mother constantly plays Erik Satie's 'Gnossiennes' on the grand piano very badly but as it goes on for the entire film it is in the end an effective if somewhat haunting and demented motif of isolation. We don't see films like this very often and it is many years indeed since the films of Leopoldo Torre Nilsson such as 'Summerskin' excited the film critics of New York and briefly and powerfully reminded people in the outside world that there is a country called Argentina which actually exists 'down there' wrapped in its own dream. If it weren't for the brilliant Borges the memoirs of W. H. Hudson the corrupt Eva Peron and the magnificent tango we might not even know that much.".

The scene between Amitabh and Raakhee meeting 20 years later was very touching. It was a very beautiful love story woven through several generations and it felt as though it was a journey through several emotions and moments of recollection remorse repentance etc. There was an atmosphere of unspoken love and care in the story.

	schema:reviewBody "After directing action movies Joshila and Deewaar Yash Chopra made Kabhie Kabhie with a theme that he is good at i.e. Love. The movie starts with the song Main Pal Do Pal Ka Shaayar Hoon and ends with the song Main Har Ek Pal Ka Shaayar Hoon. What lies between the two songs of the poet is a well told love story spanning two generations that shows the transformation of the poet from Pal Do Pal Ka Shaayar to Har Ek Pal Ka Shaayar.I have watched Kabhie Kabhie several times and yet I have not got tired of this movie. The main reason for this is that as an audience I can associate to Kabhi Kabhie in different ways to the characters to the story to the music or simply to the musings of the poet.There are seven main characters and all of these characters are natural and realistic that audience can feel each of the characters emotion and associate to them. Amitabh Rakhee Shashi Kapoor Waheeda Rehman Rishi Kapoor Neetu Singh Naseem all of them have acted very well but it is Amitabh who steals the show. Parikshit Sahni and Simi Grewal have supported well as the foster parents of Neetu Singh and Deven Verma provides the comical relief given a few scenes he leaves a good impression.Yash Chopra has handled the theme of the movie very well and has directed superbly. He keeps the story telling simple and linear develops each character very well and never goes far from the crux of the story even when touching issues like premarital relationship. Though brief he also captures the capital Delhi nicely. I regard Kabhie Kabhie as Yash Chopra's best movie until now. He did break the grounds with Lamhe in terms of story but he is yet to surpass Kabhie Kabhie as director.Music and songs have always been the strong point of Yash Chopra's movie. Kabhie Kabhie is among the top ones in that list. The credit goes to both Khayyam and Sahir. One may have to watch Kabhie Kabhie second time just to enjoy the music and songs. The songs melodiously rendered by Mukesh Lata Kishore and Pamela to date are chart busters. At the time when Kishore's voice was getting associated with Amitabh Khayyam broke the trend by using Mukesh's voice to capture the soul and the depth in the poet's or Sahir's lyrics note that in Trishul he did it again using Yesudas's voice for Amitabh.Khayyam not only composed delightful music for beautiful songs written by Sahir but also scored one of the best background music in Hindi cinema. The background music is very rich consistent pleasant and captures the mood of the characters so as to relate them to the audience. Khayyam has done it mainly by efficiently fiddling with two instruments such as two guitars when Sweety introduces Vicky to Preeti and when Amit Anjali Vicky Sweety and Preeti are eating dinner guitar and sitar Amit and Anjali discussing in the bedroom while they are thinking about two different things and the change when they talk about themselves Preeti and Vicky arguing in the garden after Preeti comes to know about her mother banjo and violin when Anjali finds out about Preeti and Vicky's love to describe a few.It isn't that there are no weak moments in the movie. The story line does has some weakness but the different strengths of the movie does not lets the audience feel or see them or lets the audience to ignore them.As a whole Kabhie Kabhie is one of the best movie that has graced the screens of Hindi cinema.".

The cinemas were totally packed  House Full. The songs were already famous before the release of the movie.Amit Malhotra recites one of his poems at a college  university where he meets Pooja and they both fall in love. But parents have other plans and Pooja gets married to an architect Vijay Khanna while Amit returns home and joins his father's business  a construction company. As time passes Pooja and Vijay have a son Vikram also known as Vicky who falls in love with Pinky Kapoor while studying and the two plan to get married. The two families meet and realise that Pinky is Doctor R.P Kapoor's daughter and that Vijay is his patient. In the meantime Pooja who has her own TV show interviews Amit Malhotra who informs her that he has given up writing poetry. In the meantime Doctor R.P. Kapoor informs his wife that he is worried about what Vijay will think when he finds out about Pinky's past.Kabhi Kabhie directed by Yash Chopra stars Amitabh Bachchan Rakhee Gulzar Shashi Kapoor Waheeda Rehman Rishi Kapoor Neetu Singh Parikshit Sahni Simi Garewall and Nasreen. Ifteqar and Deven Varma make a special appearance.This movie is poetry in motion totally and that is not to mention the acting the story cinema photography and lastly the songs. This is a typical Yashraj film where the scenery is concerned  mountains and snow.Conclusion This is a worthwhile to watch whenever you have the chance for Love Is Life.".

	schema:reviewBody "A year after the classic 'Deewaar' 1975 the Yash ChopraAmitabhShashi combination joined forces once again. But unlike the hardhitting actiondrama this time they teamed up for a simple poetic romantic drama.I am normally a big fan of multistarrers and family dramas and this is a big reason for my liking this film. The film has about 9 central characters and all of them manage to leave a mark. Also a film starring Big B and Shashi Kapoor is always a mustwatch for me. The crackling chemistry they shared between them was far superior to any of the leading heroines of those times. No wonder they did more films together than with any particular heroine!But in most of these films there is a perennial complaint of Big B tending to overshadow Shashi. But 'Kabhi Kabhie' is a heartwarming exception. Not just compared to Bachchan but out of the entire bouquet of characters it's Shashi who creates the biggest impression. His ever smiling charming persona with a big heart of gold is a complete delight. My favourite scene was where he went under the table to snoop on his son's telephonic conversation. Also the confrontation scene between him and Bachchan towards the end was terrific. It's just for him that one could see the film time and again!The other attraction of the film is we get to see stars like Big B Shashi Rakhee and Waheeda Rehman who were in their youth being projected in older roles. If these characters were to be played by actors who matched the age then the film would lose half the charm.One expects a tight narration in multistarrers but here the tone was kept deliberately simple. It's obvious from the start that it's gonna be a very poetic film. But unfortunately this makes the film quite boring and monotonous at parts. In fact the original premise of the Amitabh Rakhi romance ultimately turns out to be a mere subplot. One certainly expected something more here. But just on the verge of the climax where it appeared we were headed for a melodramatic finish we are treated to a sudden chasesequence which was a delightful surprise. The sequence is brilliantly shot with horses jeeps and motorbikes embroiled in a trail with blasts going off on the picturesque Kashmir mountains behind. It's the ideal finish required for a film like this.Music by Khayyam and lyrics by Sahir Ludhianvi are highlights of the film. But there are just too many songs in the 2nd half which obstructs the pace of the film.This was a terrific example of the versatility of Chopra who could switch effortlessly between two diverse genres. Although he is mostly remembered as a 'King of Romance' personally I find him more capable in the actionventures like 'Deewaar' 1975 'Trishul' 1978 and 'Kala Patthar' 1979. As a result 'Kabhi Kabhie' fails to match up to those standards but is still the best romantic film of Chopra after 'Chandni' 1989.Many consider it to be a great romantic film or even a poetic film. But for me this film is special just because of Shashi the starcast and for getting to see a whole bunch of actors playing characters far older than their real age!".

So after a rewatch yesterday I feel that it's a film that hasn't particularly 'aged' well. It's entertaining nonetheless but not among Chopra's best works. There are a few overly sentimental scenes and some overacting.There are several unintentionally funny moments such as the death sequence of Anju's ex. Most of the songs especially those visualized on Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh should have been left out in my opinion. Those were bad songs with poor lyrics. Characterization is also faulty. An example being the character Sweety who's more of a onedimensional caricature. The dialogues didn't live up to standard either like the sexist speech that Amitabh delivers towards the end to Waheeda's character highlighting how strong men are and how weak women are.The execution is nothing remarkable. Camerawork and sound design appear completely flat. The action sequences although few in number are unnecessarily stretched out. Heavy editing was required. However there are some notable sequences that stand out. For example Amit and Pooja's reunion and Anju showing affection for the daughter she had abandoned.Performances are a mixed baggage. Waheeda Rehman is terrific. Shashi Kapoor is quite charming. Amitabh Bachchan and Rakhee are competent. I liked her chemistry with Kapoor and Bachchan. Neetu Singh tends to overact. Rishi Kapoor is quite irritating. Overall flawed and dated it might be but it can be entertaining when watched with the family the aforementioned songs and action sequences can be fastforwarded.".

Rishi Kapoor is quite irritating. Overall flawed and dated it might be but it can be entertaining when watched with the family the aforementioned songs and action sequences can be fastforwarded.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have only recently realized that in fact I don't really like Yash Chopra's movies. These were really the first Bollywood films I have seen so I just thought  that's Bollywood it's OK. However later I thought  hang on a second how come other movies are so much better than these? Most of Yash Chopra's movies were fine you can't really see any significant flaws in them but they just lack something. I don't know what it is it's just that somehow they don't make the right use of their potential.However I did like Kabhie Kabhie quite a lot. Out of all the movies by Yash Chopra that I have watched this is the best one. Actually at first I thought it was really crap but I changed my mind about it.At first I thought the story was just ridiculous. Now I think it's actually quite good. A fresh look at the question of whether past is really past and if we are allowed to forget it or not. What I liked in the movie was that the characters weren't at all perfect  they had a lot of weaknesses. Especially Big B.'s character of course. And Vicky played by Rishi who really annoyed me at first but now I think it was a pretty interesting character. So was Pinky. Sweety is terribly spoiled and this begs the question how come that such cultured people could raise such an illmannered and silly girl. However apart from Sweety all the other characters are pretty convincing. The happy ending comes somehow too quickly like in 'Silsila'. I think that people normally need more time to sort out their problems but basically I liked the message in this movie.My favourite character was definitely Vijay played by Shashi Kapoor who surprisingly turns out to be the most mature character of all and makes Amitabh finally understand his mistake. Basically I think Shashi and Rakhee rock in this movie. Rakhee may seem too perfect to some people but I also liked her for that reason Pooja is really a very likable character. Neetu Singh was also very good I mean making a person named Pinky a complex character  that is really amazing.".

While viewing it I went to a spasm where I was laughing hysterically astonished in a bad sense and about ripping my clothes off. To all who think that Geraftaar Mrityudaata or Sooryavansham are The Big B's worst movies think again because these are classics compared to the one in hands ! I want whoever wrote it to be hanged. What's this movie ?! Honestly ! At first it's a love story in which a boy and a girl sing in green woods and snowy woods. Then the boy's heart got broken you'll never know why his girl left him? or married that other guy in specific ?! and how come she's always happy with him ?! Then it's another love story in which a boy and a girl sing in green woods and snowy woods a lame part when the boy's father likely a runaway from the nuthouse wants his son to get marry useless scenes for the boy and the girl with no singing in green woods or snowy woods and a scene for the girl combing her hair just to assure that she's happy Huh ?!. Then a known matter in every Hindi movie the girl is a foundling. So the trip to find the real parents. After a while it becomes about 2 girls fighting over one boy ..Oh sorry after that I immersed in this movie's loyal absurdness and surrendered forcibly to lethargy instead of bursting out of rage bore or not understanding !There is no clear plot. It goes stupidly from theme to another without any focus or ONE POSSIBLE MEANING being a hellish maze of circle that passes to another circle that passes to another and another pointlessly. The events happen scarcely so that's why it's called Sometimes !. Plus a neverending dialog I thought that it was a contest to create the heaviest movie ever where every scene repeats the other irritatingly and this one won matchlessly or the writer was forced to fill it up with all the unnecessary dialog he could make up otherwise someone would kill his wife children cat ! Whatever this dialog is sold as hopelessly romantic jewels while  in fact  being great book for all the cheesy completely juvenile romantic conversations !Well the writer was stoned. To prove it  Bachchan marries a girl yet he doesn't notice that she wasn't a virgin unless 20 years later ! The explosions in order to pave the way for building around a mountain are child's toys that don't do a thing ! Shashi Kapoor suddenly appears at the end on a motorcycle to chase his son into that chain of explorations How he knew about it ? from where did he bring that motorcycle ? and while he's rich why he doesn't ride something bigger ?! even my faraway neighbors heard my laughs at that moment ! The girl that was about killing herself because the boy she loved loves another girl retreats weirdly when she knows that they're engaged ?!!. Bachchan remembers out of the blue that he loves his wife because their daughter was about to die ??! and so on and on of incredibly lazy writing that could fit a Hindi melodrama's outrageous parody !With no obvious point I imagined many theories for its end 1 Amitabh will marry his old love Rakhee then the latter's husband will marry the first's wife. 2 Neetu Singh will be discovered as Amitabh's daughter so when she'll marry Rakhee's boy it will be like the reunion that those old lovers couldn't have. 3 Neetu will be discovered as Shashi's daughter from old mistake with Amitabh's wife so Singh and Rishi Kapoor are sister and brother hence Rishi will easily marry Amitabh's daughter another way to achieve the reunion of the original 2 lovers. 4 Rishi will be discovered as Amitabh's son so Shashi will be shocked and let his wife to her first love. 5 Rishi dies nobody marries and Shashi returns to the nuthouse !The taste of Shashi's villa hurt my eyes more than the 70s flamboyant ties. The direction aimed at breaking the tons of dialogs yet with no avail. Bachchan appears with no moustache then abruptly with one. Basically he wanted to be the opposite of what he was back then so from comic violent rebellious and poor young man to sedate poetic quiet and rich old man. But sure he selected the WRONG script. I kept wishing for Prem Chopra Amrish Puri or Amjad Khan to show up fighting the leads killing them or anything that may spread an atom of heat attraction or movement in it !It's 2 so long movies in one with no connection or unified purpose between both. Maybe its writer's wildest dream was to smash the legend of the first love whereas Bachchan chooses lastly his wife not his first love Rakhee does the same with her husband and Bachchan's daughter with Rishi as her first love who she loses to another girl. But if that was the hopedfor meaning then it couldn't be done more adolescently and horridly ! Irrefutably Neetu was the only good thing. The presence of her voluptuous body is a treat especially while being in always tight costumes pants and  WAW  swimsuit very rare and bold in 1976. Not that big stars were involved. Not that it alleges being highly romantic. But for being a hit once and being called a classic that make me finally collapse. Rather it's a 3 hours hit to the head and a classic at being a mammoth crap. It makes the news more fun and less weary to watch !".

	schema:reviewBody "Night of the Demons is by far one of my favorite horror films to date. You really cannot go wrong with this picture. It's directed by the master Kevin Witchboard Tenney and based on a Joe Augustyn script.The film is based on a rowdy group of high school teens who decide to throw a party in an old abandoned funeral parlor. Both Angela Amelia Kinkade and and Suzanne Linnea Quigley are the ones responsible for throwing this party together. They invite a small group of personal friends together and host this party on none other than Halloween Night. The party starts off as a real smash. However throughout the course of the night Angela and Suzanne transform into demonic characters and infect the rest of the guests.There are some real classics deaths in this one. Jill Sleepaway Camp III Terashita and her beau Philip Tanzini meet their untimely death while they are working it out in a casket of all places. Stooge who happens to be one of the highlights of the party crushes them both in the coffin. This death here is one of my all time favorites. Also check out the lipstick scene with Linnea Quigley. This movie has it all the house the booze naked chicks violence and demons. If you are into real bad movies like myself then go ahead and check out this masterpiece.I am also pleased to report that Anchor Bay has received the rights to be able to release this fine movie finally on a DVD release. Boy I cannot wait. The street date is slated for an August 24th 2004 release date.If you haven't seen nor hear of this movie then I advise you to go ahead and check it out. If you have seen this then hopefully you'll pick it up on DVD once its released. 1010 for a classic!".

Sure much of it is fairly predictable but somehow it's still much more enjoyable than the crap we see these days being passed off as Horror. I give the gore a solid 9 and the Demons' oneliners are actually funny. I'm still creeped out by Stop looking at me! The soundtrack is well done I was surprised to hear Stigmata Martyr from Bauhaus! There is also some very nice TA on display as well as some hella good makeup effects. The second film in the series is pretty good too but avoid the inferior third one. Night of the Demons may be dated dark and lowrent but it still has a lot of potential. It's definitely worth a rental at least. Give it a chance tonight just stay away from any old makeup! you'll understand when you see it!".

The characters typical American teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this. By the time the shlitz hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. It's a slow uphill setup kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster. Thankfully once the action kicks in it's full blown old school HORROR! Steve Johnson's makeup effects are awesome. Equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films. And the scares are jolting. Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever with heartstopping surprises and creepy suspenseful setups. The tongueincheek sometimes cheesy humor marks this film as pure 80s horror as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like Night of the Living Dead or Hills Have Eyes. But for true horror fans this one is worth checking out. Play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of House on the Haunted Hill. The setup and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking?".

First of all for those of you who describe this as 80s cheese if you objectively compare it with the horror flicks of the past 2 decades it compares quite well if stacked up against films in its unique horror sub genre which I would term actionhorror as opposed to psychological horror such as The Shining or the exorcist.Furthermore for its budget this film really delivers the goods or in this instance bad. The film actually has some character development and gives enough of a history of the infamous hull house to get the atmosphere right before the characters set foot in the front door. The film also has several hilarious one liners and gives the appropriate mood that a creepy horror flick should have. If you compare NOD to contemporary big budget horror films such as I am legend The Vincent Price version was much better this film really stands out. Modern horror flicks have become almost completely dominated by CGI. Most have no plot or character devel at all and are completely predictable. The special effects dominate these movies from start to finish and the characters are 24k plastic. If this is 80s horror cheese I'll take it over 95 of current entries in the genre.On a closing note seeing NOD again made me remember the beautiful Jill Terashita and wonder why I have not seen her in more films horror or otherwise. Jill on the odd chance that you read this I think you are gorgeous and should have been in more films. Lastly if you like action horror flicks you will probably like this one a lot.".

Tenney has nearly all of the ingredients necessary for a Bmovie classicmonsters naked chicks and gorebut is missing the most vital one in order to make it all work talent.The badly paced film takes an amazingly long time for anything noteworthy to happen and after 50 minutes of irritating 'crazy' shenanigans from the 'wacky' teens I couldn't wait for them all to start dying.The special makeup effects from Steve Johnson are actually pretty good when they finally happen but they are wasted on such a lousy film. Particularly impressive is a scene in which 80s scream queen Linnea Quigley pushes a lipstick into her breast and also rather good is a juicy double eye squish.Also worth mentioning are the lovely ladies who strip off during the course of the movie making the experience slightly more bearable. The aforementioned Miss Quigley bares all for the camera as usual and lovely Jill Terashita gets her best attributes out for the lads.

The storyline does not make much sense at all I mean its consistent for the most part but very improbable. The acting was the worst quality of the movie. The acting was horrid. Most of the actors were probably poor college kids looking for extra money. But the scares were GREAT! The characters were better acting when possessed than as normal people. I liked Rodger the main character. He was realistic and different. Judy wasn't all that bad she played a good screamer. Angela was alright as well. I did like Sal Romero his accent was actually funny. He was one of the 3 people Rodger and Judy to actually have a brain. The old man was funny as hell also. Reminds me of my neighbor but 10x worse. ANother good thing was that all the actors were noname so you couldn't tell who was next who would make it out and whatnot. I rate this a 6.510 but since 6.5 cant be chosen I'll round it up to 710. Watch if your in the mood for a mindless Bhorror movie.".

The house which appears like an old funeral home or closed down mansion gives off a cold meanspirited aura. This of course adds to the dread that the movie heaves. The acting I might add is at times atrocious but redeems itself by slick use of makeup and the claustrophobia of being closed in and around the darkened climate. There are quite a few eerie sequences going on and you never know who may pop out or who might be possessed. Its not the greatest horror spoof but it works in ways than other cheap attempts.

Night of the Demons is a joyless scarefree Evil Dead knockoff that has absolutely zero redeeming qualities if your not a teenage boy living in the 1980's. Still I love Scream Factory  in 2013 my library increased with more of the movies they released  I'm looking forward to future titles to come.";

One reviewer even argued that Night of the Demons was better than Evil Dead. Wellthat is just ignorance and sacrilege. Evil Dead is a horror classic. And almost everything that happens here is a direct copy from Evil Dead. There is one scene where you will see the demon's viewpoint roaming through the house. The way the camera is used is the exact same way it is used in Evil Dead when deadites try to enter the cabin only not as impressive. But I don't mind if they use the same techniqueseffects or even storyline as long as the movie manages to entertain you. And here starts the problem. Night of the Demons has a far to comedic approach to events. The acting is so bad obviously done on purpose that it removes all sympathy you might have for the characters. Also when something scary happens it just doesn't have the effect it should have. There are two or three scenes that really could have been scary if the acting at that time was truly serious. Demons from Bava showed a fine balance betweencamphumorgore and thrills. Night of the Demons is more like a parody. I am sure that there is an audience for this movie. But if you are looking for thrills you are better off with classics like Demons or Evil Dead. Do pay attention to the twist ending which is hilarious. It has nothing to do with the whole story but still makes more impact than the whole movie did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many people don't appreciate dated or lower budget horror but in my opinion you cannot be a true horror fan without at least a respect for the Bmovie. This movie is enjoyable in only that way that 80's campy horror can be enjoyable. It doesn't take itself too seriously and you really shouldn't either. Often overshadowed by the slasher movies of the 80's this one is a classic. Amelia Kinkade plays Angela. Watch for her creepy dance sequence. It's pretty memorable and what happens right after elevates Amelia's character Angela from B Movie character to a horror powerhouse like Freddy and Jason. But unfortunately the 2 sequels that followed are inferior and wound up botching her character. Linnea Quigley does something very interesting with a tube of lipstick. And the gore effects are pretty cool.This movie is by no means a thought provoking kind of horror movie where you are supposed to question the existence of humanity or anything like that. This is a horror movie with lots of drinking sex and drugs and many many moments of oh my god did she just?! Did they just do?! Honestly as a shock value horror flick very few movies surpass this one. I'm probably a bit nostalgic for it but only slightly I think a lot of the shock moments in this movie will get more people than most of the ones in Saw or Hostel. The director had a really good feel on what would appeal to an 80's teen and 90's teen in the near future. Hull House is by far the best environment for a movie like this. The music is the greatest horror movie music ever! Far surpassing that of Nightmare on Elm Street's. It throws a lot into the atmosphere of the movie.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

Stooge has some of the best oneliners to ever hit the screen in this one. he's my favorite character A lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie but my personal favorite is the ending sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters when the old man eats his left over Halloween apples in a pie and his throat is mangled from the inside out. The sound track is awesome. The scene with Angela dancing is totally creepy especially after the strobe light comes on and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter click on the song that's playing. The makeup effects in this movie are pretty sweet Angela gave me nightmares as a kid.

Actually it's a perfect purchase if you are a fan of Bmovies since Anchor Bay has put out a great unrated DVD with some very nice extras. Well I just love this film! It starts with some really cool animated opening credits and then follows the exploits of a group of teenagers planning to go to a party hosted by weirdo goth chick Angela Mimi Kinkade. Well Angela's chosen the perfect spot for her little shindig Hull House a reputedly haunted former funeral parlor. During a sance the teens unleash a demon that possesses airhead bimbo Suzanne Linnea Quigley campy and hilarious! who then goes on to give a soul stealing smooch to Angela and so on and so on until the house is bursting at the rafters will bloody murders and the resurrected dead. The film is very entertaining all around moves pretty quickly has plenty of bloodshed and special effects to keep you entertained and director Kevin S. Tenney makes the most of his locations. There's also a subplot involving an elderly couple that doesn't have much to do with the rest of the movie but is entertaining nonetheless. Kinkade and Quigley both turn in memorable performances and the cast is nicely rounded out with Hal Havins who costarred with Linnea in Sorority Babes in the Slimeball BowlORama Lance Fenton from Heathers Cathy Podewell who played JR's hillbilly wife on the last season of Dallas Jill Terashita who some may know from Sleepaway Camp 3 William Gallo and Alvin Alexis as Roger.Apparently this film was a surprise box office hit as pointed out on the extras of the DVD which may explain why two sequels were eventually made. Another good extra is My Demon Nights an informative interview with Quigley about the production. Other extras are trailers and radio spots.".

On the surface it's a period piece about a corrupt Los Angeles where sex money the police and the Catholic church all mingle. While at first glance the film is as lurid as L.A. Confidential beneath the surface it is a memorable love story a story of two brothers one a detective and one a ranking member of the Church hierarchy. The brothers are played by Robert Duvall and Robert DeNiro in performances that will linger in your mind forever.  The silent moments between these two brothers resound louder than the dialogue. There's one heartbreaking scene in a bar where their inability to communicate despite their love for one another captures all of the complexities of sibling relationships.  I have no idea who won the Oscar for Best Actor in 1984 but whoever it was could not have been better than the two Roberts are here. In supporting roles Kenneth McMillan and Charles Durning also shine one as a corrupt cop and the other as a corrupt businessman.  In fact I would have loved to see a remake of this film with the two pairs of actors trading roles DeNiro for Duvall and McMillan for Durning.  That film would have been different but arguably as great.The final scene of the film is punctuated by the perfect sound track.  So a great big tip of the hat to all responsible John Gregory Dunne for the script Ulu Grosbard for the wonderful direction that allows for those memorable silences and of course a miraculous cast of fine performers working at the height of their art.

	schema:reviewBody "Ulu Grosbard's True Confessions scripted by John Gregory Dunne and Joan Dideon from his novel of the same name is a masterful film one of the most underrated movies of the nineteeneighties. It's an exquisite character study whose themes deal with corruption the seduction of power Catholic guilt remorse and finally the need for absolution. Robert De Niro is Desmond Spellacy an ambitious Monsignor of an Catholic Archdiocese in Los Angeles and Robert Duvall is his brother Tom a middleaged hardboiled LAPD detective investigating the brutal murder of a young would be actress. Both have a strongly developed sense of Catholic sin that binds them even when their contrasting personalities conflict. It is their scenes together with all that desperately needs to be said and yet is not despite the love they have for each other that makes this one of the most brilliantly acted films of its time. While Los Angeles of 1947 is beautifully recreated many critics misconstrued the film at the time of its release as being a latter day film noir murder mystery. It is not. The solving of the Black Dahlia style murder is only incidental to the plot. Central are the relationships between many of the characters and the victim and how those relationships led to her death.The film opens sixteen years after the murder in 1963. Duvall retired from the force visits his brother who was transfered to a threadbare parish in the desert years earlier because of the scandal. I'm going to die Tommy. Des tells him. The arteries to the heart are shot. The scene then dissolves to 1947 to a magnificent cathedral with Des presiding over the wedding of Jack Amsterdam's daughter. Jack is a powerful construction contractor with a lifetime of misdeeds now a pillar of the Catholic community and trying to buy his way into heaven by building Catholic schools. The dying Amsterdam Charles Durning taints all he comes in contact with and personifies corruption literally bringing it into the church disrupting the ceremony with his incessant coughing while his daughter is already several months pregnant out of wedlock. The relationship between Amsterdam and Desmond will be a contentious point with the brothers. Unknown to Jack years earlier Tom had acted as bag man for his payoffs to Vice and though busted for it was not indicted. His attempts to put Des straight about Jack are met with irritation and an unwillingness to hear the truth because of his ambition to succeed the aging Cardinal Cyril Cusack an appointment of which Jack has some say.Jack's influence is felt even at LAPD. Does he make you nervous Frank? Tom asks Frank Crotty Kenneth Macmillan after his slightly corrupt partner he cheerfully accepts payoffs from local Chinese businessmen insists that Amsterdam despite Banging her had nothing to do with the murder. Jack's hypocrisy he is made Catholic Layman of the year and his disregard for the lives he destroys Brenda one of his hookers Rose Gregorio commits suicide after Jack refuses to see her will goat Tom to bring him in having uncovered evidence it was Amsterdam who introduced the victim to the pornographer who murdered her. Unfortunately Des also knew the victim albeit only in passing. Jack's liaison with the church Dan Campion Ed Flanders is also facing ruin from the scandal that will ensue he was the first to have a sexual tryst with the victim and tries to get Des to stop Tom's investigation informing him that she was the hitchhiker they picked up on their way back from Santa Anita and if they go down Des will go with them. You knew her too Monsignor. I knew her. Des replies. You fked her.Finally the film returns to 1963. For years Tom has carried the guilt that he ruined his brother's life and he needs his forgiveness. It must have been hard Des. It's my fault...I'm sorry. No Tommy you were my salvation actually. You made me remember things I had forgotten. I thought I was someone I wasn't. Des consoles Tom he is unafraid of dying that My bags are packed. Then in what they both know will be the last time the two brothers again attempt to connect. Both good yet touched by the same corruption the sin of pride for Tom ambition for Des and both needed forgiveness. Reaffirming the love between them despite all that has happened Des leads Tom to the plot he has set aside for himself and he hopes one day for Tom where they both may rest safe from worldly temptations. It is one of the most moving moments in the film. Requiescat in pace.".

	schema:headline " Quite simply the finest crime drama ever.";
	schema:reviewBody "This story is somewhat loosely based on the story of Elizabeth Short widely known as the Black Dahlia. For decades the mystery of her death plagued the LAPD. and despite the gruesome dnouement in True Confessions the killer of the Black Dahlia was never found.The murder mystery was dramatized in a novel by James Ellroy perhaps better known for the more successful though in many ways definitely inferior L.A. Confidential. In 2005 a somewhat low budget adaptation was made with a present day setting and most recently a Brian De Palma film regarding which a must miss was released based on Ellroy's novel and starring Canadian Mia Kirshner in the title role along with the likes of Scarlett Johansson Josh Hartnett and Hillary Swank. Despite all this attention imitators will be hard pressed to match the desolate and subdued brilliance of this telling of the popular mystery owing in no small measure to the immensely talented cast. DeNiro's portrayal of Monsignoir Spellacy an Irish priest with a decidedly human side is positively stunning in the manner of DeNiro's other historic performances of the era. Duvall as his flawed but well intentioned brother and LAPD detective renders what may be the finest performance of his long and illustrious career.Most of the period references will not be appreciated by today's movie viewer but the zeitgeist is beautifully captured. The reality of the characters is stunning even though they are necessarily stylized to a large extent. The tone pace and style of the movie are sharply reminiscent of The Godfather although True Confessions relies much less on violence and noise and more on character and plot.Central to the story is the uneasy relationship between an ambitious priest and his hardboiled detective brother. The two clash over scattered entanglements that reach deep into the LAPD the Catholic church and the wealthy and elite LA community. When events and evidence surrounding the mutilated corpse of a wouldbe actress begin to tighten the noose around a small and corrupt group that spans all these borders the relationship of the brothers becomes increasingly strained.Institutions of wealth power and influence are exposed to the increasingly unforgiving glare of reality. The scope of the story is epic but the treatment is intimate. The combination is breathtaking.Scattered about the edges of this subtle and majestically paced masterpiece is a complex thought provoking mystery but be warned. The story that unfolds is not an easy one to watch. Avoiding a trite ending the film instead seems to fade into an uneasy but inevitable twilight in which defeat loss and resignation replace the ambitions and illusions of youth.Despite the grisly and disturbing events of the story and notwithstanding the epic tragedy of the final act True Confessions is ultimately an uplifting story about redemption through adversity. The final scene has a huge emotional payoff but only if you have invested in the story from the beginning.Standouts in the magnificent supporting cast include Charles Durning as a fading influence peddler and the incomparable Rose Gregorio as a burned out madam known to but abandoned by all. And one cannot fail to mention the amazingly sensitive portrayal by Burgess Meredith of DeNiro's mentor father confessor and in many ways eventual savior Father Fargo.All in all this is quite simply the finest crime drama ever rich with performances so brilliant so masterful that you will be left speechless even after many viewings which is of course the only way to appreciate so complex and subtle a masterpiece. I recently got the widescreen DVD version and can once again experience True Confessions as I remember it delicate moving brilliant and thoughtprovoking as well as in its proper aspect ratio.".

Whenever they do begin talking with each other the weight of their shared past has the force of a sledge hammer. I have a vhs copy of True Confessions have watched it plenty of times and still find fresh nuances whenever I look at it. You have to see this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's always interesting to watch a film twentysome years after it was first released to see how it weathers the changing standards of cinema. Happily I can say that True Confessions stands up very well. I very much enjoyed the film when it came out in 1981 and I have seen it a halfdozen times since then most recently in November of this year 2002. And I find it's still an enjoyable and interesting film even on the inevitably faded VHS video from my local library. One hopes that the film will soon be available on DVD if it's not already.  The film was adapted from the novel of the same title by John Gregory Dunne which itself was based on the unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short whose nude and mutilated body was found in a vacant lot in Los Angeles in January of 1947. The infamous Black Dahlia murder. The film like the novel has a complex plot that involves corruption and nastiness in the L.A. business community and cynical hypocrisy in the affected diocese of the Roman Catholic Church. The  victim is a beautiful young woman from smalltown America who came to Los Angeles for fortune and fame but who ended up acting in porno films and sleeping around with a variety of wealthy and unprincipled businessmen several of whom have close ties to the Church.The dramatic tension of the story centres on two brothers Detective Sergeant Tom Spellacy of LAPD Homicide Robert Duvall and Monsignor Desmond Spellacy Robert DeNiro an ambitious young priest who aspires to rise as far as he can in the Church's hierarchy. In one of the best and most closely defining scenes early in the film Tom Spellacy asks his brother what name he will take when he's made Pope. Desmond smiling teasing his brother replies that he will take the name Thomas There's never been a Pope named Thomas.It never happens of course because Des Spellacy and his Church have become too close to a particularly corrupt businessman in the diocese Jack Amsterdam played to perfection by Charles Durning. It is one of Durning's best and at the same time most repellent performances. When Amsterdam is linked to the murder a scandal ensues and Des Spellacy's career comes to a sad end although in the process he recaptures his faith and his vocation and finds peace in a small parish in the California desert far removed from the centre of power in Los Angeles.The two brothers aren't close and they're often in conflict. Where Des is smooth careful and upwardly mobile Tom Spellacy is impetuous angry and shorttempered his career shortcircuited by his own instability and also in a way by his refusal to take the easy road goaded by an odd sense of honour that is ultimately destructive of everyone close to him. But the brothers do have a way of making contact with each other. In a touching scene Tom Spellacy apologises to his brother through the grid of the confessional unable to manage it in the normal manner face to face. In turn Des Spellacy attempts to deal with the hypocrisy and compromises in his own life by confessing to the priest who was once his mentor Seamus Fargo played to prickly perfection by Burgess Meredith.The film is highlighted throughout by firstclass performances. Kenneth McMillan excels as Tom Spellacy's moderately corrupt partner Detective Frank Crotty yet manages somehow to make us like him in spite of himself. Cyril Cusack is the efficiently and coldly cynical Cardinal Danaher. Ed Flanders and Rose Gregorio also turn in fine portrayals. The writing is sharp and incisive throughout with some of the best dialogue you'll hear in any film.My principal problem with True Confessions is that almost every character is in some way morally flawed and badly and there's an oppressive grimy feel to the film and the people in it. The one moral character in the story is Father Seamus Fargo Meredith a tough little man who refuses to compromise on his faith or on what it means to be a man of the cloth. For his stubbornness Fargo is banished to a desert parish that will later and ironically become the final home of the ambitious but disgraced Des Spellacy. This isn't a minor cavil but the film in my opinion succeeds anyway. It is a murder story after all and a particularly nasty one.It was especially interesting to watch the performance of Robert DeNiro in this film and to be reminded of how good an actor he once was and  sadly  to be reminded of how far he has fallen. DeNiro's performance in True Confessions is subtle and carefully layered the portrayal of an intelligent and essentially decent man who has almost fatally compromised himself in the service of his overweening ambition. His portrayal is a joy to watch. But it's almost heartbreaking to watch DeNiro these days as he wades through bad film after bad film relying on tawdry acting gimmicks to carry him through apparently satisfied to take the money lots of it and walk. It's just possible that DeNiro like his character in True Confessions needs a spell in the desert far away from Los Angeles to sort things out and rediscover his vocation.".

Preaching the purity of the eternal soul whilst helping scoundrels hide their sins De Niro is well aware of his hypocrisy but deludes himself by maintaining that it's ultimately all for the greater good of the church.Tom a local police detective faces a similar dilemma.

Solve the murder and absolve his sins that's the way he sees it. And of course his brother holds a vital piece of evidence. A piece of evidence which he must give up in order to redeem himself.There are a lot of interesting themes here  the links between business and religion wounded souls searching for forgiveness the tale of a city built on corruption victim as sacrificial lamb the way those in high places buy their angelic images through politics or church  but for the most part we've seen this stuff done better elsewhere.Godfather 3 for example better dealt with the ties between Church and Mafia Bad Lieutenant better dealt with a sinstained Catholic seeking redemption by solving a crime and Chinatown is a both a better mystery and a better tale of a city founded on corruption. Of course today the gold standard for this sort of panoramic filmnoir is the HBO series The Wire in which corruption is not only a way of life but a long accepted means of survival. In terms of shear scope The Wire renders all these films outdated.But at the heart of True Confessions is the Black Dahlia murder and the romance and mystery it somehow still manages to exude. The most famous murder in Hollywood history the crime has popped up in countless novels and films the best being James Elroy's Black Dahlia partially about the murder of his own mother and Brian De Palma's underrated adaptation of Elroy's novel.7.510  Though a lesser film noir the film works whenever De Niro and Duvall are together and the cinematography by Owen Roizman has some appropriately atmospheric moments he avoids goldenbrown nostalgia and goes instead for sunlit sleaze.

	schema:reviewBody "Like many others I remember when this film came out because the anticipation for many of us was so great as two of our finest actors in their prime were in the same film. I think I felt like many others when I walked out of the theater thinking that I had not viewed one of the great films of all times but one with an interesting story with some truly wonderful scenes between the two lead actors. Story is of course about two brothers in post war Los Angeles where the body of a hooker is found in a field cut in half. Detective Tom Spellacy Robert Duvall is covering the case and during his investigation the hookers clients have ties with the Catholic church. Tom's brother is Monsignor Desmond Spellacy Robert DeNiro who is a priest that is better at conducting business deals for the church instead of saving souls. SPOILER ALERTDesmond is in the middle of a land deal with the church and it's benefactor Jack Amsterdam Charles Durning but he has a history of corruption with Tom who was a bagman years earlier. With all that is happening Desmond now starts to question his role as a priest and what his function is in the church.This film is directed by Ulu Grosbard who does a pretty good job of recreating old Los Angeles and he paints a fairly effective look at corruption in both the police force and the church. This is not a great film and it's mostly due to the script that never really comes across as totally believable. Durning is suppose to be dying but he looks fairly healthy and when he tries to fight Duvall he loses his cough and is breathing pretty well. Also I was never convinced of why the hooker was murdered in the first place. Was it to keep her quiet? No character in this film seems like someone who would be involved in something like that even Durning's character. While the story is at best leaky it's enhanced greatly by the performances of DeNiro and Duvall. The most wonderful scenes in this film are the uncomfortable silences that these two create when they're trying to communicate with each other. These two brothers have always had a difficult time expressing themselves to each other but the murder case seems to be an act of salvation for both of them. Even though Durning's character is not especially well written he does have one very good scene where he is in confession and tells DeNiro that he's a hypocrite. It's a remark that hits the bullseye and DeNiro knew it. While the story is shaky the dialogue is actually well written and DeNiro does a splendid job of being a priest and reciting Latin. This is a film that was to easily forgotten and watching Duvall and DeNiro together is absolutely mesmerizing.".

	schema:headline " A flawed but fascinating look at murder hookers ambition and the Church...as well as Charles Durning dancing an Irish jig";
	schema:reviewBody "True Confessions with a screenplay by Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne is a movie with a split personality. Half of it is a skewering look at pride and ambition in the Catholic Church where the desire to build orphanages and schools is too easily transformed into rubbing shoulders with the powerful and the sleazy where a young monsignor is the smooth arm of the cardinal extracting money from the rich making sure high awards go to those who contribute and who is accustomed to his usual lunch of a rob roy with a twist and a large shrimp cocktail at exclusive restaurants. The other half is the story of a gruesome murder of a young woman whose torso cut into two pieces is found in a Los Angeles field. This part also is the story of the detective who investigates the crime and the tawdry world of prostitution and bribes he operates in. Any chance that the monsignor and the detective are brothers? Any chance that we're supposed to draw parallels between the two worlds the brothers operate in? Nope. Robert De Niro plays Monsignor Des Spellacy. He's helped transform the Los Angeles archdiocese under the knowing eye of Cardinal Danahan. He raises vast amounts of money on the golf courses and he's not above manipulating a church raffle. One of the men he deals with is the wealthy aggressive Jack Amsterdam Charles Durning a heavy contributor and a man eager for lucrative building contracts and high Catholic awards. Robert Duvall plays L. A. Homicide detective Tom Spellacy long estranged from his brother. Tom is a cop who started out as a bagman for pimps changed his ways isn't above ignoring small payoffs. He has an intense dislike for both Amsterdam and what he believes is the hypocrisy of the Church. The movie takes us to the tawdriest parts of 1948 Los Angeles where there's usually no percentage in finding the killers of prostitutes. You know who we're going to pick up on this one? says Frank Crotty to Tom his partner. Panty sniffers weenie flashers guys who beat their hog on the number two bus guys who fall in love with their shoes. Know how we're going to break this case? A couple of years from now we'll pick up someone running a red light. I killed the girl he'll say. What girl we'll say. The girl with the rose tattoo he'll say. What girl was that we'll say. This is a 9to5 stiff Tom. No overtime. That all changes when Tom gets Jack Amsterdam in his sights. We also learn the other side of that coin. When the Cardinal says he's nominating Des for appointment as an auxiliary bishop he tells Des If you're lucky you'll find an ambitious young monsignor to do your dirty work for you. That's immediately after the Cardinal instructed Des to remove a fine old priest from a parish because the man had complained too often that the Church wasn't compassionate enough. The two themes come together but only barely. The murder mystery which to me gives the movie its juice just slowly peters out in a conclusion where the murderer seems to be an afterthought and newspaper headlines seem sufficient for retribution and redemption. Although for me the movie is something of a disappointment it's a fascinating one. True Confessions has a great look about it. The movie captures that same golden ambiance of Los Angeles corruption that Chinatown did. We move from pornographic studios in abandoned warehouses to elegant archdiocese offices from ritzy restaurants to cathouses. Charles Durning as Amsterdam Kenneth McMillan as Frank Crotty Burgess Meredith as Father Fargo Cyril Cusack as the Cardinal are each superb in their roles. Most of all the dynamic between De Niro and Duvall is fascinating. In the face of Duvall's utter believability as Tom Spellacy De Niro was smart enough to underplay. They give the movie far more energy than do the messages Didion and Dunne serve up. If Didion and Dunne had simply concentrated on the murder and let the messages indirectly seep into our heads I think they would have had a stunning film. But make no mistake True Confessions with all its faults is still a lot of fun...but you'll need to be fond of stylish grubby murder post WWII Los Angeles and have a high tolerance for meaningful messages.".

Maybe the titleimpaired TRUE CONFESSIONS is the best straight character novel brought to film disguised as a police procedural. Didion..... I dunno. The big explosions in this film are in the eyes of the main characters. Understatement natural reallife pauses and plain unsmarmy subtlety about the place of suffering in the moment and over a lifetime... are a constant presence a kind of tidal undertow which pulls us in ever deeper. That's what keeps OUR eyes on the silver screen. We are put in touch with the humanity of these characters  and with the enduring humanity of ourselves. These performances and this film do this do it very well and do so long after the credits roll and the theater goes black.I think I'm promoting it to my silly top10 list. Now all I have to do is decide which classic to flick off. Ya I know. GROAN.....".

In some ways this is a companion piece for LA Confidential  virtually same periodlocale and with that those was hardly the good ol' days theme. Murder amorality the darkside of that bright city.  The visuals were all gloomy keeping the downbeat theme throughout.  And while some call it slow moving see it when you are in the right mood. Brilliantly evocative it made me feel good to be alive now not then when hypocrisy was rife ok it is now but we are no longer a truly White Men Only society.  A miserable world in an allegedly affluent society take a look at how the Madame makes ends meet. Kudos to the terrific supporting cast especially to Rose Gregorio and Kenneth McMillan and the underyourskin Duvall best I have ever seen him!.  It ends a bit too quickly but I say EXCELLENT!".

	schema:reviewBody "True Confessions 1981  out of 4 Entertaining if ultimately unsatisfying movie about two brothers one a monsignor Robert DeNiro and the other a L.A. detective Robert Duvall who just happens to be investigating the murder of a prostitute who was cut in half and dumped on the side of the road. As the detective digs deeper into the investigation he learns that his brother's friend Charles Durning knew the girl and that both of them might know more than they're saying. Based loosely on the Black Dahlia case this mysterydrama has always been hit with mostly negative reviews and if you go into the movie expecting something on the actual case then more than likely you're going to walk away disappointed. I wish I understood what the director and screenwriter were going for but I'm honestly lost there. For the most part this film appears to be some sort of character study between the two brothers and the actual case itself only comes up periodically throughout the running time. Yes it plays a good part in the story but it seems to be used for the brothers and not so much for the case or events. I know a lot of people have complained about the ending but I don't fault it too much but of course I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the film. The deliberately slow pacing is probably going to disappoint most people but this too is something that didn't bother me all that much. There are several positive things in the film that makes it worth viewing and one is the beautiful reconstruction of the 1940s Los Angeles. If you've seen any of the film noir titles from this period you're going to think that this here is one of them. It's always hard to recapture the cast but I thought the film's attention to detail worked wonderfully well in its favor because you never once feel as if you're seeing a film from 1981 made to look like the 40s. Everything from the sets to the cars to the outfits make you feel as if you're really in the 40s. Another major plus are the performances with the two leads clearly leading the way. You'd expect someone like Duvall to play the priest and DeNiro to be the hardboiled detective but I think the film works even better with the actors in roles you wouldn't expect to see them in. DeNiro does just fine in his first film after RAGING BULL and the way he can act without saying a word is what makes his character work so well. Duvall easily steals the film as the cop who is willing to take bribes yet at the same time he has a moral code that he's constantly fighting himself over. Durning is perfect as the scumbag good guy and Ed Flanders is great as Duvall's partner. Burgess Meredith is strong in his few scenes as is Rose Gregorio as a prostitute. Considering the two legendary actors I think many will view this film ultimately as a disappointment and I certainly understand that. It seems like the movie doesn't want to do anything in particular and it seems to not want to be really be about anything. The direction is strange to say the least and the story itself never seems to know what it wants to do but I still think there's enough here to recommend the film for fans of the actors.".

The story is Jerry has become the stepfather in a family of a beautiful young widow and a lovely daughter. Unfortunately Jerry has a very strict definition of the perfect family and his new family just may not be making the cut.

You see our mystery madman is a cunning devious and above all deadly chameleon who readily changes his identity with alarming regularity in his obsessive and impossible quest to have the ideal American family. His latest marks are a loveblinded denialist woman nicely played by Shelley Hack and her smart astute and rebellious teenage daughter a hugely sympathetic turn by the very pretty and appealing Jill Schoelen.Director Joseph Ruben working from a wickedly clever and incisive script by acclaimed crime novelist Donald Westlake further aided by Patrick Moraz's spooky stirring score John Lindley's slick handsome cinematography and a deliciously dark streak of pitchblack humor expertly stokes the tension to a nerverattling extreme while maintaining a steady pace and effectively creating a mundane atmosphere of frightening credibility. What makes this movie so special and remarkable is how it deftly explores varying degrees of psychosis the mother has difficulty dealing with the grim truth the daughter has a tendency to get into trouble at school and of course our mystery maniac is the worst offender of all a crazed perfectionist who will literally kill in order to have what he wants. In an especially nice touch even a young man excellently essayed with jolting intensity by Stephen Shellen determined to avenge his sister's death at the maniac's hands comes across as a rather dubious and none too likable wouldbe hero thereby blurring the fine line between good and evil. Moreover The Stepfather also trenchantly addresses the false sense of security and serenity people tend to erroneously ascribe to suburbia the danger of accepting others on a strictly superficial level Hack desperately wants to believe that O'Quinn is the pleasant mildmannered man he appears to be the undeniable fact that all human beings whether they are good or bad are intrinsically flawed by nature and most boldly of all the grossly impractical and unrealistic standards that are constantly perpetuated by traditional conservative family values. Intelligent insightful and overall thoroughly absorbing The Stepfather stands tall as one of the best horror slasher thriller gems made in the 80's.".

Terry OQuinn portraits a very sick man and this madness is made clear from the very start of the movie when the stepfather has just killed his family and we are introduced to him as he removes his beard and in other ways alters his appearence to allow him to find another family and again become THE STEPFATHER. The most memorable scene for me is when he interrupts his step daughter on the porch kissing her date for the evening good night. The stepfather snaps because he wants the family to remain static for ever he is crazy. So then his wife comes down and she yells at the stepfather saying that he has ruined what they had built up. The expression on his face when hearing that is one of sheere terror. The stepfather is so fragile. The basement scene where the step daugther is getting something in the freezer and the stepfather rushes into the basement to let off some steem not knowing she is there. It is all very scary.".

Terry OQuinn portraits a very sick man and this madness is made clear from the very start of the movie when the stepfather has just killed his family and we are introduced to him as he removes his beard and in other ways alters his appearence to allow him to find another family and again become THE STEPFATHER. The most memorable scene for me is when he interrupts his step daughter on the porch kissing her date for the evening good night. The stepfather snaps because he wants the family to remain static for ever he is crazy. So then his wife comes down and she yells at the stepfather saying that he has ruined what they had built up. The expression on his face when hearing that is one of sheere terror. The stepfather is so fragile. The basement scene where the step daugther is getting something in the freezer and the stepfather rushes into the basement to let off some steem not knowing she is there. It is all very scary.";

Shelley Hack was a bad choice for the wife the role was unfit for her in my opinion they should of gotten somebody more dramatic you choose who and Jill Schoelen was superb as the daughter possibly her best film she played the role as if she lived it before. Charles Lanyer as the psychiatrist was an absolute bore he should have played the reporter. Stephen Shellen was good as the vengeful brother in law and finally Blu Mankuma as the cop so what else is knew seemed like he didn't care about the case.

	schema:reviewBody "Jerry Blake Terry O'Quinn is the perfect family man. He's all about the traditional working class married with children kind of life. That is until someone in his family angers him or is basically anything less than perfect. That's when he murders them all changes his identity and finds a new family. He's been doing this for quite some time and has gone by many different aliases over the years. His current family consists of his wife Susan Shelley Hack and his stepdaughter Stephanie Jill Schoelen. Everything seems to be going well until Stephanie starts dating then Jerry decides that it's time to take out the knife and dish out his own form of brutal punishment. Then he can simply find another family under a new identity. Unfortunately for the homicidal stepfather his former brotherinlaw Jim Ogilvie Stephen Shellen is hot on his trail. Jim seeks revenge against Jerry for killing his sister and has just bought a gun ready to dish out some punishment of his own! I've always been a huge fan of this great horror film and appreciate its interesting and original premise. How can you not be intrigued by a brilliant but psychotic man who longs for the perfect family and is willing to try again and again until he gets it right? He doesn't just leave them when things go wrong he kills them. Terry O'Quinn excels in his performance as the maniacal family man and gives a new meaning to the term home sweet home. Jerry Blake is one of my favorite horror villains in film history and he probably would not have worked with a lesser actor. Jill Schoelen as Stephanie is a great lead character and although I was somewhat rooting for the stepfather I really felt for her and wanted her to come out alive at the end. The vengeful former brotherinlaw subplot also had me glued to the screen as it provided a lot of background to the stepfather character. This movie was followed by two sequels. O'Quinn returned for part 2 which was pretty good although it was basically just a rehash which brought nothing new to the table. Part 3 featured a different actor in the stepfather role which just didn't work for me at all. I would recommend this movie for anyone who appreciates intricate and engaging horror thrillers.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most positive statements I can make on 1986's 'The Stepfather' is they give away immediately who the bad guy is. Most of the 1980's thrillers psycho killers et al that deal with a Dr JekyllMr. Hyde seemingly nice guy to friends families neighbors took way too long for the secret to come out when everyone already knew from just the poster outside. I liked that and though it puts more weight on O'Quinn's shoulders to act deep into a psycho's head he does it with ease almost perfection. Unfortunately everyone else acts like cardboard but that's okay. Same occurrences happened with Kidman in 'To Die For' or Washington in 'Training Day' both good not great films. All movies mentioned had top notch lead performances. The following would be a spoiler if it didn't happen 2 minutes into the film 'Stepfather' begins with O'Quinn's exit of one family he slaughtered to another. He wants the perfect family or he just simply has his bar raised too high. New stepdaughter is suspicious and though justified she's almost annoying throughout. Meanwhile someone's seeking justice for the most recently slaughtered family. They were lucky to produce this film 23 years ago because this guy's leaving his trace and DNA everywhere and for the police to just throw their hands up and give up seems ridiculous by today's standards. But think 1986 think that this was loosely based on a true story and of course if he were more careful it could easily happen again and you'll enjoy it more. One other thing I loved about O'Quinn's performance was he wasn't 100 nice guy when he was Dr. Jekyll. He was clumsy forgetful human. He played the evilhalf perfectly as just someone being very ill. But when that happens be someplace else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the films that absolutely shouldn't have been remade a reimagining of The Stepfather is perhaps the most blasphemous blow ever struck against horror fans. This quiet masterpiece certainly deserves to be discovered by a larger audience but a remake only ensures that modern day filmgoers will soon forget that this classic even exists. For them The Stepfather will be immortalized in its more recent incarnation. This is truly a shame because the original is one of the most tense and truly frightening horror films of all time and improving upon it would be a dour impossibility.Terry O'Quinn is absolutely perfect as Jerry Blake among others and his performance here sets a new standard for screen psychos. O'Quinn is warm inviting and genuinely likable and even though we watch him walk through a bloodsoaked living room littered with the bodies of his slaughtered family at the film's outset it is at times impossible to imagine him shifting into that homicidal mode as we watch him interact with his new wife stepdaughter and his circle of friends. Most acquaintances of reallife serial killers are apt to say they were the perfect neighbor and O'Quinn's performance expertly essays the sociopathic abilities of the deranged. It creates a terrifying character one that we too would likely be lured in by and though we eventually see manifestations of the murderous rage bubbling beneath O'Quinn's placid veneer there is never any slip to indicate that anyone around him would ever suspect him of the heinous crimes of his past and the impending deeds of his future.The film is expertly paced wringing ever drop of tension possible out of the scenario and even though we know who Blake really is and we have a strong suspicion about what is going to happen to his new family O'Quinn's mastered performance doesn't let us know when he's going to snap until the very moment he does. The scene where Blake turns on a meddling psychiatrist is particularly brutal and a great indicator of just how aptly Blake fits into his new life. After all if a shrink could be in such close proximity with him and not notice something off how could we? Also strongly played is the substory about the brother of a previous victim trying to track down Blake and stop him before he kills again. His chase unfolds at a very natural clip and while it would be tempting for the filmmakers to toss in a surprise reveal that would lead him to Blake's new location and speed us into their showdown it is in fact a series of small clues that lead him there. This heightens the sense of realism that permeates the film and we are never distracted from being completely engrossed in the possibility that everything we are seeing could absolutely happen and probably has. Such realworld horrors are key to a modest thriller like this and in The Stepfather every one of these keys fit perfectly.Equally realistic is Blake's ability to alter his appearance enough to blend from one life to another. We see him in three different incarnations here and while there is never any question O'Quinn is at the core the actor's ability to bring out drastic changes through simple things like facial hair eyeglasses and hairstyle is stunning. His benign demeanor is certainly sufficient to rationally dismiss him from suspicion but when we see how different this cunning killer is able to look from place to place we can't help but imagine that Blake has been getting away with his predatory pattern for quite some time. Cleverly the film never tells us how many families Blake et al. has been disappointed by... and not knowing is actually scarier.Blake's championing of traditional family values is a deceptive and macabre mask for him to wear and the film doesn't waste any time delving into his backstory to hit us over the head with why this is so important to him. Through minor indicators we can piece together everything we need to know about his mysterious past and the filmmakers are intelligent enough to trust us to do so on our own.When little cracks start to chip away at Blake's facade of domestic bliss we know which path this leads down but that doesn't strip away any of the impact of the shocking climax. It's impossible not to gasp at the who am I here? scene in the kitchen which segues into one of the most gritty and realistic bits of violence I've ever seen on the screen. After that the film kicks into grand guignol mode and the bloody finale has genuine punch after the slow build leading up to it. Staying true to the realistic bent of the story and execution the filmmakers are wise not to make Blake an unstoppable killing machine and his crawling determination to finish his homicidal task despite the gunshot and knife wounds littering his body holds us in the grip of suspense until the husk that contains Blake's murderous inner demon is too damaged to move anymore.The Stepfather remains squarely in the cult classic category as of this writing and surprisingly it isn't even available on DVD in the US this film and the UK release of Creepshow were major factors that led me to invest in an allregion DVD player. Surely the remake will spark a proper domestic release for this underseen gem and I would encourage anyone reading this to seek out the original version before you waste your time with an update that has absolutely no chance of improving on such flawless source material I'd actually encourage you to not even hand over your money to support the remake but I'm a realist.Whatever leads you to discover this nearlyforgotten masterpiece don't miss it under any circumstances. You won't be disappointed.".

Also strongly played is the substory about the brother of a previous victim trying to track down Blake and stop him before he kills again. His chase unfolds at a very natural clip and while it would be tempting for the filmmakers to toss in a surprise reveal that would lead him to Blake's new location and speed us into their showdown it is in fact a series of small clues that lead him there. This heightens the sense of realism that permeates the film and we are never distracted from being completely engrossed in the possibility that everything we are seeing could absolutely happen and probably has. Such realworld horrors are key to a modest thriller like this and in The Stepfather every one of these keys fit perfectly.Equally realistic is Blake's ability to alter his appearance enough to blend from one life to another. We see him in three different incarnations here and while there is never any question O'Quinn is at the core the actor's ability to bring out drastic changes through simple things like facial hair eyeglasses and hairstyle is stunning. His benign demeanor is certainly sufficient to rationally dismiss him from suspicion but when we see how different this cunning killer is able to look from place to place we can't help but imagine that Blake has been getting away with his predatory pattern for quite some time. Cleverly the film never tells us how many families Blake et al. has been disappointed by... and not knowing is actually scarier.Blake's championing of traditional family values is a deceptive and macabre mask for him to wear and the film doesn't waste any time delving into his backstory to hit us over the head with why this is so important to him. Through minor indicators we can piece together everything we need to know about his mysterious past and the filmmakers are intelligent enough to trust us to do so on our own.When little cracks start to chip away at Blake's facade of domestic bliss we know which path this leads down but that doesn't strip away any of the impact of the shocking climax. It's impossible not to gasp at the who am I here? scene in the kitchen which segues into one of the most gritty and realistic bits of violence I've ever seen on the screen. After that the film kicks into grand guignol mode and the bloody finale has genuine punch after the slow build leading up to it. Staying true to the realistic bent of the story and execution the filmmakers are wise not to make Blake an unstoppable killing machine and his crawling determination to finish his homicidal task despite the gunshot and knife wounds littering his body holds us in the grip of suspense until the husk that contains Blake's murderous inner demon is too damaged to move anymore.The Stepfather remains squarely in the cult classic category as of this writing and surprisingly it isn't even available on DVD in the US this film and the UK release of Creepshow were major factors that led me to invest in an allregion DVD player. Surely the remake will spark a proper domestic release for this underseen gem and I would encourage anyone reading this to seek out the original version before you waste your time with an update that has absolutely no chance of improving on such flawless source material I'd actually encourage you to not even hand over your money to support the remake but I'm a realist.Whatever leads you to discover this nearlyforgotten masterpiece don't miss it under any circumstances. You won't be disappointed.";

Jill Shoelen gives us a down to earth realistic performance and comes across as real teen her best horror movie role and Shelly Hack Charlies Angelsgives an underplayed straight forward performance.

That's not to say that this wouldn't qualify as a horror movie it has plenty of gore and several boo moments.

The amazing thing about this perf is that the character could easily have been clich psycho your typical knifewielding maniac. But O'Quinn tries and succeeds at making The Stepfather a troubled very troubled man a man consumed with the concept of the perfect family. Jerry Blake cons his way into single mom families. Then when problems arise standard marriagefamily problems to normal people he butchers the family changes his appearance ties up all loose ends and moves onto the next awaiting mother and daughter. His latest family Susan and Stephanie Maine Shelley Hack and Jill Schoelen who by the way is a DEAD RINGER for Demi Moore's younger sister! adjust to Jerry's presence as well as any average movie motherdaughterontheirown would Mother becomes the peacemaker between the Stepdad trying too hard to click with Daughter and Daughter trying too hard to drive Stepdad away. Soon enough Stephanie is getting some bad vibes from Jerry starts digging around and soon Jerry's past begins to catch up with him. You probably have a pretty good idea of how it all plays out. But O'Quinn is mesmerizing. You really can't take your eyes off of him. Fortunately director Joseph Ruben included many camera shots that are either closeups or start off that way so that the viewer is really drawn into Jerry's eyes and can feel the fear he emanates. It's really remarkable. His Jerry is a very sick man indeed. He doesn't have knives for hands or a chainsaw to play with this guy has ISSUES!! Deep dark scary issues. And when you see that look on O'Quinn's face during the climactic showdown you'll know what I mean.To strengthen matters the other performances are quite good for this type of movie. Schoelen is appropriately childlike yet adolescent as Stephanie and Hack as Susan is maternal yet vulnerable. Ruben's direction is smooth careful and restrained. He's smart enough to back off when O'Quinn is doing his thing but brings a stylish yet no less creepy eye to the picture.When the hour and a half was up I was satisfied and glad that I decided to miss 'Family Guy' to watch this!".

At the same time he talks one heckuva good line. But inside all the candy coating beats the icy heart of a true psychopath.O'Quinn's terrific as Jerry Blake stepfather extraordinaire. His sudden transitions from Jekyll to Hyde are perfectly executed and scary as heck. And pity poor stepdaughter Stephanie Shoelen she senses something behind his calm demeanor but really has no idea. Then there's wife Susan Hack who's just happy having a complete family again plus a guy who's a good lover as the movie shrewdly shows.For nutcase Jerry however the family is a sacred ideal that allows no shortcomings. In short it's not the usual ideal we adjust to real people. Instead in Jerry's bloody hands it's an impossible standard for any mortal wife or kids. And woe betide those who don't live up to that impossible ideal. Jerry's like a guy in search of a unicorn but finding only ordinary horses he kills them causing the search to go endlessly on.The movie's violence is so sudden it's really jarring. Kudos to director Ruben who knows how to get the most out of Jerry's demonic character. Sure the premise takes the allAmerican notion of family and carries it to a psychopathic extreme. Just watch Jerry lovingly raise the model house birdhouse above everyone's head. It's a perfect visual metaphor for his obsession. And when it comes crashing down we know we're back to reality. My only complaint is with the overdrawn climax where people don't die in mortal fashion. Then again with Jerry that may be appropriate.Anyhow it's no wonder the 90minutes has become a cult favorite. Come to think of it I think I'll go sit in the warm sun for a while.".

O'Quinn is excellent as damaged dad intense measured and charmingly normal when required and then not over the top when he cracks and rants. Around him he is backed by strong turns from Schoelen Hack and Lanyer while Ruben's direction and Lindley's colour photography bring a credible feeling to the plot.A running subplot involving Shellen's grieving brother doing detective work feels a bit superfluous at times while a nude shower scene with Schoelen is totally unnecessary. Don't get me wrong Schoelen has a lovely body and is a very pretty girl the actress aged 24 at the time but she's playing a 16 year old! It just comes off as pointless titillation in a film that didn't need such tricks. Small irritants aside The Stepfather is intelligent horror and still holding up now in this age of torture and hackville subgenres. 7.510".

Small irritants aside The Stepfather is intelligent horror and still holding up now in this age of torture and hackville subgenres. 7.510";

That's why I gave it five stars because the content and bias deserved nothing.The message in this movie  and I am not exaggerating folks  is that someone who espouses oldfashioned family values is nuts in this case a thoroughlydemented serial killer! Yup to Liberal Hollywood decency equates to insanity while perversion equals good. Having watched tons of movies I wasn't shocked at this message but I was shocked how blatant it was presented. I mean have a little tact! What Hollywood won't do to slam family values.Supposedly this movie was based on a guy who killed his prior family and then remarried before getting caught. However be cautious when you see that word based because it might mean that only one percent of it involves the real facts of a case. You can bet the screenwriters added their PC bias.Anyway O'Quinn carries the film not just because he has the most interesting role but he just does a great job with it which I can't say for some of the females in here. Supporting actorsaside this would have been a better movie had the filmmakers' agenda hadn't been so obvious. Don't kid yourself this story wasn't about some serial killer it was all about Liberals slamming people who advocate some family morals. It was all about getting in yet more Left Wing propaganda.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Yasmine Kassari who won the 2005 Best Director Award at Mar Del Plata Film Festival for the film has made a film that is commendable for a debut effort from an Arab lady. The film is important because female issues in the Arab world often take a back seat and here is a film on Arab women made by a woman. No wonder it won a grand prize at the Tangiers film festival. Probably the Belgian production quality of the Moroccan coproduction aided its success at several lesserknown film festivals as well.I caught up with the film at the ongoing Dubai Film Festival and found the film honest and realistic only in patches. It presents the colorless and empty lives of semiilliterate women who are left behind in villages by husbands who seek greener economic pastures in Europe while cursing them in a song!. The women long for male companionship when there are few options for them even in time of sickness. Oppression by a maledominated society and use of traditional unscientific medicines contrasted with modern birthcontrol pills are realistically portrayed. While Director Kassari even elicits commendable performances from her main actors she includes an unrealistic sequence where a school teacher asks small kids about democracy which one student innocently thinks has something to do with bread. However more incongruous in the film was a television set if operated by batteries the film does not indicate such easy access by villagers to consumables such as batteriesshowing video films in a village that obviously did not have electricity and resorted to oil lamps in the evening and the semiilliterate women using a film camera with a felicity that would shock urban dwellers in Morocco or elsewhere. Equally out of place was a totally unwarranted gratuitous frontal nude sequence shot when a suggestive sideangle could have made the point even better. Director Kassari had good intentions but as the film progresses the realism gets diluted to a young cineaste's pipe dream where villagers can use film cameras run by batteries again? with the same felicity as milking goats! The film is at best notable merely as a commendable film on women from the Arab worldlittle else. There have been better films from Morocco in recent timessee Mohammad Asli's outstanding debut feature film on urban migration for instance.".

Fantomas demonstrates his power by assassinating a leading official a judge? a minister? the director of the Sret?  I wasn't following the boring pennydreadful plot all that closely  and anyway it turns out that he didn't murder him after all.COMMENT Most disappointing. I don't know which of many displeasures I should highlight first but I'll start with Simone Signoret. Don't bother to see this movie if like me you're a Signoret fan. Despite her top billing only Herrand the bland is billed above her her nondescript role is both pitifully small and decidedly dowdy. Mousy Simone is evenly matched with Herrand the bland who is about as menacing as the tooth fairy. With little effort Alexandre Rignault can walk all over him. So there's the whole plot of the movie shot to pieces in the first ten minutes. I'll admit there's plenty of action but what's the use of it? Rignault could lick a cream puff like Herrand with his legs bound together and both hands tied behind his back. In fact Herrand gets my vote as the weakest movie villain of all time. So what else is there to say? The movie was made on a top budget with set changes galore real locations and lots of extras milling around but it's a nothing film! I rate it 310 purely for its curiosity appeal.".

And that's when a savior shows up it's none other than Vladimir Matti Pellonp the band's former manager who mysteriously disappeared at the end of the previous flick remember? And no one ever saw him again. Sht happens. He tells them he has become Moses and that his mission is to take them back to their homecountry Russia. What he doesn't tell them is that he has also stolen the Statue of Liberty's nose and that a CIA agent Andr Wilms is after him. In other words it's gonna be one hell of a trip.Shame this trip back home isn't as interesting or funny as the Cowboys'original journey to the US. This time Kaurismki doesn't really know what to do with his characters as most of them are gone and what he has left isn't much around which to construct a coherent screenplay. Almost everyone's behavior has no explanation including VladimirMoses' who's a far less charismatic protagonist than he was back in 1989. Still the biblical references are amusing as are the scenes where the Cowboys get to sing with the usual results.So to sum up this film could have been much better but it's worth your time if you haven't already seen it.".

When I watch the first film I tend to watch it on my own mainly because the humour is so subtle so slight so strangely European that it often doesn't translate to a film you could have your pals come over and watch over beer and pizza. I find both films absolutely hilarious and compelling but it's a style of humour where you don't really laugh out loud it's like you are laughing inside your head. Go America chronicles their road trip to America and is in many ways more straight forward. They learn to play rock and roll music in order to get money all of which their manager takes and they end up in Mexico. The Meet Moses is much more bizarre.Their manager returns claiming to be Moses and insisting they have to go back to Europe but not before he has stolen the nose of the Statue Of Liberty. All manner of people are trying to get the nose back. Their journey leads them through many strange situations many of which are never explained and that's part of the beauty of this film makers style. You are often left confused or frustrated and that's just fine. I was delighted that one time member of UK punk band The Members Nicky Tesco reprises his role as American Cousin as his appearance in the first one was a huge unexpected bonus for me. Both these movies are well worth the investigation if you can find them and if you ever get to see The Leneigrad Cowboys play live  you should absolutely do it they are astounding!".

Already with the first film one was just as likely to sigh at the lameness of it all as chuckle at the gags. The sequel however is a much more somber film than its predecessor which mean there are even less gags and virtually every scene feels like milking a formula. While it might be worth a try if you are a committed fan of Kaurismki's body of work I would be very reluctant to recommend this or even the vastly superior LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO America to a general audience.".

According to who one listens to she was either a saint adored by the humble classes or a devil that manipulated her way to the top taking millions away from the same people she was trying to help.Eva Peron the biopic about her life presents her in a good light. The screen play by Jose Pablo Feinmann treats her as though she was a misunderstood person who was at odds with the oligarchy of Argentina who hated her because they saw in her a wild opportunist who was ruthless with the enemies she made along her way to the top. In fact nothing is made out of the many people that Eva was instrumental in driving them out of the country as was the case with many legitimate artists that couldn't work after the Perons came to power.Basically Eva Peron was a determined woman. She saw what illegitimacy did to her mother and family. She escaped to Buenos Aires because she saw herself as an actress something that never happened because she had no talent. Instead she attracted a military man who proved to be the best thing that happened to her. By joining forces with Juan Peron she was elevated to the role she tried to play all her life but no one would cast her in it the first lady of the nation! Eva if we are to believe what Mr. Feinmann wrote about her totally dominated the relationship as she wore the trousers in the Casa Rosada for all practical purposes. Eva Peron understood the power of reinvention. She went from an obscure third rate radio and film actress into the model of generosity as she had the final word in everything that mattered in the country. By creating her foundation to help the shirtless as she called the poor she became her own best creation.One thing comes clear in the film Eva Peron hated the rich classes. She was a bastard in a land where illegitimacy was a sin. It is clear that by pretending to be with the poor she was perceived as a saint. At the same time she lived in luxury that dazzled the same classes she advocated to be the leader. By dying Eva became an even larger mythical figure and became immortal.Juan Carlos Desanzo directed well paying attention to a visual style of the times when Eva lived. The best thing is Esther Goris who as Eva Peron makes this legend come alive in front of our eyes. Ms. Goris bears an uncanny resemblance to her character and her mannerisms evoking a bygone era with tremendous panache. Ms. Goris' Eva is full of 'earthy' talk as befitting a woman of her background. Victor Laplace is also good as Juan Peron.The only thing that doesn't come across in the film is the love Juan felt for his wife as the movie only concentrates on how Eva was instrumental for the success of Peron and his followers in Argentina.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Argentine feature was release around the same time as Alan Parker's film version of the hit musical Evita. For those interested in learning about Argentina's controversial first lady I recommend both films. Desanzo's version is lowerbudget and therefore not as spectacular as Parker's interpretation but Eva Pern is more historically accurate and fair in it's treatment of Evita. At least when compared to what has been written about her in a historical context.The film deals with the final stages of Eva Pern's life. It chronicles her bid for the vicepresidency and her illness in detail. Other stages of her short life childhood artistic years etc are seen in flashbacks.My only minor complaint lies with surprisingly Esther Goris. I say surprisingly because her performance is great more on this a little later and she does resemble Eva Pern during her final stages but when playing the younger Eva Duarte de Pern or the actress Eva Duarte Goris doesn't even come close in her resemblance. Maybe it's because I have seen one too many pictures of the historical woman pre1950 before her disease and the differences in physical appearance are too apparent. The real Eva's beauty was more radiant her hair more elaborate and her body was more voluptuous in those earlier years. Goris is too thin to abrasive and does not possess the softness that is evident in pictures or newsreel footage of the young Evita during her earlier years as the First Lady. I usually have difficulties watching a biofilm when the leading actor does not resemble the person they are portraying. I had a similar problem with Leonardo DiCaprio portraying Howard Hughes in The Aviator.Goris's voice and personality are also too overbearing. Granted the real Eva according to many was just that and her voice was indeed shrill when giving her impassioned speeches on the balcony of the Casa Rosada but during her less intense speeches and moments such as speaking to her Descamisados over the radio her voice was calm and peaceful. According to those who knew her best she also had a sweet and gentle side to her. That's not really seen in this film. Eva Pern was a diamond with some rough edges Goris is rough around the edges.With that said since Goris is portraying Eva during her final years for the most part she does indeed capture her essence physically and vocally and her performance is riveting. Like Madonna in Parker's film Goris appears to have become Eva Pern and her passion for the role is evident in this performance.Those thinking that this Argentine version will portray Eva as a saintly deity may be shocked. This interpretation portrays an Eva Pern who liked to wear nice clothes and hats but had the will of a survivor. A strong woman who talked the talk and walked the walk and was able to change for good or bad take your pick an entire nation forever due to her overwhelming fire and passion. This is a much tougher Evita than in Parker's film and if Madonna's Evita and Goris' Evita would ever face off in a boxing ring Goris' Eva would stand victorious.Despite my above comments Esther Goris is outstanding in her portrayal and the production as a whole is excellent. Considering the tremendous amount of misinformation about the real woman on film Little Mother Evita Peron starring the miscast Faye Dunaway and even the rock opera this film is a blessing. And for those like me who are thirsty for something more truthful to history we finally have a film that is pretty accurate historically and unbiased in it's treatment of it's leading lady and her legacy.7.5 out of 10.".

The film did not fare well at the box office and it unfortunately affected this brilliant film which presents a rather halftruth version but well dramatized account of the life of Argentina's most famous first lady Eva Peron. For many reasons this film is both good and bad. Many viewers and critics find fault with the rather bad cinematography and film editing the look of the film is not that of a film but more of a made for TV movie but they hardly recognize the precious quality of such aspects as the music by Jose Luis Castineira or the costume designs by Leonor Puga Sabate as well as the art direction and production. The film was not made in a studio. Rather it was shot in various locations in Argentina though mainly in its capital of Buenos Aires. This film is one that an authentic Argentinian film director produced and is his loving tribute to the great Eva a woman who is still loved in Argentina. All the actors too are Argentine. Esther Goris stars as Eva Duarte Peron who rose to power from humble beginnings as a struggling actress in film and radio during the early 1940's. Her romance with Juan Peron a decorated soldier with political ambitions leads to marriage. He becomes President and soon Eva finds herself in the center of the political arena. Argentina is suffering from a huge economic crisis and poor workingclass laborers need someone to represent them and defend their rights. Socialists exNazis and a stuffy upperclass oligarchy have all made things difficult for the poor to have a voice. Along comes Eva who had known poverty and is now playing a new role  that of a strong nearly dictatorlike leader. She establishes the Foundation Eva Peron and raises worker's salaries provides them with health benefits and vacations and generally defends the poor and minorities from the cruel and disdainful politics of the rich. She is a lot like a Latin Eleanor Roosevelt far outshining her President husband. She faces discrimination hatred and opposition from the upper classes from the military from Socialists and causes controversy because she's a woman and an exactress a profession that was not admired at the time in Argentina and in fact linked with prostitution. Ester Goris's portrayal is that of a tough gutsy Evita whose spirit is unbreakable. Before long Eva Peron is offered the position of Vice President but she acquires cancer and dies at the age of 33 in 1953. The scenes in which she undergoes unsuccessful operations and is visibly becoming worse is heartbreaking and difficult to watch yet tough Evita battles on even when she is ill. The ending is so moving. Esther Goris resembles Eva Peron in her final years and her performance is definitely Oscar worthy Foreing Picture. She is fearless relentless and because she is so outspoken she is both loved and hated. Her enemies plot her demise but we never see them triumph. Nice touches include her relationship with a homosexual wardrobe designer who also represents a hated minority group and shares Eva's views. Victor Laplace as Juan Peron has terrific chemistry with Goris. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles. Frankly this film can be enjoyed by two types of viewers an audience who has seen th Webber musical and enjoyed it and wish to learn more about Eva's life and history lovers who wish to see a drama based on her life. While this film is lovely and looks realistic it is not entirely truthful. Eva Peron was probably never as outspoken or as vigorous as Esther Goris and certain aspects of her life are omitted she had a Swiss bank account made from the money from her Foundatation and the film skips her rise to power. She was in several Spanish language films and was said to be a lousy actress. The film however is a fine tribute to a fine woman one who dared to be different at a time when actresses were not respected enough to become political figures. A splendid film and highly recommended.".

The film did not fare well at the box office and it unfortunately affected this brilliant film which presents a rather halftruth version but well dramatized account of the life of Argentina's most famous first lady Eva Peron. For many reasons this film is both good and bad. Many viewers and critics find fault with the rather bad cinematography and film editing the look of the film is not that of a film but more of a made for TV movie but they hardly recognize the precious quality of such aspects as the music by Jose Luis Castineira or the costume designs by Leonor Puga Sabate as well as the art direction and production. The film was not made in a studio. Rather it was shot in various locations in Argentina though mainly in its capital of Buenos Aires. This film is one that an authentic Argentinian film director produced and is his loving tribute to the great Eva a woman who is still loved in Argentina. All the actors too are Argentine. Esther Goris stars as Eva Duarte Peron who rose to power from humble beginnings as a struggling actress in film and radio during the early 1940's. Her romance with Juan Peron a decorated soldier with political ambitions leads to marriage. He becomes President and soon Eva finds herself in the center of the political arena. Argentina is suffering from a huge economic crisis and poor workingclass laborers need someone to represent them and defend their rights. Socialists exNazis and a stuffy upperclass oligarchy have all made things difficult for the poor to have a voice. Along comes Eva who had known poverty and is now playing a new role  that of a strong nearly dictatorlike leader. She establishes the Foundation Eva Peron and raises worker's salaries provides them with health benefits and vacations and generally defends the poor and minorities from the cruel and disdainful politics of the rich. She is a lot like a Latin Eleanor Roosevelt far outshining her President husband. She faces discrimination hatred and opposition from the upper classes from the military from Socialists and causes controversy because she's a woman and an exactress a profession that was not admired at the time in Argentina and in fact linked with prostitution. Ester Goris's portrayal is that of a tough gutsy Evita whose spirit is unbreakable.

	schema:reviewBody "'Miami Blues' fans nod at each knowingly like they share a secret. For some reason this super cool movie isn't all that well known by most movie buffs but those that appreciate it see it for the highly original and quirky piece of work that it is. Writerdirector George Armitage served his apprenticeship with exploitation king Roger Corman in the early 70s as did Jonathan Demme who coproduced. If you like Demme's midperiod movies like 'Something Wild' and 'Married To The Mob' you'll love 'Miami Blues'. Armitage even uses Demme's mascot Charles Napier the craggy faced character actor beloved by Russ Meyer nuts. The movie is based on a book by Charles Willeford which features his regular protagonist Hoke Mosely. Quentin Tarantino is a major Willeford fan and much of 'Miami Blues' prefigures Tarantino's fresh mix of crime and comedy. Mosely is played by Fred Ward who gives one of his very best performances. Alec Baldwin also lucks out as Junior. You'll rarely see either actor as good as this anywhere else. Both of them are just brilliant in this movie as is Jennifer Jason Leigh. The three of them together are just a joy to watch. Add to that small supporting roles by Napier Nora Dunn 'Three Kings' and Shirley Stoler 'The Honeymoon Killers' and it's a film buffs dream. You even get a totally pointless cameo by cult favourite Martine Beswick! I don't know why she's even in the movie but it's alright by me! I always enjoy watching 'Miami Blues' every time I pull it out of my collection. Lots of old favourites lose their appeal as the years go by not so this one which just gets better and better to me. Highly recommended fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the novel of the same name by Charles Willeford Miami Blues is an account of an excon's crime spree that includes murder theft and impersonating a police officer. It's also a thriller that's full of black humour strong violence and action that's delivered at high speed. The sheer pace of this movie and the quirkiness of its characters are its strongest points and together ensure that it remains gripping from start to finish.After being released from a California prison Frederick J Frenger Jr. Alec Baldwin flies to Miami airport where he steals a suitcase and gets hassled by a Hare Krishna devotee before casually breaking one of the guy's fingers in retaliation. Unfortunately his victim dies of shock and this triggers a police investigation.Frenger who prefers to be known as Junior checks into a hotel and orders a hooker. The simpleminded Susie Waggoner Jennifer Jason Leigh soon joins him and they quickly begin a romantic relationship. Susie who's working her way through college wants to settle down to a conventional lifestyle and so when she and Junior set up house together she happily spends her time cooking for him and keeping the place clean. She's unaware that he's an habitual thief and that during his time in Miami he's been carrying on business as usual.Detective Sergeant Hoke Moseley Fred Ward the veteran cop who's investigating the killing at the airport comes to Junior and Susie's place because he says that Junior has been identified as a possible witness. The unkempt detective chats affably to the couple and shares a meal with them during which he consumes numerous cans of beer and clearly becomes convinced that Junior is an excon and probably the killer he's pursuing. After finishing his meal and inviting Junior to a lineup at the police station he leaves.Incensed by Moseley's visit Junior goes to the detective's hotel room and brutally attacks the cop before stealing his gun badge and false teeth. This gives him the opportunity to go on another stealing rampage during which he enjoys posing as a cop and using every advantage it gives him to relieve various people of their money and possessions. The assault on Moseley led to him being hospitalised but after being discharged this previously laidback cop becomes extremely determined to hunt Junior down and bring him to justice.This movie's runofthemill plot is illuminated by its characters and Alec Baldwin gives a particularly energetic performance as the violent sociopath who's also an inveterate thief and a pathological liar. Deception also features strongly in his modus operandi as he arrives in Miami under an assumed identity indulges in a sham version of suburban life and masquerades as a cop.Jennifer Jason Leigh makes the nave Susie a sympathetic character and Fred Ward is great as the sleazy unshaven and cynical cop who's really struggling to cope but remains good natured despite being humiliated by Junior ridiculed by his colleagues and having personal problems with his false teeth alimony and indigestion. These characters' flaws emphasise their humanity and provide an effective counterpoint to the callous ruthlessness of Junior in what ultimately proves to be a very engaging crime thriller.".

Freddy meets and settles down with naive hooker Susie Waggoner a disarmingly warm and sweet portrayal by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Moreover Freddy steals the gun badge and false teeth from weary hardluck homicide detective Hoke Moseley the always excellent Fred Ward in peak scraggly form and starts posing as a cop so he can more easily break the law. It's up to a disgraced Moseley to find Freddy and bust him before things get too out of hand. Writerdirector George Armitage adapting Charles Willeford's firstrate crime novel successfully retains the idiosyncratic sensibility and colorfully engaging characters from the book the result is a lively engrossing and intoxicating cinematic cocktail of oddball black humor and nasty violence that maintains a constant snappy pace and a blithely amoral tone throughout. The original and unpredictable narrative has a genuine freshness and bristling vitality to it that's a total exciting joy to behold. This film further benefits from uniformly splendid acting from a bangup cast Baldwin Leigh and Ward are all outstanding in the lead roles they receive fine support from Charles Napier as jolly veteran detective Bill Henderson Nora Dunn as Moseley's hardnosed new partner Ellita Sanchez Obba Babatunde as hip blind informant Blink Willie Paul Gleason as vicious corrupt vice cop Frank Lackley Jose Perez as sniveling hotel bellboy pimp Pablo and Shirley Stoler as gruff jewelry store owner Edie Wulgemuth. Both Tak Fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and Gary Chang's moody score are likewise strong and effective while Norman Greenbaum's groovy religious rock classic Spirit in the Sky makes for a perfectly funky theme song.

I remember first seeing Breathless with some friends in a theater in Ithaca NY and emerging arguing about what it meant. I don't mean trying to identify any great load of symbolism or moral lesson it might be towing behind it. I just mean what happened and why? As I recall we decided that Breathless was an existential movie and didn't really need to be specific about what was going on. It was a story about a man making a life choice. You can be or do anything you want said Sartre and you can break all the rules  as long as you're willing to take the consequences.In Miami Blues the Belmondo part is played by Alec Baldwin a guy fresh out of prison who has chosen a life of wilful disobedience. His girl friend who really ought not to be in college is a parttime hooker with aspirations that are utterly bourgeois. Jennifer Jason Lee wants to live with her husband and babies in a house with a white picket fence. Fred Ward looking grizzled and great is a homicide detective whom Baldwin clobbers and whose identity he steals.I don't know why certain things happen. For instance I have no idea how or why Baldwin manages to dig up Ward's home address then goes there and beats hell out of him and winds up stealing his false teeth handcuffs and other cop accoutrements. What was THAT all about? I'll give one more example. Baldwin is in a convenience store and stumbles on an armed robbery. I'm the police! Drop that gun and walk out of here! he shouts  and threatens the armed robber with a jar of spaghetti sauce.See in an existentialist movie like this the characters don't really need to have motives. They do whatever they feel like doing.There IS continuity though even if in its details the movie makes very little sense. The characters are consistent and there is a rudimentary plot engaging and amusing without being in any way memorable.I did enjoy the movie though even the second time around or maybe even MORE the second time around since I'd learned not to expect an abundance of logic in the narrative.The acting of the three principles is also admirable. Alec Baldwin had just appeared in The Hunt for Red October in which he struck me as not much more than a handsome leading man. Here he's a different character entirely. Watch him as he struts down the street arms swinging jauntily grinning through pain happily throwing off non sequiturs in dramatic situations. Do you own a suede coat? he asks a criminal before murdering him. Lee is more than childlike. She's positively childish with her overflowing emotions. I loved Fred Ward in this. He's full of quirks and rarely seems to be taking the role seriously. Instead of soaking his precious false teeth in  what is that stuff Polydent?  he soaks them overnight in a glass of leftover booze.Interesting exercise in style and acting.".

After meeting Frenger at Susie's apartment Moseley is then beaten up by Frenger who then steals his badge gun and false teeth and goes on the rampage around Miami posing as a cop and stealing and mugging. These scenes are comical. It isn't long before Moseley is out of hospital and back on Frenger's trail again and towards the end there is a squeamish scene in a pawn shop. The performances are all great and there is also an appearance from the ubiquitous Charles Napier as Moseley's partner. It is a nourishingly nasty but very funny film to watch.";

Alec Baldwin plays a recently released sociopath murderer and thief who manages himself to steel a police badge in Miami. He is joined by a clueless hooker jennifer Jasonwho thinks she has found a decent man to settle down with. Fred Ward plays the officer trying to apprehend Baldwin and get his badge back. Mmiami blues is a great film mostly thanks to the performances by the three main characters. Baldwin does a beautiful job playing this psychopath in a way that you start rooting for him even though he is murdering assaulting and steeling from people you start seeing him as a really sick guy with the mental development of a child. I mean we clearly know his actions are no good at all but he plays it with a certain quality that even makes you feel sorry for the guy. This ambiguity with which he play the character is what builds the dark humor in this film because he seems as if he really isn't aware of the possible consequences of his actions. Jennifer Jason beautifully plays the gorgeous and naive prostitute that finds herself falling in love for this criminal. Fred Ward also does a great job playing the cop desperate to recover his badge from Baldwin. This movie greatly shows Baldwin'versatility and kind of makes me thing of a much lighter version of Henry Portrait of a serial killer in the way that both movies deal with leading characters that even thought their morals are highly questionables they kill and steel just for the kick of it they are not entirely unlikeable to the audiences witnessing their acts. Great performances Really Good film.".

This isn't a very nice movie and it's easy to see that's turned off a lot of the reviewers here. On the other hand despite the violence it's genuinely quirky and funny. The scene where Fred Ward as homicide detective Hoke Moseley and his cop buddy Charles Napier! crack jokes over the body of a murder victim while the victim's friend weeps a few feet away is priceless.Alec Baldwin does great work as Freddy Frenger sociopath and excon who immediately after his release from prison goes right back to beating people up and robbing them. Ward may have gotten top billing but Baldwin gets most of the screen time and dominates the movie. He first hires and then moves in with a dumb but innocent prostitute Susie Waggoner played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Leigh Baldwin and Ward all do excellent work and the movie looks like it was as much fun to make as it is to watch. Leigh's prostitute is easily the most sympathetic character of the bunch and what happens to her is quite frankly a little heart breaking. She easily deserves better and given the way the universe works that pretty much guarantees that she's not going to get it.Speaking of Waggoner and Frenger a lot of the reviewers here are misinterpreting the nature of their relationship. They both really do want that house with the yard and the white picket fence and they really do love each other. When Leigh's Waggoner normally an excellent cook deliberately ruins a vinegar pie she's cooking for desert Frenger forces himself to down every forkful while praising her culinary skills.Highly recommended.".

When he accidentally kills someone at the airport he becomes hunted by the police  something that his criminal activities can't afford.  When Sergeant Moseley gets too close to catching him Jnr robs him taking his badge gun and false teeth.  Living with his wife under a lie Jnr starts to live out the life as a cop AND a criminal while Moseley tries to get him.I've seen this film a couple of times and still am not 100 sure what it wants to be a comedy a violent crime thriller or a mix of both.  A mix of both would seem to be the answer but the two don't seem integrated only separate throughout the film.  What the film comes across as is the story of two men both of whom have their own humorous touches and quirks that make the story work quite well.The story is quite violent and is best viewed as a crime thriller that happens to have dark humour through it.  While the plot seems to lack a real obvious direction it is the characters that take the film along.  Frenger is violent and unhinged and played very well by a crazy looking Baldwin. Moseley is a stronger character whom I would have liked to have seen more of in the film  he is cheap dirty and very interesting.  Ward fits him like a glove and plays the character well.  The third strong in the bow is rather sympathetic and is well done by Leigh who delivers an interesting character.Overall this is a strange hybrid but it works well.  It has all the traits of a pulp thriller with dark comedy even if the plot is less substantial than I'd expected it to be.  Overall this is an underrated little film that is well worth keeping an eye out for if only for it's characters and dark humorous violence.".

The acting is solid throughout and even though Baldwin's character is clearly a sociopath he isn't totally without charm and seems to genuinely love Susie.Alec Baldwin plays Frederick J.

We know he isn't nice when he breaks the finger of a Hare Krishna devotee as he leaves the airport unknown to him this causes the Krisna to go into shock and die. He then goes to a hotel where being the classy gent he is he orders a prostitute from the manager.Susue the prostitute played by the always excellent Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't appear to be too bright although she claims she is doing it to pay her way though college. They clearly hit it off fairly quickly as not long after meeting they are engaged and Susie has retired from prostitution Junior however has not retired from his life of crime.The killing of the Krishna is investigated by a rather unusual homicide detective he seems a bit of a loner and keeps forgetting to put his false teeth back in. He soon finds Junior but doesn't have the evidence to arrest him so instead stays for dinner and ends up exchanging recipes with Susie.Junior decides to pay Sgt. Moseley a visit and steals his gun handcuffs and badge which he then uses to assist him when he takes the illgotten money of various criminals. He also takes Moseley's false teeth.The rest of film follows Sgt. Moseley as he attempts to retrieve his badge and teeth and bring Junior to justice.Over all this film is definitely worth watching if you have the chance and if you in the unlikely event that don't like it it is only ninety minutes long so you won't have wasted much time.".

Since all the faculty had been men people at the school are taken a bit back by her arrival. However since it is sweet old Greer it's not surprising that the kids all come to love her and need her. She is like a slightly sterner version of the movie Maria Von Trapp but without all the singing! About the only story element I disliked was when Greer wrote letters to one lonely boy in which she pretended to be the kid's uncaring mother and father. Lying to the boy seemed cruel and stupidas one day he's bound to realize his parents were too selfabsorbed to even bother writing. Why she didn't just send him letters in her name or arrange for mail to come for him I just didn't understand.Still the film is enjoyable and sweet so I suggest you give it a try. Not among Garson's best but still a likable little film.".

While I agree with the previous post stating this film is a familiar vehicle for Garson I disagree with him on the statement that Garson could have chosen a better film to appear in. I'm sure the previous poster has not forgotten that when this film was made Garson was still under contract to MGM and the company had been dealing with a shift in power during this period. The powers that be at the studio would not give the actress parts that were fitting of her abilities and range. As a result she took films like this to avoid being shunned by the film community and to continue working. She also was trying to avoid being sued by the studio for breach of contract. Eventually she did grow tired of being stuck in films like this so she did what any graceful woman like herself would do...she waited for her contract to expire by taking films like this. When her contract was up she left.For more inside information of Garson the poster above should read her book A Rose for Mrs. Miniver to get an in depth understanding of this great actress.Also on a sad note this is one of Garson's films that has never gone to video.

It narrates the charming saga of a not so brilliant female teacher who by the way has a tremendous sense of humanity. From the opening many teachers would remember and recognize how their final professional choice didn't come at first sight but instead after a few shocks with reality. And a very hard reality which obliged them to review the situation and put many golden dreams away. The same happened to this charming redhead Jan Stewart. She recalls her former dreams while flying to the place where she will become the teacher of twelve boys in a boarding school. Sometimes rich boys may cry and Jan does her best to avoid it although often misunderstood by the little devils she has to take care of. Greer Garson is competent as always and Robert Ryan is also well as the competent teacher that finally falls in love with Jan. Also noteworthy is the young actor who plays the rejected rich boy dropped in a boarding school by his insensitive parents. Don't know his name. And a crazy coffee pot provides extra fun. Finally this is not the first color film of Greer Garson. It's true that she rarely was seen in color but before this film she was seen in color in Scandal at Scourie an MGM Technicolor movie from 1953 also starring Walter Pigeon Donna Corcoran and Agnes Moorehead. As a leading lady Garson was seen only in three color films every one in a different process Scandal at Scourie Technicolor Her Twelwe Men Ansco ColorPrint by Technicolor and Strange Lady in Town Warnercolor. Then Greer Garson in color was a matter of supporting cast or special appearances. A pity. I was a boy when I saw her last films. But I miss her. I liked her.".

They achieve box office draw with these charms but not so much on critical review. To me Ms. Garson has it all  and as a matter of record she has scored in both categories. She has such a dimensional charming presentation making her fascinating to watch. Along with that she is quite skillful in portrayal.Perhaps the reviewer who mentioned Ms. Garson's color films forgot That Forsyte Woman from 1949. She did a Disney film much later The Happiest Millionaire with Fred MacMurray which was of course in color.This film  Her Twelve Men  is perhaps one of the few weak links in her chain of memorable films. The problem of diminishing offerings became a rueful experience for every Hollywood actress during those decades of studio contracts. As has been stated here she likely did it to fulfill her contract and to keep working.Also as the decade wore on films became more daring and Ms. Garson shunned the nudity and coarseness that was being introduced. She is credited with saying that motion pictures should reflect up to the sky not down to the ground. I appreciate that sentiment. It was shared by others at that time as well.I think you have to appreciate Ms. Garson to go this film. It's just so boring. And I just can't like Robert Ryan. A smile seems to be a rarity for his face. He has a critical sort of look while in repose and appears downright nasty in his negative scenes. He seems very unattractive to me in general mainly because of this.If you have any competition for viewing at the time this one comes up I'd recommend going with the other one. It's not that it is so badly done particularly it's just such a weak theme in general.".

This ultimately has disastrous consequences for both husband and wife despite their separating early in the story.There are very effective touches here unique to the French thriller. I especially liked Kahn's fearless willingness to run a protagonist straight into the ground so we can watch him grossly err and see him swerve into disaster a risk most American directors wouldn't have the guts to take. He infuriates us and we are in total fear for him all at the same time. I also liked the way that Kahn can imbue simple sequences like a series of phone calls with utter tension. What I did not like was the encroachment of pat storytelling elements. The resolution is purely canned and in particular there is one coincidence in the movie that is so Hollywood  so Jerry Bruckheimer  that it made me wince in embarrassment. It almost seems that at the end another director altogether stepped in to take the helm.Red Lights is definitely worth seeing but Kahn should have stayed the course with his somber bold storytelling rather than chickening out as he did.

	schema:reviewBody "This film in my humble opinion has been misunderstood by the public judging by the comments I've heard about it. First of all the director Cedric Kahn is one of France's most interesting figures to come out in the last years. He knows what he is doing and what's more he's being naughty in the way he presents his story that makes us see it one way but is it what we are seeing real? The adaptation by M. Kahn and Laurence Ferreira Barbosa takes the Georges Simenon story from America to France.The most interesting thing about Antoine is that he is an ordinary man. He is married to a Helene who is a more successful person Helene is a lawyer who must make a lot of money much more than Antoine. As a couple we can't see them together at all. Antoine is a man who is not handsome. Helene on the other hand is a beautiful woman and we wonder what brought them together in the first place? We witness Antoine going to the bathroom where he ogles his own wife in the shower. It appears their sexual life has ended long before we meet them.Antoine has a drinking problem. On the trip to pick up their children they encounter heavy traffic. As they take a detour from the main highway their troubles start. We see the passing red lights of the different bars beckoning Antoine to stop and have another beer or a beer with a chaser. To make things worse they hear on the radio about the escapee from the Le Mans prison near to where they are traveling. We see the roadblocks and the erratic way in which Antoine begins to drive.After one pit stop Helene disappears. She has decided to take the train and leaves him a note. Antoine goes to the station but he is late. Thus begins what will be a long night adventure along rural nocturnal France.Without giving away what happens we watch Antoine waking up. Antoine's car is in a ditch and he must fix the tire if he wants to go to get the children. This awakening seems to me the turning point of the story. Are we sure what we saw after Helene's disappearance and what happened in the road to Antoine with a stranger really occur? Mr. Kahn is playing with us. There are a lot of clues but as detectives the director is asking us to stay attentive to what is really going on or isn't.The film belongs to Jean Pierre Darroussin. He is an actor whose own appearance makes us not care for the man we see on the screen. On the other hand M. Darrousin knows who this Antoine is and what makes him tick. His performance is subtle yet he carries the film in a way no one would expect from a not well known star. Carole Bouquet is a bourgeois woman who seems to be living in the wrong marriage. In contrast with her husband she is in control of her life she appears at least on the surface not to care about Antoine but she has stayed married for a while. We know that Helene cares for Antoine at the end of the film when the two meet at the hospital. This film shows Cedric Kahn as a director to be reckoned with.".

His performance is subtle yet he carries the film in a way no one would expect from a not well known star. Carole Bouquet is a bourgeois woman who seems to be living in the wrong marriage. In contrast with her husband she is in control of her life she appears at least on the surface not to care about Antoine but she has stayed married for a while. We know that Helene cares for Antoine at the end of the film when the two meet at the hospital. This film shows Cedric Kahn as a director to be reckoned with.";

He brings an interesting blend of visuals with the city and the roads the cars then as it grows darker outside the lights outside become key. When Antoine awakes the next morning on the roadside he's out in the country. As well he has a great blend of music from Debusy whom I may have heard before this film but never recognized. It's a fascinating element to add with the impending doom of the film's story. But the key thing that the director can do for a film is the right casting and here's it's impeccable in dealing with the three leads. JeanPierre Darrousin is terrific at conveying the mindset of this husband in a rocky relationship. Then in the second and third acts despite what he's doing on the road he keeps consistent in keeping as the film's reluctant hero. Credit should also be given to firsttime actor Vincent Deniard who is perfect at being the quiet one you got to watch. And Carole Bouquet is a fair counterpart to a Darrosin. Although the denouement starts to drag for my money the film's main chunk doesn't. It would be one thing if Antoine just got drunk. But there's also a good interest in the talking points with the character as he decides to blow his mind in the process. Red Lights is definitely an arthouse film that won't please everyone the film ends rather realistically without the kind of extra bit American audiences might want that's more intimate here but it's still very compelling.".

But this is not what it is all about. The thriller plot is merely an excuse to give a touching and disturbing portrayal of character Antoine and his marriage.Let me answer to two of the plot holes discovered by two other commentators Antoine's drinking does make sense he drinks because of frustration and a minority complex for not feeling man enough in the presence of his successful wife. His drinking is a childish act of defiance he is not a sensible grownup not a man as he keeps repeating himself. And of course he doesn't recall all these telephone numbers from his memory as indicated with one of the first calls he calls directory inquiries and has himself connected to the respective partner each time remember there is cuts between the various calls.Red Lights is a brilliant character study concealed as a masterpiece of suspense. Darroussin gives a touching performance in his role as hero and antihero at the same time. He is not particularly likable but still makes us feel sorry for him.The ending which I am not going to reveal here is stirring in a very subtle way because above all it raises the question how it is all going to go on.I like stories in which weird things happen out of character logic.

Adapted from the 1953 novel by Georges Simenon and set to Debussy's elegantly creepy Nuages writerdirector Cedric Kahn offers up movie with attributes of a Hitchcockian suspense thriller.The feeling of foreboding begins immediately when we meet Antoine Dunant JeanPierre Darroussin a lowlevel insurance executive. He's just leaving his job to meet his beautiful wife Hlne Carole Bouquet in a local caf. They are planning to drive to the countryside from Paris to pick up their kids from summer camp.But as soon as Antoine gets to the caf he guzzles three beers back to back with one eye on the street lest his wife arrive before he's suitably fortified. It soon becomes pretty obvious that their marriage is far from happy  Antoine armed with enough drink to sink an elephant settles into a manner of truculent impetuosity while Helene remains detached cold and almost abusive.While in the road Helen discovers that her husband is utterly plastered. She hardly says anything as he weaves all over the road but her silence speaks volumes. Thus starts a trip of barely controlled hostility with the husband clenching the wheel and brooding while the wife fumes beside him. Both are so busy bickering with each other and thinking dark thoughts that they're half oblivious to news reports of an escaped convict on the loose nearby.Antoine isn't usually a drinker but something has snapped in him and as the neon signs of the roadside bars start to beckon him he becomes obsessed with downing as much cold beer and whisky as he can. He leaves Helene angrily waiting in the car while he goes into yet another bar to prepare himself for the long night ahead.Hlne freaked by his increasing belligerence and inability to drive in a straight line abandons her husband to look for a train station. Meanwhile Antoine strikes up a conversation with a reserved onearmed stranger Vincent Deniard.When minutes later the stranger steps out of the parkinglot shadows his face half hidden by the hood of a sweatshirt and asks for a ride the cocky staggering Antoine doesn't even break stride. By now he's so sweaty and drunk that he waves the fellow right into the car.What follows is detour into a night of terror for Antoine Helene and for the viewer. The movie starts to resemble everyone's nightmare  the inexplicable disappearance of a loved one. And as Antoine embarks on a desperate journey to track his wife down it soon becomes clear that Red Lights is really showing us a portrait of a marriage a marriage that has been enigmatically hanging by a thread.Their need to see the children again is probably just a way of distracting them from the aridness of their relationship. She's beautiful and accomplished while he plain and dull. Somehow the couple began their marriage as equals but she soon eclipsed him for which he can't forgive her. Other than this Kahn provides very little reason as to why their relationship has suddenly gone sour.What Kahn does provide however is the knowledge that marriage can often dissipate completely leave two strangers in a car totally sick of each other in desperate need of a reviving shock to the system. But when the sun finally rises and Antoine is released from his drunken hell Kahn does provide a dash of hope for the couple.In the end Red Lights is showing that relationships are frail and that the machinations of marriage are often inexplicable. And if nothing else Antoine and Helen show that it can all dramatically and irrevocably change and fall apart in a searing flash of red light. Mike Leonard September 05.".

Do violent deranged escaped prisoners really hang out for a few in the bar across from the train station? Are French cops really that dim? If that were you wouldn't you have one rampaging motherofallhangovers hangover the next day? For the answers to these and other questions stay home. Better yet go see something good.";

The last few seconds of the movie show the couple exchanging loving smiles while driving to the South where they would pick the children from a camp to continue together the vacation. Everything goes wrong in the inbetween.'Feux Rouges' starts as a relationship drama and turns into a thriller and a wrongturn movie. It is inspired by a novel of the Georges Simenon and as many of Simenon's novels the characters are far from being great communicators. The lack of communication the routine and maybe the differences in social positions make of Antoine an unhappy husband who is ready to spoil the start of the vacations by heavy drinking while on road. Much of the movie happens on the road and the gradual tension building picking with the disappearance of the wife Helen strikes a cord of uneasiness and even claustrophobia  great achievement for a film filmed on highways and roads with the sky almost permanently on view. As in many of Simenon's novels there is a moralistic twist and justice is made even if it is completely the result of hazard and not of the will of men. And there is a huge price to pay for this justice which we only can guess as it happens out of the screen and story time.Director Cedric Kahn has learned a few lessons in thrillers from the great masters and fist of all from Hitchcock. Antoine is wonderfully played by JeanPierre Darroussin as the type of character that we know from the very first moment that he will get into trouble and he indeed does all to confirm this but it is the character of Helene played by Carole Bouquet that he relates to all the time and who is his focal point of frustration worry and love.The simplicity of the story telling the careful gradation of tension towards horror the low key ending which does not solve the conflict but just postpones it beyond the duration of the screening make of this film a worth watching piece of cinema.".

	schema:headline " Irritating insulting and out of date";
	schema:reviewBody "The French are renowned for intellectualising cinema and identifying it as an area of artistic merit with films such as  Bout de Souffl Belle de Jour and more recently the enchanting Amelie providing examples of the pinnacle of film making. Expectations can be high as they were with Feux Rouges and it can be easy to be disappointed.The narrative follows a married couple's journey to pick up their two children from summer camp. Helene Carole Bouquet is beautiful and intelligent and is a hit at the law firm where she works but her husband Antoine Jean Pierre Darroussin is less successful and attractive leaving him with feelings of impotency which he deals with by drinking. This offering from our Gallic neighbours has left me with a desire to sign the petition to fill in the channel tunnel immediately. I have been violently offended by this film. I consider myself a modern man unthreatened by powerful women I have a willingness to talk about my emotions I even shed a tear at the end of Titanic. But when confronted with a drink driving caveman that harbours a desire to beat his chest and reinstate some prehistoric superiority over his wife I can only be insultedThe insult is not the fault of the cast Darroussin's enchanting performance is particularly impressive perfectly portraying the levels of inebriation at times humorous always pitiful. It is not his drinking that annoys as Dudley Moores Arthur and Richard E Grants Withinail show drunks can be hilarious. It is the response of those around the drunk that are both bewildering and frustrating. Bars next to the motorway continue to serve the drunken Antoine and he coasts through a police roadblock with ease. The night time cinematography is surreal and beautiful perfectly expressing the hypnotic quality of road markings and headlights that can easily enthral the unwary driver. This is heightened by a fairy tale quality that is given to some of the nocturnal motorway encounters. The director does manage to build up tension and the first half of the film is gripping as we search for the answers for Antoine's drinking and sympathise with his plight as he is continuously kept waiting by his wife. Their relationship is interesting at this stage primarily because we are intrigued why Helene has settled for the unhappy and unpleasant Antoine. Unfortunately the film deteriorates quickly from then on never knowing quite what it wants to say. The only message that does come through clearly is a rather unpleasant one regarding equality between the sexes in a contemporary world. Antoine's journey is one of discovery as he searches for his identity as a man. This is emphasised by his disregard for authority by speeding and drink driving causing his wife to get the train. His attempts to bond with other men and his rants about brotherhood seem laughable but also dangerous as shown in the tense scene in which he picks up a hitchhiker. The film continues to irritate when Antoine realises that the hitchhiker is a wanted killer but looks up to him because he is a real man and does not bow down to anyone. By allowing Antoine to kill this murderer in self defence the audience is told that it is in combat that men become real men in this case Antoine regains his masculine power. He becomes the warrior. Helene is still strong though and in order to put her back in her place and to restore Antoine's masculinity fully Helene has to be stripped of her power by the last weapon of degradation that man has against woman. The rape revelation allows Antoine to return to his shattered and broken spouse and be a pillar of strength taking his rightful place as master of the household and removing any guilt he would feel at taking another mans life as he can view it as revenge for the violation of his wife.Is this a comment on the modern man? Are we still in an age in which men are so threatened by equality that was want to revert to some archaic time where the phallus rules over all?The cinematography is impressive in parts the characters are believable and there are moments of genuine humour but it is uneven with plot holes and distracting suggestions about infidelity and conspiracy theories. As a literary adaptation it suffers from the lack of a strong captain at the helm who also appears to have been intimidated by the source material. It lacks clarity of storytelling and bumbles between a cinematic experience and the representation of a literary one. Feux Rouges remains an immensely irritating film that portrays a man that has no place in today's society.".

	onyx:emotionText "The French are renowned for intellectualising cinema and identifying it as an area of artistic merit with films such as  Bout de Souffl Belle de Jour and more recently the enchanting Amelie providing examples of the pinnacle of film making. Expectations can be high as they were with Feux Rouges and it can be easy to be disappointed.The narrative follows a married couple's journey to pick up their two children from summer camp. Helene Carole Bouquet is beautiful and intelligent and is a hit at the law firm where she works but her husband Antoine Jean Pierre Darroussin is less successful and attractive leaving him with feelings of impotency which he deals with by drinking. This offering from our Gallic neighbours has left me with a desire to sign the petition to fill in the channel tunnel immediately. I have been violently offended by this film. I consider myself a modern man unthreatened by powerful women I have a willingness to talk about my emotions I even shed a tear at the end of Titanic. But when confronted with a drink driving caveman that harbours a desire to beat his chest and reinstate some prehistoric superiority over his wife I can only be insultedThe insult is not the fault of the cast Darroussin's enchanting performance is particularly impressive perfectly portraying the levels of inebriation at times humorous always pitiful. It is not his drinking that annoys as Dudley Moores Arthur and Richard E Grants Withinail show drunks can be hilarious. It is the response of those around the drunk that are both bewildering and frustrating. Bars next to the motorway continue to serve the drunken Antoine and he coasts through a police roadblock with ease. The night time cinematography is surreal and beautiful perfectly expressing the hypnotic quality of road markings and headlights that can easily enthral the unwary driver. This is heightened by a fairy tale quality that is given to some of the nocturnal motorway encounters. The director does manage to build up tension and the first half of the film is gripping as we search for the answers for Antoine's drinking and sympathise with his plight as he is continuously kept waiting by his wife. Their relationship is interesting at this stage primarily because we are intrigued why Helene has settled for the unhappy and unpleasant Antoine. Unfortunately the film deteriorates quickly from then on never knowing quite what it wants to say. The only message that does come through clearly is a rather unpleasant one regarding equality between the sexes in a contemporary world. Antoine's journey is one of discovery as he searches for his identity as a man. This is emphasised by his disregard for authority by speeding and drink driving causing his wife to get the train.

After all the director of this contrived and artificial piece of nonsense is confident that he has overwhelmed us with shock and horror. The problem is that nothing in the plot is remotely credible. Indeed it is frankly impossible. Carole Bouquet and her husband are driving south from Paris and a convict has escaped from a prison. Husband and wife split up after a quarrel. One takes the train and the other drives. We are expected to believe that out of the sixty million people in France the escaped convict on the same evening encounters only these two separately! He rapes the wife on the train and tries to murder the husband in his car. He does these two things in separate places more or less at the same time. Surely this is carrying surrealism too far. Are we not entitled to the respect of some semblance of rationality in the plot of a film which is supposed to be a 'suspense' film? But it gets worse. The couple are supposed to be driving south to pick up their two children aged 8 and 10 from summer camp. Despite this they quarrel over nothing and the wife abandons the car. As for the husband he has consumed several bottles of whiskey and numerous beers is totally drunk and is driving suicidally. What a way to pick up the kids! What is more astonishing is that we are meant to feel sympathy for the idiotic and irresponsible husband because poor fellow the convict whom he first approaches and then provokes turns on him. What a shame the convict didn't kill the useless twerp. What advanced state of decadence have the French media class entered now when in film after film we are all expected to shed crocodile tears for despicable and loathsome characters? And this film was nominated for a prize at the Berlin Festival! What is going on? Has everybody gone completely raving mad? This film is not worth watching and yet there are plenty of people around praising it. The characters are inhuman and the plot is absurd. Somehow somewhere something very deep is going wrong with filmmakers in France and their critics and festival juries. I called attention to this in my review of 'L'Enfant'. When the wholesome and delightful film 'Amelie' came out a few years ago a chorus of French critics and media folk howled in protest about it and heaped abuse upon it in the press. There is a sickness a deeply serious and growing sickness amongst certain levels of the French media class. All sense of morality has been thrown overboard and a howling intolerance of anything wholesome arises from a baying pack of corrupt and arrogant media insiders. This is all very worrying for those like myself who love French culture and wish it to continue in some form which can continue to command some respect.".

The pace is fast and there is tension followed by a letup at frequent intervals. We the audience identify with the protagonist and cheer for him or her to succeed. In this film there is a central character called Antoine who is stupid beyond belief  Homer Simpson is a philosopher by comparison  and who gets himself into a nasty but routine situation he could have easily avoided if giving a lift to an escaped psychopath is routine. Then he blunders his way out of it. We sigh with relief at the end as he avoids a fate he richly deserves. Funnily enough he is almost sympathetic for his one concern is the safety of his family  he might be thick but like Homer his heart's in the right place.There's plenty of tension though built up in a different way. The camera spends a lot of time on closeups especially on JeanPierre Darroussin of Marseilles movies fame who plays Antoine. An air of menace is generated by car radio bulletins heavy nighttime road traffic seamy roadside dives and Antoine's increasing intake of alcohol which reaches almost incredible proportions. Most of the time is spent on busy French roads at and we spend a lot of time waiting for the inevitable crash.JeanPierre Darroussin turns in a remarkable performance.

You wonder how they ever got together. Yet Darrousin somehow convinces us that the fate of this little man matters to her as well as to us.The original property apparently was a story by the prolific French writer Georges Simenon of 'Maigret' fame and the interrogation of Antoine by an extraordinarily wellbriefed police officer is straight out of a Maigret episode. I would think the story has been updated a bit career woman attorneys were pretty unusual in Maigret's day. I can't really think that the police would assume so readily that Antoine was not guilty of any crime  police officers are known more for their pedantry than imagination but at least it helps the plot towards resolution.You won't like this movie if you don't like French films but it is a vivid and absorbing entertainment albeit about someone we pity rather than admire. It has not encouraged me to any do more driving in France even in an apparently indestructible Rover.".

	schema:reviewBody "The setting for Bhowani Junction is India during the last days of the British Raj. The town of Bhowani is a railroad junction and both the Congress Party and the Communist Party are doing all kinds of sabotage to help the British quickly get out of India. Of course each is doing it for their own reasons.Two people who may have given the outstanding performances of their careers are Ava Gardner and Bill Travers. Both play biracial people who don't fit in either society. But they react differently. Gardner is going through a whole lot of angst really seeing both the British and Indian point of view. How she missed an Oscar nomination here is beyond me.Bill Travers is the railroad station manager and his whole life is his job. He focuses narrowly on that and his tunnel vision leaves him oblivious to the momentous changes around him. Except for the fact that when the British leave he might lose that little piece of authority where he is that which gives him stature in the Raj society.

	onyx:emotionText "The setting for Bhowani Junction is India during the last days of the British Raj. The town of Bhowani is a railroad junction and both the Congress Party and the Communist Party are doing all kinds of sabotage to help the British quickly get out of India. Of course each is doing it for their own reasons.Two people who may have given the outstanding performances of their careers are Ava Gardner and Bill Travers. Both play biracial people who don't fit in either society. But they react differently. Gardner is going through a whole lot of angst really seeing both the British and Indian point of view. How she missed an Oscar nomination here is beyond me.Bill Travers is the railroad station manager and his whole life is his job. He focuses narrowly on that and his tunnel vision leaves him oblivious to the momentous changes around him. Except for the fact that when the British leave he might lose that little piece of authority where he is that which gives him stature in the Raj society.

Thankfully Stewart Granger adds a welcome calm and command when on screen. Also against this film are the white actors painted brown to look like Indians. I have no objections to the practice English speaking Indian actors weren't easy to find in the 1950s but in several cases the makeup is so bad that it is distracting. The Indian actors themselves are all very creditable out acting some of the 'noise and fury' European actors. What makes this film worth watching is the subject matter and the mature and complex way in which it is dealt with. Far too many films on racism are onedimensional rants but this thanks to its source material in John Master's excellent and authoritative novel is complex. Rather than simple black and white you have whites against Indians AngloIndians against all Communists against Congress Hindu caste against caste religion against religion. Everyone is implicated but everyone is a human rather than a viewpoint. So the racist and snobbish AngloIndian lover who is obsessed with not letting the sun darken his complexion still common in India where skinlightening creams are much prized also risks his life to save Indian peasants who are the darkest of the dark. Whilst the local Congress Party leader a nice man who marshals locals in commendable passive resistance still holds to the Hindu caste system which goes far beyond British colonial racism in terms of regarding others as inferiors and moderating social conduct accordingly. The end is a cross between the obvious a happy ending for the lovers not present in the book with a sombre grasp of reality as everyone realises that there will always be differences between groups which can be bridged but never abolished.".

	schema:headline " The British Empire Meets the Hollywood Empire";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood normally left films about British rule in India to the British themselves The Drum Black Narcissus North West Frontier but Bhowani Junction is an exception. Certainly John Masters' novel offered everything needed to make a thinking man's epic an exotic setting plenty of action a thrilling finale and a serious theme in this case racism. When Hollywood examined racial issues it often preferred to do so in the context of European colonialism rather than in the context of America itself. The film is set in the Indian railway town of Bhowani Junction in 1946 a year before independence. The British administrators are resigned to leaving India but still hope to exercise an influence over the path the country will take after independence. Hence their preference for the Congress Party over the proMoscow Communist Party. After all Jawaharlal Nehru the Congress leader was a wealthy patrician Fabian socialist a lawyer by training and educated at public school and Oxbridge Harrow and Trinity College Cambridge just like the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee Haileybury and University College Oxford. According to this film the Communists are attempting to frustrate the handover of power to the Congress Party by acts of sabotage hoping to create chaos which will enable them to seize power themselves. Moreover some Congress activists are also trying to hasten the departure of the British by nonviolent acts of resistance although these often play into the hands of the Communists. Unusually for a film about the Raj the film does not concentrate solely on relations between the British colonialists and the native peoples of India. Several of the leading characters are drawn from a third group the country's AngloIndian or mixed race community. The AngloIndians were and are a distinct community within India bound together by the English language an Anglocentric culture and the Christian religion. The main character is Victoria Jones the daughter of an AngloIndian train driver and the film depicts the relationships between Victoria and the three men in her life Colonel Rodney Savage a senior British army officer Ranjit Singh a Sikh active in the Indian independence movement and Patrick Taylor an AngloIndian railway official. Many AngloIndians worked on the railways. The fact that Victoria's lovers are drawn from the three different communities is symbolic of her uncertainty about her own cultural identity. The AngloIndians tended to identify culturally with Britain rather than India although few of them had ever visited Britain but were not fully accepted by either the British or the native Indians both of whom referred to them by the same derogatory term cheechee. It is noticeable that Victoria's attempts to fit in with British culture are not always successful. She refers to her parents by the Latin terms pater and mater unaware that in Britain this is an upperclass affectation no British engine driver's daughter would speak in this manner. Patrick is also torn between different identities. He dislikes the British largely because they will not accept him as one of them but also despises fullblooded Indians whom he refers to as wogs another derogatory term. Savage is far more liberal and tolerant about matters of race. The crisis of the story comes when Victoria kills a British soldier while he is attempting to rape her. Although the killing was clearly in selfdefence she fears that the British authorities will not on account of her mixedrace origins believe her version of events so she tries to conceal the incident thus allowing herself to be blackmailed by the Communists into assisting with one of their schemes. I said that Masters' novel offered everything needed to make an epic and overall the film is a pretty good one combining an exciting adventure story with an intelligent look at some serious issues. Perhaps however I should have said say that it offered everything needed to make an epic bar one thing a major role for a bigname American star. Hence the eccentric casting of Ava Gardner as Victoria who never seems convincing as an AngloIndian and whose accent wavers between British Indian and American. There were in fact two bigname AngloIndian cinema actresses around this period Merle Oberon and Vivien Leigh but both would probably have been too old for the role and both normally passed as white. Oberon in particular denied having any connection with India and claimed falsely to be Australian. Stewart Granger is very good as Savage a man who can be cynical and sardonic but also liberal and humane. I was disappointed however that most of the Indian characters were played with some very dodgy accents by white actors. Perhaps the casting of Gardner seems less eccentric when one considers that the filmmakers changed the ending of the novel in which Victoria ends up marrying Patrick.

	onyx:emotionText "Hollywood normally left films about British rule in India to the British themselves The Drum Black Narcissus North West Frontier but Bhowani Junction is an exception. Certainly John Masters' novel offered everything needed to make a thinking man's epic an exotic setting plenty of action a thrilling finale and a serious theme in this case racism. When Hollywood examined racial issues it often preferred to do so in the context of European colonialism rather than in the context of America itself. The film is set in the Indian railway town of Bhowani Junction in 1946 a year before independence. The British administrators are resigned to leaving India but still hope to exercise an influence over the path the country will take after independence. Hence their preference for the Congress Party over the proMoscow Communist Party. After all Jawaharlal Nehru the Congress leader was a wealthy patrician Fabian socialist a lawyer by training and educated at public school and Oxbridge Harrow and Trinity College Cambridge just like the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee Haileybury and University College Oxford. According to this film the Communists are attempting to frustrate the handover of power to the Congress Party by acts of sabotage hoping to create chaos which will enable them to seize power themselves. Moreover some Congress activists are also trying to hasten the departure of the British by nonviolent acts of resistance although these often play into the hands of the Communists. Unusually for a film about the Raj the film does not concentrate solely on relations between the British colonialists and the native peoples of India. Several of the leading characters are drawn from a third group the country's AngloIndian or mixed race community. The AngloIndians were and are a distinct community within India bound together by the English language an Anglocentric culture and the Christian religion. The main character is Victoria Jones the daughter of an AngloIndian train driver and the film depicts the relationships between Victoria and the three men in her life Colonel Rodney Savage a senior British army officer Ranjit Singh a Sikh active in the Indian independence movement and Patrick Taylor an AngloIndian railway official. Many AngloIndians worked on the railways. The fact that Victoria's lovers are drawn from the three different communities is symbolic of her uncertainty about her own cultural identity. The AngloIndians tended to identify culturally with Britain rather than India although few of them had ever visited Britain but were not fully accepted by either the British or the native Indians both of whom referred to them by the same derogatory term cheechee. It is noticeable that Victoria's attempts to fit in with British culture are not always successful. She refers to her parents by the Latin terms pater and mater unaware that in Britain this is an upperclass affectation no British engine driver's daughter would speak in this manner. Patrick is also torn between different identities. He dislikes the British largely because they will not accept him as one of them but also despises fullblooded Indians whom he refers to as wogs another derogatory term. Savage is far more liberal and tolerant about matters of race. The crisis of the story comes when Victoria kills a British soldier while he is attempting to rape her. Although the killing was clearly in selfdefence she fears that the British authorities will not on account of her mixedrace origins believe her version of events so she tries to conceal the incident thus allowing herself to be blackmailed by the Communists into assisting with one of their schemes. I said that Masters' novel offered everything needed to make an epic and overall the film is a pretty good one combining an exciting adventure story with an intelligent look at some serious issues. Perhaps however I should have said say that it offered everything needed to make an epic bar one thing a major role for a bigname American star. Hence the eccentric casting of Ava Gardner as Victoria who never seems convincing as an AngloIndian and whose accent wavers between British Indian and American. There were in fact two bigname AngloIndian cinema actresses around this period Merle Oberon and Vivien Leigh but both would probably have been too old for the role and both normally passed as white. Oberon in particular denied having any connection with India and claimed falsely to be Australian. Stewart Granger is very good as Savage a man who can be cynical and sardonic but also liberal and humane. I was disappointed however that most of the Indian characters were played with some very dodgy accents by white actors. Perhaps the casting of Gardner seems less eccentric when one considers that the filmmakers changed the ending of the novel in which Victoria ends up marrying Patrick. An ending in which a dashing white officer loses out to a mixedrace railway bureaucrat would not be in keeping with normal cinema conventions so it was changed Patrick dies heroically and Victoria marries Savage. Racially mixed romances were however a controversial subject for some reason felt to be more acceptable on screen if the mixedrace girl who loves the white boy was played by a white actress. The Eurasian heroine of Love is a ManySplendored Thing for example another American film set in a British colony is played by Jennifer Jones. It is ironic that films which set out to expose racism in the British Empire should also have unconsciously revealed some of the racist attitudes which prevailed in the Hollywood Empire. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "This film could have been wonderful if some of the parts had been given to Indian actors. For instance Hollywood and British studios make believe that Indians speak English in a singsong manner. They might have heavy accents but few speak English that way. Freda Jackson's role as the Sadani could it have been an ignorant variation of Sardarni? was incredibly stupid casting in that she spoke impeccable English for a middleclass Sikh lady. This apart Jackson was able to dominate her screen time.I would have liked to dismiss this film as a below average film but for the incredible performance of Ava Gardner who towers over all else in the movie. Take her accentfor an American there was no trace of her origins when she spoke. She alone looked real with raven black hair in a sari draped in foppish mannerafter all she was an AngloIndian. Had she worn well like an Aishwarya Rai Cukor would have got it wrong.Cukor deserves full credit for choosing Gardner for the role and for capturing the ambiance of romantic North Western Railways its first class coaches the engines and goods wagons. A keen observer will note that some of the shots of goods wagons showed vintage wagons while others showed contemporary ones.Though shot in Pakistan the film caught the Indian ambiance perfectly right up to the Railway quarters for its staff.Ava Gardner it is only too evident performed well under the guidance of good directors as John Houston. This film and Night of Iguana are my personal favourites among her films.".

In the tea business you had a better chance of acquiring a respectable living and social status.Furthermore the colonel also failed to realize the extreme prejudices that British officers in the regular English Army had against Britih officers in the Colonial Indian Army. During the Boer War of 1899 the War Office refuse to let any British Indian Officer serve in that war. Finally the colonel would have face prejudice after being send back to England not only because he was an exBritish Indian Officer but he would face additional racism if he had married that AngloIndian woman.".

During the Boer War of 1899 the War Office refuse to let any British Indian Officer serve in that war. Finally the colonel would have face prejudice after being send back to England not only because he was an exBritish Indian Officer but he would face additional racism if he had married that AngloIndian woman.";

Australian release 24 October 1956. 9841 feet 109 minutes. SYNOPSIS Rioters and passive resisters attempt to disrupt the Indian railroad in 1947.COMMENT The real joy and interest in this movie lies not so much in the stars or even in the story but in director Cukor's impressive handling of the crowd and action footage. It will be remembered that Selznick fired Cukor from Gone With The Wind because he felt that Cukor did not have the necessary big feel for the spectacle scenes. In Bhowani Junction it's obvious that Cukor set to work with the primary intention of proving that producer wrong. At times the CinemaScope screen seems filled to bursting with action. As for the plot however even in 1956 audiences were getting mighty tired of heroes and heroines who were seeking their identities. Although the movie recovered its huge production and distribution costs it earned little in the way of actual profit. Ava Gardner fans were none too happy either. She is cast out of her depth here. Although she comes across with power and conviction in some scenes in general her performance is disappointing. Granger and Travers are none too hot either. It's left to the support cast to provide the really interesting and solid characterizations. Also on the plus side are Freddie Young's picturesque camerawork and Rozsa's vibrant music score.".

This exchange near the end of the film summarizes a basic theme that runs throughout the movie  that of racism and prejudice in this period film about India's coming to independence. There is a ton of voiceover done by Granger's character. I guess it is necessary to get in all the history and details behind the political climate of the time. It does drag the film down in places.I thought this was one of Ava's better acting performances. In part because Tinseltown finally gave her a character with some meat and not just all cheesecake and sex appeal. In her biography Ava herself says it is one of her better roles. She detested the locations shooting due to the heat stench from the open sewers and nearly poverty level accommodations they had. She even contracted dysentery  so a not a great memory. She said the worst part was the rape scene which was so realistic in the portrayal that it caused her nightmares for some time. Odd but it looked rather tame on the screen to me but this is 50 years later and we have seen a lot worse. Also in her biography Ava states that they were allowed to use a sacred Sikh temple in the filming of the ceremony with Rajit. She said it was the first time they let nonSikh's in the temple.I found the film very realistic in its location shooting in Pakistan. The large crowd scenes with the locals were quite amazing and believable. The studio went to great expense to shoot this and haul all the necessary equipment and personnel to such a far away place. In fact it is said this was the nail in studio head Dorry Sherry's coffin. Because it didn't have great box office success and cost quite a bit he was soon kicked out. Much in the same way Louis B Mayer was 5 years previous. No loyalty in Hollywood.But apart from Ava's performance and the grand location shooting and realism the film itself is left lacking for something. Ava says the film was cut unmercifully in the editing room and left out some of the better sequences. But there is a good message in the film in that we should treat all humans equally.".

So don't read too much further if you'd rather be surprised.I went to see this movie in Tokyo Roppongi Hills Cinema with a Japanese friend on my birthday. I had seen Shimotsuma Monogatari both in Japanese and with English subtitles and enjoyed it immensely. I didn't know anything at all about Kiraware Matsuko no Issho except that it was by the same director but agreed to go see it based on my expectation that it would be similarly colorful charming and full of fun unexpected bits. In this I was not disappointed.The movie tells the story of Matsuko the mysterious and recently deceased occupant of a rather shabby apartment which is to be cleaned by a young man through whose eyes we see the movie. This young man is tasked by his father to clean an apartment and as he begins to discover the personal effects of the now dead occupant he becomes entangled in an effort to piece together the details of her complex and sordid life.If you've seen the movie Amelie you might recognize some influences from it in this movie. The director favors saturated colors timeshifting and the occasional surreal mixing of the literal world with the metaphorical or symbolic. I personally enjoyed these storytelling devices as well as the pacing and almost Memento like revelation of the character of Matsuko and her relationships with the other characters in the movie.The reason I checked the spoiler box on this comment was because I went to the movie expecting something light and fun with an uplifting ending like Shimotsuma Monogatari but was shocked to discover how incredibly sad and depressing this movie turned out to be. While the visual language and storytelling devices were very colorful and fun the actual story of Matsuko's life is a tragedy of epic proportions a modern day tribulation both frightening in its graphic portrayal and disturbing in its plausibility.It's a story of the excesses of achieving success the futility of searching for stability and the emptiness of hoping for happiness. Matsuko is not so much a character as a symbolic punching bag representing the state of modern Japanese femininity. Watching this movie broke my heart and I a 38 year old man cried for two days following it.If you're going to see this movie and I recommend you do be prepared to be moved by it. You won't need to understand Japanese to get what's happening though you might miss a few of the jokes here and there so don't let the language prevent you from experiencing the most depressing comedy you're likely to ever see.".

Doesn't this story remember Mizoguchi's Oyusama?

The story actually is a adaption from a original novel which depict a tragic life of a woman. The film though have a comedy outlook it is a typical tragic story. The director manages to find a new way to retell the story in a sense which youngster would feel related.And the story itself is great because it tells us what is so called life. ie ridiculous unpredictable etc. and how a woman face her life with constant hope of simply getting better.The story is a typical tragedy in a Greek kind of style.

The director manages to find a new way to retell the story in a sense which youngster would feel related.And the story itself is great because it tells us what is so called life. ie ridiculous unpredictable etc. and how a woman face her life with constant hope of simply getting better.The story is a typical tragedy in a Greek kind of style. Though it may contain some preaching scene but u are free to take it or leave as the life of the woman is open to judge.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is unique and innovative. It is somewhat of fairytale like Cinderella and reminds me of Big Fish 2003 but is also very dark and depressive like say Requiem for a Dream 2000. It follows the hardshipladen life of Matsuko through the gradual discoveries of her nephew and the people he encounters.It is extreme in content and in appearance but touches very true and deep feelings  fears within all of us. It explores the meaning of life and asks very interesting questions. It does so while treating life's inevitable tragedies with humour and gaiety. The visual style and music are important elements of the movie as they share a positivelooking outlook of life even in the dimmest of circumstances.The drama is centered around the dysfunctional family Matsuko was both the product of and the most disruptive element in its spiral towards destruction. Friendship love and professional lives are also well explored although as you can imagine none of them in an ideal truly rewarding way. The bleakness of the story and the brightness of the storytelling makes for a very interesting contrast. There are many beautiful shots even if a bit CGIheavy and the inherent beauty of life is revealed through the crust of old piled up garbage.The storytelling is very fresh and even though it sags at some points as the film never seems to end it does get its point across in a artsy and nonthreatening way. I was so involved with the demanding story that I was literally shocked as I exited the dark theater to see other people lined up for the next movie at the FantAsia festival. After a viewing experience like this I found myself surprised that there could be more movies after that or possibly that there may be anything after that! This is how profoundly I was affected. Memories is not a movie you just eat up and leave you really need to settle and digest before you can truly understand and internalize.A tough journey a good message and possibly a lot of positive ramifications in art  life.

Nakajima has an incredible eye for aesthetics and details. Where Mr. Vengeance is mercilessly straight forward Matsuko is so subtle and discrete thus emphasizing the mental brutality of the ongoing action even more.

Her younger sister is very ill and as a result her father is often to preoccupied with her to show young Matsuko the love that she craves from him.

Tetsuya Nakamura's genuinely heartfelt saga charting her tragic heroine's life before she is found murdered in a grassy area not far from her slipshod apartment at the very least superficially recalls Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire in as much as that both films' leads mere victims of bad choices and circumstances struggle to find the true meaning of joy in their godforsaken lives as it is that the narratives are mostly told in flashbacks and driven by a fractured timeline.In the present day a gruffly obese Matsuko Kawajiri Miki Nakatani is found murdered and Shou Kawajiri Eita her nephew by her estranged brother Teruyuki Kagawa is tasked by his father to clean her apartment after her cremation. He never saw her before but there meeting Matsuko's raucous punk neighbor Gori and the chief suspect for her aunt's slaying Yusuke Iseya who provide clues to her aunt's identity he gradually pieces the unbelievably hardknock adventures of her departed aunt. As the film explores Matsuko's constantly frustrating search for happiness with the right man it becomes a surprisingly bittersweet love story interspersed with musical numbers running the gamut from Christian hymns to cheeky Jpop tunes.Following his brazen though a bit hollow Kamikaze Girls writerdirector Nakamura a veteran of TV commercials conveys the vaudevillestyle film with gloriously saturated colors highly diffused lighting and a blistering cacophony of Nipponese pop culture to define Matsuko's epitonic past that sometimes it feels as though the audacious employment of visual smorgasbord threaten to derail the emphasis from its characters. Still Nakamura's direction is blissful preoccupied by the premise that the constant pursuit for love and affection eventually pays dividends  though sometimes in less expected ways  as established early in the film's opening credit sequence that recalls classic musicals and in Nakitani's happy pappap trot in La La Land. It's Utopian thinking but its groundwork on the chronic impediment of the feminine role in a maledominated culture and the ability of selfless pursuit to decimate that stigma is authentic and beautiful.".

This is Nakashima's sophomore film following his sleeper hit Shimotsuma Monogatari AKA Kamikaze Girls and he doesn't disappoint.While comparisons to Robert Zemeckis's Forrest Gump are unavoidable I think Memories of Matsuko is more like a darker version of the famed NHK drama series Oshin 1983 which told a similar story about the life and tragedies of a young woman who escaped poverty to become a wealthy store owner. Matsuko's emotional journey is not as happy one as she continually falls into abusive relationships and tragic love affairs spanning three decades yet as in Oshin even when it seems that Matsuko has lost everything she still manages to hold on to her dreams using humor the gift of music and an undying sense of hope.Nakatani Miki Ring Rasen Densha Otoko truly shines as Matsuko and her chameleonlike ability to change her look throughout the various decades 60s 70s and the 80s is amazing to watch as is her effortless ability to switch from drama to comedy. She is supported by a great cast including Ichikawa Mikako Cutie Honey Kurosawa Asuka Kirei Eita Azumi Densha Otoko Iseya Yusuke Casshern and Gori Nin x 3 Hattori Kun.The film is framed almost like a dark fairy tale but Nakashima still manages to infuse his unique sense of visual wonder and comedy into the mix. There are brilliant moments where the film takes on an almost surreal feelincorporating 2D Disneylike animation CGI and elaborate musical numbers which are reminiscent of the film Moulin Rouge.The musical soundtrack is wonderful and successfully captures the themes of lost innocence and heartbreak. It's amazing how Nakashima is able to work in Japan's diverse musical history from childhood lullabies to disco to Enka and Hip Hop into the soundtrack.While the film is very Japanese in style the overall message of the film perseverance in the face of adversity are very much universal. I was also surprised by some of the Christian themes the message of hope and salvation that was also in the film.Despite the ironic Japanese title there is nothing hateful about Matsuko at all. I'm really fond of this movie and recommend it highly. It's a bittersweet dramacomedy that will make you cry but will also touch your heart in a way few movies do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thankfully I had seen Amelie and Run Lola RunLola Rennt before watching this. In all three films the usage of music as a prop bold coloring different speeds odd and interesting angles vivid cinematography flashbacks surrealism eccentric characters animated graphics and other features of what I would call Expressionism come to the fore the entirety of the films' duration each.Amelie for all its uniqueness was actually at the end of it all rather boring despite looking like a painting that's come to life with an army of quirky people leaping out into a musical number of a film. When it was finished each of the several times I watched it and honestly did enjoy it I honestly didn't feel much connection to the characters though I understand exactly what their significance to the story is. There's other odd French films called Micmacs and Delicatessen. By I think the same director as Amelie. At 1st I thought this was just a French style. But the bizarre visuals and retrospective storytelling seem to be characteristic of the filmmaker. So perhaps the director of Memories of Matsuko is pulling directly from Amelie's influence and not a broad genre of French film that I thought existed lol I mention Amelie and Run Lola Run and these other films because they did train my mind and eyes to this kind of artistry. But with Matsuko it was not just used as an excuse to be odd and creative like Amelie but here it was completely necessary. In the 1st few minutes I was about to click this movie off with the vaudevillian and fairy tale stuff and highly saturated colors I wanted a taste of real life modern Japan tied into a wowing film and the initial presence of Matsuko did not fulfill that. But after coming to review Bounce KO Gals a Japanese lolita film I saw someone link other lolita films like Kamikaze Girls to World of Kanako to this film. And in liking those story lines and way of filming I gave Matsuko a chance.Since then I figured that the whimsy of the songanddance style and harp playing and twinkle dust introducing this film was completely sarcastic. And it was. The unbearable interludes of musicals lasted briefly popped up minimally but they and the intense colors sooner than later showed their purpose Matsuko was a lonely child with a vivid imagination and went to the carnival with her dad as a kid and they saw theatrical plays. That was the film's only moment of he and her bonding.So the musicals and coloring just visually expresses Matsuko's mental and emotional state. It introduced the rapid on screen downfall of our titular character Matsuko herself. And it made me tear up. But I actually let the tears storm down when she was older and visited back home well into her extraordinarily troubled adulthood. I saw someone around here write that they didn't quite get the last scene with Matsuko as a child and then as an adult peacefully singing her utopian theme song as she climbed up the stairs to a heavenlike light shining down from her childhood bedroom with her deceased sister angelically awaiting her to reach the top whilst every friend and ex Matsuko had sung along in misery.How can they not get this? Are they a sociopath or what? Maybe they've never been sad and daydreamed before so good for them but when you know you're unloved you then fantasize about being loved or at least your former tormentors repenting how horribly they treated you as you triumph how you realistically never did or would or could. And that's what the last scene shows. It was similar to Pan's Labyrinth showing a finally happy Ophelia in a fanciful paradise as her actual self took her last breaths the makebelieve Ophelia was being applauded by a kingdom and praised by her long dead parents. That too made me cry then. I realise this is what the director was doing here not necessarily taking cues exactly from Pan.It's just a trait of Expressionism I think to visually and musically express the inside of its characters it gives you everything you could ever ask for in order to understand what's going on and who's who. So it's used in romcoms and horror films and makes the films very popular. While I appreciated it Impressionism which I honestly prefer doesn't do that. It uses exactly what's there and that's it might not even have music in the whole film it instead uses social and historical context as well as natural scenery to describe the characters. It's normally used in indie drama films which are rarely as popular as expressionistic films but normally more critically acclaimed for their realism.But for once I appreciated expressionism here. Because I totally understood why it was applied. Not just for eye popping kicks which could almost force you to clutch your cheeks in painful dismay begging for it to stop. But to show the viewer how alone and increasingly unstable Matsuko became dwelling into a world of make believe and as she aged hallucinations. So the fact that the film looked like you just dropped and popped acid kinda goes along with that as opposed to Amelie which is gratuitously quirky and weird just for the sake of being so. That being said I liked Amelie but it had no personal affect on me. It taught me nothing. But how to giggle at an Arab immigrant struggling to pronounce French names and how to sit through 2 hours of psychedelia.".

	schema:headline " Devastatingly Good!  Minor Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen a lot of films in my day from many different eras and countries and I have to say that Memories of Matsuko is right up there with the best of them. This masterpiece is so original so entertaining and so tragic that its hard to deny its brilliance! The two movies I've heard people compare it to the most are Moulin Rouge! and Amelie. This is a correct assessment but in my opinion Matsuko's the far better picture! The film revolves around the life of Matsuko who is deprived of her father's love as a child. She realizes that the only way to get her father's attention and affection is to degrade herself by making that silly face. This develops into a bad habit as she progresses in life and whenever she is faced with being alone she chooses the demeaning path because that's what worked with her father. We soon see her as a prostitute a Yakuza girl and in several abusive relationships. What's even more heartbreaking is the fact that Matsuko tries to make the best out of every situation but it somehow always ends in tragedy. She gives and gives while asking for almost nothing in return and that's what makes it so easy to sympathize with her.The character of Matsuko is brilliantly played by the beautiful Miki Nakatani. I've never seen anything from her before but this film proves that she is one of the top actresses in Japan if not the world! The director Tetsuya Nakashima really brought out the best in her and it's a shame that the two don't get along and will most likely never work together again. Asuka Kurosawa who plays the character of Megumi also gives a noteworthy performance. I personally think the movie is at its best when she's in it! It really is a disgrace that this film didn't win the Japanese Academy Award for Best Picture that year! The Academy is obviously brainless for picking Hula Girls to win while Memories of Matsuko didn't even get recognized with a nomination!?! Talk about an injustice! Switching gears I did have a few minor problems with the film. First of all there's this childhood lullaby song that plays one too many times throughout the course of the movie. By the end you get really tired of hearing itat least I did! Another problem I had was how Matsuko died. The film builds it up as a whodunit and when we finally find out who the killer is the conclusion is far less important powerful or striking than expected. Several other reviewers commented that the film drags at the end and they're right! I think 510 minutes of editing would have made it flow better.As for the positive there's a lot to love here! The music scenes are great and the songs are very catchy! The acting story cinematography visual effects and direction are all topnotch! Another thing that's great with this film is that it's rewatchable! I've probably seen it 10 times and I still haven't gotten tired of it.At the time of this review 9  2009 there's no DVD in Region 1 that I'm aware of and that really is too bad! This film deserves a lot more prestige than its currently getting and its bizarre that its almost unknown in the United States! Memories of Matsuko will stay with you days after watching it. Whether you're into artsy films or mindless action movies I think there's a lot here for any type of person to enjoy! Highly Recommended!!! 1010!".

	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning of Memories of Matsuko Matsuko Kawajiri the eponymous heroine is found murdered in a field under mysterious circumstances. She has died alone and estranged from her family. It is the task of her young nephew Shou to piece together the details of her extraordinary life which we witness first hand in the form of vivid flashbacks to Matsuko's past from wideeyed childhood to disenchanted middle age. The result is something of a Japanese Moll Flanders by turns tragic and comic.The freedom with which writerdirector Tetsuya Nakashima delves between past and present is the film's most satisfying aspect coupled with a playfully thin boundary between reality and illusion one moment the film is insistently realistic with a limited dark palette the next it soars into Technicolor dreamscapes full of songs flowers butterflies and other recurring motifs. The cinematography is exquisite and endlessly creative. While this is an ultimately tragic biopic with a number of distressing scenes not least the repeated incidence of domestic abuse it is equally full of comedy particularly during Matsuko's youthful stint as a schoolteacher. This freewheeling mixture of presentation and narrative tone will be quite unfamiliar to most Englishspeaking audiences and better parallels can be found in French cinema  Love Me if You Dare for instance  or closer to Japan in the work of South Korean Chanwook Park. At points Memories of Matsuko certainly recalls films like I'm An Android But That's OK and the superb Oldboy. After all is anyone's life truly sad or happy? Our lives are full of joy and pain elation and tragedy and in that Matsuko's is little different.Yet Nakashima's visual fireworks are both a blessing and a curse. All too often the montages and singing substitute for proper characterisation and dialogue. At a number of points his cinematic shorthand leaves much to be desired Matsuko's lengthy jail term for instance in which she is supposed to have formed a close friendship with Megumi is reduced merely to a twominute music video. Similarly while Matsuko has various lovers whom she clings to not once does she share a meaningful conversation with them. Nakashima seems to relish in depicting the dramatic violent conclusions to these relationships but the more prosaic task of daytoday interaction  the real quotidian essence of life  is almost entirely overlooked. Many of the characters populating the movies's vibrant surface feel twodimensional and Nakashima's screenplay shows less interest in taking the time to flesh them out than it does in jumping forward to the next episode of Matsuko's life.For this reason I found it difficult to really identify with Matsuko and her world by the end and I was left with a series of stunning vignettes that did not combine into a memorable convincing whole. The last 10 minutes indeed are something of an embarrassment for Nakashima. His screenplay loses all sense of emotional verisimilitude and descends into an overblown saccharine festival of nostalgia and stringsections which embodies the worst excesses of Japanese cinema. Its simplistic quasireligious moralizing is tacky and hollow Matsuko's character and story really deserved a more complex ending and certainly something more befitting of the movie's underlying uncertainty. The simple fact of her terrible murder in itself which is almost unbearably realistic and difficult to watch would perhaps have been the best place to fadeout.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film is about memory as the English title states this brings it under one of the most vital and most cinematic subgroups in cinema films about our ability to recall life as illusion and mind rather than as just a bunch of surrounding facts. So what kind of recall here? A vagrant middleaged woman is discovered dead one day the kind of nameless death that might make neighbors pause for only a brief moment and this is the first admission here ordinary life next door can be the center of a rich world. This is done with a little too much obvious caprice for my taste but the essence is the same we go back to find this woman when she was a sweet young girl with all of life and heartbreak still ahead of her.I don't know how much is personal for the filmmaker here but much is revealed by simply examining appearances. A vibrant memory with a hyperactive consciousness that joyously swims through tragedy. It starts like one of those hyper Japanese TV ads the filmmaker apparently has plenty of experience in those but as we progress the whole is mellowed and given resonance behind the popup colors. This is the second admission that life deserves to be celebrated with as much color. A preeminent formulator of Noh wrote in the 1400s Zen inspired that life is a lying dream he only wakes who casts the world aside. There's no such effort here to awaken to what creates suffering and to purify the film is simply taken in by the swirl and sadness of suffering. I was reminded of the lush PowellPressburger melodramas from the 40s as well as recent Julie Taymor with her song and dance. Others thought of Tim Burton. To be sure though the fixation with color and artifice is as recent in Japan as anime but as old as kabuki.So overwrought and sentimental melodrama on one side too much so for my taste. Just the same I appreciate the bubbly air that refuses to dwell on misfortune it's quickly brushed aside for some new heartbreak to come along. Yet it doesn't address its own question about the meaninglessness of life and it's in this deeper way that the absence of awakening resurfaces. The girl is merely buffeted along by attachment and need and at no point down to her final moments comes to a realization.In the list of hearbreaking films ultimately this deserves its own place next to Capra's Wonderful Life. This is as much as anything else because the filmmaker leaves his heroine to a horrible life and meaningless end because in the end she's only the figment of a story that he uses to inspire with but that inspiration and change is never allowed to her inside the story. The bittersweet worldview says suffer as much as you are able to bear in the end there is release.The penultimate scene is possibly one of the twenty best shots I have seen in my life a flow of consciousness that lifts up from her and races through waters. Marvelous work. This is the cultivated awareness of the illusory life the Japanese have known for centuries across Shinto temples Zen and the Noh stage.But the maker ends this a scene late for my taste. The last one revisits the home of childhood as the place from which to ascend paying homage to the well known stairway scene from A Matter of Life and Death by PowellPressburger which just says too much now as it did then.".

Its like a good blend of black and white paint which doesn't become grey at all. Although the movie isn't too deep and simple to watch i give high praise for it being the closest thing i hv seen that manages to express that life is indeed colourful just as matsuko's life was. In the end i don't feel happy nor sad for matsuko i feel that she is considerably fortunate to have all types of colours in her life before departing even though it doesn't turn out like that. It is not entirely perfect. I don't complain on its unrealistic comical moments nor that it needs improvisation. Its fine enough. But I don't see the purpose of including her nephew to 'narrate' her story and hers isn't an outstanding testimony that deserves to be memorable  she clearly is a weak character.

The story is a fairly empty one about a young girl turned neophyte clubber on the outskirts of Paris but it isn't really trying to convey a story so much as a feeling. The main characters  the pretty upbeat confused little girl and the faintly hopeless depressed drugdependent boxer have very unique qualities that counteract each other in a compelling way and the film ultimately deals with such issues as the pointlessness of life. What really elevates this film though is the soundtrack. Each track was carefully handpicked and the dreamlike club scenes are a sheer joy to watch. As the director Yolande Zauberman said I think the soundtrack is one of the main actors in this film. Although Rob D's 'Clubbed To Death' is the central pinnacle there are many other exquisite offerings such as the more commercial 'Leave Home' by the Chemical Brothers or Gavin Bryars' short orchestral 'Farewell To Philosophy Bar'. Certain tracks such as 'Rollin'  Scratchin' by the popstatus Daft Punk were in the film but failed to make it to the disc. It is also worth noting that all of the tracks used in this film were pretty obscure at the time  Daft Punk didn't make their breakthrough until about a year later.".

It's a pity because the dank underground club vibe is spoton for the mid1990s dance music scene. The best aspect of the film is the lighting and the dynamic choice of music provided by such hipsters as Daft Punk and Masters at Work to namedrop but a few. In this sense the film has limited appeal for clubheads. The acting is a bit dazed and confused which was probably the intention. This is an often intriguing attempt to tell a sparse story through dramatic visual flourishes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clubbed to Death  called Lola in Technoland in Germany is a typical French movie  it's about music it's about youth it's about desire and about the nineties. A young French girl misses her bus and is led to a suburban techno music club by accident where she faces the electronic dance music culture as well as a big love affair. That's the whole plot but it's enough as many French movies don't have much contents  but have many things to tell and a big impact on the viewers.Lola in Technoland lives from its many impressions about love and music  actually there are not even many action and dialogues going on but the music mainly electronic dance and trance grooves accompanies the heroine's trip through the clubbing world and love affairs. It's very well photographed and shows a permanent atmosphere of emptiness desires and longings. There isn't the typical hectic setting of a bright and loud and battered dance club but the locations rather appear a surreal suburban dreamscape at night.On the good side this movie is stunning impressive groovy erotic and a contemporary French answer to the British Trainspotting cinema but without the noise tempo words lights and violence. On the bad side it's just a welldone music video clip soft sex movie and background visual for closing your eyes and chilling out on your sofa  or in the club of your choise. Anyway it's an outstanding French film and a very stylish insight into the clubbing scene of the nineties with a brilliant sound track!".

	schema:reviewBody "NORTHERN LIGHT David Lammers  Netherlands 2006.This feature debut by David Lammers is a very slow film especially the first 25 minutes require a lot of patience. The film was advertised as A film about a summer in AmsterdamNoord. Perhaps that's the most accurate description I can think of because there's not much story or dialog and the film mostly consists of nicely lensed silent images of Amsterdam. The central character is Lucien Raymond Thiry owner of a boxing school in AmsterdamNoord to whom the training and wellbeing of the kids he's coaching means everything but he's estranging his 15year old son Mitchel Dai Carter. After a violent confrontation with his son he slowly descends into solitude and everything he cared for is falling apart. Together with GUERNSEY DIEP and HET ZWIJGEN this is the fourth and last film in a film project called De Oversteek in collaboration with the VPRO and the Dutch Filmfonds to give young filmmakers the chance to make a feature film. I think it's time the search for other talent continues because this is yet another inept attempt at making a feature film. And why do these four films all feel strangely the same? Slowlypaced weak or barely scripted at all they just feel like they all have been post doctored by a third party who tried to polish their look. Filmed during high summer AmsterdamNoord has never looked this appealing and David Lammers clearly shows some cinematic talent. For instance the scene in which Mitchel is driving on his brand new bicycle in a ballet dress looks beautiful. A strangely surreal and memorable scene but the endless string of nice images wears thin after a while. After twenty minutes or so the relationship between father and son is spelled out and from then on nothing happens. Not a big help are the onedimensional performances by Dai Carter and Raymond Thiry. In a film like this without much plot or dialog the casting of the two leads is paramount. They are almost constantly onscreen without much dialog so most of the time we have to root for their emotions through silent expressions. In the case of Lucien he is such an unsympathetic character it's hard to care for him at all. Dai Carter who is on screen in seemingly endless closeups doesn't express anything and gives one of the most distancing performances I have ever seen. But what ultimately sinks this is some embarrassingly awful dialog. One particular reconciliation scene between Lucien and Mitchel was actually quite powerful and moving but is ruined by some totally unnecessary chitchat about coffee that ruins the whole impact of the scene. Lammers is primarily a director of silent images. Writing or handling actors and dialog doesn't seem to interest him at all. In an interview he gave on Dutch television I saw a very shy young man whose main interest was so he said capturing the beauty of AmsterdamNoord. When asked what the film was about he didn't seem to know himself. He's no dummy though and brought former pinup girl Monique Sluyter who has a small part in the film with him for some extra publicity. Anyway he might have made some nicely filmed shorts and some points for the cinematography are in place but for a 90 minute feature somewhat more material might come in handy. Dai Carter apparently has quit acting and started a career in the military where his wooden expressions are probably much more appreciated.Camera Obscura  410".

One of the things on this DVD I was slightly...

In my opinion this kind of prank should be kept for the passed out best friend at a party. Please don't view me as a sympathetic person because in most cases I'm not but there is definitely a borderline between what is funny and entertaining and what is unfair.

It will be the biggest waste for you.Ultimately though I guess the decision of whether to view this is entirely up to you. But I will end by saying this If you have any sense of decency concience morals whatever you will avoid this film like the plague.".

	schema:reviewBody "I brought the movie knowing full well it would contain homeless dope addicts and drunks slugging it out. I live in Baltimore Maryland and the fights and beat downs you see on this DVD is no worse than anything you see in the wrong parts of Baltimore or in any other major American city. Truth is when the rigid blinder wearing plastic liberal office mice all climb into their nice metal cages or crawl into subway for their daily scurry back out to the relative safety of the their rich suburban gated communities BRUTAL REALITY REIGN'S ONCE MORE IN THE DARK Foreboding FORGOTTEN CORNERS OF AN INNER CITY. HAPLESS BUMS DRUNKS AND ADDICTS LURK LIKE INNER CITY PIGEONS ALWAYS IN PLAIN VIEW YET NEVER TRULY NOTICED BY HURRIED DAYTIME SOULS SO ENGROSSED IN FULL MEANINGFUL LIVES THEY FORGET TO CARE! These Bum Fight videos are an unflinching look at the ugly reality of the pathetic lives some people CHOOSE TO LEAD under the cover of urban twilight! Being a total bum is a choice. I am disabled I once lived on section 8 a tiny disability check eating free government cheese butter and such. I was poor but I had my honor and dignity. But I chose to live with dignity I did not drink do drugs or engage in criminal behavior. I spent my money wisely so while I was not rich I survived nicely thank you. You see being poor is not an excuse to become a drunken bum. Being a drunken bum or an addict is a choice a person makes and they alone are responsible for their choice.Last time I checked no one demands at gun point that a drunk drink himself silly. No one makes a dope addict shoot up. No one makes a crack addict light up. No one forces a crystal methamphetamine freak to destroy themselves. Bum's fight in these DVD's for weird reasons that make sense only if their weird twisted logic is used. Bums fight on these DVD's for the exact same reasons that motivate all the other lame self destructive stupid things homeless people do. Some chronic street people are into a self destructive lifestyle. Some bums enjoy living life on the edge because they like the thrill of cheating death or living life totally on THEIR OWN SELFISH TERMS! The DVD is funny to me only because these bums made their life choices to become dope addicted homeless drunken outcasts fodder for this type of DVD. Likewise these bums made their choice to fight and act up for the quick fix offered by a lame prize pocket change or cheap booze. I would not have made such a decision for myself but I don't fault others for doing things I would not choose myself. I do not do drugs but if someone else wants to do them I will warn them it is a bad choice and if they still want to be a dope addict I wave goodbye while watching them sail toward a date certain with personal and financial ruin. Bum's have the right to fight in these stupid DVD's for weak prizes if they want to because of something we call personal freedom. If all the bum fighters in the DVD agree to the terms of the game they have every right to express and display their sick passions however they want.I have no moral high horse. If all the bums in the DVD agree to fight and the film makers have signed releases from legally competent parties I say let the games begin. We all know that increasingly what is legal in our free society is seldom moral. I say if you are offended by these DVD's on high tone moral grounds no one is forcing you to buy or watch the DVD's anymore than the bums were forced to take part in making them. If you don't like the bum fight DVD's steer clear of the DVD's do not buy them but leave those who want to watch these Bum fight DVD's alone. For all legal activities like watching bums fight in a capitalist society thriving markets exist with patrons aching to buy their vulgar wares.These DVD's are no worse than watching toothless hillbillies and poor ignorant folk get provoked into staged fighting on the lamest trash TV talk shows. Bring hillbillies poor blacks and whites to Chicago let them stay in fine hotels for a few days eat in nice places and all they have to do in return is brawl on TV for a few minutes like the mindless thugs they are. Curse pull out each others weaves tear off shirts pants whatever punch each other into bloody pulp and thereby reinforce the most negative stereotypes of blacks poor whites in trailer parks and country hill folk. These Bum fight DVD's are just a variation on an ugly theme feeding a need in America for this sort of gritty no holds barred reality entertainment. The Blood lust is not new it goes back to Roman times. The blood lust in America is already wide spread and this Bum fight DVD is just feeding the need and people who hate these Bum Fight DVDS need to just get over it!".

The two main stars in the video is Rufus and Donny. These two bums are often drunk or on drugs when performing there bits. The video also has a Happy Campers soundtrack which may I say suits it. Anyway I didn't know what to think of Bumfights at the start to be truthful I sort of liked it. But now I hear the producers have gone to even sicker lows in order to sell there videos. Oh yes this time it is people even more venerable than homeless people it is the mentally ill. And that's just sick. After hearing that my view on there videos hasn't been the same now I don't really care for Bumfights.Back to the matter at hand most of the fights in the video are not between the bumsSo Why call it Bumfights? it is prerecorded fights between teenagers and young adults whom most of either can't fight or there fights are just staged. And yes Angela Taylor does appear in the video but not naked just in a bit of a saucy manner. The bumhunter segments are funny at the start but soon they tend to get boring. And the same guy who played the Bumhunter at the start doesn't play him throughout. Some other guy also plays him and he is even crappier than Todd at playing him. Other footage in the video includes more fights caught on camera on the streets. Overall the hype of Bumfights is overrated. I can't say I was shocked by it Cause I wasn't. If you really want to see Bumfights I'd recommend get a lend of a mates because simply it isn't worth 20 bucks. The most shocking release of Bumfights I have seen is a mondoShockumentary Bumfights Presents Terrorists Killers  Middle East Wackos....but we will save that for another time. Overall 410.Not Rated Strong Language and Violence. 18".

If the viewers finds amusement in harming people and insulting unknown random people indulge in petty crimes and are very immature then this is for them. Otherwise this 'film' is not worth watching. 1 It is pathetically sad and 2 it is a sorrowing welcome to modern society. Consider the fact that the people involved in the film seem to be roughly in their 20's makes the film more pathetic. Personally I think this 'film' is in no way funny and is mindless if you haven't assumed that already. But people do get attracted to this so if someone finds it funny so be it.".

Dirty Sanchez from some welsh dropouts and now 'Bumfights'.Bumfights is a collection of badly filmed camcorder footage filmed by college bums though were dreaming up an idea for this 'pushing the boundary'. Its basically the kind of filmaking real 'film bums' do. Instead of sitting down and coming up with a good funny and interesting show they've just been plain lazy.They've sat down and thought Yeah dude lets get some homeless guys and make them do disgusting things for cash coz were such untalented guys that we don't want to endanger ourselves.Thats pretty much it. The part that had a lot going was the take on Mtv's Cribs where the homeless man is showing round his doss under a bridge. I wouldn't recommend this films even to the people with morbid curiosity its just not bad. Its just a few fights with some rock music and the fights are not bloody or goryif thats what you were hoping for there your basic 'scrapping' your friends have when their drunk. The aspect thats also very annoying is the way people think 'fights' what goes with a fight? rock music! It doesn't its boring and unoriginal.Please don't buy it seriously If its banned I wanted to see it I've seen them all I'm at film school but its not worth it. These guys are making money from just your curiosity and working on their bad publicity. If you want it download it its not worth owning.

To the film maker's credit this is very well edited and they apparently paid for all the medical bills and expenses incurred to the stars of the show and are also last I heard in the process of getting their asses sued off of them by Roofus et al.I never found Jackass funny but I thought this was hillarious especially the bumhunter segments and the duckie! guy. Bling bling just stole the show for me though seriously that guy should get his own chat show!I think for most people the moral dubiousness will obstruct their viewing of what is essentially a very funny movie. If you are one of these however I don't think that you can laugh at jackass yet complain when something like this comes along off of the back of Jackass' success. If you supported Jackass then like it or not you are partly responsible for this as anyone else.It is the product of a sick society but as a member of that society with enough truth about himself to admit he finds this funny I think the bottom line is that this is a hillarious piece of film.Ultimately we are supposed to be judging the film on IMDB not the film makers themselves and their methods no matter how dubious.BFK for life FOREVER!

To the film maker's credit this is very well edited and they apparently paid for all the medical bills and expenses incurred to the stars of the show and are also last I heard in the process of getting their asses sued off of them by Roofus et al.I never found Jackass funny but I thought this was hillarious especially the bumhunter segments and the duckie! guy. Bling bling just stole the show for me though seriously that guy should get his own chat show!I think for most people the moral dubiousness will obstruct their viewing of what is essentially a very funny movie. If you are one of these however I don't think that you can laugh at jackass yet complain when something like this comes along off of the back of Jackass' success. If you supported Jackass then like it or not you are partly responsible for this as anyone else.It is the product of a sick society but as a member of that society with enough truth about himself to admit he finds this funny I think the bottom line is that this is a hillarious piece of film.Ultimately we are supposed to be judging the film on IMDB not the film makers themselves and their methods no matter how dubious.BFK for life FOREVER! We never bottleout!";

By far the best editing was when Rufus picks up a mallet and comments on a broken ankle. The only complaint I would have is that there is more of the Teen fighting which gets dry after a while.

	schema:reviewBody "This has to be one of the most maligned films of the past couple of years it's virtually shoved under the carpet every time Julia Robert's career is mentioned and it's generally dismissed as a bore.  And in a lot of ways it IS boring not a lot happens during the course of the plot and as a horror film it utterly fails to provide a sense of urgency and fright in the conventional sense.It's also one of the most elaborate mysterious and beautifully conceived bigbudget fantasies committed to film.  The fact of its plodding storyline is in a sense besides the point of its true merit that it is a dark intensely brooding look at a woman's damaged sexuality and psyche and the oppressive times in which she existed.  The original Valerie Martin book ingeniously transmogrified the Robert Louis Stevenson story into an examination of a lost female soul who finds her redemption in a fogshrouded hell.  Stephen Frear's film is in every respect a successful mood piece a meditation on an individual's dark journey into not just a world of physical violence but her own crippled sense of selfhood and history of abuse.  More than most other contemporary films about the Victorian era this film captures in meticulous and visceral detail the horrors of the Industrial Agethe poverty the pollutionridden streets filled with animal gore and filth and the era's preoccupationrepulsion of the human body and the ominous glare of scientific knowledge gone awry in a society illprepared to meet the consequences. The cinematography and production design  by the great Stuart Craig are breathtaking.   A swinging door partially obscuring the surgically opened corpse  on a table...Mary making her way through the streets of the market surrounded by animal viscera...the shock of a roomful of a prostitute's remains savagely gutted by a demonic hand...rats in the sewer swarming into the crevices of Mary's mind...the Doctor's operating theater like a coliseum of depravity...Mary lost in the fog.These images were indelible to me and entertained my consciousness far more than any typical horror film could hope to.  Julia Roberts for all her trouble with the Irish accent and going against her image as America's sweetheart is the very picture of a haunted and ravaged soul nearly destroyed by the abuse and poverty of her childhood and bewildered by the mysterious machinations of her homicidal employer.  She lends a great deal of vulnerability and conviction to her role and carries the film in ways beyond dialogue and posturing.  Not once does she flash her trademark milliondollar smile but what she gives to the film is far more valuable than glitz and in her looks and inflections reveals more onscreen than most of her other films combined.This film won't appeal to most people.  And admittedly it does fail in so many ways that a lot of audiences will be turned off. A lot of people will definitely be bored to tears by the slow pace and what the Hll is happening?!?!? quality of the narrative. But for viewers who liked Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast Neil Jordan's Comany of Wolves Caleb Carr's book The Alienist or perhaps Ken Russell's Gothic this is worth a try.  It should not be written off as just another bigbudget Hollywood failure because its aims whether conscious or not are quite different from your average thriller or period film.   Approach it with an open mind be prepared for a dark and disconcerting vision and you might be rewarded because this film is unique baroque different and great.".

Yet as other reviewers have mentioned she actually gives a good performance. John Malkovich is excellent as the tormented JekyllHyde character.The cinematography and moods are haunting. One feels they are actually reliving the Victorian era where the servants woke up at 4AM to complete their drudgery. The kitchen conjures up the stark realities of survival the eel that is chopped up for dinner while alive Mary Reilly turns white as a sheet as she sees the animal die. I actually began to appreciate Ms. Roberts' performances more after this film also in films like Mona Lisa Smile she projects a certain believability is not just a physical presence. At one point there is a most effective scene wherein Roberts must see to her mother's burial and goes to the tenement to make arrangements. The landlord has placed her mother's body in a damp cellar closet saying she is most comfortable as he hands her one shilling the only money Roberts will inherit. Roberts then says ... poor wage for a lifetime of drudgery... We are reminded of the workhouses of Dickens and the rigid class structures which she must survive...While the dialect is at times choppy she is believable as an Irish maid and the supporting cast also lends credence to this story. Malkovich varies his performance between JekyllHyde and it is effective and visceral.If you initially avoided this film I would highly recommend seeing it now. The atmosphere and music are haunting and sad. 910".

All the national critics sure hated this lowkey retelling of Jekyll and Hyde.The muted colors with the grey overtones caught my eye and were very interesting to observe. Julia Roberts also was interesting to watch no makeup no smile just sad somber looks yet still appealing. Despite critics' comments to contrary I found this an intelligent adaption of the famous story.People don't care for subtly in films anymore. They want inyourface smash ups gore violent contrasts....and a lot of it. This movie is extremely lowkey and subtle although there are some bloody scenes.I have to admit that I agree with one criticism that it's hard to believe Roberts' character Mary Reilly would not recognize Jekyll from Hyde played by John Malkovich when he didn't change facial appearances! And yes the film generally speaking is a real downer a depressing tale. Yet for some odd reason despite the above paragraph I recommend the film to people who enjoy slower films and subtle suspense even if they have to suspend a little believability. I thought it was oddly fascinating.".

Its dark themes deal with the oppression of a strict classbased society in Victorian England as well as the secrets that we all hide inside our hearts. The familiar tale takes intriguing new turns from the viewpoint of the house's servants.  John Malkovich while a tad thin on his English accent delivers a fantastic performance as both Jekyll and Hyde as he plumbs the depths of morality and the human soul.  Hyde is a stark contrast of freedom among the restrained servants of the Jekyll house and his subtle sexual innuendoes quietly violate the chastity of Victorian stereotypes.  Much of the violence occurs off camera until near the climax of the film which may be one of it's shortcomings.  The film is very quiet and slow and may put some viewers to sleep.  Another issue I had was the lovely HensonWorkshopprovided effects at the end which are imaginative but don't make a bit of sense when compared to the rest of the film.  If you can stomach a quiet and very subtle thriller however this is a real gem.".

While I can understand and see why people were put to sleep by the film I think it's a refreshing change of pace from the standard popcorn flick that is only interested in being the number 1 film at the box office Monday morning.  John Malkovich turns in a great performance of the JekyllHyde character and Glenn Close steals the few scenes she's in as a Madame of a brothel.  Julia Roberts plays against type as a dour chambermaid and I think that's what put off so many people.  Obviously most people like their Julia flashing her now 20 million dollar smile.  I say good for you for trying something different.  If you haven't seen Mary Reilly watch it on the next rainy day and enjoy it.My grade  8 out of 10".

Even knowing how evil Mr. Hyde is you really grow to like him he's a sort of rebel against Victorian mores and the class system.I think that the best line in the movie is when Mary tells Dr. Jekyll about her father's Michael Gambon drinking problem it was almost too selfreferential! As it is I think that Malkovich's performance in this movie might have been what made me view this movie positively more than Julia Roberts's performance. But either way you'll probably like it.

The story of Jekyll and Hide and it has been done in other films but this is one of the best I have seen. The film had a lot more feeling to it but was very subtle and made me think a lot of things through. The film has a slow pace compared to some but this isn't such a bad thing it definitely didn't feel drawn out it seemed to have enough time to venture down all the paths it needed including the death of Mary's mother.The film is classed partly as horror but the only part of the film which was scary to see was the scene where Mary witnesses Hde become Jekyll for the first and last time. The special effects were a little out there compared to the rest of the film it was almost like someone put a microwave in Dr Jekyll's Victorian kitchen. It would have been better to see there faces gently merge from one character to the other.Other than that all I have to say is this is a brilliant film.

The entire story is told from the viewpoint of Mary Reilly and I have never seen Julia Roberts do a better job than here. She is wonderfully effective... it is worth watching this film only for her performance. But it is also worth watching because of the attention to period detail. You really get a feeling of what it must have been like to live in the 19th century.

Not only hers but everyone else's too like the naive servants the furious Mrs. Faraday the brothel mistress. Mary Reilly  the character  also has a disturbing traumatizing background story and at some point Mr. Hyde gives a pretty heavy psychological spin on it. It's never elaborated on or seems ignored even but this suits the tone of the film. Insinuating things often hits harder than explaining them. Through some of the characters some of the possible little script flaws or plot holes get solved. For instance doesn't anybody notice that Dr. Jekyll and his assistant Mr. Hyde look very much alike? Only Hyde looks younger. Sure people notice this but one of the servants goes about assuming that Mr. Hyde might very well be a product of Jekyll's student days. As a bright student Jekyll was popular with the ladies. And since Jekyll never got married if he would have had a son... in those days it was even a sin to merely speak about or suggest a thing like this.I like John Malkovich's performance a lot and it's clear that him  Stephen Frears both understood very well what they wanted to achieve here. The good doc Jekyll whom is looked upon in high regards by his servants is far from kosher to the bone himself we get hints at how he conducts his research and we know he's a regular client at Mrs. Faraday's house of pleasure. While on the other hand Mr. Hyde as the savage beast has his scarce moments of weakness for Mary Reilly. See what I'm getting at? And when looking at it from Mary's side she unwillingly brings out the worst in the best and the best in the worst so to speak. Frears  Malkovich and screenwriter Christopher Hampton added shades of gray to a classic one too many times told story that is basically just about black  white. The film got me really interested in reading the source novel it was based on. To see how it compares the film.What else is there to like? Enough I think. Phillipe Rousselot's wonderful cinematography. A captivating musical score by George Stenton. As much as it's a characterdriven story it does feature a handful moments of the grotesque. Glenn Close gets decapitated. Dr. Jekyll is seen on the street repeatedly kicking a little girl in the stomach. An engrossing scene that shows how slaughtered meat for consumption is being traded in the streets followed by an analogy towards the trade of human organs for the sake of science. Not sure whom all were responsible for these sequences  I understand that Frears for example never intended the film to end like it did with that climactic transformation sequence. But said sequences are a graphic reminder of the fact that we are watching a horrific story. At any rate I didn't think they hurt the film. They injected it with the necessary dosage of brutality.The set design is marvelous and Dr. Jekyll's laboratory  or at least the way of getting there  is cleverly structured as it helps crafting the suspense of a certain scene in a brilliant manner. The 19th century London setting works convincing but we don't get to see much of it. The blocking  framing makes sure we usually only see one part of a street at a time. And to add to this claustrophobic  dark notion this film has most scenes take place on indoors sets. But also these sets are put to great use. To Mary Reilly the doctor's mansion starts off as a safe haven a place offering a good job and a possible better future. But it doesn't take long for this house to get infested with the evil of Mr. Hyde's presence at night. So much even that it starts to haunt her dreams. This shift in tone happens gradually with a slow but impeccable pace.Truth be told to me Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde always seemed a very simplistic story to tell. At least in the classic version as it got famous. It's good source material yes but Frears  Hampton managed to squeeze a much more interesting film out of it. Which probably could have even been a lot better if the producing studio at the time wasn't so concerned about how it would do at the box office.Voil that's it for what I like about this film.Notice that I didn't mention Julia Roberts' performance. It's very downtoned as it should be. She is there not to be noticed her character demands it and so does the story. And while she does have a lot of screen time she doesn't do much so there's just not much to say about her acting. But you can always 'see' the wheels of her character's thoughts grinding as she is the only one who's trying to fathom what's going on. From all the servants she's the only one that knows how to read. Dr. Jekyll discovers this very early on when he spots her reading a book in his library. This of course titillates the good doc's mind. And that's the point in the film as soon as it comes where you instantly realize this is going to take a turn for the worse. In that moment there's a harmless thing between them that will inevitably unleash unspeakable horrors. And this 'harmless thing' even is personified throughout the whole film. It goes by the name of Mary Reilly.A very interesting adaptation. And a good film full stop.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mary Reilly offers a new spin on Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and in that respect this really should have been a lot better. In fact whichever way you look at it this should have been a better film. The story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is a great base for a story and it's shocking to see that this is all that could be mustered. I don't know if Valerie Martin's novel is any better but given the fact that a film was made of it I'm inclined to think that it is. The film sees the shocking transformation of Dr Jekyll into Mr Hyde from the point of view of the good doctor's maid who just so happens to be called Mary Reilly. This is interesting because is shows the story we already know from a different perspective thus giving it new life but it loses so much in terms of the focus of the actual story things such as the reasons for the experiments and the crimes committed by Mr Hyde aren't touched on at all and that means that any interest generated by change of perspective is swiftly cancelled out.The film stars Julia Roberts who takes the lead role. It's not a good performance from her the atmosphere around her gives the impression that she's either uncomfortable or bored or both and that ensures that she's never much fun to watch. The usually brilliant John Malkovich takes the double role of Dr Jekyll and his alter ego and even he fails to make an interesting go of it. He's this film's biggest asset  but his performance loses credibility due to the fact that Mr Hyde is OBVIOUSLY the same person as Dr Jekyll! The fact that it's based on a story we all know doesn't help the film where the plotting is concerned. The audience knows that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde are different versions of the same man  and that means we are left waiting for the characters to catch up. Mary Reilly makes this dramatic irony it's centrepiece and it's not a good move as any intrigue is killed before it has chance to get off the ground. To be fair the film does a few good moments of suspense  but these are few and far between and all I can recommend doing with this film is missing it and seeing either Rouben Mamoulian's 1931 classic or the hilarious Hammer take Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde!".

	schema:headline " This Film Fails On Every Level In Addition To Being Julia Roberts Low Career Point";
	schema:reviewBody "I was perusing through the premium channels at my house when I came across a 1996 Stephen Frears film Mary Reily.  I had remembered hearing things about this film not exactly good things but since I had nothing better to do I sat back and watched this Julia Roberts  John Malkovich film.      Mary Reily is basically one big gimmick wrapped in a treatment of a classic tale.  The whole film deals with house maid Mary Reily's dealings with Dr. Henry Jeckyl and Mr. Edward Hyde.  The whole gimmick is the fact that this film is supposed to be the woman's take on the story.  Let's just say that while this gimmick might have been a good one it is pulled off in the worst way imaginable.  Which is disappointing to me because any film that starts off with an eel being graphically butchered would usually be alright in my book kidding.  I don't want to give anything away about the film but you probably know the whole story anyway if you have been paying attention to classic literature at all.  I think it would just be easier going through everything that is wrong in this movie.      First of all let me start on the performances in Mary Reily.  It seems to me that literally every one of the actorsactresses took a seminar before shooting on onenote acting.  Not one character in the film conveys more then one emotion in the whole film even with Dr Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde amazingly enough.  Julia Roberts Mary Reily is the worst of the cast this was also during her dry spell before My Best Friend's Wedding brought her back to superstardom.  I had no idea she was supposed to have an Irish brogue until 20 minutes into the movie and after that her accent changes about every four sentences...downright horrid.  In addition to the in flux accent she is the second worst offender of the onenote acting.  She expresses one emotion sadness as depression nothing more then that although she does do this thing with her eyes alot that is supposed to show horror I think.  The worst offender of the onenote acting is John Malkovich.  In one case this sort of acting works and his portrayal of Dr. Henry Jeckyl is one of the two redeeming values in this film.  He plays Jeckyl as if he is a shell for a true inner being that lurks beneath his skin and he does it with great subtlety.  Then his Hyde comes out and you realize that his Hyde is almost the same performance as his Jeckyl except kicked up a notch or two.  Don't even get me started on Glenn Close as brothel leader Mrs. Farraday who is in the film only a short time but threw off every scene she was in actually making the movie worse then it already was with her acting style of sneering at anything said to her. When she leaves you note that the film rises in quality only a little.  The rest of the performances are of the same school onenote acting to show their stance on Mary Reily's actions.  That was the most upsetting thing in the whole movie but trust me there are more flaws.      The screenplay by Christopher Hampton is so unbelievably straight forward and boring that every line in the film is completely unimbellished. What I mean by this is that the majority of the dialogue consists of one to three sentences.  Which really doesn't help with any character development although there is a little but you barely notice it because the performances hinder the development very much.  It also doesn't help that the screenplay adds a completely unnecessary subplot involving Mary Reily and her parents there was absolutely no reason for them to be there.  The other thing about the screenplay that is very odd is the fact that while Dr. Jeckyl is the film a fair amount Mr. Hyde is treated as cameolength character which just confuses me even more.  There is one other thing that I liked about Mary Reily that was the Set Design by Stephanie McMillan and the overall Production Design by Stuart Craig this is the most impressive thing in the whole film showing both gothic and classic styles at once. The final thing which I really can't say too much about because of my lack of knowledge of Stephen Frears other works but the pacing during the early scenes is just bizarre but it straightens itself about a half hour into the movie.  I am not sure how much of this film can be blamed on Frears himself because other then the early pacing problems I couldn't find too many glaring problems.      Overall I would say that everyone should avoide wasting about 2 hours on this film.  It isn't even good for a laugh because of it's overly serious tone.  Even fans of Frears Roberts Malkovich and Close should stay far away from this thing and keep your respect for these professionals.My Rating  210".

	onyx:emotionText "I was perusing through the premium channels at my house when I came across a 1996 Stephen Frears film Mary Reily.  I had remembered hearing things about this film not exactly good things but since I had nothing better to do I sat back and watched this Julia Roberts  John Malkovich film.      Mary Reily is basically one big gimmick wrapped in a treatment of a classic tale.  The whole film deals with house maid Mary Reily's dealings with Dr. Henry Jeckyl and Mr. Edward Hyde.  The whole gimmick is the fact that this film is supposed to be the woman's take on the story.  Let's just say that while this gimmick might have been a good one it is pulled off in the worst way imaginable.  Which is disappointing to me because any film that starts off with an eel being graphically butchered would usually be alright in my book kidding.

	schema:headline " The film Mary Reilly is a shipwreck of reason.";
	schema:reviewBody "True fans of Julia Roberts may wish to experience this film. No doubt one's love for her previous efforts will allow one to find this trash as personal treasure. All others should give this film a wide berth. We are meant to suspend disbelief and assume Julia Roberts to be Dr. Jeckyl's hardworking Irish maid who survived child abuse with scar tissue and is now forced into perpetual servitude yet still able to look this good.The predominant evidence to Roberts' being miscast is her inability to retain an Irish accent throughout the film. Just once didn't the director think to stop and film a scene until Roberts got it right? Roberts would seem to occasionally add accented inflection as an afterthought. I hope they never cast her as Eliza in a remake of Pygmalion! Julia Roberts portrays confusing emotions throughout the film. Fear disillusionment frustration and surprise all appear to register on Roberts' face as the same emotion. Wide eyes with lips that almost part and eyebrows that almost remarkably remain motionless. In fact much of Roberts' time in the film is spent tentatively peering through some portal with her shining face looking for a shadow to hide behind as she views something off camera which is never truly as horrific as a horror movie should be. To be fair the sets and the costuming are superb. The sound is satisfactory but not memorable. That's about the best I can compliment this film. While a film of the horror genre it also vainly strives to be a romance an intense melodrama and near the end even cheesy science fiction. The end result is this film doesn't know what it wants to be. Therefore it plods away with the pacing of a cadaver stagnating in its own refuse.John Malkovich must be incredibly confident in his talent to have given such a terrible performance here. I have seen him do far better with far less. Perhaps Malkovich knew that in this script the parts of Jeckyl and Hyde are merely supporting roles that take a backseat to what is inherently a Julia Roberts star vehicle and he took that to heart. This film's Hyde appears to be perhaps ten years younger than Jeckyl and cleanshaven. We're never meant to truly understand what diabolical serum turns the one man into the other but I imagine it involved a pint of guiness followed by a vodka chaser and either shaving cream or rogaine depending on the need. That is the extent of the difference visually. The rest is dependent upon Malkovich's performance as a kind elderly gentleman in the part of Jeckyl and a sinister rebellious delinquent in the part of Hyde. Malkovich rises up to this challenge by not rising at all. Instead he reads his lines alternatively wooden or melodramatic. He is the villain because it is his part to play except of course when it is not. Then he is a misunderstood lover unrequited or a man hiding angst and longing. We are meant to feel pity for him but we end up feeling indifferent. It is explained to us why Jeckyl has invented Hyde. He struggles with demons within that perhaps we all have to some degree only he was trying to control his and use it affect freedom from the captivity of his humdrum existence. One can't help but think that all Jeckyl truly needed was spontaneity. His reasons for unleashing this monster have not enough weight to carry the film. Further this monster he unleashes turns out to be simply a man of amoral virtues who doesn't pass for a gentleman by cultured 19th century standards. I mean in the 20th century Mr. Hyde would fit in quite well in a reality cops tv show as a man police take into custody. He's no monster. He's no madman. He's just a common criminal and a boring one at that like a kleptomaniac who steals lives. Diseased or merely selfish he deserves what he gets.  Glenn Close appears laughably in what appears to be a man in drag with far too much makeup making her performance as Cruella DeVille in 101 Dalmatians Oscar material by comparison. In Mary Reilly she portrays The Madame Farraday who being the manager of a nearby prostitution ring naturally stereotypically has dealings with Hyde and cleans up after his antisocial outings only to be surprised when this backfires. Close performs her role as if she knows her fate and sneers and jeers at everything around her there obviously for her own entertainment and amusement certainly not ours. The other performers are inconsequential to the plot or the atmosphere and quite unremarkable. The premise sounds solid on the surface but like a wet paper towel it breaks under any strain. The casting was misguided. The dialogue is weak. The script itself is bland where it should have been melodramatic and vice versa. The interaction between characters always appears forced and rarely builds from the logic of the moment. The motivations shown of Reilly's childhood horror appear more scary than her present plight and cause one to wonder why she doesn't just turn tail and run. Yet towards the end we realize it is because she actually likes it when she's punished and broken. She wants to be Hyde's victim. This realization could have been an audience shocker but instead it's a yawn. There's a bad joke that comes to mind. The masochist says to the sadist hurt me please. The sadist says to the masochist no. This is what happens to the leads in this film. Nothing. And yet they seem content with that.".

The film begins with a lovely metaphor  Mary's warm hands bringing a stunned eel back to life an eel that is then mercilessly chopped up and served for breakfast and this metaphor is a wonderful analogy for Mary's effect on the doomed Dr. Jekyll. She brings him back to life but only after a terrible decision has already been made. It's too late.I especially loved several aspects to this film  not just the performances but the literate and subtle script by Hampton that really gives a sense of the war for good and evil within all the lead characters  especially illuminating both sides of the coin that is Mary herself because the film has no easy answers and that she truly fears and loves equally  as does Dr. Jekyll himself.  The film shows compassion toward both lead characters as the subtle victims of early abuse  but where Jekyll seeks to become the knife as well as the blade Mary's situation is both simpler and more complex.  She doesn't seek retribution but instead finds a kind of fascination in herself with the undeniably attractive Hyde who apologizes to no one who neatly sidesteps the Victorian niceties of the times.  She may want to screw Hyde but she loves Jekyll. In some ways it's the perfect match  even if it is an impossible threesome.The performances are lovely  Roberts' accent is uneven she did a much more authentic brogue in Michael Collins but she is really striking visually has never been more beautiful and makes some very brave choices as an actress nonetheless so the accent inconsistencies didn't bother me too much. Malkovich is wonderful and equally subtle even if Hyde does seem to simply be channeling his Vicomte from Dangerous Liaisons.  The script by Hampton is literate and sometimes troubling there are no easy Freudian answers here and the direction is gorgeous as is the cinematography  Roberts and Malkovich seem to emerge as pale haunted visages in the darkness.Overall flaws and all I'd recommend this film as worth a second look.".

Gangsters smuggle it into HK only to become instant zombie prey. One of the gang escapes with the bottle but is run over by two young VCD sellers and wannabe petty criminals Woody Invincible and Crazy Bee returning to their mall shop in their bosses' car. Trying to revive him they give him a drink of what they think is Lucosade. With him seemingly dead and unsure of what to do they bring the corpse back to the mall with them in the boot of their car. They make the mistake of leaving the boot open. And pretty soon the mall is crawling with zombies. The odd couple and a bunch of other mall employees have to bond together to try and fight their way out.";

Bio Zombie is original in the way it blends comedy horror action.....and it works!!I really liked the transition the film.  When you meet Woody Invincible and Crazy Bee they are far from winning any moral awards.  This provides so much humor especially their tough guy personas so you naturally take a liking to the two.  Follow that with crossing paths with a couple of gals including hottie babe Rolls and you have really funny moments!!  The way director Wilson Yip progresses the story you find out about the characters and then he adds the deadly biochemical plot which takes the film to another level.  It's not a horror film having you shut your eyes or watch through the cracks of your fingers but you find yourself drawn into the story following the plight of our unlikely heroes.VERY good chemistry between the cast.  Jordan Lee Woody and Sam Lee Bee really seem like two buddies who get into all sort of trouble.  Their personalities facial expressions mannerisms are all assets to their respective characters.  Angela Tong YingYing Rolls is good as well and flaunts her sex appeal very well!  The bathroom scenes with her and Woody are hilarious!  Even the Sushi guy plays a vital part!Credit goes to Yip for giving a shopping mall a very unique and creepy look due to great cinematography.  As more and more zombies appear the twist from comedic entertainment shifts to struggle to survive entertainment. The great thing is this film doesn't take itself too seriously and it looks like they had a lot of fun shooting this film.  Trust me you'll have fun seeing it too.".

Follow the lives of a pair of smalltime punks running a VCD shop the likable Crazy Bee and the incredibly named Woody Invincible as they try to get their boss's car and end up accidentally unleashing a zombie plague. Oops. But even before the first zombie shows up the duo has gotten into some amusing scrapes and got out of them with bluster that for once is not unlikable.  They may be jerks but at least their the kind of jerks you can see yourself hanging out with.When the zombies show up the movie stays focused on Woody and Bee.  It seems so wrong to say that this movie is character driven but it is.  Not it a dramatic sense but in the sense that the characters and not the zombies are the main focus of the movie.  That surprisingly doesn't hurt the film as the interactions are definetly between our heroic duo and the zombies are generally amusing.But the movie knows when to get serious.  The last ten minutes or so switch from humor to seriousness save one speech from Bee suddenly and yet without missing a step.  The last ten minutes seem to come from a real zombie movie and are filled with emotion and pathos.  It's kind of startling but it also fits.All in all I definetly recommend this movie.  It is one of my favorites. Just go in expecting humor.  Heck it's best to go into the movie not knowing anything about it.".

It really takes way too long to get to the zombie action and I didn't find myself amused at the antics of the two heroes. But stick with it. About an hour in the film really picks up and drops some of the comedy. There are moments in this thing that are so sad and depressing they rival some of Romero's work. And that is a huge statement coming from me. I believe the comedy was thrown in to lighten our mood so the director could sucker punch us with the dark finale. It reminded me of Man Bites Dog in this way only not as deep. But it did affect me and I loved that ending.

OK so the zombie subplot does take a while to get in place but the comedy does provide entertainment up until the zombies all start shuffling in. The pacing is great with scenes of tension the handcuff key in mouth sceneand cheesy emotion The Sushi zombie giving a present to that girl pushing along the narrative and character development to a good standard. Before watching it i was expecting a gorefest but gore fans will be disappointed scenes of zombieculling are quite brief and restrained but fans of comedyhorror or zombie films should enjoy. To be honest the film does play as a bit of a spoof with moments of clichd and cheesy emotion and the whole computer game idea towards the end. Although the ending does shaft the comedy element for emotion although i think its played for laughs and the ending is a bit of shock it is overall an enjoyable experience and if you do enjoy this check out Peter Jackson's Braindead!".

	schema:headline " Hong Kong takes on Romero's zombie movies and it kind of works except for the less then likable leads";
	schema:reviewBody "Horror comedy with uneven make up. Two slacker hustlers Working at a mall selling video games and VCDs and DVDs. When they run over a man fleeing from an escaped zombie he was looking to get the soft drink like substance that turns people into flesh eating ghouls when it all went wrong and he fled and then got hit. The friends give him a sip of the zombie juice and then throw him in the trunk and head back to the mall unaware they've just started a zombie infestation. Best described as Dawn of the Dead in Hong Kong with a humorous eye this is a movie that works in fits and starts and ends up just missing. The problem is that while there are nice touches like the zombie chef who loves an unaffected girl our lead characters are real jerks and while that makes for some good laughs it leaves you with no one to really root for or people you're rooting for by default. So much for the antihero and snarky tones that some films take. Its not a bad movie just a disappointing one. Worth a look for horror aficionados.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well i'm extremely pleased I saw this film when I had the chance. I managed to see it late one night on 'Film Four Extreme' not knowing what i'd be in for. I was expecting a cheap zombie effort that I would have to force myself to sit through. But I was wrong!First of all I have not seen the newly 'dubbed' version of this film and do not wish to either. I have seen two different versions which different subtitles. The first was on 'Film four' which seemed to have been translated by someone british I could tell because most of the slang was british. The other version of subtitiling is from the HK region 0 DVD and NOT the newly release US version of this film which I think has the dubbing. The DVD subtitling isn't great because some of it is translated very poorly whereas the 'Film four' version of this is grammar perfect.From the very opening shots of the film I actually found myself laughing! Could this be!? A horror film that is actually truly funny and isn't 'Return of the Living Dead'! Two characters called 'Crazy Bee' and  'Woody Invincible' work at a VCD shop in a neon like indoor mall and accidently run into this person in their car which is inevitably a zombie. They take the body back to the mall in the trunk of their car only to release that its missing and starting all kinds of trouble in the mall. That's the basic plot from there without giving anything away. But I assure you you'll find yourself laughing! There are some classic moments in it.Now for the Zombie genre horror people out there I still suggest checking this out. As far as I know there are few zombie films out there that seem to be able to work with comedy. A couple that spring to mind are 'Return of the Living Dead' and 'Brain Dead'. Although Bio Zombie may not be as good as either of these in effects its still an equally great zombie film. There are minimal gore scenes and no truly amazing SFX but it doesn't let it's low budget appereance hurt the film at all. Still there are some great gore scenes such as the 'tap in the face' where Bee jams a tap pipe into a zombies head and turns on the fawcett and blood comes out the end! Not to mention a scene with a drill in the mouth! There are good points to be had for the true zombie genre horror fan. If you do get the chance to see this on 'Film four' then I suggest you do because this version of the subtitles are a lot better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I am not a big fan of ZomComs ZombieComedies after seeing the high rating on IMDb I decided to give this one a try. Needless to say I found it to be more than a little disappointing for several reasons. First it is my opinion that this particular subgenre is a very difficult undertaking to begin with due to the simple fact that zombies are not typically funny and any comedy at their expense risks lessening their overall valueand subsequently that of the movie as a whole. Therefore I believe that it is extremely important to have the audience invested in the main characters as their welfare or predicament is quite often the key to the entire film. Unfortunately in this particular case the two main characters named Woody Invincible Jordan Chan and Crazy Bee Sam Lee were hardly worth any concern or sympathy as they were nothing more than mere street thugs. Perhaps if they had been adorable losers it might have changed things but as it was I certainly didn't care for them one way or the other. As a matter of fact if anything the only characters of any interest was a mugging victim named Rolls Angela Tong and an abused wife named Mrs. Kui Dorothy EliasFahn due in part because of their unfortunate circumstances but also because but they both lent some nice scenery to an otherwise drab atmosphere. And then there was the awful decision to give ridiculous names to the characters like Jelly Suk Yin Lai and the aforementioned Rolls. Quite frankly I found this action to be both cheap and childish. Ditto the entire movie. Below average.".

And with this film featuring plenty of both and also starring Sam Lee one performer guaranteed to get on my nerves there's just something about his face that annoys me I found myself growing tired of proceedings pretty quickly.Lee plays Crazy Bee a nogood slacker who along with his equally worthless pal Woody Invincible Jordan Chan runs a VCD shop in a mall when the guys aren't ripping off their customers with dodgy pirated copies of Stephen Chow movies they're cruising the mall looking for hot chicks and ways to make easy money.Their carefree way of life comes to an end however when the mall becomes the centre of a zombie outbreak and making a fast buck and scoring with women come second to avoiding being eaten by the undead.Those viewers looking for a completely insane piece of Hong Kong horror will probably be fairly disappointed by BioZombie the first half of the film features next to no zombie action preferring to concentrate on following our unlikeable heroes as they wander the mall argue with sexist shop owner Kui Yiu Cheung Lai and try to win the affection of hotpants wearing sexpot Rolls the lovely Angela Tong and the second half in which the walking dead finally begin to wreak havoc lacks the sense of outrageousness that can be found in so many other HK films.Towards the end of BioZombie things start to get a little better as the few survivors fight a bloody well slightly bloody battle against an ever growing number of flesheaters but it all arrives too late in the day to rescue the film.

However this doesn't explain the endless amounts of boring dialogue that do nothing to forward the plot and winds up filling space between dull zombie attacks.There are comparisons listed in this review section that say that this movie is the Hong Kong Return of the Living Dead or worse Dawn of the Dead.  Not in my opinion.  Not even close.Don't get me wrong. There were some funny parts to this movie but nothing that would merit it being more than a 20 minute edited version. Sure the lack of a budget may have made makeup effects hard but not impossible  reference the first Evil Dead movie.  If you are looking for Asian zombie action you may want to try something like Shiryour gari Junk. This one is from Japan and is not spectacular but is mindless zombie fun.

They're not trying to look funny but different situations they find themselves in is.Woody Invincible and Crazy Bee are two characters that has no redeemable quality to speak of. They're going about their bumbling ways thinking that things are normal when actually things can't be more wrong than it is.This is a really great movie and you need to see it to appreciate the humor of it all.Sam Lee and Jordan Chan does a superb job of playing two characters who finds themselves in the middle of zombie outbreak. Especially Jordan Chan deserves an Oscar nomination for his outrageously cool and funny acting. Without the acting of Sam and Jordan this movie wouldn't have been half as funny. Not just another zombie comedy but something with a real kick in the pants. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1998 Hong Kong zombiecomedy Biozombie we meet a pair of very amusing ne'erdowells Woody Invincible Jordan Chan and his younger sidekick Crazy Bee Sam Lee. When not engaged at their regular occupation as clerks at a bootlegged VCD store in the New Trend Plaza Mall the two boastful cowards can usually be found either smoking pot or gambling and whoring in nearby Macao. As in another Asian horror film that I recently saw 1960's Jigoku their lives are suddenly altered when their car accidentally strikes a crazed pedestrian. But rather than pulling a hit and run as in Jigoku Woody and Bee here make the mistake of helping the dying pedestrian not knowing that the soft drink that they pour down his throat actually consists of an Iraqi biochemical weapon that can transform anyone into the lurching fleshhungry undead! Soon enough the zombie scourge has increased exponentially and our hapless heroes along with some hotties from the mall's beauty parlor AND an obnoxious cell phone dealer and his gorgeous wife are playing hideandseek with the gut munchers in the locked and deserted shopping emporium....Anyway Biozombie succeeds wildly at both its missions. It is both very funny and a fairly gripping zombie experience. The film is extremely fast pacedthe zombies here are a pretty hyperkinetic bunchand director Wilson Yip does a terrific job at wringing shocks and yucks on his obviously limited budget. Though his zombie makeup and FX are nowhere near the level that fans of Tom Savini may be accustomed to they are certainly good and effective enough. It's loads of fun watching our two stoner heroes morph from empty braggadocio to fullfledged superefficient zombie slayers and most of the film's laffs come as a result of the hilarious expressions on these dudes' faces they seem to be mugging ALL the time. The relationship between the two is a touching one especially toward the film's end as Bee's idolization of his older mentor becomes more apparent. The film gives the gorehounds out there any number of pleasing set pieces too including a frenzied fight in a security office a zombie freeforall in a sushi bar a nerveracking attempt to procure some handcuff keys out of an imminent zombie's mouth the use of a power drill ! on a zombie's head and that final melee in an underground garage. The picture is nothing demanding or terribly earth shaking but it sure is fun right to its surprisingly downbeat ending. This finelooking DVD from Media Blasters by the way offers the option of excellently translated English subtitles or what has been called Engrish subtitles which are hilariously mistranslated in the worst pidgin English style. That latter option is certainly not recommended for use during an initial viewing largely incomprehensible as these subtitles are but is highly entertaining later on. However the film is viewed though this cult item should readily be acknowledged as a significant addition to the zombiecomedy subgenre.".

	schema:headline " Even with linguistic rationalization this is still a mediocre film";
	schema:reviewBody "Bio Zombie is an unevenly paced zombie comedy that arches from over the top gags to serious human choice drama. The film maker's intentions of a quirky and invigorating addition to the genre are not fulfilled. Rather the film is a banal and somewhat boring picture that is ultimately unable to impress the audience. An important caveat is that this movie is clearly made with a Chinese sense of humor. It is highly probable that what makes this film endearing is lost on nonChinese audiences. The above stated the film still has more faults than positive aspects.The main issue with this film is the style of humor. The sight gags are universally accessible. On the other hand the dialog driven humor has a unique Chinese sensibility. Many of the verbal gags strike a Western audience as poorly thought out or simply childish. This may be the case due to a fondness of punning in Asian culture. Various Asian countries have a tradition of humor based on the similarity of word pronunciation for wildly different concepts. As would be expected these jokes require more than a cursory understanding of the language. At several points in the film the nonChinese speaking audience is given cues to laugh but seemingly has no material to laugh at. This disconnect between cue and humor is most likely the result of linguistic ignorance. The effects of the punning may be delightful for native speakers but the puns leave everyone else feeling let down or underwhelmed.The highlight of the film is the relationship between the characters. It is clear that the director placed great emphasis on both chemistry and character development. All of the players are multidimensional people that interact in relative to the situation natural ways. While the characters are a clear strong point the required development involved causes the film to drag. BZ is a zombie film and zombies are neglected until the second half. While rich characterization is appreciated the lack of zombies in a zombie film is quite frankly boring. The film further suffers from the actual zombie story being utterly devoid of novelty. BZ relies on themes previously used by Romero. The homage is appreciated yet adding no new context or style comes off as drudgery. In addition the makeup effects are laughably poor. It is clear in several shots that zombies are wearing gardening gloves dipped in oatmeal like substance. Furthermore the frenetic editing and cheesy music fail to provide humor or tension. Overall the film is a collection of interesting people engaged in a dull plot and filmed in a technically average way. One can and should expect more from a zombie film even a budget zombie movie such as this.On a personal note I will not be recommending this film to friends. BZ may come up in debates about who is the biggest zombie film buff but only as a demonstration of the depths one is prepared to suffer for completeness. Should the potential viewer decide to watch this bore please try to be in some way intoxicated. 5.3 of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you watch Bio Zombie its pretty damn obvious that Asian horror filmmakers are just as infatuated with Romeros zombie creations as we are.The movie is about these two slacker looser types who work in a video store down at the local mall. While they are driving their bosses car from the auto shop they hit a strange man with a suit case containing a liquid that when ingested will turn anyone into raving flesh eating zombies. They mistake the liquid for a soda bottle some one drinks it and the zombie fun begins.The first half is just getting to know the characters so the actual zombie action doesn't begin right away but the funny dialog and characters will keep you interested until the undead starts to roll in. The first half kind of feels like Mallrats with all these crazy young characters who's life depends on being in the mall for 95 of their lives. I mean we get to losers as leads kind of like Jay and Silent Bob we get the asshole who treats his girl like crap like Ben Afflecks character in Mallrats lets face it the influences from Kevin Smiths films on this one are also blatantly obvious.The second half of the movie is when the zombies start to roll in. This half of the movie reminded me a lot of Romeros Dawn of the Dead and hey there's no denying that Romeros film was an obvious inspiration for this here flick. You know zombies in a mall people running and hiding from them in the stores. You know the drill.What disappointed me a bit about this movie was its obvious lack of gore! I was expecting a blood bath but no surprisingly the movie showed a lot of restraint in this department. Could it have been because of its small budget? Or where there other reasons for the lack of the red stuff? I don't know but after a while I was feeling a bit cheated. Not only that but the actual zombie make up wasn't all that great sometimes you could see that it was just appliances glued to the actors faces...and that really really sucked for me. In fact its the worst part of the film. Hey! If your making a zombie movie at least make the undead look cool! But the movie manages to award us with something else instead. We might not have cool looking zombies or buckets of blood and guts the camera actually shys away from showing us the blood and guts on many occasions but we get great characters! Woody and Bee are funny guys they are lovable slackers and you'll be entertained by their funny situations and hilarious dialog.The direction was inventive as well there were some really cool shots in there that caught me off guard. Like for example there were some visual references to the house of the Dead video game! Now before you go saying something about how Uwe Boll did it and it sucked and you'd be right! this director actually did it right! You have to see it to understand but it was very original. There were many other cool shots in the film that showed the director was creative with his shots.All in all a fun zombie movie with great characters but not enough gore. Think of it as Mallrats meats Dawn of the Dead and you'll have an idea of what your going to see! Rating 3 out 5".

The way the characters become trapped and the zombie infestation itself is different and BIO ZOMBIE is more goofy slapstick than actual zombie gore film. Still it manages to balance the drama of being stalked by flesheating killers and slapstick humor well enough not to be annoying.A good take by Hong Kong proving that the chinese probably has a better handle on this zombie thing more so than their Japanese counterpart whose zombie films have been well really strange.The ending hints at a possible sequel that is sadly hasn't appeared yet.6 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hong Kong takes on the zombie genre. BIO ZOMBIE is basically a remake of Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD with characters trapped in a shopping mall infested with the living dead. The way the characters become trapped and the zombie infestation itself is different and BIO ZOMBIE is more goofy slapstick than actual zombie gore film. Still it manages to balance the drama of being stalked by flesheating killers and slapstick humor well enough not to be annoying.A good take by Hong Kong proving that the chinese probably has a better handle on this zombie thing more so than their Japanese counterpart whose zombie films have been well really strange.The ending hints at a possible sequel that is sadly hasn't appeared yet.6 out of 10.";

	schema:headline " Bogart's Breakthrough Film!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Petrified Forest is widely regarded as Humphrey Bogart's breakthrough film which indeed it was. Bogey had made several forgettable films between 193034 before returning discouraged to the New York stage. There he acquired the role of Duke Mantee in the stage version of The Petrified Forest in which Leslie Howard was the star.When Warner Bros. bought the film rights they wanted Howard but also wanted Edward G. Robinson for the Mantee role. Howard interceded on Bogart's behalf saying that if Bogey wasn't cast as Mantee that he wouldn't do the film either. Bogey never forgot this favor and years later named his daughter Leslie after Howard.The story takes place in a dusty road side cafegas station in the middle of a desert. The film is essentially about a bunch of life's losers with no real future except for the young waitress Gabrielle Maples Bette Davis who dreams of leaving the dusty desert for the bright lights of Paris.A wandering intellectualwriter Alan Squier Howard comes to the cafe broke and hungry. He strikes up a friendship with Gabrielle who admires his cultured manner and love of poetry much to the chagrin of would be boyfriend Boze Hertzinger Dick Foran a has been football player who now pumps gas. Inside the cafe we meet Gabrielle's father Jason Porter Hall who fancies himself as a war hero and Gramp Maples Charlie Grapewin a senile old timer who likes to tell stories of his encounter with Billy the Kid.Into this peaceful setting comes gangster Duke Mantee Bogart and his three pals Jackie Joe Sawyer Ruby Adrian Morris and Slim Slim Thompson. The gang is on the lam from the law. Mantee holds all of the people in the cafe hostage including travelers the Chisolms Paul Harvey Genevieve Tobin and their chauffeur Joseph John Alexander. The rest of the film deals with the conflicts between the various characters and the growing love story between Alan and Gabrielle.Bogey reportedly patterned his Mantee after real life gangster John Dillinger right down to his speech and movements. In fact if you look at photographs of Dillinger you can see the resemblance. This might explain Bogey's CP3O the android from Star Wars like posture. Notice how he holds his arms and his walk.The two black actors Thompson and Alexander were also in the New York stage production. Dick Foran was appearing as a singing cowboy in a series of B westerns for Warners and welcomed this chance at a straight role in a major film.Although Bogart definitely dominated the film one can't help but admire the performance of Leslie Howard as Squier. Bette Davis just emerging as a major star has little to do but stare wideeyed at Howard.After this film Warners signed Bogart to a contract. He would play mostly gangster roles in Cagney and Robinson films with the odd lead in a B picture such as Black Legion 1937 until 1941 when he became a major star after appearing in High Sierra and The Maltese Falcon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Sherwood's The Petrified Forest had a run in 1935 on Broadway for the first half of that year. Warner Brothers bought the film rights and shot it the following year. Leslie Howard and at his insistence Humphrey Bogart came west to repeat their stage roles.For Bogart it was a return to bigger acclaim than he had gotten in his first trip to Hollywood in the early Thirties. He hadn't made much of an impression then but he was in Tinseltown to stay after The Petrified Forest and his frightening characterization of criminal on the run Duke Mantee.The Petrified Forest takes place in a filling stationgreasy spoon truck stop on the edge of the Arizona desert. About as desolate a place as you'll find. Three generations of the Maple family own and operate the place. Grandpa Charley Grapewin Father Porter Hall and daughter Bette Davis who dreams about the fact there's more to life than this nowhere place. Bette also has to contend with former college football star Dick Foran and his clumsy efforts at courtship.Along comes Alan Squier played by Leslie Howard who's a blase world weary vagabond who's seen better days. He and Davis hit it off and she comes to realize that there is a great big world out there. The first third of the movie involves the two of them and I have to say that in the mouths of players less skilled than these two Robert Sherwood's dialog would have sounded like so much romantic drivel.For Davis Gabrielle Maple is a unique part and not one she'd play later on as her features hardened. An intelligent and romantic young girl is not a typical Bette Davis part but she does bring it off.As for Howard Alan Squier is a typical part for him. Not too much different than Ashley Wilkes or Philip Scott from The 49th Parallel.The remainder of the film is when Duke Mantee and his gang take refuge at the filling station and hold captive anyone who's there or wanders in. A lot of souls are bared under Mantee's guns and the climax is spectacular.Two other actors who repeated their Broadway roles are Joseph Alexander who's the chauffeur of a rich couple who stop at the filling station and Slim Thompson a member of Mantee's gang. Both of these players are black.Joseph Alexander is a menial and Slim Thompson really rubs it in to him telling him the day of liberation has come for some time now. In 1936 that was practically revolutionary.Alexander had a substantial career but I have no idea what happened to Thompson. He had no other film credits and only one other stage appearance on Broadway in the original production of Anna Lucasta.Moviegoers of all generations should thank Leslie Howard for insisting on Humphrey Bogart being in this film and helping to create a screen legend.".

Not too much different than Ashley Wilkes or Philip Scott from The 49th Parallel.The remainder of the film is when Duke Mantee and his gang take refuge at the filling station and hold captive anyone who's there or wanders in. A lot of souls are bared under Mantee's guns and the climax is spectacular.Two other actors who repeated their Broadway roles are Joseph Alexander who's the chauffeur of a rich couple who stop at the filling station and Slim Thompson a member of Mantee's gang. Both of these players are black.Joseph Alexander is a menial and Slim Thompson really rubs it in to him telling him the day of liberation has come for some time now. In 1936 that was practically revolutionary.Alexander had a substantial career but I have no idea what happened to Thompson. He had no other film credits and only one other stage appearance on Broadway in the original production of Anna Lucasta.Moviegoers of all generations should thank Leslie Howard for insisting on Humphrey Bogart being in this film and helping to create a screen legend.";

	schema:reviewBody "The best context to look at The Petrified Forest is through the context of the first great disaster of the 20th Century World War I or as it was known then The Great War. I had just finished reading a long thorough history of World War I when I saw this one and even though this is some twenty years after that awful catastrophe all wars usually are but this one especially one can still feel it's aftershocks rolling through that desolate landscape. Maybe that's why Leslie Howard's character Alan Squier wound up wandering through there as it probably reminded him of more than a few days and nights in No Man's Land a term invented by the Great War to describe the space between enemy lines. A lot of nonAmerican WWI veterans came out of it really messed up. The whole foundation of the 19th century's ideals had been laid to waste by this new and brutal world that WWI brought about. So it's not very suprising to me that Squier feels obsolete as he puts it the role he had hoped to take with his world doesn't even exist. The best he can do is give Gabrielle Maple the chance he can never have.Duke Mantee played by Bogie in a superb breakthrough performance is also a relic but from a different period that of the Roaring Twenties. Not for nothing were such outlaws as John Dillenger and Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow glamourized during this period one could possibly point to our current fascination with serial killers as this phenomenon's modern equivalent. But by 1936 the period of the romantic outlaw was drawing to a close if it wasn't already over a point made five years later in High Sierra. Mantee is totally without hope of escape or even a reprieve. He sees his fate as clear as day and doesn't kid himself about his chances of eluding it forever. That more than anything would explain his rapproachment with Squier and perhaps his reluctance to shoot him until Squier gives him no choice. Mantee may know his own fate well enough but he has no wish to inflict that fate on someone in the same position.Granted there's a lot more layers and angles going on in The Petrified Forest than what I've just mentioned here but this was the one that grabbed the most. Because human nature doesn't change that much perhaps that's why this brilliant stage piece still holds my respect.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Petrified Forest Archie Mayo 1936 is most fascinating for its eager willingness to voice criticisms of wealth power authority and inequality in America. Perhaps its acute social commentary should be unsurprising considering that Warner Brothers released the romantic crime drama during the depths of the Great Depression but it is freshly relevant just the same striking a note that would not be witnessed in the films of the forties and fifties. In speaking to the exploitation of workers the snobbery of corporatism the repression of women blacks artists and literary poets the reign of gangland crime the American government's complicit abuse of power and the loss of individuality in an increasingly meek age The Petrified Forest manages an equalopportunity iconoclasm that belies any party affiliations. Simply put the film is unafraid to criticize America and it's that sense of freedom that makes it particularly delightful. Best of all The Petrified Forest voices its dissent through colorful witticisms and engaging banter never taking itself too seriously or losing its sense of humor. The Petrified Forest is also particularly notable for marking Humphrey Bogart's first major screen role as the nominal villain and escaped gangster Duke Mantee. The unshaven pompadoursporting Bogart is leering and menacing brooding and growling and glowering projecting the lonely hardbitten cynicism that would soon become his trademark. At the same time however he also emerges as a sympathetic and noble figure one who transcends his criminal trappings through a fierce sense of integrity and individuality. Not only did these hardboiled character traits become the template for the Bogart persona but they also serve as a source of magnetism within the film's social milieu. Aside from the corporate oilman Mr. Chisholm played by Paul Harvey Duke Mantee's hostages in a desert diner come to admire and salute his rugged individualism and defiance of the status quo even as he endangers their lives. They yearn for the empowering resistance that he embodies and the gritty social rebelliousness that he wears on his prickly face and when the film before its final shootout labels the confrontation as Duke Mantee vs. the American government it's clear that the sympathies of its principal characters reside with the Duke. The Petrified Forest is also noteworthy for the dynamic contrast between its two black characters. One of them Joseph played by John Alexander is virtually the embodiment of the presixties Hollywood stereotype a meek shuffling subservient chauffeur who always looks to his wealthy boss for paternalistic approval before opening his mouth. The other Slim played by Slim Thompson is one of Duke Mantee's gangster associates and he's clearly a liberated autonomous independent soul who offers his opinions on his own accord while mocking his colored brother for his subservience. He's almost a figure out of 1966 rather than 1936 and the difference between these two black men highlights the social conflict that the film heeds. On one side is the ruggedly individualistic and socially defiant Duke Mantee and a black man who marches to his own beat on the other is a fat cat corporate tycoon and his docile and emasculated black servant who in turn represent the American status quo. And so while Mantee and his gangsters are nominally the villains of The Petrified Forest at heart they constitute the film's heroes and rousing saviors. They are the men who obliquely brighten the hopeless despair and repressed frustrations of a trapped waitress who is secretly a talented painter Gabby Maple played by Bette Davis and a fatalistically passionate French drifterpoet who is hitching his way to the Pacific Ocean Alan Squier played by Leslie Howard. They also seem to enliven several of the other repressed characters from the restless wife of the cowardly tycoon Mrs. Edith Chisholm played by Genevieve Tobin to an excollege football player struggling to release his pentup energies Nick played by Eddie Acuff to an old man who longs for Billy the Kid Mark Twain and the legendary individualists of a bygone era Gramp Maple played by Charley Grapewin. To be sure the film doesn't explicitly paint Duke Mantee and his fellow gangsters as heroic saviors but it's clear where the film's sympathies lie.Ultimately The Petrified Forest is about an umbrella of misfits and their discontent with the repressive and exploitative American establishment and it's that pulse of iconoclasm that keeps it audacious and provocative after all these decades.".

	schema:headline " When Bette Davis Learned to Steal the Show . . .";
	schema:reviewBody ". . . it was when she was 27yo. and she stoled the lead from Leslie Howard a veteran actor by 1936 and Humphrey Bogart who landed the supporting actor role via Howard's petitions to Warner Bros..In the desert of the US Southwest Davis runs a desert diner and store owned by her dizzy daddy. Howard is a visiting vagrant writer on foot who stops in the diner to eat. After Davis waits on him they strike up an intense conversation. However the gangster Duke Mantee and his mob are making their way through the desert leaving a trail of blood behind them. Thus Bogie putting on a real thug act also enters the diner scene where almost the entire film is set.This was Davis and Howard's 2nd match up on the silver screen Of Human Bondage was their Oscarworthybutoverlooked 1st. Their screen chemistry was simply sensual and a true pleasure to absorb.Bogie's gangster character was nearly comical compared to Howard's philosophical and sophisticated wanderer. Davis played the young woman who has a talent for capturing the colorful desert scenes on canvass but wants to go abroad to France where her long lost mother is from and resides.Therefore Davis' character acts like a bridge between the two key men opposites Bogart and Howard. She's both street smart from having to run the desert diner and intellectual since she is an avid reader and artist.Given that this motion picture was filmed with sound barely beyond the silent years Davis' live stage experience shows  shows up Bogie by far. There would never be a time in the history of Davis and Bogart's five movies together when Bogart was ever able to command the lead away from Davis. However in Dark Victory Davis and Bogart did make a great love match.It was later during The Big Sleep when the 25yo Lauren Bacall and the 46yo Bogie brought out the very best in each other. So much so immediately after that film was made they were wed. It was to Davis' credit that she groomed Bogie into a better actor. He wouldn't be the last actor Davis groomed into greatness.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's really an unusual movie or to be more exact filmed stage play for its time. There's nothing unique about the situation. A gangster and his handful of hoods hole up in an isolated desert cafe with hostages of varying characters. But it's impressively written and handled deftly by the performers. There aren't that many movies in which I look forward to the appearance of Betty Davis but she's just fine here. The film is all the more surprising because the theme it treats is an old one  the replacement of the old and exhausted by the new and visionary. Cf. Shane for another example. It may have struck a more responsive chord with audiences of the early 1930s  that old and exhausted business. The rabid capitalism of the past must have seemed a little oldfashioned. When this was written income taxes were negligible and there was no social security. The robber barons were able to keep just about every nickel they could squeeze out of their nonunionized subordinates.There's a kind of robber baron in this movie too. A businessman with an expensive car a black chauffeur and a wife who doesn't love him. It's a bit stereotypical true but it's hard to overcome the necessity for sketching in a character with a few lines of dialogue without seeming lazy or preachy. About halfway through by the way his wife gives him hell for his selfishness. The two black characters the chauffeur and one of the gangsters are never referred to by their race. Both are highly individuated people and the one exchange between them is kind of funny. Bogart as Duke Mantee gives what is probably his most highly stylized performance. His menacing posture is that of someone who has recently suffered a stroke in the region of the cerebellum. He even speaks oddly  not his usual snappy lines but long drawnout ominous yet resigned to his fate. He seems to agree with Leslie Howard that they are washed up which is the reason he agrees to kill Howard who will then leave his insurance money to Betty Davis so she can return to France where she was born. It's Custer's last stand. And that forest is indeed petrified.There's a bit of philosophizing and poetry  but not enough to dull the narrative. And Villon is the perfect poet for Betty Davis. Not aristocratic or elegant a thief from the lower depths really but filled with passion. This is the end for which we twain are met. He could have been Davis leaving the petrified forest and involving herself in something most people would recognize as more grand. Howard has misspent his life. He's only written one book so he's obviously a failure. I didn't care for that remark too much since I've only written one book myself Fine Wines of Mississippi and nobody read it except my Mom and her only at gunpoint. So maybe Howard overplays the world weariness. But he and Bogart are the only two characters in the movie who seem to know what it's all about. The gangsters and the football player are airheads. Davis is full of dreams. The businessman thinks only of himself. His wife brims over with resentment. The old man is foolish and tells lies. Only Howard and Bogart see through everything.It's quite a good movie. It shows what you can do with some good actors a decent script and very little in the way of extravagant special effects or expensive location shooting. The windblown desert sets look the way windblown desert locations should and so seldom do. My advice? Siddown mug and watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A drifter is hitchhiking in the middle of Arizona's desert but the cars passing by him are as eager to stop as the tumbleweeds. The opening shot of The Petrified Forest reflects our very loneliness  we all have goals we all wander in our lives and we all depend on helpful people.The man makes it to a roadside diner to find people with seemingly purposeful lives. Gabby Maple played by Bette Davis is the owner's daughter a young idealistic servant killing time by painting reading French poetry and dreaming of visiting Bourges her mother's hometown. Her father Porter Hall who couldn't keep his warbride wife in USA spends time expressing an ironic bitterness toward anyone's bitter at his country. Dick Foran is Boze a former college football player who sees Gabby's heart as a trophy to win. And Grampa Charley Grapewin keeps bragging on his status as the one guy missed by Billy the Kid.The characters divide the world in two those who look at the future Boze and Gabby and those who remember the past angrily the father or enthusiastically Grampa. Generation is an important factor since the film is set during the Great Depression which more resonates as a state of mind what kind of future such a gloomy period can ever paint except for the younger generation who didn't live or merely the War? Gabby thinks of the Great War as the event she owed her existence to and the source of an existential quest. The mysterious voyager is Alan Squier as if Alan was a wording of Alone and with his dandy look and affable mannerisms he belongs to another era and since eras condition states of mind his is enigmatic. Indeed the man a writer played by a suave and wonderful Leslie Howard speaks in poetry and philosophy a failed artist who wasn't cut either for marital commitment. Alan's constant amazement hardly hides what he is deep inside a misfit an outcast and an intellectual malcontent. Yet his detachment gives him an undeniable aura he has no goal but is not turned to the past either. And if Gabby is enamored she doesn't want to marry either she just sees in him an invitation to escape.People with high hopes believe in their destiny what they wait for is a sign a little oddity that breaks up the morbid routine and enlighten moroseness with a light of hope. When Alan finally leaves mooching a car belonging to wealthy tourists the Chrisholms Paul Harvey and Genevieve Tobin you can see desperation in Gabby's eyes as if the only sparkle that could've her ignited it started to fade. But destiny didn't say its last word the passengers are carjacked and when they all join the diner they find a new guest  Duke Mantee.And it's one thing to have people blabbing about life and death their views are elevated to another dimension when their lives are endangered. Mantee will be the trigger so to speak to a series of selfrevelations. played by a youngish Humphrey Bogart Duke Mantee is less an imitation of gangsterlegend John Dillinger than Bogart's own approach to the role he played on the Broadway play a man so wornout so tired of being pursued by Police on having to keep his guard that he ended up walking slowly and carefully as if he was at the verge of starting a shootout. He's a living tickling bomb a man who's had enough. Even at 37 Bogart could illuminate the screen with tiredness combined with a savage reputation and the fact that he risks his life by waiting in the diner for a mysterious Doris. Mantee is not the immigrant gangster he's the quintessential romantic desperado with an attitude and a respect to the oldtimers. Gramps loves him immediately he's an authentic bandit and inevitably Mantee fascinates the hostages and there's more than Stockholm syndrome in that.There's an obvious identification between Duke and Alan both are from the past a vanishing breed one by not acting enough another by acting too much. Duke is the Yin to Alan's Yang and between them grows the genuine bonding of men who got nothing to lose inspiring among the hostages various reactions from various personalities Mr. Chrisholm tries to buy his freedom as if the usual rules were still applicable. Boze tries his luck but Duke neutralizes him he's the only to speak overtly against criminals but while he's right in the absolute in a life that became relative he missed many points. Mrs. Chrisholm wants to run away with Duke she exhorts Gabby to follow her dreams unlike her. Duke's presence is a conscience's catalyst.Duke incarnates a sort of a new order an escape from codes and conventions sometimes with positive results see how obedient the black chauffeur is contrarily to Slim Hope there's no segregation in gangster world since they reject everything from society the good as the bad. And even a bad action can deliver from a bad condition. Duke will give Alan's life a meaning. Alive he's useless but dead with his life insurance policy he can build Gabby's future. After all when Depression is caused by money maybe money is the solution? Since people are valued through their wealth so why not translate it into a generous sacrifice? Alan came to the end of his road to better start Gabby's. Their romance was doomed because Gabby's happiness depended on Alan's act but for the brief time it lasted it was magnificent.And if you don't believe it can happen keep in mind that without Howard's insistence to have Bogart playing his part Bogart's career would have fallen down. Bogart would be grateful for Howard who sadly passed away during World War II by calling his daughter Leslie. Howard was to Bogart what Duke was to Alan what Alan was to Gabby a lifechanging blessing.".

I also enjoyed the married couples side conversations  very comical and a refreshing change from the serious situation with the gangsters. Also loved the relationship between Betty Davis' character and her new love interest not a sappy love story at all. Very mature feelings on Leslie's character  he is pretty captivating.

In this film he is a lazy writer gone awry trying to live out his dreams in Bette Davis' character who is a painter.In a way he's totally opposite of Humphrey Bogart's Duke Mantee character and the dichotomy really is the justification of 'classic' given to this film.Bogart's and Davis' performances are just average in this film  although at the time of the release this was Bogart's best film. I think the old man  Charley Grapewin  and Genevieve Tobin as Mrs. Chisholm do a great job with their small parts. Tobin is also a very attractive lady! I enjoyed the banter between the two drivers as well both AfricanAmericans cast in a white movie at WB in '36. It's a shame they weren't given larger roles.Talky and melodramatic  and certainly unbelievable the middleofnowhere desert gas station is almost always FULL of people for starters this stagy yet classic film is not for everyone. Your kids will hate this film. But to me  this is good stuff. This is prototypical 1930's cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie version of Robert Sherwood's play The Petrified Forest is an oddity. An outstanding maybe even great film derived from a basically second rate work. Archie Mayo directs splendidly this story of a poetdrifter who literally walks into an eatery in the Arizona desert where he runs into a desperate Dillingeresque bad guy who holds him hostage and in the course of his captivity falls in love with a very naive young woman. Much of the dialogue is dated though clever and is written in the fauxLost Generation style popular in Broadway plays of the twenties and thirties which is to say there are hints of Fitzgerald and Hemingway in the attitudes expressed but little of their artistry and originality. As the drifter sensitive pipesmoking Leslie Howard has never been better or better cast one almost suspects that the role was written for him. Humphrey Bogart in his first good movie role is appropriately menacing he looks remarkably like John Dillinger and shows even at this stage of his career much of the charm and charisma that later propelled him to superstardom. Watch him closely he more than holds his own with Howard. Bette Davis is somewhat silly as the love interest this was not a good part for her. There are no demons for her to unleash in this shy schoolgirl and she seems at a loss as to how to play her. The supporting cast is superb down to the smallest bit player. Mayo and Company worked wonders with the desert set with its cacti tumbleweeds and air of rustling menace. We know it's not a real desert but it doesn't matter the state of mind is all. This is how the real desert would feel in the mind of such a man as Howard plays and this is all that matters. The shacklike eatery with its blinking barbeque sign is a great creation with its creaking floorboards and dry as sand tables and chairs one can almost smell the chili. Also the transition from day to night is exceedingly well done and quite subtle it just happens. You know it's dark outside without actually having to see the darkness just beyond the door. The feeling of stars and huge sky above is conveyed by dialogue only and is yet palpable nonetheless there in spirit if not fact. Inside the claustrophobia is wellmanaged even with several camera shifts there is a strong sense of confinemnt in the film. Mayo did a better job here with this threadbare wildly ambitious play than Wyler ever did with much better material and I'm not sure why. Mayo's career drifted downward in the late thirties and forties and of his later work the less said the better. But in 1936 he proved that with great actors outstanding cameramen and art directors small miracles could be wrought right on the Warner Brothers back lot and for a while at least the desert bloomed.".

We see this clearly in The Petrified Forest. Robert E. Sherwood's classic long running Broadway stage play in 1935. It's significant in giving stage  sometimes screen actor Humphrey Bogart his first very successful major role. Night after night audiences were stunned by Bogart's performance as the notorious John Dillinger style outlaw Duke Mantee. The play was such a success that Warner Bros. acquired the property in 1936  adapted it to the big screen. Leslie Howard  Bette Davis  most of the other actors were asked to repeat their stage roles except for Bogart. Warners wanted Edward G. Robinson for the role of Duke Mantee but Howard insisted on Bogart or he would not do the film. The studio gave in to Leslie Howard  film history was made giving Humphrey Bogart his first notable major film role. It's hard to picture anyone else for the role of Duke Mantee. This is not a gangster film it's more of a thought provoking philosophical drama of real people looking for meaning  purpose  dreaming of something better.The story is essentially about a wandering poet Alan Squire Leslie Howard aimlessly gallivanting in the desert  eventually comes to a remote  desolate gas stationrestaurant  diner named the BARBQ in black mesa Arizona. He strikes a friendship with waitress Gabrielle Maple Bette Davis an artist dreaming of living in France but is repressed  stuck. Alan belongs to a vanishing breed of intellectuals  brains without purpose  is looking for something to believe in  something worth living  dying for. He feels obsolete in a world that no longer has a place for him. The 2 find common ground with poetry. But it's not just about these 2 characters there is Jason Maple Porter Hall the proprietor who's dissatisfied with his life  finds some fulfillment as a member of a patriotic group called The Blackhorse Vigilantee's. There's Gramp Maple Charly Grapewin who reminisces's of the old days of Billy The Kid.There's the exfootball jock Boze Dick Foran who pumps gas. There is the rich couple Mr. Mrs. Chisholm Paul Harvey  Genevieve Tobin who have an empty loveless marriage. And the 2 black characters Joseph the chauffeur John Alexander  Slim Slim Thompson one of Duke Mantee's henchmen. Joseph the chauffeur is the familiar stereotypical servant a yes man  is subservient  obedient  only speaks when he is spoken to. Slim on the other hand is the complete opposite  is very liberated individual  marches to the beat of his own drum  is never afraid to open his mouth  speak his mind. He is equal to the rest of the other white henchmen. Something that was not usually seen in movies in the 1930's.The film strikes a common chord  most everyone can relate to these people.They all have a story to tell  they all seem trapped in their own built in prisons. Even Duke Mantee as threatening  menacing  frightening  commanding as he is while holding the others hostage in a grip of fear he is also trapped  there is a sense of doom  futility about him. The only ones that seem content are Joseph Slim  Gramp Maple who admires  welcomes the presence of the Duke as he sees him as some kind of a colorful character  savior. Even some of the others are fascinated by him as he is the embodiment of lawlessness individuality  freedom. America always respects  prizes liberty  rugged individualism.As Gramp Maple says he ain't no gangster gangsters are foreigners he's an American. Even the rich wife Mrs. Chisholm Genevieve Tobinis drawn in  asks the Duke to take her along as she is bored  miserable with her pillar of the mortgage loan  trust banker husband.The Duke like Squire is also obsolete as his kind of celebrated outlaw folk hero's have drawn to a close. The public had a fascination for these kind of outlaws in the 1930's like John Dillinger Baby Face Nelson Pretty Boy Floyd Bonnie  Clyde Ma Barker etc at a time when the banks  government had failed the people. By 1936 these celebrated outlaws were being replaced by new hero's  champions of law  order. The interplay between Squire  Mantee is interesting as they have a mutual respect  seem to understand each other. Even during the violent shootout between the gangsters  the police the movie still retains it's philosophical poetic stance. Leslie Howard  Bette Davis are the stars but to modern audiences Bogarts philosophical gangster steals the picture. Who would you rather watch ??The Petrified Forest is a very unusual movie that embraces several elements  genre's  is most significant  memorable for establishing Bogart's career paving the way to his eventual stardom in 1941 in High Sierra  The Maltese Falcon. Roy Earle Sam Spade  Rick all owe something to Duke Mantee for this is really where it all began for Humphrey Bogart. Even though he was in films since 1930 like in Up The River. Bogart's next significant film was made the same year in Black Legion a social drama dealing with racism. Also directed by Archie Mayo  with some of the same cast. Bogart recreated the Duke Mantee role in 1940 in a short radio broadcast  also in 1955 on television. The Petrified Forest is a timeless classic philosophical drama that makes you think about what's important  the difference between living life  just merely existing  no longer functioning. Highly recommended !".

There are no limits no censorship only ideas which are always valid so long as the public ceases to be the public and becomes part of the show swept by surprise fear tears or laughter.";

Alfredo the main character is just a boy who loves theatre he doesn't want to become a big movie star nor a stage star. He doesn't want even to make money by acting. So he decides to create an independent street theatre company with some of his partners from the Art School. The movie isn't based on a true story but it certainly looks like it was We can see all the characters 30 years after the company was created talking about it. Just like if it was a documentary. It does not matter that much if the performances of Alfredo and his crew aren't too brilliant because that's not what this film is about. You don't have to live in Spain to comprehend the point of this movie as the previous commentator suggests. Just take a look around and see how everything in art's been prostituted. That's what this film is about. About not giving in about fighting the establishment. Although the final sequence clearly shows us that the establishment cannot be beaten. Sad but true. Noviembre is one of the more brilliant Spanish films that I've recently seen. I highly recommend you to watch it. Nevermind if you're Spanish northAmerican or German...".

Noviembre has caused many things to change in my brain and my way of thinking about art. Art should be something that people express freely and in any kind of form or way they want.I thought the scenes in the streets when they were acting were incredible. The end of the movie is very rough and harsh. If you ever see itbe prepared to cry in the end or at least be very touched by the meaning of it. If you have not lived in European countries it is more difficult to understand it. In factall the bad comments that I have read about this movie were made by non Hispanic andor non European people.So please all of youjust open your mind to new and different things.Make sure that you think twice about the true meaning of this movie before you say plenty of bad things about it.To me everything was greatrealistic for the way Spain was at the time and entertaining.".

Very much like Into the Void in documentary form the story is told by alternating between the main story line and the interviewtype narration of the characters some years later about a half dozen of them compared with 2 in Into the Void. But hang on for a second..these character are not real! The story is entirely fictional but made to look like a documentary.The story starts with young actor Alfredo arriving in Madrid for adventure in the late 90s which makes the 'now' in the movie somewhere in the 2030s or 2040s guessing from the age of the 'real' characters interviewed. There he meets Lucia who soon becomes his wife. When discussing their initial motivation for acting Alfred intimates that it's to a large extent out of love for his wheelchairconfined brother from both physical handicap and mental disorder. Lucia on the other hand attributes it to sibling rivalry kind of the 'Baby Jane' syndrome.Together with a group of friends who share the same passion for acting the two embark on their venture. The unique thing is that in their vision to bring the theatre to the public they shun any indoor performance venue which would imply an admission ticket. They do all their performances outdoors right in the streets and they steadfastly refuse to accept any money for their performances. The movie follows this group's performances which are presented in pseudodocumentary style complete with fictitious dates in the streets of Madrid culminating in a unexpected and quite devastating ending. Between hilarity and poignancy and everything in between this movie has a great deal to offer. A fascinating movie particularly if you love performing arts. It won the FIPRESCI prize in the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival.".

Maybe to audiences in Spain it might resonate or at least given the publicity surrounding some of its most daring pieces they could bring a proximity which to me seemed illusive at best.First of all the group as I gathered was active in Madrid in the past. We see Alfredo organizing his troupe of actors then we are given glimpses of some of their work in the center of the city. The director brings another dimension by adding an explanation as to why things worked or didn't and its ultimate demise by presenting actors mostly in their 50s or older talking directly to the camera telling us about their experiences when they were young. If we are to believe them it would have put the action as having taken place in the 60s in a Spain where Franco still dominated and most of the actions of the Noviembre group would not have occurred and not in the recent past. If the director wanted to add this sort of device he would have achieved more reality by presenting the same actors we see throughout the film as part of the Noviembre group doing the explanations.Some of the Noviembre theater pieces aren't even interesting! One wonders what was the big deal about them. Maybe the fact that it was never done in Spain? In other western countries where street performances happen on a daily basis these performances they did seem very tame and pointless. Only their piece about the assault to apparently innocent bystanders have any real punch the rest doesn't amount to much.Unfortunately this Spanish film seems to have been made for only a few that knew the in joke not for the rest of us outside of Spain.".

Even if it is pretentious or selfimportant or whatever 'artsy masturbation' means this film goes well outside the dull predictable mainstream  at least in its ambition if not farther. But not in a Warhol kind of way. It had something to say.

Their older tenyearold son Elias is being bullied at school until he is defended by Christian a new boy who has just moved from London with his father Claus. Christian's mother recently lost her battle with cancer and Christian is greatly troubled by her death.

As is customary the Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language film finally makes it to Dallas in April AFTER the awards show is long forgotten well except for the halfassed hosting job by James Franco. Denmark's entry directed by Susanne Bier Things We Lost in the Fire is overflowing with every human emotion one can imagine. However the battle between two emotions is most prevalent misplaced revenge and forgiveness.At it's core this is a story of two fathers and two sons. The presentation is quite odd in that it tries desperately to tie in all spectrum of human emotion and economic standing. Anton Mikael Persbrandt from the excellent 2008 Everlasting Moments travels back and forth between an African refugee camp where he serves as a doctor and his upscale Denmark home where he is separated from his wife and trying to set a good example for his son Elias Markus Rygaard.The other father is Claus Ulrich Thomsen whose relationship with his son Christian William Johnk Nielsen is flat out terrible. Christian's mother has recently lost her battle with cancer and it has caused a rift between these two ... and lit a fire of anger in young Christian.Soon enough Christian stumbles upon Elias being bullied at school. His flaming temper sets the bully straight with a violent act creating a bond between Elias and Christian. Sadly Christian continues to spin off axis and he drags Elias along.As a doctor in the camp Anton constantly strives to repair the despicable acts of the local town bully. This is used to contrast with what's going on with his own son at home. There are many parts of the film that are difficult to watch especially as Christian just loses his grip on reality.While I certainly see the excellence in the film I believe the filmmakers tried too hard to stage the contrast. The story of the boys was plenty powerful enough to carry a film. Also the doctor in the camp could have made a chilling movie on it's own. Instead we gets bits of each and that's fine ... just not what it might have been.".

	schema:reviewBody "After his mother's death Christian moves once again and starts in a new school. He meets Elias and defends him against bullies. The latter's father works as a doctor in Africa with a sadistic crime lord nearby. And so we have the setting for a drama exploring revenge as well as power struggles loss and fear. The overall moral isn't going to surprise anyoneand it isn't entirely consistent and this does occasionally stoop to a clich. However it remains a gripping and effective film and it manages to interject a lot of insight and truth seeing situations from multiple different perspectives. This is the second movie by Bier that I watch and I am confirmed in my assertion that Things We Lost in The Fire was a fluke and not representative of her level of talentit should be noted that the main problem with that one was the script and she had nothing to do with that. She abandons the eyeball shots and there is much rejoicing. The camera is close at times though no longer oppressively so. This has a cinematography similar to the show NCIS with handheld cameras. I didn't feel like the nature footage added anything at least not that of Denmark. The editing puts you right there without being annoying or particularly drawing attention to itself. This is written by the man behind Den Du Frygter Mrke and Blinkende Lygterand other famous ones but those are the ones I've seen and liked and his skill and credible human charactersthat are the focus shines through. Everything is set up and most of it pays off. The acting is excellent without exception the kids especially. Our halfway orphaned lead captures every look and movement to perfection and they really did find someone who could be Thomsen's son. Bodnia returns to a typecast role for him and delivers. The vast majority of the humor works and nearly none of it detracts from the serious and important subject. Everyone can recognize the little brother in someone they do or have known. The music is appropriate and not distracting. Dialog is great. No soap opera moments it all comes across as entirely genuine and nothing comes out of the blue. The tone is mature and honest we don't feel preached to or lectured this respects its audience and honestly understands what it has to say it isn't merely repeating a mantra. There is gorethink ER and disturbing content in this. I recommend it to anyone that this at all appeals to. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "In A Better World is yet another great film directed by the talented Susanna Bier. In this film the characters deal with many ethical dilemmas and general life issues. The film deals with issues such as revenge divorce death and other things that people deal with daily. The three main characters Christian Elias and Anton deal with these issues differently and each have to figure out their beliefs throughout the film.Christian is a young boy who loses his mother early in the film. He moves to a new town in Denmark after living internationally for many years. At his new school he meets Elias and they become good friends. Christian has a lot of anger built up from his mother's death and takes it out very violently. He carries around a knife and knows how to make a bomb. While he only uses this violence against people that he believes deserve it he definitely takes things too far. This brings up the main theme of the film revenge which is also the meaning of the Danish title of the movie Hvnen. Christian pulls a knife out on another boy who is bullying Elias. The boy deserved to be stood up to but the knife is pretty extreme for young boys. He then convinces Elias to help him bomb a car owned by a man who was rude to Elias's father Anton. Yet again this is crossing the line. Eventually Christian learns his lesson but this shows the struggles of a young boy lost from losing a parent figure and living in an unstable environment.Elias is dealing with divorced parents and bullies. He loves his father very much but he is usually working abroad in Africa. He befriends Christian who teaches him to stand up for himself. As their relationship grows Elias's values become more and more unclear because of his new friend's influence. It is typical for people to be pushed into situations that make them uncomfortable by the people around them especially at a young age. Bier does a good job of portraying this common issue and the story is very moving. We know all along that Elias is a nice person and that he knows that he should not be carrying around a knife or bombing cars but he also has been pushed around for years and is excited to have a friend and to be able to stand up for himself. Without the guidance of his father he loses track of his values until things go too far. People often lose track of their values as they meet more people and experience things like divorce and Elias is a great example of that. Even people who are good at heart make mistakes but it is possible to learn your lesson and be reminded of yourself.Anton Elias's father is a good example of the ethical issues that adults have to deal with. He is going through a divorce caused by his own extramarital relationship yet he is still in love with his wife. Meanwhile he is working as a doctor in Africa making it hard to be a good father and to get his wife back. While in Africa the man causing all of the terror for his patients comes to him for help. Anton must decide whether he wants to help this man who has done many terrible things or if he can deal with letting him die. Tying the larger world into the lives of the characters in the film is something that Susanna Bier is very good at. This is an interesting way of making films and adds more to the stories of the characters. Africa is a big part of Anton's life and it is hard for him to distance himself from that life while at the same time it is hard for him to be away from his life at home. Finding that balance while keeping his morals in tact is Anton's main issue. What he is doing in Africa is extremely admirable but it gets in the way of raising his son and impacts their lives very much. In A Better World is not only very entertaining and beautifully filmed and scripted but it forces the viewers to question their own actions and choices. Susanna Bier succeeds at creating a film that is both pleasing to watch and an extremely meaningful experience. She has created yet another beautiful and powerful movie that everyone can relate to. In another director's hands the plot might seem a little bit extreme but she makes it work. The characters are not only relatable but also very complicated and easy to become attached to. Overall I would definitely suggest this film to anyone looking for a meaningful moviewatching experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "'IN A BETTER WORLD' Three and a Half Stars Out of Five This Danish drama won Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards as well as the 2011 Golden Globe. It deals with violence in Denmark among children when two ten year olds meet at school and form an unhealthy alliance against bullies. The film was titled 'Haevnen' in Danish which means 'The Revenge'. It was directed by Susanne Bier and written by Anders Thomas Jensen. It stars Swedish actor Mikael Persbrandt and some of the film is spoken in Swedish as well as English as well as Trine Dyrholm Ulrich Thomsen William Johnk Nielsen and Markus Rygaard. I found the film interesting and well made but not nearly as good as all the critical acclaim and accolades it's gotten.The film focuses on a boy named Elias Rygaard who is constantly picked on and abused by bullies at his school in Denmark. His father Anton Persbrandt is a doctor who works at a refugee camp in Africa and is constantly commuting back and forth. Anton and Elias's mother Marianne Dyrholm have not been getting along and are contemplating a divorce. Elias's younger brother has not been effected by this as much as he has but his parent's problems combined with the bullying at school has caused a lot of emotional problems for Elias. When a new kid named Christian Nielsen moves to town with his father Claus Thomsen from London Elias finally finds a good friend and someone he can relate to. Christian having just lost his mother to cancer has psychological issues of his own and is eager to help Elias with his problems. They first get revenge on the main bully picking on Elias at school in a somewhat brutal way but when Anton is assaulted by another father their ideas for revenge turn much more dangerous.I could really relate to the outcast elements of the film and the issues of dealing with bullying and finding that one friend you can really relate to but I didn't understand the depression issues that pushed the kids towards violence so easily. I've read that's part of the film's point exploring how little it takes before a child  or an adult  thinks something is deeply unjust as said by Bier herself according to Wikipedia. In that way the film works but I couldn't really find it relatable. For a film to really work for me it has to strike certain emotions and I have to connect with it in some kind of way either emotionally or on a pure entertainment level and this film didn't do that for me as well made as it is. The acting directing and writing are all more than adequate but in my opinion it's far from a great film.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vUUMkZYiXwNQ".

For a film to really work for me it has to strike certain emotions and I have to connect with it in some kind of way either emotionally or on a pure entertainment level and this film didn't do that for me as well made as it is. The acting directing and writing are all more than adequate but in my opinion it's far from a great film.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vUUMkZYiXwNQ";

	schema:reviewBody "In a Better World is a film that lives up more strongly to its English title than its Danish title. It is an accomplished film that elegantly introduces the moral conflicts we battle internally. At one point I became increasingly frustrated with what seemed to be cowardice thinly veiled by pacifist propaganda  particularly during the scene between the Doctor and the mechanic where he is repeatedly slapped in the face. Perhaps the reason why this scene in particular makes me cringe is because culturally I react to the notion than to be slapped in the face is perhaps even more offensive than being punched. A fist to the face is an assertion of one's pride whereas a slap in the face is interpreted as a deliberate act of humiliation.But as the story unravels you realize all prior scenes  particularly that one  set up and elevate the effect of what is a redeeming powerful yet nostalgic ending. The female lead delivers the most heart breaking performance in the film but the most note worthy are those delivered by the children who seem to have full grasp of the sophisticated storyline at their young age. The director clearly has instructed them to deliver the pain felt by their characters in a convincing way without the need to reduce them in intellect as many other filmmakers often feel inclined to do with child roles. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is intrigued by international films  start here.".

	schema:reviewBody "To put it simply IN A BETTER WORLD is about revenge. And we see this form of behavior happening all over the place so its theme couldn't be more relevant today. Al Qaeda bombed the World Trade Center in New York so the US attacked Afghanistan and Iraq. Israelis attacked the Palestinians. Palestinians attacked back. Indians attacked the Pakistanis. Pakistanis attacked back. And on and on it goes. The important question that is raised in IN A BETTER WORLD is How far should you go when someone does you wrong? It is important to defend yourself when someone attacks you. This is what happened in IN A BETTER WORLD. At the beginning of the film a bully picked on a weakling named Elias. The bully called him names and pushed him around. His friend Christian was horrified by Elias not standing up for himself so he took it upon himself to defend Elias. This is a recurring behavior of Christian throughout the movie. If a person did him or someone else wrong then he sought revenge. He did this with his father by accusing him of not loving his mother. He did this with a mechanic who struck Elia's father. And as I said before he did it with the bully who picked on Elias. Why does Christian have this vengeful nature? It could all stem to his mother's death. He probably felt cheated out that his mother died at a young age so he is now filled with hate and revenge. And if he sees any kind of injustice in the world he fights back. The problem with Christian's thinking is that it's impossible to fight all the injustices in the world without incurring some consequences. And some of those consequences are horrible. Unfortunately Christian has to learn this lesson the hard way. So how far should you go when someone does you wrong? Go and see IN A BETTER WORLD to find out. Highly recommended.".

The victims that come into his ramshackle hospital are suffering from all kinds of maladies including pregnant women who are the target of one of those soulless criminals roaming the devastated country. Anton is appalled by the conditions he must work but he keeps his good work even in conditions that might endanger his own lie.The second narrative concentrates on a young boy Christian seen eulogizing his dead mother who has died too young from cancer. His grief stricken father Claus decides to bring the boy home to Denmark where he is going to stay with his grandmother. Claus wanted to give Christian a normal life in the small community they live. Trouble finds Christian though. His first day of school is marked when he finds a bully making fun of Elias a boy that would not fight to defend himself from the older and stronger boy tormenting him.Fate has Christian and Elias to be seated together in the same classroom. The boys bond right away. Christian is troubled by the fact the bully seems to get away with murder he decides to put an end to the constant ridiculing and taunting of the weaker Elias. One day Christian has the opportunity to give his due to the bigger boy by beating with a bicycle pump which could have gravely harmed the boy. Marianne Elias' mother and Claus are called by the school counselors to see if they can solve the problem at hand. A truce is agreed by all parties.Marianne a doctor has been separated from Anton who comes home periodically to be near his two sons. One day while walking with his boys and Christian he runs into a bullying situation himself when Lars an aggressive mechanic comes running to where Anton and the boys have been standing believing they had done something to his car. Anton a non violent man decides not to fight the aggressor thinking perhaps he will teach the kids a lesson in how not to confront the man. Christian does not take the situation lightly. He begins to plot to do something to avenge the injury caused to his friend's father while taking care of Lars in some way or another.In a Better World by Susanne Bier the Danish director poses a lot of moral questions for the audience. The more mature Anton having lived among violence realizes his attacker is an imbecile. Christian on the other hand is a child that is grieving deeply a death he does not accept much less understands. Christian has a good sense of righteousness believing mistakenly in the adage 'an eye for an eye'. As he did with Elias Christian decides to take care of Lars in a way he can but his actions unfortunately almost killed his friend Elias who wanted no part in the plan to harm Lars.The screenplay by Anders Thomas Jensen deals in the contrast between the violent world where Anton must work and the peaceful Danish setting where everything should have been peaceful and serene. Unfortunately not all is quiet in the place where decency should be the prevailing factor in the community. There are layers of violence even in the least expected places. Taking the law into one's hands is also wrong but in Christian's troubled mind the events around him make him think differently.The feat of Ms. Bier is in the way she manages to get good performances from her excellent cast. Michael Persbrandt does justice to his Anton a man with a clear conscience and clear vision of humanity. The young actor William Johnk Nielsen is a revelation as the suffering Christian. This young man shows excellent promise. Trine Dyrholm has good moments as Marianne the concerned mother who wants to protect Elias from the bullying at school. Elias is played with conviction by Markus Rygaard. Johan Soderqvist the cinematographer captures the Danish and Kenyan locales in clear images. The music score by Morten Soborg adds another layer of texture to the film. Another good film to be added to Ms. Bier's excellent career.".

The topic here is vengeance and its consequences more or less. I was a little surprised to find it had been directed by a woman Susanne Bier. I've always thought women would be good at this kind of near melodrama but have never actually seen one tackle such a project to my knowledge. The story centers around two boys and their developing reaction to first school house bullying but then a much more serious instance of it in their home life. The acting is beautifully done and none of the leads seem to have held back in the slightest. One dad is a doctor who it appears donates his services to a part of Africa wrought with violence. Despite his obvious good nature he and his wife also a doctor are having problems.It's unusual in my experience to have a woman show just how much more selfless a man might be than his wife but that is exactly what is done here. And it's quite refreshing. But the sweep and breadth of this movie is quite satisfying on its own spanning from Africa to modern day Denmark. This is a trip I wouldn't hesitate recommending to anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is recommended.For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.Isaac NewtonTwo Danish families worlds apart in their ideologies and circumstances come together in Suzanne Bier's Oscar winning foreign film In A Better World. Screenwriter Anders Thomas Jensen takes two parallel stories about parallel lives that converge. Although the screenplay doesn't consistently mesh the duality of its concept with scenes of African turmoil in sharp contrast with idyllic Danish villages it does provide thought provoking mediation about the subject of revenge and its impact on violence death and daytoday hardships faced by some minorities in our global realm.Family No. 1 Anton Mikael Persbrandt a Swedish doctor who works in Sudan treating victim of war crimes tries to be a principled and ethical pacifist an idealist lost in an ungodly world. He confronts conflict at work and in his private life as his marriage to Marianne Trine Dyrholm is floundering. His son Elias Markus Rygaard is dealing with bullying at school and his parents' possible divorce at home.Family No. 2 Claus Ulrich Thomsen a recently widowed and grieving father and his son Christian William Johnk Nielsen who blames his father for his mother's death and cannot adapt to the loss of his mother. Both troubled souls move from London to start a better life.When Christian defends Elias from the school bully both boys become instant friends and begin a dysfunctional bonding to survive a world that they perceive as riddled with injustice. Later an disturbing incident occurs between Anton and another parent which triggers the two boys into righting a wrong in a most extreme way. No longer wanted to be victims they instead become the oppressors.Complex issues abound in this film. At some point each character's action causes an act of retribution a penalty for their misconduct but not always the most deserving of punishments. In this unfair world of ours the turning of a cheek may result in injury rather than reward. Karma is at work and actions decide our fate. We witness the ill treatment of people victimized with global acts of mistreatment and persecution in each country and are unprepared for the film's stark reality. It is the universal atrocities that prevails in our lives that rankles the core of this film and give the film its undeniable power.This is definitely a Message Movie with a capital M although sometimes the message is a mixed blessing becoming a sermon at the pulpit in Bier's skillful hands. The scenes from Africa seem a bit heavyhanded and just don't correlate with the majority of the more interesting story set in Denmark. It also becomes a tad melodramatic in the end.

The acting especially the young actors is exceptional.In A Better World could have been a better film if the story would have concentrated more with the family dynamics and the psychological effects that compound a child's indefensible adult world.

	onyx:emotionText "This film is recommended.For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.Isaac NewtonTwo Danish families worlds apart in their ideologies and circumstances come together in Suzanne Bier's Oscar winning foreign film In A Better World. Screenwriter Anders Thomas Jensen takes two parallel stories about parallel lives that converge. Although the screenplay doesn't consistently mesh the duality of its concept with scenes of African turmoil in sharp contrast with idyllic Danish villages it does provide thought provoking mediation about the subject of revenge and its impact on violence death and daytoday hardships faced by some minorities in our global realm.Family No. 1 Anton Mikael Persbrandt a Swedish doctor who works in Sudan treating victim of war crimes tries to be a principled and ethical pacifist an idealist lost in an ungodly world. He confronts conflict at work and in his private life as his marriage to Marianne Trine Dyrholm is floundering. His son Elias Markus Rygaard is dealing with bullying at school and his parents' possible divorce at home.Family No. 2 Claus Ulrich Thomsen a recently widowed and grieving father and his son Christian William Johnk Nielsen who blames his father for his mother's death and cannot adapt to the loss of his mother. Both troubled souls move from London to start a better life.When Christian defends Elias from the school bully both boys become instant friends and begin a dysfunctional bonding to survive a world that they perceive as riddled with injustice. Later an disturbing incident occurs between Anton and another parent which triggers the two boys into righting a wrong in a most extreme way. No longer wanted to be victims they instead become the oppressors.Complex issues abound in this film. At some point each character's action causes an act of retribution a penalty for their misconduct but not always the most deserving of punishments. In this unfair world of ours the turning of a cheek may result in injury rather than reward. Karma is at work and actions decide our fate.

	schema:headline " Danish director's meditation on vigilante justice is well taken but feelgood denouement doesn't quite ring true";
	schema:reviewBody "In a Better World the Academy's 2011 Best Foreign Film winner is Danish director Susanne Bier's meditation on vigilante justice. The focus is on two children Elias and Christian who develop antisocial tendencies due to problems going on with troubled parents at home.Elias's father Anton a Swedish doctor is separated from his mother Marianne after she discovers he's been having an affair with another woman. Anton spends a good deal of time working as a physician in a Doctors Without Borders refugee camp in Sudan. Christian's father Claus has just moved the family back to Denmark from London following the death of his wife. Christian blames Claus for lying to him that his mother would get well and also accuses him of wishing that she would die in the later stages of her illness.The bulk of the plot involves Christian befriending Elias at the local school after Elias is subject to severe bullying by classmates particularly one Sofus Elias's main tormentor. Christian metes out vigilante justice to Sofus beating him with a pipe and putting a knife to his throat. Christian clearly realizes the school authorities will do nothing to stop the bullies under their charge and their impotence is reflected in Marianne's complaints to the school administrators who she blames for doing nothing to stop the violence. Biers asks at this point should we admire Christian for taking the law into his own hands to prevent further violence or is his use of a knife a troubling portent of things to come?Sure enough a second incident leads to escalating tension and violence. When Anton separates his younger son from another bullying child in a playground the bullying child's father a gruff car mechanic threatens Anton upset that Elias' father touched his son in his effort to separate the two brawling children. Anton won't take the bait and get into a physical confrontation with the car mechanic. Christian convinces Elias that his father is a wimp for not physically confronting the car mechanic and in a more sinister turn hatches a plot to blow up the car mechanic's van with a pipe bomb. Perhaps the most engaging aspect of Beer's narrative is the portrait of the more than troubled Christian whose demeanor rivals older individuals who engage in psychopathic behavior. Indeed the steely Christian played by an excellent William Jhnk Juels Nielsen truly comes off as a despicable and scary youngster reminiscent of some of the sinister characters hatched in American high schools responsible for mass killings.When Elias is hurt during the pipe bomb blast of the car mechanic's car Christian's outlook takes an unlikely turn where he blames himself for his friend's injury to the point where he's on the verge of suicide it takes some quick thinking on Anton's part to find the boy and save him.Meanwhile back at the refugee camp Beers argues that there are limits to pacifism. A local warlord blamed for a slew of atrocities amongst the populace shows up with his machine gun toting thugs and demand that Anton treat a severe case of gangrene which has affected his leg. When the warlord claims responsibility for sexually abusing one of the women whom Anton has been treating in his makeshift hospital Anton has had enough drags the man outside where a mob of local villagers beat him to death. The scene doesn't quite work as the warlord's confederates seem to shrink away and allow the angry mob to do their boss in.While Ms. Beers' nuanced exploration of vigilantism may lead one down a path of troubling cognitive dissonance for the viewer her decision to tie the overall narrative up with an unlikely happy ending is not a good one. Indeed I had a hard time buying that Christian would suddenly become a respectable member of the community given the slippery slope he had already gone down. Are psychopaths so easily redeemed? I think not. And some of the other feelgood resolutions also felt a little too pat Elias' miracle recovery and the reconciliation between Anton and Marianne. In a Better World raises troubling questions about vigilante justice and features some excellent performances particularly from the two child protagonists. Nonetheless director Beers' denouement unfortunately is not consistent with her earlier tale of alarming psychopathy run amok.".

	schema:headline " Tragedy can bring people together.";
	schema:reviewBody "Why does it take tragedy to bring people together? By the end of this movie this was the only question that stuck in my mind. Many of the central Ideas which surrounded this movie all lead back to tragedy. Although some tragedies were more drastic than others they were all substantial enough to affect one's life. It was as if tragedy was a revolving door.This movie had a very cinematic feel to it. Within its budget at least. The camera angles shifts at certain points in the movie which seems to be on purpose. I noticed that the camera would stay still until it is focusing on one person. When it is a face shot of single person then the camera starts to sway back and forth a little bit. You could feel the tension amongst the characters in the movie when the camera did this. In one particular scene actually the only scene I remember this happening in Christian finds some fireworks with gun powder in them. As he turns towards Elias to explain what he found the camera dramatically zooms in on Christian. What is weird about this though is that it doesn't zoom straight to his face the camera zooms in but is still far enough to see his body. It was as if there was no point to this technique besides making the viewer anxious to wonder what is about to happen.The actors that stood out in this movie were the two young boys. Elias and Christian both reminded me of the movie The good son In the good soon a young boy goes to stay with his aunt and uncle. Throughout this movie the little boy realizes that his cousin is crazy and is trying to bring him along to do bad things with him. While both of the boys seem as though they are friends Christian was turning Elias into a parent's worse nightmare. Christian was a character that I could relate to seeing that I have had many friends with troubled past. I felt sorry for him but if I had kids I would not want them hanging around him. Elias on the other hand I really felt sorry for. His character actually made me feel sorry for him. Whenever I see bullying I am not sure how to handle it and the bullying that took place in this movie actually felt real.Not being a fan of Dogme 95 I felt that this movie had a feel to it that was very Dogme 95'ish. I really enjoyed this movie and I know that it was obvious that it was done with a professional camera and broke many of the Dogme 95 rules it could have easily been done within the context of Dogme 95. I enjoyed this movie though because it had a cinematic feel to it but it was not a blockbuster movie. I am not sure how big the budget it must not have been very large there was only a few areas in which the movie took place and there was only one car explosion. I really enjoy movies such as this that are very simple but very complex at the same time. It's very Complex in the sense of the story.Tying together the stories of each characters battle at this point in their lives the director did a good job blending all these stories together as well as keeping it clean so I was able to follow each characters life without being confused. If there was a message in this movie I believe that it was life goes on. And while life is going on you have to make the best of it. It was important as an audience to know that and if you go back and watch the movie again you will understand that. This movie was put together very well. It was a movie that can bring people together I believe. It is also a movie that can make someone believe again if they are having troubles in their lives.".

	schema:headline " Revenge forgiveness realities and a solid film";
	schema:reviewBody "This film delves into the depth of emotion without becoming over dramatic and though the film parallels Bier's other film After the Wedding it portrays these emotions with less drama and more poignant realism. Everyone is familiar with the darker workings of childhood social groups and how they can become either dangerous or beneficial and in this case a complex interplay of both. There were few scenes in the film that made decisions look easy which in addition to the filming style created a lot of realism in the film. Though some say the moral stories aren't new the way the children are confronted with adult issues make a much more multifaceted situation. The main moral question of revenge versus forgiveness Bier's Dogma reminiscent techniques and her use of parallel stories make for a realistic view of these two families interacting. Interacting is definitely an understatement in classic Bier style emotions intensify as the plot moves on. She deals with serious issues and negative affect which is both brave and hard to watch. Though troubling to experience the story was powerful enough to make viewers consider their own lives. While not everyone's experiences are to the extreme as in In a Better World the basic situations are relatable to almost everyone. With her Dogma 95 reminiscent style the filmmaking itself relates a realistic tone the usually handheld camera and shots of characters' faces full on make the film feel more like the viewer is seeing something real that happened. The gruesome violent and shocking scenes to me did not feel excessive. It was clear that the director aimed to portray real life horrors not shock audiences in the way of a horror movie. The views of the wounds inflicted on the Africans were shudderworthy but I know there are realities like that in life and those people were lucky to see a skilled doctor. The violent beating of the bully at the school with the bike pump was cringe inducing and realistic enough to be truly uncomfortable to watch which has a Dogma like feel. It is awful to watch but there is some consolation in the knowledge that the bully won't bother them again. The way Christian took the revenge too far in his attempt to assert his power definitely foreshadowed his actions later in the plot.The worlds of Africa and Denmark shown parallel to one another to emphasize the universality of the big questions Bier asks of her audience. When is revenge just and when is it taken too far? The juxtaposition of the doctor treating a man guilty of atrocious crimes and a young boy willing to blow up a van to revenge his friend's dad after getting slapped around by Lars is quite striking. One can somewhat understand the doctor's decision to protect all life until the man starts making terrible comments about the dead girl so when he turns the man over to the furious community it feels as though justice has finally come to such a man. After this is shown and Christian convinces Elias to make a bomb the horror of the situation is obvious. When Elias almost dies to save innocent people the clarity of the bad decisions is crystal clear and the viewer just hopes that everyone lives long enough to forgive and move on. The happy ending felt a tiny bit forced but in the same breath I will say that if the film ended with the death of a child it would be needlessly depressing. She makes her points clear without putting the audience though emotional trauma.The theme outside revenge was the fatherson relationship. One relationship is happy overall the father is absent often to be a surgeon in Africa with a happy fatherson relationship. The other is more filled with angst because the mother died recently and Christian blames his father for it which becomes the catalyst for most of the film's action. The fathers in Africa mourning the loss of their pregnant wives also play into those roles even across the world the parental love shines through. Honestly there were many things to get out of this film of deep emotional and moral significance but it also reinforced how terrifying the prospect of parenting is. You not only have to keep it alive you also have to care for their delicate emotional health or they might make a bomb and almost blow their best friend to smithereens. I digress Bier's film is much more than a warning for parents. The children and the wonderful acting speak on a level understood by anyone commentating on the time and place for revenge and forgiveness.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this gorgeous Oscarwinning film In a Better World Susanne Bier delivers an entertaining and emotionally compelling film a matured project which defines that maturation of the Dogme 95 movement and a profound discussion on the nature of revenge while telling two stories simultaneously in Denmark and Kenya. Perhaps this latter featthe discussion of revengeis the most telling considering the film's international popularity. The debate at the heart of this film is the nature of revenge. So much seems obvious from the Danish title Hvnen which means simply enough the revenge. The change to In a Better World is not so much a translation as a deliberate stylistic choice. Not to argue that a direction translation would have been any betterThe Revenge definitely would make this seem like a different film! Though a rather minor thing it is an interesting change to note something which might slightly impact the viewers' perspective of the story. Each character from the pacifist to the emotionally unstable little boy at some point does exact revenge upon someone else by inflicting harm upon another but the success and magnitude of the revenge varies vastly. And at the end of the movie the big revenge really is not a revenge at all but a situation much better for all of the characters instead of debts being paid debts are forgiven. Instead of relationships being broken relationships are salvaged. One another thing about the slight shift of focus which could result from the differing titles is the importance of the African side of the story. While Anton's work as a doctor in African is no doubt an important part of his character and philosophy I at some points in the film found myself wondering about the importance of this subplot and its characters. The resolution of the African plot is also curiously disappointingonce the bad guy is dead and the community has its revenge the bad guy stays dead. However considering the villain's own fears about being usurped the lack of any retribution on the camp is a bit mystifying. Did the man's henchmen dislike his conduct as much as their victims? If this the case it was never made clear. They all seemed as bad as him. As it is this optimistic and peaceful ending of the African side of the story brings more attention to the plot when the title of the movie is In a Better World a kind of optimistic mantra which appeals to American and western appreciation for a happy ending. Susanne Bier has previously used third world locations in her other movies as essential components to the plot and characters. The most relevant example would be the Danish man running an orphanage in India who must travel back to Denmark in order to secure funding in After the Wedding 2008. After the Wedding which was also nominated for the Best Foreign Language film is in this and many other ways a sister film to In a Better World. In a Better World is in many ways a more mature more realised version of After the Wedding and the overall better quality is evident in the fact that it won Bier the OscarAfter the Wedding was good but it was so close to being great. And there are several simple things which make In a Better World a better award winning film. First the cinematography. It is an absolutely gorgeous film. It is helped rather than hindered by the use of techniques evolved from Bier's Dogme 95 days including handheld shots closeups to let emotions and gestures speak for themselves and an understanding and use of natural lightning. After the Wedding uses these technique and more but the usage is just that one shade too much that pushed it into trying to be an art film. This pushed the film into an awkward place rather than adding another element of interest. The gratuitous amount of shay cutaway shots to eyes mouths and elbows was distracting especially because Bier unique among many European film directors uses a style which also incorporates many Hollywoodesque techniques. In In a Better World Bier still uses close up shots and character stills but in a much more mature and subtle way. The use also does not clash jarringly with the more Hollywoodesque aspects for example the scenes with the local terrorist group in the African side of the story. Other areas in which In a Better World surpasses its sister is pacing it is about twenty minutes longer and more importantly it feels a lot shorter as though it does not drag on. It could also be said to show a more realistic comparison of the privileged life of western Denmark and life in a poor and unstable region. In After the Wedding the contrast is very conscious and inyourface making it feel contrived at times. In In a Better World the comparison is much more subtle but the contrast certainly is not. The lifestyles of the characters in Denmark versus the characters in Africa is staggering as is the contrast between the peaceful and idyllic shots of Danish nature to the chaotic and stark shots of African nature or at least the harsh natural beauty of the desert around the camp. Wealth is not directly brought up but the disparity is clear. The contrast of the two places also makes some of the Danish characters' reactions to events seem petty. It certainly provides an interesting commentary on Danish society Danish society has more problems than it cares to admit but at the same time some of its problems are so little compared to what the rest of the world faces. Not to reduce Danish problems to nothing however since belittling problems does not solve them. What is needed is more understanding.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a Better World by Susanne Bier from Denmark has won both the Golden Globe and later the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. It has done so over much more highprofile films like Biutiful from Mexico. My friend from Denmark has not seen it yet but she told me that Ms. Bier is known for films about relationships. And this one is certainly no different.The film follows the relationship of two confused preteen Danish boys. Christian's mother just died from cancer and he is angry at his dad for letting her go. He is the type who would not simply turn the other cheek in a conflict. Elias is the kid bullies like to pick on in school. His parents who were both doctors were in the process of divorce which distresses him. Elias' dad works as a volunteer doctor in Africa and this gives the film an extra dimension to work with.The actual Danish title of this film is Haevnen which translates to revenge. This is exactly what this film is all about. From the more familiar revenge on a bully at school to revenge in several other permutations in different situations in life are depicted here. There are several situations when you can effectively feel the tension of the characters in the events as they unfold on screen. Ms. Bier excels in building up the drama in the situations she has presented us as vengeance ultimately leads to inevitable consequences. I have not yet seen any of the other nominees yet so I could not really say if this was the best of them. All I can say is that this family melodrama was well done. The intercrossing of the stories was done very effectively with suspense and sensitivity. The film is long almost 2 hrs and slow but it is riveting. However you can't completely shake the feeling that the conflicts you are seeing in In a Better World are all familiar situations that we probably have all seen before in various other films  just better presented. And that is the thing that sets it apart.".

	schema:headline " Violent revenge does not create a better world";
	schema:reviewBody "In a Better World is a gripping story of two families united through tragedy and misfortunes. Christian the main character is a young boy who is dealing with the loss of his mother and his distant father. While Christian deal with his mother's death he and his father Claus move to a new town and Christian is enrolled in a new school. At the new school Christian becomes friends with Elias a young boy who is bullied at school and does not make friends easily. These two boys struggle through their trials together and learn about revenge betrayal forgiveness trust and friendships. Christian is the only person who will defend Elias when he is bullied by other kids at school. Christian's first act of defense is to threaten and beat up the boy who bullies Elias. Christian gets himself into trouble with this and from here his troubles spiral out of control because of his desire to get revenge on those who have done something wrong.Along with his problems at school Elias also has problems to deal with at home. His parents are in the midst of a divorce and his father is rarely around as he travels to Africa frequently to serve as a doctor. Because of this Elias seems lost and alone before he becomes friends with Christian.There are many prevalent themes throughout the film that are very relatable to most viewers. Many complex relationships are portrayed throughout the film and serve to add depth and meaning to the story. The relationship between Anton and Marianne Elias' parents is very strained and effects Elias and the way he acts in school. Elias and his father have a stereotypical fatherson relationship except that Elias' father travels a lot and is not always around. This puts a lot of stress on Elias and he does not always have someone to talk to about his problems. When Elias and his father are shown talking via skype it is clear that Elias just wants someone to talk to but his father is too distant and almost seems to not care about his son's troubles while he is away. The relationship between Christian and his father is also strained. Christian and his father do not communicate with each other and this causes them to not get along. Claus puts a lot of pressure on Christian to be good but Christian does not agree with the way his father thinks and acts how he wants regardless of his father. The relationship between Elias and Christian is the most prevalent relationship seen in the film. Their relationship is built on kindness towards each other but as the film goes on their friendship becomes strained when they have different views on how to deal with situations. In the beginning they are able to find common ground and bond over the fact that their parents are not together although for different reasons. In the end Christian and Elias' relationship works because they both want the same thing they both want to fit in and be important to someone.One of the biggest themes in the film is revenge and violence. It seems as though everyone in the film wants to get revenge on someone somehow. Christian and Elias want revenge on the boy who bullied Elias they also want revenge on a man that hit Elias' father. Marianne wants some sort of revenge for the way that she was treated by Anton. The young boys see revenge as a way to solve problems however their parents do their best to teach the boys that revenge will not solve any problems. We also see the residents of the camp in Africa where Anton works wanting to get revenge. They end up acting violently similar to the way that Christian and Elias acted when they wanted revenge against the bully in school. Through this film we are able to see bullying from the perspective of a young school boy and from the perspective of adults. We see that this cruelness exists in childhood and sometimes continues into adulthood. Bullying also occurs across cultures as we see when Anton is working in Africa. We are able to see this story from the point of view of a child and of an adult which adds to the complexity of the emotions shown throughout the film.I found it difficult to relate to the characters and sympathize with them as I have never gone through any trials similar to these. I could not image ever acting like Christian and Elias or thinking of ways similar to theirs to get revenge. The boys come up with very extreme ideas to get revenge. I was taught at a young age that getting revenge rarely solves anything and I found myself feeling frustrated with the young boys for acting the way they did.I enjoyed the acting in the film. I felt pulled into the story by the emotions shown by each character and the way that the characters dealt with their emotions. Through these different emotions the film was able to deepen and move forward. I was especially impressed by Trine Dyrholm's acting. After seeing her in other movies I am impressed by the different characters that she is able to portray. None of the characters seemed at all the same and she brought a different element to each of the characters I have seen her act as.Over all I found the film to be very dramatic and emotional. I would not watch this film again because I did not enjoy the drama and I thought that the way the boys dealt with their emotions was far beyond what any actual 10 year old would do. Throughout the film I questioned the actions of the characters and I thought there were some aspects that were unrealistic.".

Her performance is less credible than most of her chores opposite Bogart. On the other hand CHARLES BOYER is impressive as a man on a mission who is eventually betrayed. As in all such spy thrillers this one has a plot line that is better left undisclosed but suffice it to say that there is plenty to ponder as you watch the story unfold and some interesting work by a large supporting cast. Set at the time of the Spanish Civil War it has plenty of plot to follow.Wanda Hendrix has a nice bit as a Cockney lass and Katina Paxinou delivers the goods in a malicious role. Too bad the chemistry between Boyer and Bacall is not quite on par with the kind she had with Bogart because their romance never seems quite credible. Neverthelss she does not deserve the panning her performance received when the film was first released on the heels of two successful films with Bogart.A bit dull in the stretches but atmospheric and worth watching as an interesting example of Warner Bros. noir the sort of cloak and dagger atmosphere needed to give the story some punch.".

Unfortunately for Denard he is literally on his own  everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the Falagists of Spain.

Wanda Hendrix is the drudge of a girl Else who works for Mrs. Melendez. The local diplomat Licata Victor Francken is already a willing associate of the Falangists.The Brits Holmes Herbert Miles Mander and best  if not worst  of the lot George Coulouris don't give much hope to Boyer's cause which he soon grasps may be Britain's before long. Herbert and Mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the Ramsay MacDonald's and Stanley Baldwin's governments during the Civil War. Coulouris here is a typical Col.

She's an aristocrat  the daughter of a Press lord. It was Bacall's second film and sad to say almost sank her long career. She does act well but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with Humphrey Bogart and being directed by Howard Hawks. Boyer is a fine actor but he's not Bogie and Herman Shumlin is not Hawks. Her next film returned her to Bogie and Hawks again and her star resumed it's ascendancy.It's a bleak film as was the novel. Boyer's mission never succeeds as he has too many hidden foes all over the place. But the villains are likewise also losers  frequently with their lives.With Dan Seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou and the man who destroys her.

His papers are stolen he's accused of murder but he's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the Fascists.This film has its good and not so good points.

Uh no. Boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent but Bacall is 100 American not of the British upper class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion Bacall is somewhat miscast. Her acting isn't up to snuff either she's better in other films. But she's an astonishing looking woman and much can be forgiven.Paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. It's a great part and his performance is perfect while some of the direction of the other actors isn't as good. This was definitely a case of no small parts only small actors. Seymour wasn't a small actor.Definitely worth seeing even with its flaws.".

Graham Greene has been translated into film many times of course in such masterpieces as Thin Man and in lesser vehicles. Confidential Agent is one of those lesser vehicles yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway despite lackluster direction the incongruity of Bacall and Boyer's depictions as respectively British and Spanish and the almost complete nonexistence of any chemistry between the two leads. In some ways this last problem actually begins to work in the film's favor for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one person's tragedy? The most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from Greene's complex and guiltridden psychology which pervades the film. I know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull and I can understand that. Yet I found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world. I was compelled to watch not by any great acting although Boyer is marvelous as usual managing to convey a rich mixture of worldweariness tragedy hope and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes but by the downspiraling rush of one man's slim hopes against a world of oppression and money. What is a thief? What good is love in the face of death? Where does mere profittaking end and exploitation begin? The film does not rise to the level of art and thus cannot hope to answer such questions but it is much more than mere entertainment and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn. The lack of glitz of bubble of narrative bounce help to make this movie very worthwhile.And there is no happy ending for history wrote the ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "In October 1937 a man crossed the English Channel knowing that the success or failure of his confidential mission could mean victory or defeat for his people according to the opening statement. The secret agent man is former Spanish composer and pianist Charles Boyer a Luis Denard. Spain is divided by a Civil War and Mr. Boyer is acting against the Fascists. His mission is to obtain exclusive rights to precious coal which is needed for the war. The forces of evil are positioned to obstruct Boyer at every turn...Missing a train due to questions about his passport Boyer gets a lift into London with coal tycoon's daughter Lauren Bacall as Rose Cullen. The beautiful heiress smokes and drinks up a storm while wondering if Boyer's comings and goings are those of a completely sane man. A romance tentatively develops. Boyer takes up residence with cool calculating Katina Paxinou as Maria Melandez and meets sadeyed contact Peter Lorre as Contreras. Unsavory characters continue to block Boyer from his mission...Watch on the Rhine 1943 and Confidential Agent are the only two feature film credits for director Herman Shumlin unfortunately. He died in 1979 and certainly should have received more film projects based on the evidence presented here. Having photographer James Wong Howe and editor George Amy on your crew helps obviously. Shumlin subsequently focused on stage work and met with considerable success...This film was scolded for miscasting the French Boyer as a Spaniard and Ms. Bacall as a British socialite...Boyer plays the character well rolling with his regular accent. Bacall charts the same course with less success. In only her second film she would have benefited from a script explaining how her character grew up in New York. Bacall showed more rapport with Bogart than Boyer but maintains great sex appeal. The supporting cast is superb. Dan Seymour as Muckerji has a great part. In a startling debut Wanda Hendrix as Else go headtohead with Ms. Paxinou for best supporting actress honors.

	schema:headline " Mixed strong and weak points but worth seeing over all";
	schema:reviewBody "Confidential Agent is a rather neglected film it seems to be listed in very few film reference books presumably because it was out of circulation for a long time. The story from a book by Graham Greene concerns a Spanish pianist turned antiFascist soldier in the Spanish Civil War Charles Boyer who comes to England on a secret mission to buy up a huge supply of coal with the dual purpose of using it to support the Republican side and denying it to Franco's forces he's assisted by a spoiled rich girl he runs into Lauren Bacall who also falls in love with him.It's easy to see what Warner's was hoping for from this film by costarring a solidly established male romantic lead Boyer with the hot new female sex symbol Bacall fresh from her sensationmaking role with Bogart in The Big Sleep the previous year in a patriotically antiFascist story while the war was still in progress the studio might seem to have had all the bases covered. But in fact the film is a very mixed bag.On the negative side Boyer struggles manfully with his role but never seems to really get inside his character. Bacall seems to be trying to portray a femme fatale of the sexy but icecold variety but her performance which the critics generally panned comes off as just being wooden. And there's a complete lack of real chemistry between the two. The film also has a strained Hollywood happy ending which seems tacked on.But there are some virtues to set against this. The script is generally intelligent and the complicated plot consistently clear. Several of the minor performances are memorable especially Ian Wolfe and Dan Seymour as two quite different but equally amusing eccentrics Peter Lorre is fine as his usual sniveling villain and Katina Paxou is excellent as the soevilshe'sinsane murderess. The best thing about the film though is the starkly noirish photography by great cinematographer James Wong Howe those seriously interested in the art of cinema lighting will find much to admire.All in all not a classic but worth seeing for its good points.".

	schema:reviewBody "Somewhat underrated espionage tale adapted from a Graham Greene novel that stars Charles Boyer as a Spanish agent sent to England on a special mission. He meets lovely Lauren Bacall and tries to avoid being killed by fascist operatives. The primary complaint that I see about this film judging from reviews here and elsewhere is about the casting. Particularly that you have a Frenchman and a Hungarian playing Spaniards an American playing a Brit etc. with no effort to match the accents of someone from those countries. Honestly this doesn't bother me. It was standard for the era that an actor would speak in their own accent when playing someone from another country rather than wind up sounding like Speedy Gonzales or something. Bigger issues for me are Bacall's performance in the early scenes where she spits out her lines like she's angry at them and the lack of chemistry between her and Boyer. The latter hurts the film's romantic subplot but since that was a part that was of minor interest to me it didn't impact my enjoyment much.Any movie with a cast like this photographed by the great James Wong Howe can't be bad in my eyes. The supporting cast is especially good featuring the always entertaining Peter Lorre as well as Victor Francen George Coulouris Holmes Herbert George Zucco Miles Mander and Dan Seymour looking considerably less fat than usual. Katina Paxinou makes for a vile villainess. Good work from Wanda Hendrix as a teenage hotel maid who pays a price for befriending Boyer. For her part Bacall is pretty and despite the issue I addressed before she does get better as the movie goes along. But she is the weakest actor in the movie by far. Boyer is quite good as the nervous and befuddled hero. Perhaps not a perfect fit for the role but I think he does an admirable job. There is one scene involving him slapping another character that is a little unintentionally funny. Overall it's an interesting picture with a noirish atmosphere and tension particularly in one gripping scene with Paxinou and Hendrix.".

The Spanish characters in the film are played by a Frenchman Boyer a Belgian Francen a Greek Paxinou and a Hungarian Lorre! And to top it all off Bacall is supposed to be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities the performances are all very good  especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer Paxinou and Lorre meet and talk in wildly different accents is a real hoot! And I guess seeing as how they were alone that they should actually have been speaking in Spanish anyway! It seems pretty weird that the Brothers Warner couldn't find any Spanish speaking actors in Los Angeles! Of course Hollywood has often had an any old accent will do policy  my other favorite is Greta Garbo Swedish as Mata Hari Dutch who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican Ramon Novarro. Maybe they should have got Novarro for Confidential Agent  he would have been great in Boyer's role or at least in Francen's which would have saved greatly on the dark makeup budget.".

I put it down simply to she's way to American to cast well as the daughter of an English lord. Additionally as she says her director gave her no direction. A pity because Herman Shumlin the director had just come off doing Watch On The Rhine and this has similar subject matter.Confidential Agent taken from a Graham Greene novel from 1939 and not one of his better ones. It casts Charles Boyer in the title role as just that an agent for the Spanish government when it was clear it was already a losing cause. He's in a last minute attempt to stop English coal mine owners from consummating a deal with the new Falangist forces for coal. The miners just want to get back to work which won't make it an easy sell.When you come right down to it Boyer is really inept. So much happens to him including his credentials being stolen that you wonder why they'd pick this guy. Still he muddles through some how. One thing that the film has going for it is an incredible cast of character actors most of whom have played villainous roles. Just the names of Peter Lorre Victor Francen George Coulouris Katina Paxinou Dan Seymour Miles Mander and the nature of the story where Boyer does not know friend from foe for a lot of the film gives the story a boost. All these folks have essayed villainy well on the screen so you really can't tell who's good and who's evil.One I will note is George Coulouris who in this film plays a real oaf and well. Usually he's smooth and evil this was a new aspect to him and he carries it off well. And Katina Paxinou fresh from her Oscar for For Whom The Bells Toll lights the screen up with her brand of intensity.But most of the time the story is slow and sluggish. Maybe Michael Curtiz could have gotten more from this cast. And Lauren Bacall got right back on track with The Big Sleep her next film.".

Granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but I think through no fault of her own. I think there was some miscasting in having her portray a British uppercrust lady. No accent whatsoever. I think all the strange accents were distracting  Boyer was certainly no Spaniard. It was hard to keep straight which country people were from.I really liked the black and white cinematography. Mood is used to great affect  I especially liked the fog scene. The lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension.Bacall is just gorgeous. Boyer just doesn't fit the romantic leading man role for me  so he and Bacall together was a little strange. Not great chemistry  and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still really liked this picture. There is great tension and it moves along well enough. I must say I found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period film.Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as supporting cast. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal. Her one scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite disturbing. Lorre also does quite well in his slimy snake portrayal of Conteras  a sleazy coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix also does quite well in portraying the child Else  especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time though she appears much younger. Turns out she later married Auie Murphy which proved to be a short lived tempestuous marriage.".

The two of them together have zero chemistry. I wouldn't be surprised to read they hated each other. And what are the dramatic stakes? Coal from Newcastle. Even as a MacGuffin it's boring.

The whole film is shrunk. Bacall starts out wrong and never fully recovers. Instead of a ditch she could be simply frustrated at customs. She doesn't fit this upper class English snob. There is a heaviness to the sincerity in this film that leaves it a little tiring. Some of the best Graham Greene adaptations are located on foreign soil. This one is in foggy London which lacks the exoticism. Overall it's missing something which I struggle to put a finger on. The final act is a good thriller but it seems to need an unhappy ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seems to me that the reason why this movie isn't liked and known any better is because the world was not really ready yet for a this sort of action movie at the time. It's more the sort of actionthriller we are accustomed to of seeing now days with a better and more slow build up to it. So the movie was actually ahead of its time and I could understand Tony Scott's interest in this movie and why he decided to make a remake of it back in 2004.It's definitely not an usual revenge flick. It seems more focused on its characters and drama really but this of course is not necessarily a bad thing. It actually makes this movie a pretty refreshing and original one within its genre. And having said that it's not like the movie is all drama. It of course is still being filled with plenty of straightforward action in its second.And you would think that this is when the movie becomes truly good and interesting. However in this case I have to say I liked the first half so its drama and buildup better than the second more action filled one. I just liked the story and far slower pace of the movie its first half way better. It was a genuinely good movie while its action part comes across as far more standard and the story suddenly got pushed to the background. Besides director lie Chouraqui was obviously far more at ease with telling a story than at handling the action really. It's still good and fun enough action all but it just still feels like the second half of the movie is doing a good job at destroying what the first half of the movie had been building up. In that regard this movie is totally the opposite of its remake in which the second half and all of its action parts were its highlights.With its pacing and buildup this definitely feels more like a foreign movie which is not all that surprising really considering that it had a French director at the helm. But this approach is actually what makes the movie work out as something special and refreshing. I however don't think simply just everybody will be able to appreciate this approach. especially of course when you are expecting a more straightforward action flick.And for such a low key movie it definitely has a great cast in it. Scott Glenn Joe Pesci Jonathan Pryce all in one movie that's pretty awesome! And there are all really right at place within this movie as well. Scott Glenn is a great leading man to have when the main character is supposed to be a grumpy tough guy with his heart still at the right place.Maybe it's only just a half successful movie but it's still really worth giving a go!710 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " a very unusual European film";
	schema:reviewBody "When most people today hear the title Man on Fire they probably think right away of the 2004 film starring Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning. Unbeknownst to many of them is that film is in fact a remake of a gritty disturbing and above all unusual European film of the same title. The 1987 version of Man on Fire is probably a film that I would have to consider schlock. From the looks of it it's budget was fairly decent for it has good acting good effects and good sound design. But the reason why it falls under the category of schlock is because of its very unusual and sometimes inferior styles. This is a film that will meet viewers halfway. Some people will enjoy it just for what it is. And the other half will simply despise it.For me Man on Fire was in deed unusual and strange and definitely not the most creative film ever made. But while that is true in my personal opinion there is another factor that I cannot deny. And that is the factor that while the film was a bit shoddy it was highly entertaining and in a way a bit more complex and more compelling than the 2004 remake. It has some gorgeous scenery absolutely wonderful acting a fairly decent screenplay and other things that I simply find attractive in a motion picture. Scott Glenn was absolutely flawless as Creasy and he pulled off the character as being mysterious cold and unusual. He wasn't quite the tough guy as Denzel Washington was in the remake. To be honest I wanted him to be tougher but it kind of worked out. Jade Malle an actress who unfortunately did not do much acting after this debut was fairly good as Sam. Yes she wasn't the best child actress in the world and not a patch when compared to Dakota Fanning but I found her to a fairly decent addition to the cast. And Joe Pesci while definitely one of the unusual aspects of the film pulled off a fairly good performance as well.Action sequences in Man on Fire were fairly decent. Many of them were flawed but they were for the most part thrilling. There was one part that I personally felt did not work out. When one of the bad guys gets shot in the stomach he just kind of stands there until he finally starts to slowly fall over. The camera doesn't change angles or anything like that to create a more distressful feeling. But other than that the gunfights and action sequences were intense gritty and bloody. And the gore here is used at a controlled level. And what I will always remember about this film was that unlike the 2004 version there was a scene here that just made me jump.So what doesn't work in Man on Fire? Basically it's just a few aspects of the film's style. Some parts of the film I think could have used a few more takes. The scene where Creasy finds the first of the kidnappers probably could have been done differently for I found it to be too disturbing and uncomfortable. And like I said there are some wonderfully talented actors and actresses in this film. Jade Malle's parents were portrayed wonderfully unfortunately their characters are what I would call stick figures. Just in the background so that you know they're there. The ending for the film is a mysterious one of the highest order. For a while it doesn't make any sense. And I think the explanation of the ending just depends on an individual viewer's point of view. Maybe that's what the director intended.The original 1987 Man on Fire is not the kind of film for everybody. Some aspects of it are inferior to the 2004 remake but other aspects exceed well above it. Personally I might prefer this version for its colorful acting its notsogangster style Scott Glenn's wonderful performance the great music score and just the great thrills of a 1980s European thriller.".

	schema:headline " 2004 vs. 1987 Slick vs. Disturbing";
	schema:reviewBody "Man on Fire may be one of the most underrated thrillers of the 80's. While a bit slow and uncomfortable which it clearly meant to be to watch it is also an excellent trip into a desperate man's rampaging mind. Glenn truly is the epitome of the title of the film and is far less methodical than the 2004 updated version this aspect is neither better nor worse but different. Actually if you took attributes of both films and combined them you would have a perfect version. The 2004 version features some stylish camera work and editing along with some exceptional dialog and memorable quotes not to mention excellent performances by the entire acclaimed cast.The 80's version is harsh and sometimes even bleak but far edgier and while also visually very unique is far less superficially artistic there's no sometimes interesting sometimes downright distracting zig zag editing of the remake here than Tony Scott's music video style don't get me wrong I really dig both of the Scott brothers' work!. The 80's version does not have same pyrotechnics featured in the latter film and the action is a bit less satisfying. On the other hand the action in the 80's Man On Fire is disturbing brutal and ugly. Just like real violence. This gives the film a very unpredictable and gritty flavor. Like a train wreck Glenn's Creasy does not seems to approach his mission like his 2004's more surgeon precise counterpart but as a man who's finely honed training keeps him alive smashing a maze of the grimy underworld his obsessed mind propels him through. Where the slick action high production values and more articulate script of the 2004 version does give it's film some major advantages the 80's film's ending has it beat in spades. MINOR SPOILER ALERT don't read following paragraph if you don't want to be spoiled even if it is minor!The two films follow a very similar path throughout most of their respective journeys but the end of the road for both could not be more different. More satisfying than the far more melancholy ending with Denzel Washington and a rather obvious tacked on final resolution to the final baddie yet to be dealt with on Creasy's list watch it it looks like it was filmed at the last second with just 2 actors in someone's backyard the 80's film has an interesting bookend with it's unusual opening and ending. The finale is almost nightmarish as Scott Glenn's Creasy is insanely calling out his young charge's name but it all ends with a far more sweet resolution than what we would have predicted. Without giving away who all lives and dies it is a long belief of mine that the best films make you feel for characters that you are convinced will die but then don't. It's like being on a thrillride particularly simulation ones. People love the illusion and sensation of being in some great danger but barring strange accidents walk away just fine.END SPOLIERScott Glenn's Creasy deserves to be seen. It is a different experience than Denzel's but it has equal merit in very different ways. And although Fanning is absolutely amazing as Denzel's charge in the remake the original has the rare distinction of having a bit more ethnic child being the focus of Creasy's devotion and not the unlikely blond and very pale skin offspring of Marc Anthony. Yes this was an intentional choice. There just are not many major Hollywood films that use an ethnic child to focus all of the efforts of the hero to save and you can't say Golden Child! That kid had all kinds of special powers a regular Asian sterotype...unless you really think we can all run up walls and teleport and whatnot. Give it a look just be prepared to follow a dangerous crazy man on a mission for 90 minutes! It's sometimes very harrowing!".

	schema:reviewBody "Not being fan of director Tony Scott's 2004 remake starring Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning it however did get my attention that this novel adaptation was also attempted in the late 80s in a very European style. Not as easy to get a hold off but it turned out to be a solidly atypical if unspectacular lean revenge thriller with a striking performance by Scott Glenn in the central role as former CIA agent turned bodyguard Mr. Creasy. It's the cast that makes this one work where can you get Joe Pesci doing what he does best getting angry yelling profanity breaking radios and singing Johnny Be Goode outside some methodically stylish directorial touches like the opening slow motion intro and stunning Italian backdrops and decors. The music score is atmospherically edgy and always complements the onscreen action with the cinematography fluidly projecting the details.The pacing is rather stodgy as it does take awhile before it builds up some momentum soon after the ransom kidnapping by some terrorists there it crackles along Creasy gaining health and then going on the warpath finding those involved to only dispatch them until reaching its abrupt if confused climax. However the final frame really does paint a beautifully haunting picture which does leave it open. While grimy and mean when it does explode effectively staged too it might be too shortlived as it could have up the ante on numerous occasions despite one bloody shootout and a brutal beatup scene. Instead it's rather understated  more so moodily brooding in its activities and Glenn's husky narration as it's quite a lyrical character drama spending a lot time developing upon the relationship of the young girl and her bodyguard. While not particularly deep still it feels genuine in the thoughtful bonding and the transformations. Glenn's wearily lamenting but hardy performance balances out nicely to Jade Malle's wholesomely bright turn. Danny Aiello shows up as one of the kidnappers. Also the cast features Brooke Adams who we don't see too much of and a little role for Jonathan Pryce.".

Interweaving both classic literature and stirring quotes between Hero and his young charge for whom he has been assigned as bodyguard it's hard not to picture a restrained tiger on a leash which had been wounded and left for dead. As a result it convinces this audience member that at anytime during the dark moody and poignant tale the screen will detonate and shake the foundations of the theater.

	schema:reviewBody "You'd have to dig a bit to discover that Man On Fire with Denzel Washington is actually a remake or rather another version of a book that's out there somewhere but there is indeed film from 87' bearing the same title and basic plot outline albeit with a heavy dose of melodrama. Swap out Denzel and Chris Walken for Scott Glenn and Joe Pesci Mexico City for Italy and Tony Scott's neopunk visual aesthetic for a more stonefaced straightforward approach and you'll have some idea. It's a passable film but instantly pales with any comparison to Scott's outing which is a masterpiece and one of the best films of the century. Glenn is Creasy a mopey ex CIA soldier who gets a job from buddy Pesci protecting a wealthy businessman Jonathan Pryce and his family mostly driving their precocious young daughter Jade Malle around. The two are rocky at first begin to bond she's kidnaped and Creasy wages war on the criminals who took her with an arsenal of firepower provided by Pesci. At ninety minutes it's a little too short for any of this to be developed properly or proportionately so to other elements but it works well enough. The strongest bits are the early scenes where they make friends brought to life by Glenn's warm smile and Malle's emotional curiosity. The final act of revenge feels oddly rushed awkward and too overblown to justify the lack of action we get it should have been more hot blooded and sustained. It's still a decent piece though with the distinct cast doing fine work especially Pesci who is volatile and unpredictable almost stealing the film from Glenn.

	onyx:emotionText "You'd have to dig a bit to discover that Man On Fire with Denzel Washington is actually a remake or rather another version of a book that's out there somewhere but there is indeed film from 87' bearing the same title and basic plot outline albeit with a heavy dose of melodrama. Swap out Denzel and Chris Walken for Scott Glenn and Joe Pesci Mexico City for Italy and Tony Scott's neopunk visual aesthetic for a more stonefaced straightforward approach and you'll have some idea. It's a passable film but instantly pales with any comparison to Scott's outing which is a masterpiece and one of the best films of the century. Glenn is Creasy a mopey ex CIA soldier who gets a job from buddy Pesci protecting a wealthy businessman Jonathan Pryce and his family mostly driving their precocious young daughter Jade Malle around. The two are rocky at first begin to bond she's kidnaped and Creasy wages war on the criminals who took her with an arsenal of firepower provided by Pesci. At ninety minutes it's a little too short for any of this to be developed properly or proportionately so to other elements but it works well enough. The strongest bits are the early scenes where they make friends brought to life by Glenn's warm smile and Malle's emotional curiosity. The final act of revenge feels oddly rushed awkward and too overblown to justify the lack of action we get it should have been more hot blooded and sustained. It's still a decent piece though with the distinct cast doing fine work especially Pesci who is volatile and unpredictable almost stealing the film from Glenn. Nothing compared to Scott's version but worth a look.";

At first he hates it as it involves working with a child Sam a subject that carries a lot of pain for him. However gradually he softens to Sam and relaxes into a job described to him by David as norisk babysitting despite the kidnapping problems in Italy. When Sam is kidnapping right out of Creasy's arms he is left riddled with bullets. It becomes a matter for the police and paying is not an option from their point of view. Awaking in hospital Creasy decides to take matters violently into his own hands.It was the sequel that made me come back to this film and given Scott's heavy use of style I was hoping that this would be a much more slimmed down and gritty film but still keeping the violence and desperation. As it is though Man on Fire is just a disappointment because it doesn't do a terrible lot of note. I can understand why it does have a certain amount of cult appeal because it is a strange beast of a film. It is very American in cast but yet very European in style and delivery like it is an attempt to ape the American movies without stepping too far from it. The problem is that it is cheaply done and basic  and not in a good way. Creasy's character changes like a light being flicked on and off. However even with this we still drag our way through the story. When the violence finally comes it lacks conviction and is surprisingly dull.It is a shame because I was hoping that the low budget feel would mean a very gritty and desperate feel to the film but there is never much in the way of urgency. For me director Chouraqui carries the can on this because he directs with a clumsy touch and his use of slow motion at the start and end is a terrible call. The cast are OK but to be honest it is mostly the novelty value of having them there. Glenn deserves more and could have given more if given the opportunity. Pesci Pryce and Aiello are all soso at best but it is Malle that is the worst cast  not only is she a bit irritating but she doesn't have the chemistry with Glenn that the film requires.I wanted to like Man on Fire because it is a bit of a cult film that few people have seen. However the truth is that there is a reason for this because it is just not that good. It doesn't deliver convincing characters or story and the violence is too dull and uninvolving to save the day. The remake is not a great film by any means but it is certainly better than the original  and maybe that was the point Scott wanted to prove!".

Tend to be along the same lines and on the same page as critics who tend to be unfairly bashed on the internet for no reason but there have been times where a panned film is not that bad to me and an acclaimed film considered not that good or not doing much for me. The former is an example here. 'Man on Fire' is not a great film exactly and can totally see where the critics are coming from. Personally do share some of their criticisms. However 'Man on Fire' does have a lot of things in its favour so if asked whether it is that bad my answer would be no. Not a lot is done exceptionally nothing also is done disastrously.'Man on Fire' is an interesting film visually. The locations are stunning especially the palazzo the industrial loft and the boat dock and the film has some of the best location shooting from personal opinion of any film from that year. Not perfect by all means some of the editing is choppy and incompletelooking and count me in as another person or didn't see the need for the slowmotion which has very rarely been a favourite camera technique of mine in film. The music is dynamic and haunting.The script has some nice tension and contrary to what some critics have said it does have wit and coolness especially Scott Glenn's lines. The story could have been better the buildup of the first half tends to be slow and take too long some of it is routine and other parts forget to make sense and come over as ludicrous. However the second half generally really picks up the momentum fun and suspense levels leading to an exciting and touching ending.Don't agree that it completely lacks emotion though there could have been more and it does for my liking come too late. The action mostly a few routine moments is gritty and suitably uncompromising without going unnecessarily over the top. The direction has been criticised can understand as it is sluggish to begin with but there is a real sense that Chouraqui is more comfortable.Scott Glenn is an intensely charismatic lead and carries the film brilliantly. Jade Malle is more charming than she is irritating which was great. Her and Glenn's chemistry is the heart of the film and it is dealt with a believable amount of charm and that it developed gradually rather than them hitting it off straightaway was a good move. In support a fun Joe Pesci and sinister Danny Aiello despite an inconsistent accent stand out.Not everybody comes off well more to do with screen time than performance quality. Jonathan Pryce and Brooke Adams just have too little to do to make much impression Adams in a role little more than the smallest blinkandmiss of cameos is particularly wasted.In summary not a bad film and has enough to not make it fizzle but some elements bring it down from being on fire. 610 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Man on Fire is a trashy simplistic thriller based on a novel by A.J. Quinnell. It stars Scott Glenn as John Creasy a former C.I.A. agent living in Italy who forever mopes about his traumatic past. Then his good friend David Joe Pesci finds him some work as a bodyguard for Sam Jade Malle the daughter of a financially well off couple Paul Shenar Brooke Adams. Not long after the adult and the kid actually form a bond she's violently kidnapped by scuzzy terroristtypes. Once he's recuperated he's determined to get her back using the most ruthless means available to him.The 2004 version of the same story directed by Tony Scott originally considered as director of this adaptation and starring Denzel Washington Dakota Fanning and Christopher Walken may be much better known but this version offers a well paced watchable enough and very rainy revenge flick full to the brim with violence. At first it seems as if it will be overly dreary but it develops humor and heart as the crusty sullen Creasy and the personable pre teen girl start hitting it off. Still it's pretty melodramatic stuff overall with some decent but rather perfunctory action. The deeply affecting music score by John Scott will make you think you're watching a better movie than you really are.It is somewhat fun to see the underrated Glenn join the ranks of cinematic bad asses. For a while the script allows him to look like a bum until he begins his bloody mission and decides on a makeover. The excellent supporting cast is a major draw Pesci Adams Shenar Danny Aiello Jonathan Pryce Giancarlo Prati Lou Castel. Pesci has one offbeat moment where he does an enthusiastic rendition of Johnny B. Goode and Aiello is memorable as a snivelling weasel but the lovely Adams gets barely anything to do here. Young Malle is endearing.One other major point of interest for viewers may be comparing this film to its 2004 counterpart. At least this one has less fat on the bones and less reliance on showoff stylistics. It's adequate entertainment and runs a trim 93 minutes.Six out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Denzel's 2004 version is one of my favorite onemanarmy revenge flicks so when I saw this title at the truckstop 1 bin I grabbed it. It's a most excellent take on the same story and well worth watching. Scott Glenn is a topnotch toughguy actor who never got his big break but he always does a great job and this is clearly some of his best work IMO also check out The Challenge 1982. This FrenchItalian 1987 version had only a small fraction of the budget of Denzel's film and it quickly sank out of sight in America but it works on different levels and is very entertaining in its own peculiar way.Glenn's Creasy is a great version of the burnedout PTSDsuffering haunted depressed former Special Ops bad soldier who has seen and done too much and has totally given up on life. Yes this character is an action movie stereotype but Glenn breathes a lot of life into him. He starts out bedraggled but unlike Denzel he stays shabbylooking when he gets hired for his ultimately redemptive bodyguard job. After all Hell breaks loose then he shaves and gets a haircut and the audience knows he means business from that moment on.Jade Malle was a 12yrold French actress so it's a very different dynamic from Dakota Fanning's little girl but it's interesting in a special way. Glenn's Creasy still sees her as the daughter he never had but being older she's more of a pain in the butt than a sweet little girl would be. Some people always put a Lolita angle on these types of stories but anyone who's ever been a father or an uncle or a big brother to a needy tween girl knows it's far more likely to just feel protective towards these girls. Miss Malle does some very nice naturalistic unaffected acting while depicting a lonely neglected girl who fixates on Creasy as a downandout loner well worthy of salvage and her friendship even though he initially has no desire whatsoever to be her reclamation project or her friend. But Samantha is determined to pull this poor lost soul back into the world of the living and she gradually brings him around.Of course we all know Creasy's not going to stay a cheerful guy who's found a reason for living and is glad to be alive again. There's trouble right around the corner and when it hits Glenn is extremely effective as an obsessed highlyskilled heavilyarmed vengeanceseeker unconcerned with his own survival. Also among many other great actors and actresses in the supporting cast we have Joe Pesci in the Christopher Walken role and he's fantastic as usual.Anyway for fans of the onemanarmy revenge films this is a fine example of the genre. I also highly recommend my own personal favorite the Korean The Man From Nowhere made in 2010. Don't be afraid of the subtitles or you'll miss out on a classic film.".

Though billed and treated by most as an actionthrillerrevenge film it's much more than that. The aspect that really grabbed me was the development of the relationship of Scott Glenn's Chris Creasy and Jade Malle's Samantha. The gradual development of the Creasy character from an isolated and emotionally shut down loner first into a friend and finally into a surrogate father and mentor to Samantha is touching and believable. Touching and believable as well is Samantha's simultaneous evolution from a lonely if charming rich kid into Creasy's surrogate daughter and protg. I just wish Ms. Malle who exhibited such a strong screen presence in this film had gone on to make more films than the one other movie and one TV show credited to her on the IMDb site.".

The truth is that once upon a time there was a reclusive European author with the penname A.J. Quinnell who gained notoriety among a select group of fans for his excellent series of novels about an exmerc named Creasey who lived on a remote Greek island and only left that island from time to time to take special jobs or to seek revenge for friends that had been wronged. When he would take these special jobs he almost always did so with a team formed of his old buddies also mercs. The novels were uniformly excellent but never found a mainstream following. In fact one of the last ones had a very limited print run and you want to read it you may have go to a rare bookseller and pay a steep price. Of the set of Creasey novels MAN ON FIRE was the odd man out featuring the protagonist on his own not in a team and having some stress issues to boot. Just like see my other reviews the actor chosen to play the lead in SHOOTER looked nothing whatsoever like the character as described in the source novel by Stephen Hunter Scott Glenn in this film looks nothing like Creasey in the Quinnell series nor does he act like him. Creasey was huge and a stonefaced killer. Which is not to say this is a bad film  I ACTUALLY PREFER IT OVER THE DENZEL VERSION  merely to point out that this is just one more sad example of the film biz having its way with a good work of fiction and leaving mainly ashes in its wake. Once you overcome the fact that the director is not really following the source material very closely you end up with a passable film that perhaps makes up for in passion what it lacks in technique. Compared to a Bourne film for example one of the only examples I can think of where the films do actually resemble the source material  HOW RARE IS THAT? the deficiencies soon become obvious however.".

	schema:headline " The Colin Farrell Mystery Is Revealed";
	schema:reviewBody "What a stunning surprise! A family saga without familiar places or I should say that there are all familiar places but they feel completely new. I'm not one who likes to give away plot points so I won't I just want to say that I loved the loving involved in the unfolding of this realistic fairy tale. Personally I've been questioning the apparent success of Colin Farrell. In very short years he worked with everybody from Stone to Spielberg co starred with Pacino Cruise and Willis but other than a winning pout and a clear willingness to take risks his appeal eluded me  until last night that is. A Home At The End Of The World made me fall in love with him with his power with his utter fearlessness. He creates a character with his heart in his sleeve and an innocence that it's compelling aggressively on your face. Sweet and tough wise and naive. Robin Wright Penn is also a standout. Her truth unusual as it is is unmistakable. Sissi Spaceck's suburban mom is an extraordinary creation. Subversive without meaning to lovingly subversive that's what she is. The opening with a startling Ryan Donowho grabs you by your heart and your throat and doesn't let you go. Wondering why this film didn't become an instant classic I arrived to the uncomfortable conclusion that it has to do with the casting of Colin's life long friend Dallas Roberts a good actor but not charismatic enough to give us a compelling pairing. I agree that he should be awkward and different but there is an element of petulance and physicality who didn't allow me to care for him as much as I wanted as much as I needed. Sorry I had to mention that. But the experience that this little big film provides is unforgettable and the revelation of Colin Farrell mystique as an actor is nothing short of breathtaking.".

From a very young age his character is aware of certain truths about life and he's acutely in touch with his feelings. He trusts and follows these feelings to the exclusion of everything else. This is not an ordinary character and this is not an ordinary film.Everything about A Home At The End of the World is offcenter in the best possible way  the characters do not fit into any stereotypical molds and there are no overwrought emotional scenes although the film is deeply emotional and profoundly intimate. Choices are made consequences are dealt with but nothing plays out in a trite predictable way. Instead the story builds slowly with intense subtlety showing the changes Bobby and his childhood friend Jonathan experience in their conjoined lives. I recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to take this unforgettable journey along with them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael's Cunningham's book is so moving I was afraid to be deeply disappointed by the movie adaptation. Although 90 min is barely enough to narrate the story in its emotional complexity the movie is very faithful to the book probably because the screenplay is from Cunningham himself. The acting is excellent and the soundtrack featuring Laura Nyro is beautiful and if some of the book's interest is lost in translation it still makes a pretty good movie. I find some detractors' arguments pretty amazing as if all they'd watched was the trailer. To suggest that after Jules  Jim any movie containing a threesome is worthless that any movie taking place in the 70s80s is obsolete that there was too much or not enough sex scenes or that the AIDS theme is not developed enough is plain ludicrous. This is not a movie about an era about homosexuality or about the AIDS epidemics. This is about recreating a place out of time and geography where the world makes sense again. A home in other words. This is about loving another being or two since one is never complete never enough irrespective of family links gender and the established social codes. The characters are struggling to escape the rules to enjoy the big noisy world around and find a natural place in it. They are the opposite of stereotypical characters at least once they are fully revealed to themselves. As for the end it is not unconclusive it is what is called an open ending and probably in this case the perfect ending which means the only possible one. My advice watch it and read the novel too.".

The struggle is to find equilibrium with all the surprises that may come one's way.Although the movie has its share of sadnesses there are also quiet triumphs. In an odd way this film touches some of the same chords as the far more eccentric The World According To Garp and Cider House Rules.To the director's and screenwriter's credit they resisted the temptation to pack too much onto the film. I found the characterizations just specific enough. Fine performances from all. Beautifully established in youth.The film trusts both your intelligence and intuition to carry you through the trip.

But he did with a performance that astonished me.What is unfortunate it that the movie in some ways has been limited in appeal by the sexuality theme that has become attached to it. Yes Jonathan is gay. But labeling Bobby bisexual is reducing him to a caricature. Bobby's life was about love needing and getting it from the people in his life. He found no limits in how to return it. Imagine no inhibitions in showing love and affection! Any scene with Bobby in it just continued to show his tender and honest heart. Then there were the rampant rumors of the deleted scene. I totally understand why the scene was cut. It would have been unnecessary and gratuitous.It is unfortunate this film wasn't released to a greater number of screens. Missing these performances would truly be a tragedy.".

Also the importance of good editing should not be overlooked.In any case the first part of the movie spends a bit too much time on exposition or perhaps simply doesn't use the time well enough. We're fairly clubbed over the head with Bobby's nearworshipful identification with his older brother. The scenes with Sissy Spacek were far superior to the others and brought out the best in the young actors playing the boys.The film's most pleasing aspect was the wonderfully crafted relationships among the four adult characters played by Farrell Roberts Wright Penn and Spacek. They were convincing and drew the audience into the entire complex of the the interaction between the characters even among those I've spoken to who identified more strongly with one of them. These scenes are crafted very well and display the director's skill from live theatre. This part of the movie I wanted to see more of. Yes folks Colin Farrell can indeed act you'll find many different shadings in his performance and a vulnerability you probably haven't seen before. Dallas Roberts who was nominated for an Outer Drama Critics' Circle award for Best Actor for his outstanding performance in Nocturne in New York and who recently finished a run of a two man play with none other than the renowned Sam Shepherd does an extremely fine job. He maintains honesty and intensity and isn't drawn into the easy trap of trying to play the whole weight of the drama at once. He keeps himself firmly in each moment. Robin Wright Penn turns in a delightful performance in a character whose range of outlook on life is wide and complex. Sissy Spacek is simply superb aside from the tendency to like her in whatever she does her character took only moments to become highly engaging. The scenic design and location choices were notably excellent.This movie which unfortunately has yet to receive wide distribution is definitely worth seeing. Not only does it feature fine performances and direction in the latter part of the story but it raises questions about what family really IS and who gets to decide what that definition should be? That makes it a VERY timely film. Unless you've read the book you probably can't tell what's going to happen at each stage and you may find yourself with more questions than answers by the time the end credits roll. A piece of art that ASKS questions and doesn't claim to provide all the answers is to be valued and appreciated. It's also unusual for Hollywood to produce given their corporatelydriven tendency to release neat and packaged films. It allows far more room for the audience to make up their OWN minds and thus displays more respect for them. In my opinion it was this aspect of the script that enabled the producers to draw in three name stars and give us a welcome introduction to the highly talented Dallas Roberts whose performance takes no back seat to any of the others.This film contains varied  perhaps unconventional relationships. For that reason it has had a lot of screenings at GayLesbian film festivals. Don't let that fool you into overlooking this film. Its appeal is in the humanity of the characters not their sexual preferences.I highly recommend the film. Be patient with the first portions the older the characters get the better the film gets.".

The movie is so heartfelt from the poignant connection you feel as the two main characters have their first intimate contact at age 16 to the closing frames with the ambiguous ending. Colin is simply amazing as the romantic lead the level of tenderness he achieves with his boyhood love is so sweet and innocent hard to imagine from someone as hard ass as the reputation that belies him. The scene when they are dancing and kissing on the balcony to the strains of the Mozart aria is both erotic and magical reminiscent of classic Hollywood.The most emotional part for me was when they were watching ALL ABOUT EVE bc one of my very best friends in this life and many previous ones instantly came to mind as this was the last film we saw together not long before he passed.Bobby Colin moves to NY to be with Johnnie and Johnnie is now living with a woman a very colorful woman named Clare. We later find out that Clare is really in love with Johnnie but can get what she truly wants only from Bobby see the movie to find out. The chemistry really isn't there between Bobby and Clare even awkward at times like he's there in body but not in spirit and Colin shows us this emotional dichotomy perfectly. Clare soon discovers while she loves Johnnie that the love of Johnnies life is Bobby but what she doesn't know then is the same is true of Bobby which we find out as she sees them dancing and she has a painful epiphany. What she does after coming to terms with this is to say she is going to leave to see her mother in Philly for a few days but she's actually saying goodbye and then she does something I didn't find to be true of her character which I thought was cruel she tried to get Bobby to leave Johnnie and go to Philly with her and he tells her NO at first but then once she asks again finally he understand what she is really asking of him and gives her a resigned NO................... See This Movie I always knew Colin was an amazing actor but I never dreamed he was capable of such an ingnues intimacy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think the movie is excellent. And adaptation of the novel is great.These days though it is not easy to avoid comparing Home at the End of the World and Brokeback Mountain.It's not about sexuality I am talking about. And not about friendship exceeding usual limits. The most intriguing what makes these two movies close to each other emotionally  really different.And there is a major difference. The difference.

Colin Farrell's character Bobby Morrow is one of the most fascinating people I've seen in the movies for some time. I hope his performance and this film are given the recognition they deserve. The rest of the performances are excellent as well. The screenplay and the direction are also very good too. The story isn't something that we haven't seen on film before but the characters and the way the film unfolds isn't your standard fare. Don't listen to the detractors see this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clare loves Jonathan who loves Bobby who... well loves everybody. Bobby is either straight or homosexual or bisexual or asexual depending on where you are in the movie. A HOME AT THE END OF THE WORLD is a relationship movie wherein everything hinges on the relationships but those relationships remain strangely illdefined.Achingly sincere A HOME AT THE END OF THE WORLD strives for an easygoing reality not fully appreciating that easygoing can also mean meandering. To its credit we are never sure where the film is going to take us but to its detriment the film doesn't seem to know either. The film relies on JULES AND JIM math  one guy plus one guy divided by one girl equals melodrama  as a way of exploring the changing social landscape of America from the laid back sexdrugsandrock'n'roll sixties to the early days of the AIDS epidemic. It covers a lot of ground yet doesn't seem to really go anywhere.The best part of the film is the beginning before most of the main stars even make an appearance. Set in Cleveland first in 1967 and then in 1974 the film has some gentle fun looking at suburban attempts at being mod and trendy while romanticizing drug use and rock music. These are little Bobby Morrow's formative years where one by one he tragically looses members of his family leaving him an orphan by age 14. He befriends nerdy Jonathan Glover in high school and ultimately becomes part of the Glover family whom he seduces with his genuine charm gentle optimism and an apparently always ready supply of marijuana. It is also where Bobby and Jonathan begin exploring their sexuality. Even with it's discomforting approval of casual drug use this is where the film is most successful in the way it deals in an honest and intelligent way with blossoming sexuality and the awkwardness of being a gay teenager. The film really deals with original ideas in these early stages but that is just meant to be a foreshadowing of the main storyline which unfortunately tends to be rather trite and clichd. The bulk of the story takes place in 1984 and thereafter as the adult Bobby Colin Farrell heads to New York to live with Jonathan Dallas Roberts who is now more or less openly gay. Jonathan is living with Clare Robin Wright Penn a gay guy's gal pal i.e. fag hag who is your standard New York City kook complete with punkish magenta hair crazy clothes and unconventional ideas that don't seem all that unconventional anymore. Clare loves Jonathan and wants to have his child but she seduces and becomes pregnant by Bobby who we suddenly are expected to believe isn't gay at all. The three continue to live together as something more than roommates but something less than a marriage. And the film sortakinda explores the nature of this threeway union. As a result we get three or at least two intriguing characters who get lost in a story bereft of a dramatic point. And a perfectly good gay love story becomes an unconvincing a love triangle where each member ends up playing oddpersonout at some point. The most troublesome part of the story is that the character of Clare even exists. Clare's main function is to keep Jonathan and Bobby apart as lovers even as her pregnancy is a gimmick designed to keep them together as family. And though the film is progay on the surface there is the suggestion that Clare has somehow cured Bobby's homosexuality and the added insinuation that Clare and Jonathan could both find true love if only he didn't have that darn quirk of wanting to sleep with guys. This is a gay love story which wants to avoid being a gay love story. Also Robin Wright Penn is just not an interesting enough actress to bring any pizzazz to the stereotypical role of a bohemian kook and offers little reason to see why both Bobby and Jonathan are devoted to her. The character itself is a nuisance. Clare exists as a beard a plot contrivance designed to turn a gay love story into a straight love story. The main character however is Bobby and Farrell does a fine job playing him as a repressed manchild. There is no trace of the bravado that has made up Farrell's onscreen and offscreen reputation only a gentle sweetness. Unfortunately this causes an inconsistency in character. As played at age 7 by Andrew Chalmers and at 14 by Erik Smith Bobby is an open articulate engaging free spirit. When Farrell picks up the character at age 24 Bobby has suddenly become repressed shy and childlike. Even realizing the various hardships that marked Bobby's early life his sudden display of emotional retardation is jarringly illogical. And though Farrell is good it is the excellent performance of Smith as the teenaged Bobby that really defines the character. The best thing about HOME is Dallas Roberts. As the adult Jonathan he makes the character seem typically gay without seeming to be stereotypically gay. His Jonathan views Bobby with love and lust as a friend and with resentment and distrust as an ersatz favored sibling. Roberts embodies the conflicted nature of Jonathan better than Michael Cunningham's screenplay would suggest possible. Also Sissy Spacek has some fine moments as Jonathan's mother. She is particularly effective in a scene where Mrs. Glover has just discover Jonathan and Bobby in a compromising position. The ensuing scene finds her distraught not because she realizes that Jonathan is gay but that know she must accept as fact what she had already suspected. It is poignant moment.Had A HOME AT THE END OF THE WORLD been made in 1967 or 1974 or even 1984 it might have had an impact. Now so much of it is if not clich at least ordinary the supersensitive gay man in love with a straight man the flower childmother henearth mother with a penchant for gay men the alternative family unit the odds and ends bits of feminist dissatisfaction and even the climatic special guest appearance by AIDS. The story's one original element is the naive yet controlling gay yet straight passive yet dominating eager to please yet vaguely selfcentered Bobby but the film shies away from either exploring or challenging the character. Indeed the filmmakers even made a point of editing out a shot of Farrell's full frontal nudity likewise they edited out his sexuality which is the linchpin of all the relationships. They don't want to reveal too much of the character and in the end they reveal too little.".

This role shows so well how versatile Colin is an an actor what a talented genius he is and what a fully emotional person he's capable of being. All the actors did an incredible job but in particular I was really impressed with the teens that played the young Bobby  Jonathan they were absolutely genuine in what these really complicated mature roles.Regardless of the necessary changes made from the book I was amazed at how so many moments were exactly as I'd pictured them when I read it.Even though there's been a ton of reviews  the book to read there are some totally cute hysterical  goofy moments that knocked me out of my seat  completely surprised me. And the one altered scene I'm thankful they changed it that scene without any irrelevant controversial distractions is an Oscar winner if I ever saw one completely beautiful  traumatic  sweet  loving. I don't want anything to stand in the way of the characters  what they care about there  if I'd been in a room of screaming fans I would have been annoyed for having anything interrupt those beautiful moments during the film though I wouldn't kick the deleted scene out of bed if it shows up on the DVD!Saturday the 24th I saw it again. They're giving away Home books  CDs as raffle prizes  though I wasn't lucky enough to win I was lucky to get a book anyway. One of the guys that won the CDbook set gave me his book because he already had one. It has the Home poster on the cover!Everyone was filling out pink questionnaires for the film One of the guys collecting them said they had about 200 responses from the previous showings  of those nearly everyone rated the film as excellent. Only 9 of that 200 rated it fair  only 2 poor 2 bastards!Colin's got some incredibly powerful moments in this film and though I'm a fan of his anyway I was happily blown away with how loving he is as Bobby. It's glorious to watch. I'm highly impressed with the whole film all the acting from everyone. It's a very emotional poignant  profound story. ".

It's not often that a movie like this would actually get made so it's a testament to how well it was written directed and acted. Bravo once again to HBO for taking a chance to make a film out of the mainstream. It is a touching story that pays tribute to a great book. The same author who wrote the book also wrote the screenplay which translated well to the screen. This movie delves into places few filmmakers will tread. With all big budget Hollywood cookie cutters out there as well as the independent films that aren't very independent Home At The End Of The World is a movie for the true lover of filmmaking.

Sparked by their relationship with freespirited Clare they forge a loving unit that redefines 'family'. Colin Farrell Robin Wright Penn Sissy Spacek and Dallas Roberts star in this lyrical film that's both a celebration of commitment and a music  and memorydriven portrait of America in the '70s and '80s. Adapted by Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Cunningham from his own novel 'A Home at the End of the World' strikes close to home as an adventure as big as life itself risky surprising sexually charged and real according to sleeve scribers...That description while not entirely inaccurate hints at how A Home at the End of the World fails to achieve its full potential. The film isn't altogether a memorydriven portrait of family and music over the decades covered indeed it is a portrait of an unconventional family unit but that should have remained secondary. At heart this is a love the kind including a sexual attraction story between the Bobby and Jonathan characters possibly deemphasized to make it more palatable. The focus unravels especially after Mr. Farrell's adult Bobby take over the action. The film draws its fault line by losing touch with the central relationship and Farrell's characterization goes off course. Freedfromthewig Colin Farrell and Dallas Roberts could have recorded a hit version of Look Out Cleveland with The Band backing...The casting is excellent with Erik Smith and Harris Allan especially winning as the teenage Bobby and Jonathan they blend perfectly with the grownup Farrell and Mr. Roberts. Note that criticisms of Farrell in the lead role are of characterization not acting. Smith's Bobby was played as a selfassured and sexual adventurous young man but Farrell's Bobby is suddenly an asexual puppy dog something is missing. We begin with an uncommonly artistic story from Mr. Cunningham's novel. Cunningham worked on the film a double edged sword for it reveals not only tantalizing bits of his artistic vision but also invites criticism regarding its execution. The fine original story is still evident on film and some cinematic moments give the material emotional strength...A highlight occurs when Smith and Allan become brothers by exchanging jackets most importantly the jacket worn by Bobby belonged to his brother and he symbolically replaces Carlton a sexuallycharged Ryan Donowho with Jonathan. This is a circular story. Note we begin with Bobby walking in on his brother having sex with a young woman on top this scene is recalled when he walks in on his replacement brother again with a woman on top. In both instances Bobby winds up in bed with brother. There is no evidence of incest but the opening brotherbrother relationship appears extremely intimate as does the later relationship between Bobby and replacement mother Alice an easily potted Sissy Spacek. This story is about replacing lost love. We end with a full circle... A Home at the End of the World 6904 Michael Mayer  Colin Farrell Dallas Roberts Robin Wright Sissy Spacek".

After the nonsense about cutting out Colin Farrell's 'extremely distracting member' from the sex scene didn't create any new buzz the movie was left to play to its minute slice of the pie in half empty art houses around the country. Still just because mainstream America is too squeamish to sit through an openly gay film does not mean that the level of filmmaking is reflected in its box office totals.Based on his novel of the same name Michael Cunningham has written a screenplay that although similar to The Hours in theme is very unique. Its focus is on our search for acceptance for the people who define us for a home even if it is at the end of the world. He creates three individuals to take the same quest in their own way. The first is Jonathan Dallas Roberts someone who needs to be loved but resents that quality about him. It makes him susceptible to pain because he takes everything as betrayal. Next to that he feels that his life is always second to his best friend Bobby's. Bobby is played by notorious badboy Colin Farrell in his most toned down role yet. Bobby also needs people but not in a bad way. He just feeds off others and this feeding takes its toll on Jonathan. So much so that he heads off to New York and befriends a drifter a personality of originality named Clare. The two of them play house despite the fact that Clare is older than Jonathan and he is gay.Homosexuality is a major player in this film. And yet at the same time it's not because only Jonathan is actually gay. Bobby would be classified as bisexual but that term comes with the same connotation as homosexual and so it is more accurate to say that Bobby just loves everyone. There is no word to describe his sexual inclination because it is not really a big enough part of him to demand a label. It does not matter  perhaps one of the larger themes here that will sadly get overlooked as many people are not ready to embrace this yet.A Home At the End of the World is not a groundbreaker but it is a pioneer. It is one of the few movies about homosexuality and about it in a blunt unmasked way that could have a chance with the more mainstream audience. It is shot with the gritty quality of the independent film but it has mainstream Colin Farrell who may just have a shot of killing two bird with one stone here proving that he can do more than just the tabloids and bringing homosexual films to a more 'out of the closet' place among other films. Later this year he will try this same task again on a grander scale with Oliver Stone's Alexander and if that proves successful A Home At the End of the World can be credited as the beginning of that.

Debutant Dallas Roberts was good as well.One would expect more conflict when three characters are trying to establish a family together but the calm and composed outlook was refreshing.

This kind of miserable ignorance prevails as there are many who have not seen old films which were influential in revealing the richness of the cinema made in New Zealand. One of the best known films from New Zealand 'Goodbye Pork Pie' is the best example of how innovative ideas help a film to achieve tremendous local success as well worldwide acclaim. It was made by director and writer team of Geoff Murphy and Ian Mune who are considered as New Zealand cinema's important directors. Although Goodbye Pork Pie is classified as a road movie it is much more than that as it is for the first time that a film made in New Zealand has covered the entire nation with only three characters who represent three different faces of New Zealand. The general outlook of rebellion appears to be credulous as big doses of humor were added in order to speak against the system. The natural beauty of New Zealand is filmed in such an artistic professional manner that one would easily be tempted to pack bags and immediately leave for a trip to those parts. Lastly those viewers who care about the promotion of serious cinema would not hesitate to explore some other films made by Geoff Murphy name Utu and The Quiet Earth.".

	schema:text "    In London Belgian immigrant Carol Ledoux shares an apartment with her older sister Helen and works as a manicurist at a beauty salon. Helen uses the word sensitive to describe Carol's overall demeanor which is almost like she walks around in a daze rarely speaking up about anything. When she does speak up it generally is about something against one of those few issues on which she obsesses such as Helen's boyfriend Michael's invasion of her space at the apartment. That specific issue may be more about men in general than just Michael's actions as witnessed by Carol being agitated by hearing Helen and Michael's lovemaking and she not being able to rebuff the advances effectively of a male suitor Colin who is infatuated with her. One of those other obsessive issues is noticing cracks and always wanting to fix them. While Helen and Michael leave on a vacation to Pisa Italy Carol chooses largely to lock herself in the apartment ditching work. There she is almost hypnotized...";

	schema:headline " Genuinely Scary";
	schema:reviewBody "Repulsion is a great example of how to make a truly scary movie  The trick is not to fill the screen with monsters or indestructible serial killers it is to portray fear in a way that will be familiar to the audience.  It is clear from early on in the film that the lead character Carol played brilliantly by an extremely younglooking Catherine Deneuve is not exactly normal.  When her sister leaves her alone in their shared London apartment for a few days however the things that scare Carol are the sorts of things that have scared a lot of people spending the night alone such as hearing imagined footsteps in the hallway and the like.  Of course while normal people get a brief fright from such a thing Carol descends into a madness of hallucinations.  The movie is seen almost entirely from her point of view using techniques borrowed by later directors such as Darren Aronofsky for his movie Pi which gives the entire movie a claustrophobic feeling that enhances the impact of Carol's hallucinations.There are no doubt people who would like to explicate this film as an exploration of sexual repression or the like and perhaps they are indeed hitting the mark in doing so but this film works brilliantly as pure cinema with no metaphoric subtext needed.Overall Rating 4 stars out of 4 or 9 out of 10".

	schema:headline " One of the best of of psychological thrillers";
	schema:reviewBody "Extremely shocking if you consider the time it was filmed!Carole a beautiful young unusually shy fragile foreigner works in a beauty salon and lives with her older sister Helene in London. Her behavior at first seems faintly strange and distant but it appears like this is normal for everyone around her. Soon we realize she is antisocial and has a psychopathological fear of males and sex. When Helene leaves for a trip with her lover Carole isolates herself in her sister's apartment and surrenders to her morbid fantasies that lead her down a path of hallucinations all the way to murder.Polanski uses the world outside in a clever way to give us the whole parameter that helps bring about Carole's downfall. The social alienation a foreigner feels the domination games and the selfinterest of the people close to her. The men that approach her together with her own sexual fears are all catalysts. They create the image of a threatening world and her helpless existence in it as seen from inside her already troubled mind. Then begins a very true detailed description of her problematic mind that slowly worsens into madness. Done in a natural and simple way and perhaps that is what makes it so haunting.The first part is purposely slow. A momenttomoment reality that builds up tension and soon gives way to a nightmarish world. We watch as everyday reality transforms into a closeddoor hell and as Carole transforms from strange into a clinical psychopath. The house becomes a character its dimensions distorted and Carole is left there to wander in it alone with the house and the objects acting as symbols to portray exactly what is going on inside her head. Everything symbolizes Carole's mental decline in parallel. Space becomes distorted. Time becomes distorted. She becomes distorted.The black and white makes you focus exactly where the director wanted and the visual effects are very limited compared to todays psychological thrillers. Here the girl and the apartment are enough. The violence is not graphic it is psychological. Polanski's expert use of sound sets camera angles and framing all play a great role in creating the horror atmosphere.Deneuve is Fantastic! In a very difficult part if you consider she plays alone and without dialogue most of the time delivering an extremely complex role her best performance to date perfectly!! People have rushed to say she was flat but in this specific film I believe that was the intention. The MIND is the protagonist here she is only the vehicle where the mind lives. Her underplaying helps the viewer focus on what is happening inside her head makes you follow her and go through the experience with her. If one decides to watch this film and not experience it then yes she looks hypnotized.By the time Helene and her boyfriend return the viewer is just as shocked to have seen what the couple finds there. It is heartbreaking. The very last scene then finishes you off perhaps giving the biggest clue. Revealing a secret as to why this has happened. And the way this scene is filmed leaves you with a chill in the spine. I became even more disturbed well after the movie was over and my thoughts had settled down. This is why I call this film an experience.I think that some factors always needed when putting a value on films are often overlooked. Things like Time of release Level of difficulty in achievement of the story itself and Level of difficulty because of the budget or the country of production. Based on these I think that Polanski has created masterwork. It could be considered very slow especially for today's viewers. And for others it could even be considered a claustrophobic hell. In respecting everyone's personal opinions I would only recommend this to a specific audience and specific friends. Mostly ones who want to concentrate and allow themselves to be taken in by this type of film. For them I am sure the experience will be rewarding.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roman Polanski's movies divide movie fans. Even admirers of his output will single out a particular movie that just doesn't work for them in my case it's 'The Fearless Vampire Killers' which for me is an utter waste of time. But I would bet that virtually every Polanski buff would list 'Repulsion' as one of his very best movies. It's a brilliant exercise in unease and paranoia that has lost none of its power of the years. It is still one of the most disturbing movies ever made and manages to evoke an atmosphere filled with dread and fear without resorting to obvious shock tactics. Catherine Deneuve is perfect as a beautiful and disturbed girl slowly lost to delusion and phobia. This is arguably her most memorable role along with Bunuel's equally brilliant 'Belle De Jeur'. The rest of the cast is interesting and includes Yvonne Furneaux 'La Dolce Vita' underrated Brit character actor Ian Hendry 'The Hill' 'Theatre Of Blood' 'Get Carter' John Fraser 'The Trials Of Oscar Wilde' and Patrick Wymark 'The Conqueror Worm' and Hendry's costar in the fascinating but almost forgotten 'Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun'. All the cast are excellent but Deneuve's unforgettable performance is what really sticks in your mind long after the movie is over. That and Polanski's accomplished and tense direction make this movie essential viewing for all movie buffs. One of the most important and impressive movies of the 1960s and one of the most chilling horror movies ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film the first Polanski made in English works so well and for so many different reasons that I felt like I had to watch it again as soon as it ended.  From the first moments of the movie Polanski sets up the key conflict cutting between shots of Catherine Denuve's gorgeous face and of the things she is seeing all of which are almost frighteningly ugly by comparison. After fifteen minutes of this it becomes clear why Denuve's Carol is unable to cope with anything in the world around her and why she is so dependent on her sister and her attractive female coworker who provide the film's only beauty other than Denuve.  When her sister leaves her alone her surroundings decay further into ugliness sending her deeper into her madness.  I loved the way that despite Carol's growing insanity Polanski keeps going back to closeups of her face which remains beautiful.  So beautiful in fact that no one can seem to notice that she is clearly very deranged.  The only question the film left me with is this How could Carol possibly survived for an entire lifetime up till the point where the film began?".

	schema:reviewBody "A closeup of an eye frames the beginning and the ending of Roman Polanski's psychological horror classic REPULSION. The owner of this eye is Carole Ledoux one of cinema's most unsettling heroines who is about to  in the next 100 minutes  undergo a complete personality transformation from a softspoken ingenue to a catatonic madwoman who actually anticipates her own imagined rape.The choice to use Catherine Deneuve must have been a stroke of casting brilliance even though the expression is dated and clich because her pale features blond hair and overall simpering body language make her an ideal for a young woman about to snap at any moment. Her Carole Ledoux is a obsessive compulsive woman who can't stand to see dust over a chair much less the kiss of another man.She receives no help from her sister Helen Yvonne Furneaux. A woman as outgoing as she is withdrawn there is an implied notion that Helen would rather be living alone than with her sister Carole. It makes me wonder how much of Carole's eventual madness would her character be aware of but then again she is into her own life so that would be unlikely.The only person who seems to want to help Carole who senses there is something wrong with her and is resolved to be with her despite anything is Colin John Fraser but she is too immersed in her own crumbling mind to notice. It's not a help that it ends badly and he winds up in her bathtub which she's already filled with water  why we never know. Once he's gone her mind is free to devolve into its chaos and this chaos is able to finally conquer her until she is in a catatonic haze.Why do people go mad? There is no true explanation for it. There are people who doubt Carole's unraveling mind would have taken place in the way it does but this is exactly what happens not just in this movie but in usual circumstances. Polanski is excellent in establishing her progressive mental decay she listens to a couple make love through the walls of her apartment  itself enhancing her own repressed sexuality a very striking moment of eroticism. She begins acting oddly not only at home but at work even while walking down the street. Polanski uses some experimental jazz to manifest her mind spinning out of control much in the way he used it in some of the more nerve wracking sequences of ROSEMARY'S BABY. About fortyfive minutes into the movie  roughly halfway  we're treated to a blink or miss image of a man standing opposite from Carole reflected in her closet mirror. It's a powerful moment and one that didn't need the shocks used today to make me jump out of my seat. Using odd camera angles photographing people in extreme upside down closeups and showing increasingly imagined scenes of rape Polanski creates a hellish scenario where a woman's mind is torn to pieces and where we can't do anything to stop it but watch. It does add to Deneuve's powerhouse performance that much of her time on screen is spent nearly mute and by herself. Terror because of this becomes an internalized experienced that only becomes external through the set the apartment was modeled on and Deneuve's extreme acting which is a revelation. The mundane even the trivial does a 180 degree turn and becomes chaotic a reflection of reality gone to hell and a beautiful woman turned insideout due to her repressed feelings directed towards her father who at that last haunting shot of the family portrait looks a little like the rapist  disclosing the root of her intability and her hatreddesire of men.REPULSION is a groundbreaking horror film that has become more relevant in recent times with the advance of psychology. Eschewing ghosts for shadows and surreal settings its influence can be seen in the more harrowing moments of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM where Sarah Goldfarb is stalked by her own crumbling mind in her own apartment and a refrigerator suddenly turns homicidal.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes not saying anything in a horror movie and letting a character lose hisher mind in a setting can really get the goosebumps going more so than with the recent 'shockers' of late that all seem to take place within a haunted house or have some kind of ghostly secret. The most frightening thing about Repulsion Roman Polanski's first film in English and filmed in England is that everything that can terrify the audience is within the lead character's mind. In this case the young Catherine Deneuve plays Carole a parttime manicurist who spends most of her time inside of her apartment she shares with her sister. Polanski piles on the atmosphere like fudge on a sundae we literally get thrust inside of her mind as she goes into this downward spiral.It would be one thing if the film was a great success just because of Polanski's tricks with adding true fear into the audience but Deneuve is a big factor in this too. It may be a triumph of underacting or even overacting from a point of view. All through the movie she plays her paranoia and sexual frustration if not repression almost like a kind of doll following orders we can't quite understand. Sometimes she interacts or sees things that are strange i.e. a cooked and eaten rabbit the cracks in the walls springing up but then as the film winds into its climax she becomes perfected into this kind of traumatized crazed creature. She is a beautiful person who plays a not too beautiful being but she somehow pulls it off even better than in her role in Belle du Jour. Bottom line if you're tired of getting disappointed with the latest horror films where unexplained phenomena in a house terrorize its main characters take a look at this film and see if it will leave you when you're finished with it.

Polanski piles on the atmosphere like fudge on a sundae we literally get thrust inside of her mind as she goes into this downward spiral.It would be one thing if the film was a great success just because of Polanski's tricks with adding true fear into the audience but Deneuve is a big factor in this too. It may be a triumph of underacting or even overacting from a point of view. All through the movie she plays her paranoia and sexual frustration if not repression almost like a kind of doll following orders we can't quite understand. Sometimes she interacts or sees things that are strange i.e. a cooked and eaten rabbit the cracks in the walls springing up but then as the film winds into its climax she becomes perfected into this kind of traumatized crazed creature. She is a beautiful person who plays a not too beautiful being but she somehow pulls it off even better than in her role in Belle du Jour. Bottom line if you're tired of getting disappointed with the latest horror films where unexplained phenomena in a house terrorize its main characters take a look at this film and see if it will leave you when you're finished with it.

Polanski's direction is unparalleled as he elicits a creepy terror through the use of some fairly unconventional specialeffects. The subjective world created for the heroine is a series of dreams and visions of a decaying apartment and psychosexual fantasy and this is what the film seems to be about. The cracking walls are perhaps one of the most ingeniously horrifying specialeffects in cinematic history. The lack of dialogue that runs throughout complements the restrained narrative design as the neurotic obsessions remain largely unexplained. But for better or for worse I think better Polanski's final frame settles on an image which cryptically resolves the entire enigma with a kind of devastating efficiency.

Or perhaps it is if they are intruders like Colin and the lecherous landlord who physically assaults her when you live in a society where that kind of abuse is the norm. That would be the point of Repulsion.I'm not really sure what more it would have taken for Polanski to hit home the point. There are no likable males in this picture. In fact there are no sympathetic characters except for Carole. Her sister and and sad Briget her colleague at work are too enmeshed in their pushy jerk boyfriends to think of anything or anyone else. Miss Balch tells it like it is and is unfortunately all too right about Briget's heart breaker boyfriend but the mainstreamers conventionalistconformists traditionalists and other males with an axe to grind will write her off as a woman embittered because she doesn't fit conventional beauty standards. Madame Carole's boss only cares about her inasmuch as her behavior affects business.These four female characters give clues as to what is supposed to be normal women's behavior in this film. They begrudginly endure slappy brusque unattractive creeps complain about them to each other but do nothing whatsoever to alter their unhappy situations impose them on roommates unannounced and without consultation as third roommates it's as if Carole doesn't exist to these normal women except as a gofer and accessory. Not terribly different from the way the men in the film treat her. Handsome impatient Colin isn't the red herring he would appear on first glance he is jokingly advised by his friends to force her to give him what he is naturally entitled to insistently breaking and entering her apartment when she has clearly been avoiding him. He deserved exactly what was coming to him. OK well maybe not outright murder but let that be a lesson to the overzealous...Repulsion's only failure and I consider it massive is that it is apparently too subtle. Even for contemporary audiences content to feign ignorance and repeat over and over that it's the sad tale of a repressed female complete with rape fantasies. It isn't. It's a portrayal of a traumatized woman driven murderously crazy by normalcy and convention imposed on her at every turn. Watch as a double feature with Chinatown 1974 or Fire Walk With Me 1992. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "Carol Ledoux is a young Belgian manicurist living in a flat in London with her older sister Helen and Helen's boyfriend Michael. I note that some reviewers have tried to alter the two women's names to the more authentically Francophone Carole and Helene but Carol and Helen are the spellings which we see in the credits and written down in the film itself. The film tells how Carol kills two men a young admirer named Colin and Helen's sexually predatory landlord. The title Repulsion refers to the repulsion Carol feels towards human sexuality something shown by her reaction to the noise of Helen and Michael's lovemaking a reaction that is far closer to disgust than to embarrassment or annoyance. Carol is obviously mentally disturbed something shown by her demeanour walking around in a seemingly catatonic state and hardly ever speaking to anyone.This was Roman Polanski's first Englishlanguage film and his second feature film following the Polishlanguage Knife in the Water from 1962. It has generally enjoyed a high reputation among Polanski devotees but it has never been a film which I have been able to warm to even though technically it is a good one. It is a psychological horror film influenced by the work of Alfred Hitchcock especially Psycho and the use of blackandwhite photography at a time when colour was becoming the norm may reflect this influence. The use of a singleword title may also have been homage to Hitchcock a lot of his films Saboteur Suspicion Notorious etc. only have one word in the title. Polanski and his cinematographer Gilbert Taylor are able to create a powerful sense of isolation and claustrophobia and there is a particularly frightening dream sequence.The problem with the film is that there is no character with whom the audience can identify or sympathise. In Psycho a brilliant piece of filmmaking Hitchcock is able to make us sympathise not only with his heroine Marion Crane and the other murder victims but also to some extent with their killer Norman Bates who is the victim of his own disturbed mind. Polanski is not able to pull off the same trick. Carol may be mentally ill but that does not mean that the two killings can simply be seen as the acts of a deranged mind. Indeed they might even be seen as justifiable homicide in selfdefence.This is particularly true of the landlord whom Carol kills while he is trying to rape her. Colin may not be a rapist but there is nevertheless something creepy about him. He becomes obsessed with Carol whom he hardly knows and when she rebuffs his advances he breaks into the flat to protest his adoration for her obviously frightening her severely. We cannot therefore really sympathise with Carol's victims the one a wouldbe rapist the other an obsessive creep.So can we sympathise with Carol herself? We certainly could if we understood the cause of her psychological traumas as we do with Norman Bates but we don't. It has been suggested that she may have been sexually abused as a child by her father or another male relative but there is no direct mention of this in the film itself. The only piece of evidence comes in the very last shot of the film which shows an old family photograph including Carol as a child looking at an adult male with what has been described as a look of loathing. On the other hand it might be a look of Oh God Daddy's making me pose for one of these stupid family photos and I just don't want to! Catherine Deneuve's performance is again a technically good one at least as far as Carol's outward demeanour is concerned but we never get much sense of her inner life or even that she actually has an inner life. Carol seems so dead to the world that we never understand why Colin has fallen for her so heavily even though Deneuve was of course strikingly attractive. Repulsion may be a film which engages the head but it is never going to appeal to the heart. 510".

In Psycho a brilliant piece of filmmaking Hitchcock is able to make us sympathise not only with his heroine Marion Crane and the other murder victims but also to some extent with their killer Norman Bates who is the victim of his own disturbed mind. Polanski is not able to pull off the same trick. Carol may be mentally ill but that does not mean that the two killings can simply be seen as the acts of a deranged mind. Indeed they might even be seen as justifiable homicide in selfdefence.This is particularly true of the landlord whom Carol kills while he is trying to rape her. Colin may not be a rapist but there is nevertheless something creepy about him. He becomes obsessed with Carol whom he hardly knows and when she rebuffs his advances he breaks into the flat to protest his adoration for her obviously frightening her severely. We cannot therefore really sympathise with Carol's victims the one a wouldbe rapist the other an obsessive creep.So can we sympathise with Carol herself? We certainly could if we understood the cause of her psychological traumas as we do with Norman Bates but we don't. It has been suggested that she may have been sexually abused as a child by her father or another male relative but there is no direct mention of this in the film itself. The only piece of evidence comes in the very last shot of the film which shows an old family photograph including Carol as a child looking at an adult male with what has been described as a look of loathing. On the other hand it might be a look of Oh God Daddy's making me pose for one of these stupid family photos and I just don't want to! Catherine Deneuve's performance is again a technically good one at least as far as Carol's outward demeanour is concerned but we never get much sense of her inner life or even that she actually has an inner life. Carol seems so dead to the world that we never understand why Colin has fallen for her so heavily even though Deneuve was of course strikingly attractive. Repulsion may be a film which engages the head but it is never going to appeal to the heart. 510";

Repulsion came 3 years later and while a fine film on a purely technical level its psychomindfck ambitions are shredded to pulp by the time the film reaches its close leaving the viewer cold and unfulfilled. While containing some incisive veiled sentiments on how the male and female gender perceive each other from aggression and fear to promiscuity and perversion Repulsion ultimately becomes overshadowed by artistic pretension and symbolism. The surreal plot follows a remote young hairstylist Catherine Deneuve who doesn't say much and finds herself in perpetual fear of the opposite sex solidified in the presence of an inexplicable stranger who 'rapes' her in the middle of the night her paranoia and insecurity only worsens when her sister takes a vacation with her lover and things quite literally begin to fall apart.What's unfortunate about Repulsion is that Polanski doesn't stick the knife in far enough...a few years later he would do a superior study of patriarchal politics with demonic overtones in Rosemary's Baby and even later still an impressive meditation on claustrophobic madness with The Tenant. Both of these films combine the best elements of Repulsion into more satisfying wholes that one would be better off seeking them out instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shocking scary and shot on a shoestring budget Roman Polanski's 1965 horror masterpiece provides a riveting account of a beautiful young woman's unstoppable descent into the madness that turns her into a killer. As someone who finds sex repulsive she feels increasingly threatened by the regular attention she gets from admiring men whose unwanted advances she regards as unpleasant unwelcome and an invasion of her privacy. The discomfort and vulnerability that she feels manifest into something more serious however when during a period of enforced solitude she starts to experience the series of terrifying hallucinations that eventually leave her completely unhinged.Carol Ledoux Catherine Deneuve is a demure young Belgian woman who lives in a London flat with her sister Helen Yvonne Furneaux and works as a manicurist in an upmarket beauty salon where she attends to the needs of the establishment's welloff clientele. Her regular demeanor is so detached distracted and distant that he colleagues and clients often ask if she's fallen asleep. During her walks back and forth to work she seems to be in a trance and is strangely unresponsive whenever she encounters a decent young man named Colin John Fraser who regularly tries to date her.Helen is having an affair with a married man named Michael Ian Hendry and his presence at the flat makes Carol uncomfortable and repulsed by his habit of leaving his toiletries in the bathroom in places that she regards as an invasion of her space. When Helen and Michael leave for a holiday in Italy Carol is left alone and in this state becomes even more withdrawn and agoraphobic. She starts to hear and see cracks appearing in the walls and suffers from frightening hallucinations during which she gets attacked and raped. She becomes so distracted that she lets the bathtub overflow irons her clothes with an unplugged iron and constantly ignores Colin's attempts to contact her. When in his frustration he breaks into the flat Carol kills him by hitting him over the head with a candlestick.Before she went on holiday Helen had cooked a rabbit which had remained on a plate in the flat gradually rotting and becoming a magnet for flies. In her distracted state Carol remains totally unconcerned about the carcass and takes no action to dispose of it. When the landlord Patrick Wymark calls by to collect the rent money he expresses his disgust at the state of the place which he refers to as a pigsty. As he becomes increasingly attracted to Carol he makes some unwanted advances and suggestions which she responds to by repeatedly attacking him with a straight razor until he lies dead on the floor. When Helen returns from her holiday she's naturally completely unprepared for the horrific scene that confronts her.Repulsion is wellpaced to make each successive stage of Carol's breakdown seem perfectly natural and its tense atmosphere is well complemented by Chico Hamilton's often neuroticsounding score. Dialogue is used economically and some of the movie's most powerful passages feature none at all. Distorted images extreme closeups and the use of effects like arms coming out of the walls all add to the sense of unease that permeates the whole film and its circular structure which begins with a closeup of Carol's blanklooking eye as an adult and ends with a chilling closeup of her eyes as a child provides the movie with its satisfying and extremely thoughtprovoking conclusion.From the acting standpoint Catherine Deneuve virtually carries the entire film with an incredibly intense performance that's even more remarkable as this was one of her earliest movies.After having watched Repulsion it's clear that Carol had been in a very troubled and abnormal mental state for many years. This being the case it raises the question of why noone had ever done anything to make sure that she got the help that she so obviously needed and leads to the likelihood that someone wouldn't have wanted the real cause of her psychosis to be known. Whether this is the case or not it's an astonishingly good movie and was clearly years ahead of its time.".

For me it's in the screenplay itself. I expected this movie to explore themes like sex sexism and other things of this nature. But after seeing it I don't think this movie actually explored anything. Perhaps it was trying to say something about human nature. Perhaps it was sending a message about men. But I can't help but to think about Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire 1987. My biggest complaint in my review of that film was that it had an interesting concept but it didn't seem to have anything else. No themes ideas or things of that nature. And I think the exact same applies here.This aside Repulsion 1987 is a fairly good movie. The acting is good for the most part the cinematography is great and the execution of psychological horror is incredible for any decade let alone the 60's. Very few classic horror films have ever managed to disturb me like they did to the people who saw them in theaters but this one actually had some good and original scares.Overall I'm glad I saw it and I would recommend.

There are no twists there is no climax or resolution. Repulsion is just a remarkably impotent descent into madness film that garners no intrigue whatsoever. I haven't felt this burned by an acclaimed classic horror film since I watched Don't Look Now.Neither the main character nor her insanity is ever explained. There aren't any provocative implications towards any such explanations either. It's as if they just decided to make a fraction of a movie. A short story or even a Youtube skit could have properly handled the intended subject matter. Losing one's mind is a concept that has been explored in many films new and old and done right.Repulsion is as bleak as oblivion itself. Not Hitchcock bleak not mindwarping Carnival of Souls bleak bleak as in unfinished. Fractional. We get no backstory on anybody. We see a woman's crazy sister Carol having repetitive hallucinations and blacking out. Over and over. And she does inexplicable things in her house like leaving meat sitting out for days to rot and killing a harmless man who was hopelessly in love with her. We do see a kill scene involving a men's shaving razor but it is laughable. The guy just stands there and takes it while a skinny blonde manically gives him death by a thousand razor blades. Yeah not stabbed. Just slit repeatedly. That is as exciting as it gets in Repulsion. So who is she and why is she crazy? We simply never know enough about Carol to feel anything. Was there a traumatic event during Carol's childhood? Something her sister could attest to? Was there a recent incident that caused her to come unhinged? Was she just always insane? Assuming she was always insane is actually the most plausible conclusion to be drawn since her descent into madness is anything but delicate. She starts off as an introverted bitch that can at least hold down a job but in a matter of a couple days she devolves into a lunatic who can't take care of herself or control urges to kill. But assuming that we must then wonder how did she make it this far in life if she was a homicidal freak with no grip on reality by default? As unbalanced as Polanski decided to make this woman a lifetime of warning signs would have been impossible to miss.There is no place for Repulsion in cinema. I'm not sure if one could make a more ungrounded film if they tried. I can offer no insight into how or why it has gotten the nod of the head from so many critics and audiences for 50 years running now. Do yourself a service and skip it. No matter how eccentric your taste in movies is no matter how patient of a viewer you are do not watch it. There is no redeeming aspect of Repulsion. All historical relevance considered it is simply a miserable piece.".

I can offer no insight into how or why it has gotten the nod of the head from so many critics and audiences for 50 years running now. Do yourself a service and skip it. No matter how eccentric your taste in movies is no matter how patient of a viewer you are do not watch it. There is no redeeming aspect of Repulsion. All historical relevance considered it is simply a miserable piece.";

Oh and the bonus for sitting through this endless borefest is a climax that takes 10 minutes to build up to...nothing.

Granted being better than most teen romantic comedies isn't much of an accomplishment but Loser is a good movie even though I knew what was going to happen.I thought Jason Biggs played his part as Paul very well. He had the loserlike goofiness that inspired quite a few laughs but you could also tell how much the character loved Mena Suvari's character Dora. Greg Kinnear is also very good as Professor Alcott Dora's love interest at the beginning of the movie. When all is said and done Paul comes out as a winner not a Loser because he realizes that you don't have to fit in with everyone else to be cool. That's what really sets this movie apart from lots of other recent teen movies. It does have a point. Obviously it's not extremely deep and it won't change your life or anything but it's still good and it makes the movie very worthwhile.I think that lots of people didn't like this movie because they were expecting something along the lines of American Pie given that both Biggs and Suvari were in that. If you're looking for American Pie you will not like Loser. Although billed as a comedy there are some times when it's downright serious especially further into the movie. If you want nonstop grossout humor Loser is not for you. If however you want to see a good romantic film that's funny at times but serious at other just like real life then I think you will enjoy Loser. Yes the basic plot is quite familiar but there's enough extra stuff to keep it interesting and make it stand out from the crowd of bad teen comedies that have been around lately.Rating 810".

Jason Biggs did pretty all right as the nice country boy lost in the nastiness of the city and Mena Suvari's character complemented his nicely as the girl who makes all the wrong decisions but is really trying to find her way.

	schema:headline " A charming and sweet romantic comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody " out of Loser is a breath of fresh air considering the amount of vulgar comedies American Pie Road Trip and Scary Movie that have been released recently. It relies on little sex and profanity but instead has its success rooted firmly in the acting and charisma of young stars Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari.The film centers around Paul Tannek Jason Biggs an allaround nice guy from a small town who is now going to college in a big city due to a scholarship he's received.  His personality is a contrast to most people around him particularly his roommates who like to party all night and taunt Paul.  Because of his kindness and his apt studying each night he's considered a loser.Yet not everything is bad for Paul.  He's met a girl Dora Mena Suvari in his European Literature class and he develops a fast crush on her. However he doesn't know that she's secretly having a relationship with the class's teacher Professor Alcott Greg Kinnear.  After some mishaps involving a party Paul begins to develop a strong friendship with Dora and his feelings for her begin to go even farther as he wonders if he even has a chance to have a relationship with her.A warning before watching this film if you're expecting similar antics from Biggs in American Pie prepared to be disappointed.  Loser is a contrast to that movie.  It prefers to develop relationships rather than put in some sort of sex joke and it's all the better for it.  True there aren't exactly a huge amount of belly laughs in the proceedings but it's always entertaining fast witty and charming.As I said before the movie's success lies squarely on the shoulders of Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari and they're as good as ever.  Biggs niceguy performance is his best to date and he creates one of the most genuinely likeable and true characters I've seen in movies for a while.  Suvari is equally appealing as the role of a girl whose also kind but is mixed up in the wrong relationship.  The chemistry between them is strong and the best praise I can give this film is the fact that I cared for their characters and wanted to see them get together.The other performances are suitable enough.  The other standout is probably Greg Kinnear as the professor whose smug performance makes hims a character easy to hate.  There are also appearances from wellknown comics like Andy Dick and David Spade and their brief cameos bring a few good laughs.Amy Heckerling wrote and directed this film and while her script may be rather predictable her direction is still good and she shows the same talent she had in the 80's.  This may not be her funniest film but it's easily the most likeable.Loser also has other little elements that work to its advantage.  The film features a good soundtrack playing songs that are actually appealing and also work with the scenes and situations it's played along with. With standout performances excellent chemistry between the two leads Loser is a great date movie and one you certainly cannot pass up if you're a fan of both Biggs and Suvari.  This is definitely the most pleasant surprise I've seen in a long time.".

	onyx:emotionText " out of Loser is a breath of fresh air considering the amount of vulgar comedies American Pie Road Trip and Scary Movie that have been released recently. It relies on little sex and profanity but instead has its success rooted firmly in the acting and charisma of young stars Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari.The film centers around Paul Tannek Jason Biggs an allaround nice guy from a small town who is now going to college in a big city due to a scholarship he's received.  His personality is a contrast to most people around him particularly his roommates who like to party all night and taunt Paul.  Because of his kindness and his apt studying each night he's considered a loser.Yet not everything is bad for Paul.  He's met a girl Dora Mena Suvari in his European Literature class and he develops a fast crush on her. However he doesn't know that she's secretly having a relationship with the class's teacher Professor Alcott Greg Kinnear.

Mena Suvari plays 'the girl' and as usual for Suvari she comes across as annoying and not nearly as smart as her character is supposed to be.If you are looking for the next Clueless check out I Could Never Be Your Woman 2007 it better matches Heckerling's potential.

Most of jokes were about Jason Biggs character and it wasn't very funny actually it made me feel sorry for him. But anyways the movie itself was great. So if you are expecting this movie to be funny you may be disappointed but on the other hand it's a great love story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Time and time again I've seen trailers for movies that look absolutely awful but then when I saw the movie itself I saw that the trailer had mislead me completely. Such is the case of Loser. Although promoted as a simple 'two misfits meet  fall in love' story this film actually has a far more involved plot than that. It's also not a straight light comedy contrary to popular belief. Loser is a semiserious dramedy and it functions incredibly well that way. It also has one of the best romance developments of any movie I've seen. It's a heck of a lot more realistic than the cheesefests of several decades ago.I normally don't think much of Jason Biggs. Basically all he's good for is teen comedies or so I thought until I saw him as Paul in Loser. We finally get a performance out of him that actually has some merit to it. Plus he has great chemistry with his leading lady.I also am not a fan of Mena Suvari. Most of her roles lack any depth of character portrayal and the fact that she usually looks pretty bad doesn't help an actress who often plays hotties. But as Dora I see the first Suvari part I've ever actually liked. She really does convey the character superbly and for once she really looks as cute as the rest of the cast says.Greg Kinnear pulls off his usual fine portrayal of the sleazy conceited guy in this case a professor named Alcott.Assorted cameos Dan Aykroyd David Spade etc. fit the situations like gloves and never seem forced like they do in other movies. These were cameos because the actors wanted to do it not because the director wanted them. The supporting parts like the roommates were done well as well. Yes I realize I just said well as well.small spoilers ahead. very small.I hear people complain that the underplot about the drugs was too funny. But those people failed to notice that the plan DIDN'T WORK which is the reason that the story could be handled so lightly. And I hear people complain about the fates of the 3 roomies. But those people failed to see the comedy at play. For some reason they have trouble comprehending that Loser is both serious and funny.Loser is a good movie. No great classic but enjoyable worthwhile and wellpresented. Go check it out. But make sure you rent the tape BEFORE you pick up the pizza.".

If she's trying to show high school kids the problems and unexpected strife of college life in a metropolis then she should have shown that world in a more focused way. If she's trying to be funny and quirky for the older subset than her characters should have been better written and less dickish. Besides being clinically underwritten it's difficult to figure out who is the lead character or at least the person we're supposed to sympathize with. Throughout the film we follow Paul Biggs and it seems that he is our protagonist. We feel for him when his dorm mates are mean spirited when the girl of his dreams is misguided and when everything tries to keep him from getting through school but he lacks character development. He goes through hard times but there's no resolution to be seen and he doesn't change at all. Dora Suvari on the other hand has a mess of bad things happen to her and then she changes her opinion about her relationship with her professor Kinnear which means she's the only character who evolves throughout the film. It seems that we should be following her but then interwoven in her tale is that of Paul's who just seems like some poor schmuck who never wins. Without any proper direction for our characters and no change in their behaviors or thoughts on the world there shouldn't really be any reason for this film to exist. It's trying to show the problems of college students but it doesn't realistically depict them. Paul's three roommates are also pretty distracting as they're rich sycophantic rapists who don't seem to get much comeuppance until the credits. Besides its plot defects it's also drab and very of its time making this film a tiring slog.".

Just when you think you have this film's plot pigeon holed it takes you in a different direction. THREE BURIALS OF MELQUIADES ESTRADA is in part a revenge story but it's also much more than that. There are no one dimensional characters. As much as you want to hate Barry Pepper's numbed border patrol officer you can't help but feel sorry for him. And Tommy Lee Jones' Pete will break your heart. He and Pepper have never been better and Jones' direction is natural and subtle. My only problem with the film was sometimes it got a little too quirky for its own good. But for the most part I believed every moment and really cared for these lost characters. It's one of those films that really leaves you thinking about a lot of stuff from mortality and loss to the very real problems of racism and inhumanity. It's never preachy or self aware and isn't out to impress it's just telling a story. I highly recommend this movie. It's by far one of the best films I've seen recently.".

	schema:headline " Bring me the body of Melquiades Estrada";
	schema:reviewBody "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada2005 Tommy Lee Jones steps up to the plate and takes a big first swing with 'Three Burials.' This is a movie that captures the old Peckinpahesquire style of the rugged west and combines wonderfully with Guillermo Arriaga's moody and alienated script. This is a film that could have took a political mood and dealt with the issues of border security and the like but it smartly refrains from doing so and instead focuses sharply on the heart of society itself  people. Tommy Lee Jones plays Pete a rancher who has few friends with his closest friends being a woman from town and a man from Mexico. The woman is the wife of a local diner owner Rachael Melissa Leo. She also happens to be extremely bored and engages in extramarital affairs. Pete loves her but she loves her husband. And possibly the sheriff and possibly Pete. The other emotional connection in Pete's life the Mexican is Melquiades Estrada Julio Cedillo an illegal immigrant who finds work and friendship with Pete. Pete loves him like a son or a brother or friend or a combination of all three. Barry Pepper plays Mike the new border patrolman in town. He is brutal. Perhaps by nature or not. He is bored he passes the time sitting outside of his jeep looking at dirty mags. His wife Lou Ann January Jones is also bored. She feels isolated and separated from her husband. She spends her time at the local diner and befriends Rachael. While she sits at home her husband the rookie border patrolman makes a stupid mistake and tries in vain to hide it. The whole town is bored even the police and the border guards. They find out the police find out and in a small town people talk but more importantly people listen because they have nothing else to do. Pete finds out about Mike's mistake and sets out to carry out Mel's last wishes and bury him in his home town back in Mexico. The story has its characters and connects them in ways that we don't always suspect they will connect. No one is a cardboard cut out. Even better no one is simple. Each character is complex and has their own distinct feelings. A major theme is that of alienation. The characters are alienated not only from each other but from themselves as well. Earlier i stated that he film took the right road and avoids making a blatant political message. The movie still carries a message though. It is a commentary on life and society. The story has parallels to Peckinpah's 'Bring me the Head of Alfedo Garcia.' It has a very Peckinpah style and features a man who makes a long journey with a dead body. He cares for it and tries to preserve it even talks to the body sometimes. The film has some great cinematography as well and the score suits it perfectly. The acting is wonderful and I have to say that Tommy Lee Jones has rarely ever been better than he is here. Barry Pepper also gives a solid performance. This is Tommy Lee Jones first directing credit in major film and he knocks this one out of the park. Jones clearly has a strong control of his movie and this should go down in history as one of those rare first time wonders. 44".

When his ranch hand is killed under mysterious circumstances Pete jumps into action. Pete wants to take his friend Melquiades Estrada across the border to Mexico to make sure he receives the proper burial he deserves. A coyote has lead to the first burial site and the following investigation involves the local sheriff Belmont but Pete will have none of that.Pete's investigation leads him to the corrupt border guard Mike Norton. Perkins captures the man and with the body strapped to a horse and his captive in another Pete begins the long journey to Mexico. He passes the hot land between the two countries in a voyage that will bring Melquiades to his home.The separate narratives at the beginning of the film are somehow confusing and the viewer is advised to pay close attention to it since it has multiple stories going on at a time when we don't know much of what is happening. We get to meet the cruel Norton and his bored wife Lou Ann. It also serve as the way to tell us how Pete and Norton meet.Tommy Lee Jones with his rugged looks brings a tremendous presence to his own film. Mr. Jones is a decent man who can't stand the injustice his hired hand suffered as he delves into solving the mystery of Melquiades' death. Barry Pepper is quite good as the nasty Mike Norton a man who gets much more than what he bargained for. Dwight Yoakam January Jones and Melissa Leo are seen in minor roles. Julio Cedillo plays the dead man Melquiades Estrada.Tommy Lee Jones is blessed to be working on his first venture with the great cinematographer Chris Menges.

The editing of Roberto Silvi sets the tone for the early part of the movie.The Three Deaths of Melquiades Estrada shows us a mature Tommy Lee Jones who has learned his lesson well in front of the camera.

But the attention to detail brings this movie to such heights of perfection that you cannot help but twist your face into a satisfying grin while the movie is on and for much time afterwards.";

Written by Guillermo Arriaga also writer of Amores Perros and 21 grams and the first movie of Tommy Lee Jones as a director but also lead actor The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada tells the story of Ranch hand Pete Perkins Tommy Lee Jones who wants to fulfill the promise he made to his recently deceased Mexican friend by burying him in his hometown in Mexico. The power of this modern western and initiatic journey resides in the complexity of the characters their depth and their controversial behavior. None of the protagonists are one dimensional none of them are right or wrong but all of them do right and wrong things. They are not always rational and most of the time they feel lost. In one word they all appear profoundly human. Build over a chase dynamic fueled with contrasts and paradoxes the film opposes Wild West landscape and Modern carton built houses 4WD tracking hunt and horse back journey fake TV soaps and true friendship but maybe most of all Freedom and Prison. Indeed most if not all characters are trapped in their apathetic lives from which they can't or don't want to escape forcing us to ask ourselves how close is our lives to the spectacle projected in front of our eyes. Melquiades Estrada embodies this possibility of Escape and now that he has been buried 3 times he transcends this Freedom making redemption possible not only through death but also through rebirth suggesting that nobody is beyond it.".

The film is slow at times but gets it point across well and I believe those instances in the film where not much is going on actually help it in order to put things in perspective for us viewers. The cinematography is artistically beautiful while the score screenplay from Guillermo Arriaga who also appears in the film and the performancer are firstrate. Amazing how films like this go virtually overlooked in the press and eyes of mainstream American cinemagoers. This film deserves to get all the nomination and award hype that less worthy stuff like Brokeback mountain or even Walk the line have received. This is a true masterpiece from Tommy Lee Jones who proves hes just as credible in directing as in acting. 1010".

He has made some really great performances in the movies JFK Heaven  Earth and The Fugitive. And otherwise he has always been good although he got some typecast in some stereotype roles. In 1995 he debuted as a director on TV with the movie The Good Old Boys which I sadly haven't seen. Now he has joined some of his famous and acknowledged colleges like Clint Eastwood Mel Gibson Denzel Washington and made the step from actor to actor  director in his own very first motion picture  The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.In this movie Tommy plays the lead as Pete Perkins who under some mysterious circumstances finds out that his best friend has got killed. As a consequence of this he reacts strong and dramatically wanting to fulfil his old promise to his now gone friend.The script is written by Guillermo Arriaga and he mixes the characters and the beautiful landscape into an original story dealing with many subjects. As said before the movie is beautifully filmed and good edited. Aside from the director the shooting star  Barry Pepper  delivers another very good and solid performance! He is a very good actor which I hope to see a lot from in the future All in all a solid and good piece of movie craft from Tommy Lee Jones which I know respect more than ever! 810".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING  THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES THE ENDING There are some films that you just don't know what to make of at first. The Western  period or otherwise  remains the definitive genre for portraying warped morality plays packed with layered themes and dense symbolism but I found this one more difficult than many. I feel that to appreciate a film I have to get to grips with the leading players' motivations but in a film where the supposed hero is a lunatic who's blown an unremarkable event up to absurd levels what am I supposed to do? The answer is to constantly ask questions about the film. The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada offers no particular answers of its own but it remains accommodating to whichever possibilities you wish to assign it. The lead question of course is what has driven Pete Perkins Tommy Lee Jones to such extreme measures. Whether the attitude of Patrolman Norton Barry Pepper ever actually changes is another obvious one. But this is a film on which obvious answers to obvious questions are only going to shed a limited amount of light. Why for example the cuts back to the dessicated border town where the citizens have no way to pass the time except to sit in a diner and smoke or to have casual sex with people in motel rooms? Most importantly what would Pete do if Melquiades Julio Cedillo had been buried in a pauper's grave having died of a heart attack? In the end I came away very impressed but still feeling that I'd missed many of the nuances.The first half of the film uses complex chronological fragmentation to give the viewer an immense amount of information in a small space of time by allowing us for example to observe an event knowing what its consequences are going to be. It also disrupts any sense of empathy by not allowing us to watch the characters' emotions progress in a linear fashion in a sense these early scenes become semiindependent vignettes. They allow us to identify early on what turns out retrospectively to the characters to be a key scene a promise that rancher Pete makes to his illegal immigrant labourer Melquiades to take his body home should he die in America. This fateful conversation takes a central role in Pete's motivations when Melquiades is later accidentally shot and killed by pigheaded border patrolman Mike Norton in a moment of carelessness. When Pete learns who killed his friend and realises that the local police don't plan to do anything about it he decides to take matters into his own hands.So far so good. But Pete's idea of revenge is anything but simple. It's not enough to gun down Mike as Mike did Melquiades. Mike must be shriven. He must suffer in the desert. He must realise exactly what he did. As his estranged wife Lou Ann January Jones lounges in a diner muttering through her ennui that her husband is beyond redemption he is busy atoning for his sins albeit against his will by returning the festering corpse of his accidental victim back to his home village. If my use of religious terms seems pretentious then I'd like to point out that there's a scene where Mike is dunked in a river. Admittedly he's dragged through it by a horse but I never claimed that allusions have to be airtight. We don't like Mike but we grow to sympathise with him. He's certainly closer to being redeemed at the end of the film than Lou Ann is. That might just be what drives Pete to his extreme course of action of kidnapping Mike digging up Melquiades and carrying them both off on horseback towards Mexico however insane at least someone in the town is actually doing something. As such the old man in the desert begging to be euthanised becomes a weird living prophecy of the town's future he could easily be all that's left of a similarly dead town in a symbolic sense at least.What takes the film deeper into surrealism is the ending where it is revealed that Melquiades to an unknown extent and for unknown reasons has lied to Pete. The little village of Jimnez where he wanted to be buried doesn't exist. The woman he claimed was his wife is nothing of the sort and cannot understand how Pete has come to possess a photograph of herself and her children. As it happens this is only a minor setback for Pete who quickly locates a suitable spot out in the hills that looks about right based on the background of the photograph he's got. And like that with Melquiades's final burial the film is virtually over. It just lingers on the face of Norton whose brutal lesson is now complete asking the departing Pete if he'll be okay. He has gone from the film's least sympathetic character to it's virtual hero a man who made a terrible error through thoughtlessness and was made to pay for it in the most painful way possible. A satisfying transition to watch.The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada is a grotesque and extremely complicated portrait of a madman out to do the right thing in a world where right and wrong have been hopelessly skewed. This meaty concept is what makes it such a satisfying film and why there's still very little that can top a good Western.".

They really really kill people weakened by travel forced labor deprivation and lack of a hat in the desert.b. Law enforcement is not that venal. Venal yesjust not THAT venal or impotent.c. Also which is it? Sheriff and I.N.S. work together or they don't?d. Sixty grand for a singlewide in Van Horn? Fiftyfour? Got to assume that this is prior to the current realty reality.e. Man 1 is shot by Man 2. By wild cinematic coincidence Man 1 has been indiscreet with the wife of Man 2 but only because Man 3 has induced him to do so? The mind boggles.f. How exactly were three distant cowpokes watching soaps they couldn't understand with excess food they freely give away?SPOILER. The movie's title gives away the ending.";

And it is revealed that the guard's wife had sex with the Mexican  but with no character development this is simply unfathomable. This utter lack of character development is the inherent problem with the film and it renders most of the characters' actions to be inexplicable. Moreover we are expected to sympathise with the Mexican immigrants yet without any of the protagonists in the film being any more than almost comic stereotypes I was left completely cold. I agree that the politics are sledgehammer PC but this would not have bothered me at all if the film hadn't been so lacklustre. Unfortunately despite the excellent acting of Barry Pepper as the border guard this film is as vacant as the Texan desert in which it is set.".

	schema:reviewBody "A bit of a disappointment since I was expecting it to be one of the best films of 2005 but it still ended up being a gritty and superblyacted modern western. The film is split into four acts but it's really just two halves. The first half is interesting yet it jumps around too much between characters and time periods that one gets completely lost and begins to misunderstand where he's even at in the film's sequence of events. The second half is completely linear but ends up being very dull and filled with meaningless plot devices like a snake bite and an old blind man who just wants someone to kill him. But don't get me wrong the film definitely has it's fair share of good points as well. The acting is superb. Everyone from Tommy Lee Jones to Barry Pepper to January Jones are incredible though none of them really shines above the rest of the cast. The cinematography is also topnotch and does a great job of setting up the ambiance and scenery for a film as bleak and dull in tone as the life of a border patrolman is. Overall it's just a run of the mill film that tries some new tricks with the screenplay and completely gives that up in the second half for good reason.".

Sadly it also exhibits some annoying OhSoPC twaddle so prevalent among certain Hollywood types. For example every Mexican in this movie is charming sincere honest and kind.

But aside from the clear danger of approaching half a dozen armed strangers in the wilderness regardless of their ethnic background Jones and Barry Pepper as the two Americans simply stroll into the armed camp without any thought whatsoever for caution or protocol or safety. They just assumed and expected us to assume that these Mexicans would be Hollywood stereotypes of civility innocence and simply beaming with the luster of the all too common 'Peasant Myth' i.e. all peasants and poor people are happy good and simply waiting for The Man to allow them a chance to plant their gardens care for their communities and feed the world's poor etc..Undoubtedly there are many many wonderful innocent and trustworthy folks in the third world. Undoubtedly an opportunity or two might serve them well. But the oversimple and mawkish way it is presented here is naivet to the extreme. On the one hand when the trappings of modern Western culture are stripped away as they are in the crappy Texas border town where the movie begins you get banality and despair.When the American fugitives arrive at a crappy Mexican village in the middle of the wilderness on the other hand there are gay twinkle lights charming homemade and rustic music couples and neighbors and family members chatting away with love and affection for each other. Isn't poverty grand? And aren't third world people just the absolute bestest ever? And aren't Westerners too jaded too artificial and too banal for words? Anyway that's the Peasant Myth. Personally I do not believe it for a moment. I have been to the third world several places at several times and let me say there is a REASON why those people are so desperate to leave it. Those places are horrible! Only in the guiltridden fantasies of Hollywood multimillionaires does the Peasant Myth make any sense at all.Having said all that this movie nonetheless has charm. For example if the movie had NOT used Mexicans versus Americans as a political subtext it would be a profoundly powerful movie. As it is the posturing of the Hollwood rich kid elite spoils it a bit and makes it merely a good movie.Clearly Pepper and Jones do a stupendous job of acting. Certainly Oscar worthy.

	schema:reviewBody "There is little doubt that Tommy Lee Jones has potential as an absurdist filmmaker but this snail'spaced oddly discomforting 2005 film is neither a mythic tale nor a prodigious directorial debut for the veteran actor. The pokey momentum and arid West Texas locations remind me a bit of Bruce Beresford's 1983 Tender Mercies but Guillermo Arriaga's screenplay lifts the intriguing plot device of Sam Peckinpah's 1974 Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia to move the story forward. Unfortunately the resulting film does not come close to either classic because of its unsavory characters implausible and often irrelevant story turns and worst of all the deadening pace of the whole venture.It focuses on local rancher Pete Perkins who finds out through the local sleeparound waitress that his friend and ranch hand Melquiades Estrada an Illegal Mexican immigrant has been shot dead by a new border patrolman named Mike Norton. The first half of the overlong film shifts back and forth in time and bounces among characters that may or may not matter at the end while the second half is a desultory trek where Perkins is intent on bringing Estrada's decaying body back across the border to his hometown. This is where the absurdist aspect comes to fruition as Perkins goes to extreme measures to preserve the body and the intent of the mission. I was hopeful the more straightforward narrative that takes hold on the journey would lead to a greater emotional resonance but what it really does is elongate the story unnecessarily.Jones is fine as Perkins though his character is mostly a cipher as we are never clear why Estrada is that meaningful a friend to him. Barry Pepper has an unenviable task playing the surly Norton and he bears the brunt of the plot's absurdities in the second half. Dwight Yoakam portrays the local sheriff on one consistently sour note though there are decent sideline contributions by Julio Cedillo as Estrada and Melissa Leo as the waitress. Levon Helm shows up in a cameo as an old blind farmer but I couldn't help but be reminded of Gene Hackman's bit as the blind monk in Young Frankenstein. Give credit to Chris Menges for his appropriately sunscorched cinematography of the desolate terrain.

	onyx:emotionText "There is little doubt that Tommy Lee Jones has potential as an absurdist filmmaker but this snail'spaced oddly discomforting 2005 film is neither a mythic tale nor a prodigious directorial debut for the veteran actor. The pokey momentum and arid West Texas locations remind me a bit of Bruce Beresford's 1983 Tender Mercies but Guillermo Arriaga's screenplay lifts the intriguing plot device of Sam Peckinpah's 1974 Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia to move the story forward. Unfortunately the resulting film does not come close to either classic because of its unsavory characters implausible and often irrelevant story turns and worst of all the deadening pace of the whole venture.It focuses on local rancher Pete Perkins who finds out through the local sleeparound waitress that his friend and ranch hand Melquiades Estrada an Illegal Mexican immigrant has been shot dead by a new border patrolman named Mike Norton. The first half of the overlong film shifts back and forth in time and bounces among characters that may or may not matter at the end while the second half is a desultory trek where Perkins is intent on bringing Estrada's decaying body back across the border to his hometown. This is where the absurdist aspect comes to fruition as Perkins goes to extreme measures to preserve the body and the intent of the mission. I was hopeful the more straightforward narrative that takes hold on the journey would lead to a greater emotional resonance but what it really does is elongate the story unnecessarily.Jones is fine as Perkins though his character is mostly a cipher as we are never clear why Estrada is that meaningful a friend to him. Barry Pepper has an unenviable task playing the surly Norton and he bears the brunt of the plot's absurdities in the second half. Dwight Yoakam portrays the local sheriff on one consistently sour note though there are decent sideline contributions by Julio Cedillo as Estrada and Melissa Leo as the waitress. Levon Helm shows up in a cameo as an old blind farmer but I couldn't help but be reminded of Gene Hackman's bit as the blind monk in Young Frankenstein. Give credit to Chris Menges for his appropriately sunscorched cinematography of the desolate terrain. The DVD is sparse on extras  a fullscreen or widescreen viewing option and a relatively terse commentary track by Jones Yoakam and actress January Jones who has a redherring role as Norton's bored wife Lou Ann.

Jones' character lacks the necessary dimension to make him fully convincing and his friendship with the title character isn't shown developing enough to justify the actions Jones' character undertakes on his behalf. And the film is also unjustifiably grotesque  to the point of almost being comical andor offensive. Also this film's denouement is guaranteed to have you scratching your head wondering if you missed something. Guaranteed. Solid directing from Jones but again its downfall is the screenplay and its many shortcomings oversights and illconceived and poorlyrealized ideas.

The situation of the poor Mexican people living in that no man's land and the stereotypical alienation and arrogance of the border patrolmen are also very impressive.

The subprofessional screenwriter .....of this movie..... Arriaga then reaches for the blow torch again when the Barry Pepper character 'escapes' from captivity and enters a cave to hide only to be bitten by a rattlesnake! .....how this beatenup man dispirited exhausted malnourished riding without a hat in the daytime Mexican sun then slung over a horse and riding for unknown hours over rough terrain could survive a rattlesnake bite is another story whopper too...... There were other fanciful inventions like the ones mentioned but on to other problems with this movie. Repeated flashbacks can be acceptable in telling a story but only when the question is answered Would the story work better being told in a more linear fashion? During the early parts of Three Burials I was confused several times when characters I was just beginning to learn about were time shifted backwards. For this viewer the confusion this caused wasn't worth the effort itself and the story would have been clearer had they told it straight forward. .....Plus later on this creaky device is just dropped from the movie altogether!..... Something else now Is Arriaga making a political statement by showing virtually all of the white Americans as defectives in one way or another while all the Latino's are benign generous and overall good guys? More The character played by Jones is certifiably insane. Really weird guy. Next In brief but numerous flashbacks they show the relationship between Pete and Melquiades as a deep one of mutual trust and affection. How then to deal with the duplicity of Melquiades in telling Pete about his nonexistent family in Jimenez? Is this something you would do to a good friend when talking about your death and how you would want your family notified? It's pathological and calls into question M.'s character. Finally Three burials take place. The final one after all the tedious agony Pete's gone through to have it occur is a halfass job with the body not even deeplyfully buried. The local animals would have his remains eaten and spread all over the place assuming of course that there would be anything edible after all the amateur embalming that has taken place. PS Why the need to show the corpse over and over again?".

The submarine interior including the conning tower brought back a lot of memories. The crew terminology and actions were true to form. The gliches were few but only a submarine historian or WWII veteran would pick up on most of them. The opening scene of the ship in the periscope is not the same ship shown a few seconds later in actual footage being sunk. Also in 19421943 torpedo reliability was low and very seldom would only one be fired. I doubt that if a Captain would have known there were prisoners aboard a transport would the chance be taken as Barney Doyle took. At least one transport was really sunk carrying prisoners but it was not marked as such and it was proceeding as a normal transport. All in all this is my favorite sub movie and I enjoyed every minute if it. Some seem to think it drags on and the story line is to simplistic. That's how it was. A sub's duty was to sink enemy shipping and there would be days of boredom followed by hours of gut wrenching tension amid depth charging and constantly being chased under by aircraft. I highly recommend TORPEDO RUN.".

The director Joseph Pevney does a good job of creating an atmosphere of tension as the Americans hunt down the prize of the Japanese fleetthe ship which ultimately costs Doyle his family. My favorite scene is when the American sub sneaks into Tokyo Bay in search of the Japanese carrier. Admittedly Torpedo Run is not as gritty and intense as Das Boot nor is it as actionpacked as The Hunt For Red October but in its own way it is on par with both of these fine films. If you like 1950s WWII movies or if you're a Glenn Ford fan you can't miss with Torpedo Run. It's one of those movies I have to watch at least a couple of times each year.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1942 the commander of the submarine USS Grayfish Barney Doyle Glenn Ford commands a motley crew such as  Lt. Jake 'Fuzz' Foley Dean Jones  'Hash' Benson L.Q. Jones  Lt. Redley Robert Hardy  Lt. Burt Fisher Paul Picerni and especially the secondin command Lt. Archer 'Archie' Sloan Ernest Borgnine with whom Barney has a special relationship . Doyle is a stiff captain who plans to sink a Japanese carrier . As their main target is the Japanese aircraft Akagi which led the attack on Pearl Harbor. But there is a freighter in the way  and on board are his wife and child . Doyle is tormented by the fact that his spouse and baby daughter were taken prisoner when the Japanese invaded the Philippines and he has no word from them for almost 10 months . They're really prisoners of the Japs and whom we have grown to love in flashbacks . Shortly after  Barney is overjoyed when reliable sources confirm that they are alive . There was good reason for the Japanese to let him know however  all of the civilians are being transported to Japan . At the end takes place the confrontation and square off in the Pacific Ocean and Tokyo bay . Standards submarine melodramatics about an US submarine that must torpedo a Japanese carrier which holds some of the crews family members . Glenn Ford gives a good acting as an able ship's captain well respected by his men and effective at sea  who pursues the ship that led the attack on Pear Harbour back Tokyo . Although the film relies heavily on the deep relationship between Lt. Cmdr. Barney DoyleGlenn Ford and Lt. Archer 'Archie' SloanErnest Borgnine . This nailbiter is a tightlyknit drama centered on the relentless sea maneuvers of a sub going after a carrier and vice versa . Sometimes slow  generally worthwhile watching . As a main premise results to be an engaging issue  a ship transporting his family is acting as a shield for the Akagi carrier forcing Doyle to make a terrible decision as his country comes first and he blows the freighter out of water . The film is known as one of the most famous WWII submarine movies though some scenes at sea however suffer from the utilization of obvious models in a just as obvious studio tank . Secondary cast is frankly good such as  Diane Brewster Dean Jones  L.Q. Jones  Philip Ober  Richard Carlyle and Robert Hardy . George J. Folsey's colorful and vivid cinematography  including spectacular maritime scenes  set in the Pacific Ocean of World War II  in fact  this movie's ocean scenes were filmed in the Pacific Ocean. .MetroGoldwynMayer MGM 1958 wishes to thank the Department of Defense and the United States Navy for their assistance in the production of this motion picture.The motion picture was professionally directed by Joseph Pevney who also made other WWII films as Away all boats. Pevney shot all kinds of genres as Comedy  Film Noir  Mystery  Drama  such as  Who is the black Dahilia ? The strange door Man of a thousand faces Mysterious Island of beautiful women Cash McCall Tammy and the bachelor Istanbul Because of you and Westerns as Night of Grizzly .This Torpedo run represents one of a select group of a few World War II submarine movies which have won the one single Academy Award in a technical category that's just only the one Oscar in either special effects or sound editing. These movies include Crash Dive  Enemy below 57 by Dick Powell with Curt Jurgens Robert Mitchum  and U571. The nonWW II submovie The Hunt for Red October also won just the one Oscar as did the WW 2 part submovie 49th Parallel  but for Best Original Story .

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of these films that we don't get nowadays and hasn't been produced for decades . Hardly surprising since 1945 only two submarines have killed ships in conflict . The first one being the Pakistani submarine PNS Hangor that sunk the Indian frigate INS Khukri in the 1971 India  Pakistan war and the last time was the Argentine Cruiser The General Belgrano being sunk by HMS Conqueror in the 1982 Falklands War . On top of the 1981 movie DAS BOOT has got to be the last word on this sub genre of war movie . It's very easy to express tension in these type of movies  of having silent routine as enemy ships patrol over head dropping depth charges and have close ups of submarine crewmen with beads of sweat slowly dripping down there foreheads but DAS BOOT did this type of drama so effectively and so vividly any successor would be a very pale imitation TORPEDO RUN on its own merits isn't a bad film . It doesn't break any new ground but follows the formula rather well . Like so many other films especially American war films there's a fair bit of artistic licence used such as no American submarine actually penetrated the Tokyo harbour during the war and the mega massive Japanese aircraft carrier is an invention for the film . There is a slightly annoying aspect and that is many of the model shots look unconvincing but this is common problem seeing as scale involving fire and water are impossible to achieve on screen and even DAS BOOT suffered slightly from this One thing the film does deserve great credit for is the British character Lt Redley played by Robert Hardy . All too often recent American productions such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BAND OF BROTHERS portray the Brits as either amateurish buffoons needing rescuing by the tough  brave and resourceful Americans or make an already bad situation much worse leaving the hard pressed Americans to pick up the pieces while the British stop to drink some tea . Here we see Redley put forward a suggestion that gets the crew out of a very tight spot . Nice to see the war shown as a joint effort amongst allies who had a mutual respect for one another".

The flashbacks to civilian life also take the audience out of the war story in a way that releases any builtup tension.  Then the movie has to start all over.The effects are also not terribly good even by 1958 standards.  Too many model shots of ships and the interior of the sub really does feel like a studio set especially due to the lighting design.One thing that is especially interesting about TORPEDO RUN is a sub evacuation sequence in which the seamen exit the submarine at the floor of the ocean using Momsenlungs special breathing devices.  These devices are very rarely shown in submarine movies.A much much better sub movie was released a few months before this one RUN SILENT RUN DEEP.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie has a pretty interesting approach for '50's standards by inserting lots of flashback sequences with the homefront that however also happen to be incredibly sappy. It does at parts make the movie a melodramatic one.Submarine movies just never have been any of the best or most exciting action packed movies because of their restraints with a couple of well known exceptions of course. The movie has a good beginning but as it heads toward the ending the movie starts to drag and become less interesting when the movie becomes more personal and gets filled with some more emotional aspects.It even manages to put in a personal and family dramatic main plotline in the movie. What an accomplishment for a submarine movie! Yes it helps to make the movie more original and less formulaic but it also of course isn't the most interesting approach thinkable especially not since it gets stretched out for the movie its entire duration.The miniature effects were pretty good looking. I mean I have seen far worse even from movies that were made much later. Although they are hard from convincing by todays standards of course.Glenn Ford was a great choice for the main lead as the tough looking but sensitive commander. Ernest Borgnine forms a good duo with him as the submarine's lieutenant. The rest of the character remain mostly in the back.A decent enough genre attempt.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Barney Doyle Glenn Ford is pursuing the Japanese ship that led the attack on Pearl Harbor back to Tokyo where to all intents and purposes he plans to enact revenge. But there's a major problem in the form of a freighter that is being used as a screen in front of the ship. For this freighter houses American prisoners of war among them Doyle's own wife and child.A well put together psychological thriller by director Joseph Pevney that is formed from a novel by Richard Sale who cowrites the screenplay with William Wister Haines. Tho the usual problems that exist with WW2 film's from this era are evident here racist undertones jingoistic sloganeering  hierarchy back slapping Torpedo Run manages to break away from its inheritance to become a taut involving aquatic drama fit to be named alongside the best in the submarine subgenre of war movies.Glenn Ford's performance is well layered and credible. Few actors from his generation are as undervalued for playing personally conflicted characters as he is and here as Doyle he is on top characterisation form. He is ably supported by Ernest Borgnine as Lt. Archer 'Archie' Sloan Doyle's right hand man friend and professional conscious. It's with the two actors that the plot rightly focuses on but this sadly puts the supporting characters in the shade. Thus the one truly important thing lacking from the piece is a total group dynamic expose. But thanks to the strong lead performances and Pevney's no tricks directing the film survives its failing. There's also added weight thrown into the narrative with the use of flashbacks to show how Doyle's relationship with his wife evolved. This helps us to be privy to Doyle's torment as he must make a career and life altering decision in the midst of war. The action is of good quality especially the eventual showdown between the rivals. And as one who personally likes to see the forgotten art of model work used effectively this film also scores high on the exciting scale for like minded film fans.Far from perfect for sure but there's much to admire and be involved with to make it a solid recommend to fans of WW2 human dramas. 710".

Their's is a polarity that has become something of a genre clich. Still they work well together. The rest of the players also do an adequate job.For me the star of the show is the huge submarine of the American longrange Pacific fleet  the 'Gato' class. These were whoppers. Even so the interior still looks a little too roomy to be believable as most of these early sub movies do. They were also the most successful submarines of WW2 and I'm surprised we don't see them featured more often.Some tactical issues seem extremely hokey. The initial attack on the Japanese aircraft carrier would surely have been initiated from several miles away allowing the sub to position itself on whichever side of the carrier that was not protected by the freighter. As things are by taking such a reckless action knowing that the freighter contained some 1400 POW's and civilians the sub commander was surely liable to a warcrime charge. Add to that his collision with a barrage despite being aware of its proximity and remaining at periscope depth at low speed when a destroyer was barely a thousand yards away and you begin to wonder how the skipper ever got his command. He certainly wasn't fit. The speed of the carrier is also quoted as 21knots. So how come the commonorgarden freighter was managing to keep up with it? That vessel would barely have managed half the speed.The Japanese ships are all too clearly models. Not as goofy as those of Preminger's 'In Harm's Way' but it is a postwar movie 1958 more could surely have been done. Worth a watch but by no means collectible. Britain's 1943 vintage 'We Dive At Dawn' has a great deal more going for it despite being 15 years older and made on a wartime budget.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a reasonably welldone tale of a submarine commanded by Glenn Ford with Ernest Borgnine as his friend and executive officer during World War II.Ford and Borgnine are called back from the Philippines to Pearl Harbor leaving Ford's wife and little girl behind. By the time Ford and Borgnine take their boat out the family has been captured. Ford pursues the big Japanese aircraft carrier the Shinaru but it's being deliberately shielded by a transport carrying a thousand captives of the Japanese. The captives include Ford's own family and he knows it but he's forced  against the urgent pleas of Borgnine  to take a shot at the Shinaru. He misses and sinks the transport instead.This leaves him understandably bitter. He takes his boat directly into Tokyo Bay and takes another shot at the Shinaru. This time his torpedoes are intercepted purposefully by a Japanese destroyer. After this dangerous venture he is barely able to get his boat back to Pearl Harbor passing out in a tormented sleep for three days.A final attempt at the carrier leads him to Kiska in the Aleutian Islands which Ford considers a dead end. As well he should. This is late 1942. The Battle of Midway was over. The Japanese still held some territory in the Aleutians but it was practically uncontested. Nobody wanted the Aleutians. There's nothing there but sea lions and bird and the weather is lousy. There were some bloody encounters in the fog and snow but in the end the Japanese withdrew perhaps out of boredom.The unlikely prospect of finding a big Japanese carrier there aside this is pretty well done. It's unsparing in some ways. There are a few flashbacks to the happy times that Ford his family and Borgnine spent together but in the end the wife and little blond girl die. A more traditional ending would have reunited them somehow.The visual effects are effective too. And there is a good deal of tension in the scene in Tokyo Harbor when Ford is negotiating a mine field. After the final attack on the Shinaru the submarine is sunk. The majority of the crew escape using aqua lungs and are rescued by a companion boat but six men are left behind to die. When he's pulled aboard the rescue boat one of the first things Ford asks is the names of the men who didn't make it  an admirable touch.Borgnine is a little more humanistic than the skipper. This is a traditional conflict the sympathetic secondincommand and the stern and bythebook skipper. At that Glenn Ford is not just tough he's almost miraculously indifferent to pain. When they are depthcharged Ford falls and breaks the bone in his upper arm. The pharmacist's mate puts a small splint over the fracture and Ford carries on  giving orders donning his escape gear floating to the surface  as if nothing were wrong. I remember meeting a stranger as he emerged loaded from a bar and managed to fall down while trying to get into his car. I think I broke my fibia he said thickly. And indeed I could feel the grinding of a fractured bone in his shin. By the time the ambulance arrived it could no longer be said that he was feeling no pain.As a submarine movie this is no masterpiece but it's above average. Ford is in his minimalist mode not animated by hatred as in The Big Heat but the interpretation is believable enough. There are times when Borgnine seems to be reading his lines from cue cards but he's such a jolly goodnatured guy that it's difficult not to like him. And this is one of the few instances from this period when the inclusion of the hero's romantic interest is justified. Without the corny scenes of his wife an family we wouldn't be able to understand Ford's character.".

I served on submarines in the mid 1950's and used the Momsen lung to ascend 100 feet in a training tank. Two years later the device was abandoned in favor of the so called blowandgo method of free ascent to the surface. I made this ascent in the same training tank from a depth of 50 feet.

A lot of sequences show depth charges going off so close to the sub that it would have instantly sank not survived. Any submariner could only wish they could have done this. What this film is good at is producing drama  atmosphere. Of course a lot of submarine films have already duplicated the atmosphere so by the time this one was made that is not a big accomplishment.

	schema:reviewBody "These submarine films always follow the pattern of playing out the relationship of the determined Captain and the watchful suspicious second in command. This one features Ford as the Captain and Borgnine as the Lieutenant. Same old routine. The film starts fine then gradually becomes absurd as feverish Ford turns into Captain Ahab relentlessly in search of his white whalein this case the Japanese carrier Shinaru. Seems the Navy is perfectly willing to accommodate Ford on his obsessive mission and Borgnine is even willing to reject the offer of a command of his own vessel in order to stick by AhabFord's side. Oh sure. And what started all this? In an earlier scene Ford is forced to torpedo a transport filled with 1400 civilians including Ford's wife and child caught in Manila that is being used as a screen to protect the Shinaru. Absurd! Both the Navy and Ford's character fully aware the transport is there would never take that kind of chance. The potentially staggering loss would have been a calamity that would never have been sanctioned. This is just a ridiculous contrivance to fuel Ford's obsession. In addition the filmmakers try to have it both ways by never stating whether or not Ford's family survives or not. Borgnine is merely there as the Voice of Reason. His only other duty seems to be offering Ford coffee in every other scene.Otherwise this film is a secondrate action film. The supporting actors have almost nothing to work with leaving them blanks we could care less about. Interesting to see a young Al Freeman Jr. on board since there were few black submariners in the service. So not historically inaccurate. The stock footage of U.S. destroyers used to play Japanese destroyers IS inaccurate obviously. And the special effects are variable effective at times and painfully obvious at others. And the multidepth charge walloping Ford's sub takes is very impressive but also hard to believe that the sub isn't blown to pieces considering most of the charges explode right on top of it. One other odd note is the lack of a music score credit. The score is perfectly fine yet whoever provided it was either denied credit or took their name off it. Wonder why.".

	schema:headline " Pretty pat submarine drama starring Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Joseph Pevney and written by William Wister Haines and Richard Sale this average World War II submarine drama stars Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine Ford is the commander of a submarine and Borgnine is his first officer. Like most in this genre Ford plays a tortured determined sub captain who's chasing a holy graillike target in this case a Japanese flat top a new aircraft carrier named Shinaru Borgnine's character is also Ford's friend who helps andor covers for his commanding officer C.O..The cast includes a number of supporting actors including Diane Brewster who plays Ford's wife in a couple of flashback sequences Dean Jones as Foley and L.Q. Jones as Benson are two members of Ford's crew Philip Ober as Ford's C.O. and William Schallert uncredited as another sub's commander. The Japanese characters are barely seen and of course uncredited. The film's Effects which are really nothing special received an Academy Award nomination.The story is compelling at times but is also full of the usual clichsLieutenant Commander Barney Doyle Ford is Admiral Samuel Setton's Ober best submarine captain his Grey Fish has attained an impressive record of success sinking enemy targets. Barney is driven because for 10 months he hasn't known the fate of his wife and two year old daughter who were living in Manila before Pearl Harbor and Japan's invasion of the Philippines. When word finally surfaces that Jane Brewster and their daughter Dede Kimberly Beck uncredited in her screen debut have been found alive and well in a Japanese internment camp it's soon followed by news that the sought after carrier Shinaru is being screened by a transport ship with 1400 prisonersofwar likely including Doyle's family and two destroyers dubbed tin cans.Naturally Barney and his crew is given the opportunity to take a crack at sinking the target but the captain despite pleas from his first officer Lieutenant Archie Sloan Borgnine takes an ill advised risk and accidentally shoots the transport ship instead. Because of the destroyers who have dropped depth charges in order to destroy them and are currently lying in wait the Grey Fish is unable to rescue the survivors.Seeing this scene would later cause Barney to wrestle with his emotions about the tragedy for three days in his captain's quarters but not before he successfully commands the sub into Tokyo Bay and destroys another tin can in lieu of the desired target. They'd had to hide among some enemy mines and blow through some sub trap netting during their escape.Upon their ordered return to Pearl Harbor Admiral Setton questions Archie about Barney's fitness while offering the Lieutenant a ship of his own. Archie tells the truth about Barney's struggle but then states that he'd rather be Doyle's subordinate on another mission to sink the Shinaru than helm his own boat. So Barney and the Grey Fish are given another chance and are accompanied by another sub dubbed the Blue Fin. When a suspicious Barney asks Archie about his conversation with the admiral Doyle's paranoia causes a rift between the two friends.Later after taking another undue risk Barney causes the Grey Fish to lose its conning tower and most of its communications ability reducing their chances of sinking the Shinaru by sonar to one in eight. Now unable to using either periscope Barney decides to let Archie help make the decision to continue the quest to sink the Japanese carrier which they do despite great risk to themselves and their crew. The Grey Fish is sunk to the bottom by a Japanese destroyer which is then in turn sunk by the Blue Fin.One of the film's most interesting and not often seen sequences follows as the crew of the Grey Fish abandons their submerged sub in order to be rescued by the Blue Fin's crew. Their skipper Randy Schallert is able to show Barney that he and his crew minus the six that died in their sinking did successfully sink the Shinaru.".

While some of the Oscarnominated special effects are good there are a few special effects shots that may provoke giggles from modern day audiences. And the ending wraps things up a little suddenly and may be unsatisfying to some viewers.Fortunately there is more good than negative stuff. Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine give solid and believable performances. And there is fun seeing L.Q. Jones and Dean Jones among the supporting players.

VIEWERS' GUIDE Adults.COMMENT Few people set out to make a bad movie. A cheap movie yes but one that purposely fails to entertain its intended audience that's rare. Yet sometimes you wonder what audience producers could have been thinking of when they made a particular picture. Torpedo Run is a case in point. An audience composed entirely of rabid Glenn Ford andor Ernest Borgnine fans is the only one I can nominate that would enjoy Torpedo Run. Lots and lots of closeups of Glenn and Ernie acting out their preposterous lines in a perfectly serious manner not the slightest traces of mockery or deprecation in their voices. The other players are a solidly stolid bunch too but their roles are strictly support so they don't count for much.Maybe the movie is popular with fans of director Joe Pevney? I'm kidding. Joe doesn't have any fans. Doesn't deserve any either. A strictly pedestrian totally unimaginative hack. An interesting actor but a totally lousy director. Action fans then? What action? Well yes if you like lots of blownup illmatching stock footage and obvious models. CinemaScope fans? Well 'Scope is hardly the medium for claustrophobic submarine interiors  and that's where maybe 90 of the movie's 98 minutes is set. Movie fans? Torpedo Run is not a movie. It's radio soap opera with onedimensional characters phony conflicts and absolutely zilch in visual appeal.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whistle Down the Wind has remained one of my favourite films ever since I saw it as a young child many years ago when my parents took me to see it when it was originally released. The performances by all the children in the film are charming and Alan Bates excels as the criminal who is mistaken for Jesus. For me the special aspects of the film are its genuine innocence and the capturing of a much simpler time in England that will never return. I myself was born and grew up in the north in an area similar to the one shown in the film and today now aged 48 watch the film with great nostalgia and a warm feeling about my carefree life as a child. I also feel sadness that many children in our country today cannot enjoy the freedom to roam and play far and wide as I and the children in the film could do at that time. I have never met anyone who didn't enjoy this underrated classic and defy anyone not to be moved by the naturalness of the performances. A marvelous addition to anyone's DVD collection and one that I treasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have enjoyed reading the comments on this truly marvelous film. Its main appeal is that it has a timeless nature  which explains why so many visitors to this site have only discovered it comparatively recently.Its primary characteristic is indeed an omnipresent nostalgia present even on its release . Many who saw it including myself when it came out in 1961 were struck by this. I think the major reinforcer of this quality is Malcolm Arnold's hauntingly melodious music  which manages to be both wistfully operatic and deftly atmospheric. Surely this composer is one of those who have managed to capture popular sentiment and combine it with admirable developmental structure.As for the performances they are extremely inspired. And I have nothing to add. No one has yet mentioned however the superb vignettes such as 'Auntie' with her aversion to port wine 'not since VE day'. These stem in turn from the brilliant script by Waterhouse and Hall and illustrate the way that their TV assignments were overflowing into conventional cinema to great comic effect. Indeed the references to popular TV shows in their script for this film is a measure of the importance of the box in sociological history .All in all a landmark film that has succeeded in touching the lives of many people in its modest and profound way.Definitely one that should be seen and seen again in the 21st century!".

	schema:reviewBody "Forbes' wellloved film performs a delicate balancing act between symbolism and naturalism and does so with sensitivity and humour. His achievement becomes more evident when one considers the recent Andrew LloydWebber version of this story which considerably Americanised and coarsened it floundering badly as a result. Director Forbes whose first and arguably finest film this was had previously been better known as an actor. His skills and experience are in evidence from the start here as he brings the best out of the children who make up a good proportion of his cast.In a film that has a lot to say about the grander issues of religion a lot of the real pleasure here comes from the quieter interactions between youngsters as they either gauchely hide things from their elders or express the ironies of simple belief. Juxtaposing the innocence of childhood with the cruelty and persecution of the adult world and with a fair dose of symbolism and various interpretative levels the result is in some contrast to the other prestigious productions of the time. The recent ground breaking kitchen sink dramas such as that by Karel Reisz Saturday Night And Sunday Morning 1960 or pictures of aggressive social mobility from Jack Clayton Room At The Top 1959 were full of working class characters. They focussed on the newly discovered reality of their aims and aspirations and were part sociological exploration of class part attempt to wrestle poetry of sorts from everyday life. While Whistle Down the Wind benefits from the breath of fresh air currently blowing through the British industry  the location shoot and naturalistic performances are especially characteristic and effective  the sympathetic portrayals in the film serve to emphasise the fact that its concerns are less sociological than theological even if its slightly selfconscious air shows a continuing concern to gain a 'significance' from the community at least of some sort. It's a film where outright classconsciousness rarely raises its head while the anger of the times seen elsewhere on the contemporary screen is almost entirely absent. In fact when they occur at all such issues only appear in the context of organised religion as for instance when the children encounter the doctrinal certainties of the local vicar an aloof establishment figure much more concerned with the vandalism of his church than the urgent questions of his young parishioners. The irony is of course that while discussing the missing guttering from the church he is entirely unaware that real spirituality exists in the barn down the road in the hearts of children. Whistle Down The Wind is something of a family affair in more ways than one. Not only do the principals mostly spring from the Bostock family or their close acquaintances but the film itself is based on a novel by Mary Hayley Bell the wife of actor John Mills and mother of Hayley  who plays the lead Kathy. Some have objected that she is too old to play the part and strictly speaking this is true although on screen her proximity to womanhood allows her I love you to The Man Blakey Alan Bates a meaning potential unavailable to a younger performer. Hayley's role and performance reminds one of another she had provided a couple of years back in Tiger Bay a related tale of a platonic love between a child and a murderer. The star spent a good deal of her early career in British film persuading audiences that she could successfully grow up on screen.Much of the success of the film springs from its gentle and sophisticated treatment of religion. Put in the mouths of babes doctrinal criticism is thereby sidestepped and the biggest potential objection to the piece  that the confusion of a murderer with Christ might be blasphemous  is largely defused by having The Man say very little his main conversation an imitation of the parables is a retelling to a rapt audience of 'Ruth Lawrence air hostess' from a comic. The mistake in recognition is made by innocents and is therefore understandable. The director overcomes objections by charm. And while Forbes has his Man reinforce the mistaken impression by his opening words the first sight of him arms outstretched newly appeared in a 'stable' a evocative stance reprised as he ultimately surrenders suggestive heavenward pointofviewshots and so on the audience is never made to feel uncomfortable with the suggestions. In fact at a time when the BBFC had firm views on the Church and established religion seen on screen the only other title that comes easily to mind dealing with such matters in a lighthearted and successful way is the very different Boulting brothers' Heavens Above! with Peter Sellars.The film's charm is greatly enhanced by a memorable score by Malcolm Arnold the highlight of which is reworking of We Three Kings  perkily reprised up tempo as the trio of youngsters pay their homage to their 'Christ' or while choreographing a march down the road. The ensemble playing of the film is excellent. Bernard Lee more familiar to audiences as 'M' in the James Bond series turns in sterling work as father Bostock while among the younger actors Alan Barnes as Charlie is also a standout. It is Charlie who expresses the final disillusionment It isn't Jesus it's just some fella but faith of sorts remains amongst many of the children even as Blakey is led away. The film's final sense is of religious reinforcement rather than disappointment You missed him this time but he'll be coming again Kathy tells some latecomers to the barn while the details of the murder in question is left sufficiently vague so as not to entirely deprive Bates' character of sympathy even as he is handed over to the authorities. There's a sense that the killer has been redeemed by the innocence and trust of his admirers rather than the other way round  a subtly ironic turn of events which never the less makes for a satisfying conclusion. For those who enjoy British cinema of this decade the charming experience offered by Forbes' debut is unmissable while others who have seen the film before there will be no hesitation.".

The kids try to care for and hide the Second Coming as they believe Bates to be from the adults who they perceive to have no hearts left. With deliberate ambiguity the story explores issues of faith and doubt and really made me ask the questionIs the innocence of children to be cherished or dismissed as out of place with modern cynical society? This movie straddles a thin line of fantasy and gritty poetic realism that was prevalent in Black and white UK 60s cinema.I just loved it as a kid. The scene where Jesus is suffering lying under the hay on the floor as he is stepped on in his concealment will always stay with me. Then when he is led away the way he raises his arms is as if it is a Crucifixion. My crap VHS copy fell apart so I hope it will be out on DVD in the US this side of 2010.".

I didn't expect this to be such a moving and wonderful film. Kathy Mills is a girl who finds a man in her barn who she believes is Jesus Christ Alan Bates but he's really a murderer on the run. Along with her siblings and the other town children they all believe in him and take care of him. The ending is very powerful and moving. Beautifully filmed in black and white I found this to be a really great film. Hayley Mills is excellent Alan Bates all the children and the rest of the cast are all terrific. One of the best 1960's British film that I have watched  1010.".

Cleverly designed perfectly acted by all the children as well as the adults pithily appropriate screenplay believable accents the setting is the Yorkshire moors in England and a wellbalanced carefully planned production all combine to produce a mesmerising gem of a film. Already a star Hayley Mills proved she was not just a pretty face and built on her impressive performance in Tiger Bay to create a moving character of budding adolescence still trapped in childhood innocence and belief. The period of the early sixties is neatly conveyed and Hayley Mills as Cathy creates a metaphor for the deeper layer of the film's message of the increasing social awareness and diminishing religious belief despite the traditional Sunday School attitudes and practices which was gradually bringing about the social change of Britain in the sixties. The story is well told the drama is dynamic the actors do a marvellous job and the film certainly deserves to be better known if not least because it's an early example of Richard Attenborough's production skills.".

It is a tad too slowly paced with the many nondialogue sequences dragged out and the mix of thick accents and whispering makes what dialogue there is difficult to understand at times.

It was an intelligent entirely believable charming and powerful film that affected me profoundly.I managed to dub a VHS tape of it and watched it over and over again until I practically knew it by heart.

I cannot explain with words the feelings and emotions it stirs within me.And not just the story itself but the whole world of this film is appealing to me stark and grim though it can appear at times. I don't know if this rural English countryside exists anymore but I wish I could walk along the crest of that magnificent hill in the early Spring listening to the birds and hearing the wistful music of Whistle Down The Wind in my head.

The girl and her sister and little brother Alan Barnes a superb performance cosset the man and plot to keep him secret from the adults because of what happened to him 'last time'.  The man in turn is bewildered by the increasing adultation and attention of the neighbouring kids.One of the strongest points of the story aside from the contention that religion really couldn't cope with the return of Christ is the developing attraction between the preteen Mills and Bates.  This is understated but unmistakable and owes a lot to Hayley's talent when she was a child actress.

I've seen all the classics past and present and have to say this really is up there as one of my favourites. Filmed nearly 45 years ago set in the wonderful Lancashire moors around the town of Burnley England. This film will do nothing other than warm your heart. The innocence of the lead characters coupled with the respect shown in a byegone day gives you that sentimental feeling embossed with a sense of pride .

	onyx:emotionText "A truly beautiful beautiful film. I'm in my 30's and would describe myself as an emerging film buff. I've seen all the classics past and present and have to say this really is up there as one of my favourites. Filmed nearly 45 years ago set in the wonderful Lancashire moors around the town of Burnley England. This film will do nothing other than warm your heart. The innocence of the lead characters coupled with the respect shown in a byegone day gives you that sentimental feeling embossed with a sense of pride . I'll spare you the details of what you may watch but give it a go and imagine times nearly 5 decades ago with a simple but interesting plot and enjoy!";

	schema:headline " Were I to be asked to name my favourite film this would be a strong contender";
	schema:reviewBody "The story concerns the three children of a farmer who find a man hiding in their barn. The man Arthur Blakey is in fact a murderer on the run from the police but owing to a misunderstanding the children believe that he is Jesus Christ returned to Earth. The film concerns the children's attempts later aided by their friends from the village to feed the fugitive and to shelter him from the adult world.I was surprised to see on this board a review putting forward the theory that the film was a critique of religion as a childish delusion which struck me as an eccentric misinterpretation. The film is a deeply religious allegory of the Christian faith which makes it something of a rarity in cinema history. When Andrew Lloyd Webber recently turned it into a stage musical he changed the setting from England to a fundamentalist community in America's Deep South something which involved a radical shift of emphasis. The Britain seen in this film the setting is the rural hinterland of a Lancashire mill town but it could have been virtually anywhere is far from being a fundamentalist society it is a semisecular one where the adults pay lipservice to religion but do not take it seriously. The children are sent to Sunday School but their father does not attend church himself. Religious fundamentalists believe that the Second Coming is imminent for the adults in the film including even the Vicar and the Sunday School teacher it is not a possibility to be taken seriously. If Christ ever did return this Vicar would probably take the opportunity to complain to him about his ide fixe the recent theft of some guttering from the church.Of course Blakey is not literally Christ returned to Earth but it is a mistake in my experience shared by both ardent fundamentalists and ardent secularists to believe that religious truths can only be conveyed through the medium of literal fact. Myth and metaphor are also important to convey religious ideas and metaphorically Blakey represents Christ an embodiment of the idea that all of us the unjust as well as the just are made in God's own image and embody something of the divine. Throughout the film there are echoes of key episodes from the Gospels including the Nativity the action takes place in a barn with the three children representing the Magi an identification underscored by the use of the carol We Three Kings in the musical score the calling of the disciples the number of children who visit Blakey later rises to twelve Peter's denial of Christ when one of the disciples is bullied by another boy with the whistle of a passing train standing in for the crowing cock and the Crucifixion Blakey's pose with outstretched arms when finally arrested.The film was nominated for a number of BAFTA awards but did not win any. The Academy predictably ignored it completely as far as Oscar nominations were concerned. Since 1961 however it has acquired a status as one of the classics of the British cinema. Remarkably it was the first film of its director Bryan Forbes. There are a number of reasons for this besides its ambitious theme. There is the evocative and memorable musical score from Malcolm Arnold. There is the crisp blackandwhite photography of the Lancashire countryside and townscapes. Despite a difference in theme the look of the film is similar to the kitchen sink realist dramas that were popular in Britain at this period. Most importantly there is the high standard of acting from all involved most importantly from Hayley Mills as Kathy the oldest of the three children. It always seemed to me that Hollywood never knew quite what to do with Hayley treating her first as a latterday Shirley Temple and then as the successor to Sandra Dee's crown as Teenage Virgin Queen but in her two early British films she was a superb young actress. The other one of those films was Tiger Bay made two years earlier in which Hayley coincidentally also plays a young girl who befriends a murderer on the run. In that film too there are religious overtones although they are less marked than in Whistle Down the Wind. The other children are also all very natural especially Alan Barnes as Kathy's little brother Charles.Among the adults the two performances that stand out are those of Norman Bird as the farmhand Eddie and Alan Bates as Blakey. Eddie is the embodiment of the cynicism and cruelty of the adult world which the children instinctively find unacceptable the first thing we see in the film is the children rescuing some kittens which Eddie has tried to drown. These kittens will play an important role in the plot. Bates has the difficult task and succeeds of trying to play a murderer without making him altogether unsympathetic. Blakey is a rough taciturn man but there is something Christlike about his drawn suffering features and something about his demeanour that suggests he could have been better under other circumstances. His character seems to be softened by his contact with the innocence of the children there is perhaps a moment of moral redemption when he throws his gun out of the barn instead of using it to resist arrest as he had originally planned.Perhaps the most important line in the film is the very last one spoken by Kathy to two children who have arrived too late to see the supposed Jesus You missed him this time but he'll be coming again which can be taken as a reference either to the Resurrection or the Second Coming a line which emphasises that this is a film about faith. This has a strong claim to be regarded as one of the top British films of all time indeed were I to be asked to name my personal favourite this would be a strong contender. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Seen at Sundance Premiere 2008. Within the first 2 minutes of the Escapist you know your buckled in and you won't be getting up till the credits start rolling and thats just how it is. In the tradition of the Bird Man of Alcatraz Great Escape Cool Hand Luke and other greats of the prison break genre you can add the Escapist. The feel is modern but the setup is old school and true to the genre in a familiarly comforting way. Director Rupert Wyatt has created a fantastic action film with intelligent sequencing and a meaningful ending that makes you remember its indie roots. What is even more amazing though is the sound  it is insane! The sounds of the prison are so real and chilling in their quiet way then when the action hits its like a tidal wave of sound hitting all you senses. Rarely does a new flick come along with such wide potential that brings new ideas and old ones together so well. I'm left extremely impressed by all involved. Movie will be best seen on the big screen with high quality sound I imagine American audiences will not show this as much love as they should do to the lack of big names but I suspect the UK will embrace this very well.".

The arrival of a new cell mate Lacey played by newcomer Dominic Cooper coincides with Perry receiving the first letter from his family in fourteen years. His daughter is a heroin addict and close to death. Perry decides he must get out to see her and make things right while there is still time. He goes to his closest friend Brodie Liam Cunningham and they enlist ontheedge pugilist and thief Lenny Drake Joseph Fiennes to put together their plan.But the film begins with the escape cleverly setting up many questions in the head of the viewer which are then answered in flashback. We want to know why Frank starts the escape attempt what appears to be a stab wound how drug dealer Viv Batista Seu Jorge gets involved and why Lacey is part of the team when he has arrived in the prison so recently. The answers come but slowly so that it's only at the very end that the little hints and clues scattered through the story of the escape attempt itself make sense.This structure and the final plot twist would alone make this film worth repeat viewing but not just for that. Writers Daniel Hardy and Rupert Wyatt Wyatt also directed let images rather than words do the talking and with a cast of this calibre it pays off brilliantly. The actors are allowed to use their faces and bodies to tell us the story Brian Cox letting his face fall into a pile of regret when he reads the letter Damian Lewis's posture as he walks past the cells to find out what happened to his brother the tiny shifts of expression on Dominic Cooper's face as he relives his forced dalliance in the showers with Tony from self pity to self hatred and back again. It's top notch stuff.Comparisons with Shawshank Redemption are inevitable but while Redemption was really a story about hope The Escapist is actually a film about redemption about the single unselfish act that can redeem wasted years perhaps a wasted life.

	schema:headline " Existential puzzlebox movie  not just an escape";
	schema:reviewBody "I caught this at Sundance. Not the premiere but one of the other showings. Then I went back to a second viewing! The only film there I'd felt that way about. The audiences reaction said it all. People came with very little hype or knowledge about what was billed as a prison escape movie. So this was one of the few films at the festival which really exceeded expectations. I knew something was up when it started with the escape itself! Cutting back and forth between the escape and the plan was a device that I worried at first would annoy me a tip of a hat to Memento but without good reason for being there. I was wrong  in fact the reason we get this structure is one of the cleverest reasons I've ever seen and its only fully clear what it all signified in the last few seconds of the film. But I won't spoil it.. its just worth saying that this film and its clever structure and twist makes it more of a Jacobs Ladder or Memento than a Shawshank Redemption. You need to see it twice to pick up all the clues and understand completely  a bit like Donnie Darko or Mulholland Dr  enjoyable even if you don't get it completely but there are other layers to figure out in future viewings. The film had an interesting look to it like a 70s movie and excellent cinematography although I wished that they'd either not used CG in places or done it a bit better. The acting from Brian Cox carrying the film and Stephen Mackintosh minor role really impressed first time I've seen Cox carry a movie since Manhunter. The sound was very interestingly done which is rare and together with the unique detailed look of the film gave me the impression of a director Rupert Wyatt who got to realise his unique vision.... which is what these Sundance movies should be about. The music was quite diverse and best when not getting too sentimental but it helped with the pace if not the mood. Leonard Cohen's song also perfectly led us in and out of the story. But the technical side of the filmmaking from all parties was clearly top notch and Joe Walker's editing creating a double story while keeping both interesting was also standout good. I also loved the retro titles these films its referencing from the 70s are some of my favourite but this managed to update subvert and improve them. Hats off.".

	schema:reviewBody "As one reviewer said this is an existential puzzle box of a movie the true meaning of the title being revealed at the very end. It's not just about escaping from a prison nor is it a pretentious metaphor. Its just very very well made.I appreciate some similarities with Shawshank Redemption for obvious reasons but really this film stands up on its own rights. The reasons for escaping are wholly different  SR was to right a wrong while here it is familial breakdown and taking responsibility for ones own actions. Brian Cox's character and the rest are believable and fleshed out enough to engage with but the real achievement here is in the pacing and structuring of the plot.The film cuts between the actual escape itself and the events and planning leading up to the escape. Dominoes diamonds and of course drugs all play a part in the setup of the escape which plays out with breathless excitement. The grim presentation of the prison Damien Lewis' character in particular appears shockingly believable. Prisons are not ruled in the way they should be and a character like his having a grip over the institution rather than the other way round seems sadly truthful. He is very scary...The end like Shawshank is uplifting in a downbeat kinda way. It reminded me of The Descent which i hope is not a great spoiler for people. I almost cried but actually you're left feeling quite happy for the central character. There is not the same redemption as SR which is a good thing so don't go in expecting happy endings or heaven forbid Prison Break The Movie. For that it is not though its existence probably owes something to the success of that overrunning TV show and the ingenious escape route is one Michael Schofield would be proud of. But really this is a great little indie movie which came and went at the cinema very quickly but will no doubt find an audience in the years to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "While The Escapist may not have an allstar Alist cast it has a pretty recognizable international one. When I saw the names attached to this thing I couldn't believe that it had trouble finding distribution. Luckily IFC Films stepped up to the plate and will add it to their VOD schedule to get some exposure for its DVD release. Much like Unknown from a few years back Rupert Wyatt's film is a hidden gem of intrigue and suspense. A disjointed narrative tells the story of a ragtag bunch of criminals looking to escape from a maximum security prison so that the orchestrator Brian Cox's Frank Perry can see his daughter before she dies from drug abuse complications on the outside. Each member of the team has a specialty necessary for the escape to work andor finds his way on the team through trade whether consciously or not. You do begin to wonder way Rupert has decided to show it all interspliced with flashbacks on how they got together and when the conclusion is reached you will understand in a surprisingly satisfactory turn of events.Now these names may mean absolutely nothing to you but on paper they are quite the collaborative team. Cox leads the way in recognition and stature followed by a favorite of mine Damian Lewis in a smaller role than I had anticipated and Joseph Fiennes. Add in the familiar faces of Steven Mackintosh Liam Cunningham Dominic Cooper and singer Seu Jorge and you've really got something for a film that will probably not be seen by very many people. And that is the real shame here because The Escapist has a lot going for it. With a good marketing push and word of mouth this had the potential of being a sleeper hitan indie done well. Hopefully IFC viewers will start spreading excitement and help it to achieve cult status of some sort. It may not be as mainstream as Prison Break but utilizing the same core idea Wyatt culls together a unique tale that takes more from a film like Jacob's Ladder than pop culture television.It all begins with Cox's Perry tired and scared finding Lewis sitting on a cell bed. The next thing we know Cox joins up with the team as they have just smashed their way into the laundry room only now he has a bloodied shirt and what can be assumed as a nasty gash to his stomach. We have been dropped right into the escape and now the group is together putting their plan in motion. But wait all of sudden we are back in time watching Cox do laundry duty Cunningham's Brodie putting on an ant race and Mackintosh's Tony berating newcomer Cooper as he arrives at the prison. The discovery that we are about to go on a journey with the escapees juxtaposed with how they all came together to plan the event becomes clear. With sharp cuts yet coherent story continuity it all makes sense as both halves reach their crescendos at the end. The plot line of the past thread reaches the point at which the film started and that progression leads to the end of the escape simultaneously. Both meld together as one revealing what has indeed been going on the entire time possibly not even parallel timeframes after all.Complete with some very nice camerawork Wyatt shows some skill as a director. Scenes like that of Mackintosh and Cooper in the showers fog shrouding their advance into the water shielding us from what we know is about to happen really stick out. Even the trip to that end with Cooper's Lacey being helped by guards and inmates opening doors for him to hide in plays nicely into the artistry and aesthetic being put on display. The prison is dark and dingy yet a paradise in comparison with the large expanses of sewers they soon find themselves traveling through. It is a muted palette throughout making the light at the end of the tunnel both figuratively and literally that much brighter in notion and reality. And the way in which we see things happen is with suspense and intrigue. Watching the inmates plan their escape with dominoes as we are shown the real life places they mimic along with extended sequences of rapid process cutswhether they be making drugs creating a steel cutter or even a jailhouse brawlmany instances beg to be appreciated visually as well as for how well they advance the story.It all ends up being an actors' movie though as the performances shine above all else. Fiennes was almost unrecognizable to me at the start. I thought that was him but something was off. Only after about thirty minutes did I finally realize it Fiennes performing as a madman utility guy nothing like the Shakespearean heroes he is most known for. Lewis is great as the menacing prison czar always with a smile yet demanding the respect of every inmate with his own brand of punishment the guards look the other way on. And I really liked Seu Jorge's role as Viv Bastista. He is a wild card to the filmlibrariandrug cookwitness for Lewis' Rizza. What really makes them all so elusive and mysterious however even as we learn who they are as men is the fact that we don't know what has landed any of them in jail. Are they killers? Thieves? Rapists? It doesn't matter. These men all come together for a common cause and work as a team to achieve it. They sacrifice themselves for the others just as Cox realizes that freedom doesn't have to be of the body but can also be of the mind.".

Unable to do anything for her from his cell and unwilling to wait till he gets out Frank comes up with a base plan to escape from the prison and brings several other prisoners on board to assist him. The escape itself can be worked out to detail and timings but in the meantime it is the days leading up to the escape that prove to be the more testing in a world of betrayal power rape murder and drug use.Watching the trailer for this film some time ago I was left not particularly fussed about whether I got to see it or not  it just looked like I expected and offered little. The generally good reviews made me check it out when it was released on DVD though and I'm glad that I did because this is a much better film than it looks on the trailer. It is not that the plot is something different from a prison movie  although it is a little it is the manner of delivery that makes the film work as well as it does. The concept is strong but it is the editing and structure that are the driving forces here. We start the film in two places. On one hand we are with the group as they start their escape attempt while on the other hand we are some time before this when Frank gets his motivation to escape.What this structure does is increase the tension by having two dramatic threads happening at the same time with the escape itself delivering the pace to pay off against the buildup that is happening at the same time in the other thread. Rather than building up to the escape then the film does both at the same time and it is an effective and engaging technique. The point where one thread catches the other isn't totally convincing in some regards and I'll not be the only person to express a slight doubt at the dramatic punch of the conclusion but with being caught up in the story so effectively up till this point it does work and the way that it slightly undoes the impact of some of the film that had gone before is not a killer of a problem so much as it is a minor niggle.Wyatt's direction is roundly good and as cowriter he makes the most of the structure and material. It helps of course when your debut feature has an impressive collection of actors and performances  and Wyatt's does. As he also showed in Red recently Cox makes an engaging leading man when given the chance. Fiennes is not quite so good as he perhaps overdoes his swagger and toughness  still looks the part and does well but again he is a slight niggle. I liked Cunningham's turn as well as Cooper  although the latter had a bit of a wet and less engaging character to work with. Brazilian musician Jorge was a bit of a weird find but did OK. Mackintosh is engaging and convincing in how he acts knowing he is technically untouchable due to the actions of his brother. Lewis is not in the film for much of the running time but his less is more approach produces a real menace when he is given the camera.The Escapist is a comparatively small British film full of faces you'll recognise but nobody who is a real leading man in film terms directed by Wyatt making his feature debut after a few shorts to his name. However it is cleverly structured and delivered with a real sense of quality in the story direction and performances. It is not perfect but it is much better than the trailer suggests and I was pleasantly surprised by how much it engaged me and how much I enjoyed it.".

	schema:headline " A ThrillingLynchian Attack On The Senses!";
	schema:reviewBody "It was only yesterday that I had the chance to watch a film that is little known yet somehow managed to make it to my nearest Vue cinema inbetween some of the current perhaps contrived blockbusters that are on our screens currently. So it was only with great surprise that this film which I had heard great things about after it debuted earlier this year at Sundance had a screening after some persuasive actions on a friend I was able to settle down for what I hoped would turn out to be a memorable prison film. At a first glance The Escapist would appear to be your usual affair of a prison drama however Rupert Wyatt has done far more than that in this wonderful existential puzzle box of a film it drives on with true mystique and leaves you as the viewer questioning the true structure of the narrative as it thrives you along to the thrilling lynchian climax.The opening of the film begins the puzzle with what appears at first to be a strange narrative choice you join a number of inmates that are seemingly in the midst of a prison break. The thumping electronic score sets your heart racing with a mixture of confusion and interest. Just as you think your in the middle of the escape the director makes what seems to be a very questionable editing choice. He appearingly jump cuts back in time before the escape. The film itself constantly jumps between the escape and the lead up to the escape. Throughout the first half of the film I must admit I found this seemed to hurt the pace of the film but that's only if you take this as a conventional PrisonEscape film. This isn't Escape From Alcatraz. And this narrative style that is explored through the film becomes clear more and really begins to pick up the pace in the second half and the climax of the film really does show this choice of structure really did compliment the story. You genuinely are knocked out by the films climax it's on the same level as Memento and you feel equally fulfilled by the end of The Escapist.The cast is really five star lead by the wonderfully diverse Brian Cox as the haunted subdued life sentence serving inmate Frank Perry. Arguably his career defining performance. He brings multiple layers to the character impressively without much dialogue it's a powerful albeit silent performance for the most part but you genuinely feel for his character and without giving anything away you will understand why when you do see the film as the main story point is what leads to the engineering of the escape. Cox is joined by a fantastic supporting cast of some of the finest English actors around today. For the most part there appearances are often short but there screen time does more than enough to create the tense look behind your back atmosphere you would expect in any prison film. Steven Mackintosh gives a chilling performance as the stereotypical inmate that is always the prisons big bad. He takes a distinct liking towards Perrys new cellie with some unnerving results. His fictional older brother in the film the leader of the cell block is played by the wonderful Damian Lewis who I became a big fan of after Band Of Brothers. He has considerably less screen time here but for me his chilling stares and few words were some of the most memorable for me after the credits rolled.The cinematography of the film is quite simply incredible. With a bleak grey tone to the film that keeps the existential atmosphere brooding in the background. Much of the film takes place in vast maze's of underground tunnel works. The filmmakers managed to captured a claustrophobic feel towards the ongoing story. Full of black shadows and long seemingly endless age old tunnels that are barely lit by the flickering orange flame from their cellmade torch's. The cinematography really helps compliment the enclosure of the prison both inside it as well as the escape. Their really isn't anywhere to go its dark brooding and downright terrifying. As you would expect a prison to be! The Escapist really is a revelation in regards of modern cinema. It just reels you into the story from the get go and takes you on a bleak ride through the dark underbelly of the prison metaphorical in its tone Rupert Wyatt really has crafted something wonderful here. The film defiantly leaves you with that deep satisfaction that Britain has been getting some blisteringly good films as of late alongside films like Dead Man Shoes it gives you the sense that there is still a lot of great to come.".

Desperate to get out of prison to save her he hatches a plan for escape and enlists some other like minded souls each with their own special skill to see it through. What follows is a twinned intercut tale as we witness the escape attempt and the prior motivations leading up to said escape. All building towards what one can rightly expect to be a run of the mill ending so evident in most prison based movies......Directed by Rupert Wyatt The Escapist thrives on claustrophobic atmosphere and grim prison reality to set the wheels in motion. Filmed at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin this is a dank place overcrowded and paint peeling from every wall and of course there's an array of unsavoury characters just waiting to use violence or sexual proclivities to feather their respective nest. This place alone is reason enough for escape attempts let alone the reasons put forward for our escaping protagonists. The audio on offer also enhances the mood the clanking of metal or the rumbling of shuffling boots land in the ear drum with almost tenacious glee. There's also no overdose on dialogue no filler conversations serving no purpose to the crux of the tale.The cast are prison uniformly strong led by the great and weathered Cox the roll call of escapees also contains earthy Liam Cunningham a buffed up Joseph Fiennes a youthfully fraught Dominic Cooper and black magic gusto from Seu Jorge. While within these walls menace comes from a weaselly Steven Mackintosh and the excellently chilling Damian Lewis as nick daddy Rizza. All in all The Escapist if you pardon the pun is a break out movie two fold. Not just as a story but also in offering up something different in the genre it belongs too. Much like Brian Cox himself The Escapist is something of a British treasure. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about a man who is determined to escape from prison in order to reunite with his ailing daughter.The Escapist is beautifully made but I cannot say I enjoyed it. The main problem was the confusing delivery of the plot. Sometimes the characters are in the prison and sometimes they are in the tunnel trying to escape. The transitions are all sudden and unannounced. I could not work out if the story was linear or delivered in flashbacks until the last five minutes but by then I have already decided that The Escapist is a huge waste of time.The ending twist makes the film considerably better. It resolves the previous confusions I have but then five minutes of brilliance does not make up for 85 minutes of boredom.".

	schema:reviewBody "There have been many great prison escape movie in the past. Escape from Alcatraz  The Great Escape and Papillon are just three classics that spring to mind . Sadly The Escapist is nowhere near good enough to mentioned in the same breath as those three. Frank Perry Brian Cox is an institutionalized convict twelve years into a life sentence without parole. After years of brutal prison life he begins to feel that there is nothing to live for on the inside. When his estranged daughter falls ill Frank is determined to make peace with her before it's too late. He develops an ingenious escape plan and recruits a dysfunctional band of escapists  misfits with a mutual dislike for one other but united by their desire to escape their hell hole of an existence. However his dogged fight for freedom is blocked at every turn not just by the guards but also by the local psychotics that roam the prison. But Frank only has the one goal in mind and that's to come to the aid of his daughterby any means necessary. Much of the action takes place within the tunnels sewers and underground rivers of subterranean London.Despite the impressive cast Brian Cox  Joseph Fiennes and Damian Lewis The escapist is a bit of a mess. Foe some reason we see the escape happening in snap shots between the actual planning of the break out and it's totally confusing.I wonder why directors feel the need to mess around with time lines in films?. It's a big risk to show some of the climax of a film before the end and if it fails it ruins the whole film. That's the case with The Escapist.It's a shame because the acting deserves a much better final product . The performances from Brian Cox  Frank  Dominic Cooper  Lacey and Steven Mackintosh Tony are impressive but sadly to no avail.The prison scenes are unrealistic and look almost Victorian and i was extremely surprised when halfway through the film it is disclosed that the prison was in London. I could have sworn it was in Ireland due to the amount of Irish accents.  This was made by Parallel films an Irish Company.Another thing is that we never find out what the characters did to get into prison in the first place . There is very little background information on the inmates so therefore i didn't care what happened to them .If you have seen or a planning on seeing The Escapist i would like to ask you a favour. Please explain the ending to me! I was left totally bemused as to what was real and what wasn't and in the end i just wanted it to finish  escape or no escape.If you considering watching this do yourself a favour and watch one of the three movies i mentioned at the start of this review instead . You wont regret it. 5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "This is potentially one of the most overestimated films in the last decade. It is visually attractive modern and stylish with interesting choice of colors but everything else seems to be a result of poor choices and even worse logic. This film is not a thriller and most certainly not an action film as some of the reviewers have noted. It is a misery inducing exercise in bad drama that will leave you feeling just short of suicidal. To begin with there is the jumping back and forth in time element. This is usually used in films sparingly so that the time sequence either starts in the past and then finishes in the now or the opposite. This film jumps back and forth so many times and so often that you end up having no clue whatsoever what part you are actually watching. Not only is this irritating but it also makes it impossible for you to actually follow the attempted escape as just as soon as they start running a couple of minutes later you find yourself back in prison. Secondly  character development. There is none. Fullstop. Films about escape are all about characters that's what provides the element of suspense. The film becomes important when you start sympathizing with the lead character. None of that whatsoever. Also the film advertises itself as a story about a band of misfits. Being a misfit to me means a person of a certain character  puzzling or interesting in some way but certainly non conventional. In this film however you learn nothing about the characters apart from their names. Thirdly the plan is developed in like 3 seconds. The main part of the film the part that actually makes you invested as it tickles your intelligence and sense of imagination is just missing. No character development no plot development in a film that has a difficulty deciding whether to be a drama or a thriller but ends up being misery porn. See this movie if you want to irrevocably cast away an hour and a half of perfectly good time that can be used for a host of other more interesting things.".

	schema:headline " Grim realism and comicbook adventure meet in this superb prison break drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Rupert Everett's new film The Escapist is a gripping prison break drama. Beginning in explosive fashion with the instigation of the escape attempt the film switches back and forth between two chronologically distinct narratives the story of the escape and the story behind the escape. The result is an inspired combination of grim realism and comicbook adventure.The escape attempt is hatched when Frank played by Brian Cox an elderly and worldweary inmate receives his first letter in fourteen years informing him that his daughter has become a drug addict and that her health is failing. When Frank decides that he must break out and see her before it is too late a number of other outsiders fall in with him each having their own reasons for trying to escape.The prison is an intimidating place effectively ruled by inmate Rizza a menacing turn by Damian Lewis and his obnoxious brother Tony. Drug dealing is rife and the new inmates are subjected to a trial of humiliation and catcalls. The prison guards are mostly complicit in these activities offering little protection for outsiders and dissenters. In a brutal demonstration of power Rizza forces a disobedient junkie to cut off his thumb with a knife as an act of penitence. This is one of several jolts delivered to remind the audience that the prison setting is not just there for their entertainment it is frighteningly real.There are a number of fine performances in the lead roles. Ralph Fiennes is excellent in the role of Lenny a menacing violent inmate who becomes a brave and resourceful hero during the escape attempt. Tony is a memorably revolting villain played with aplomb by Steve Mackintosh. But it is Brian Cox who deserves the highest praise. The crucial wordless scene where he comes face to face with his wife in the visiting room is powerfully understated and typifies his performance.On the other hand from the grim reality of the prison the escape attempt is a taut and exciting adventure. The escapists use improvised gadgets to make their way through the subterranean caverns that they hope will lead to the outside world. The scenery from long underground tunnels to cavernous sewers to a disused underground station is often spectacular and the camaraderie that develops between the five men is deeply affecting.The two strands of The Escapist the story behind the prison break and that of the prison break itself are expertly juggled throughout. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout and the film often segues between the two narratives at unexpected junctures. I will not attempt to spoil the final twist but it is one of those great moments in cinema where all sorts of details in the preceding film fall into place and continue to fall into place when it is all over.Apparently the prison scenes in The Escapist were filmed in a prisonturnedmuseum that was restored to its original appearance for the film shoot. It is a superb location with enclosed walkways crisscrossing the central space and a dramatic spiral staircase that Everett uses to great effect in several set pieces. What struck my friend who accompanied me to the cinema is that there are no windows for the prisoners to look out of only a skylight in the distant ceiling. Daylight takes on an almost mystical property as the escaped prison inmates strive to escape the subterranean passages adjoining the jail.The sound and music in The Escapist are also deserving of high praise. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch includes a thunderous theme tune and creates tension by use of frantic percussion. The sounds of the prison by day and by night are exceptionally well done helping to create a stifling claustrophobic world that encroaches on the minds of the viewers. By the end you cannot help rooting for the escapists.".

Tony is a memorably revolting villain played with aplomb by Steve Mackintosh. But it is Brian Cox who deserves the highest praise. The crucial wordless scene where he comes face to face with his wife in the visiting room is powerfully understated and typifies his performance.On the other hand from the grim reality of the prison the escape attempt is a taut and exciting adventure. The escapists use improvised gadgets to make their way through the subterranean caverns that they hope will lead to the outside world. The scenery from long underground tunnels to cavernous sewers to a disused underground station is often spectacular and the camaraderie that develops between the five men is deeply affecting.The two strands of The Escapist the story behind the prison break and that of the prison break itself are expertly juggled throughout. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout and the film often segues between the two narratives at unexpected junctures. I will not attempt to spoil the final twist but it is one of those great moments in cinema where all sorts of details in the preceding film fall into place and continue to fall into place when it is all over.Apparently the prison scenes in The Escapist were filmed in a prisonturnedmuseum that was restored to its original appearance for the film shoot. It is a superb location with enclosed walkways crisscrossing the central space and a dramatic spiral staircase that Everett uses to great effect in several set pieces. What struck my friend who accompanied me to the cinema is that there are no windows for the prisoners to look out of only a skylight in the distant ceiling. Daylight takes on an almost mystical property as the escaped prison inmates strive to escape the subterranean passages adjoining the jail.The sound and music in The Escapist are also deserving of high praise. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch includes a thunderous theme tune and creates tension by use of frantic percussion. The sounds of the prison by day and by night are exceptionally well done helping to create a stifling claustrophobic world that encroaches on the minds of the viewers. By the end you cannot help rooting for the escapists.";

She can't hide her contempt for his dullness and rustic ways. He is unhappy but never argues back just finds his own little ways of getting pleasure out of life. A series of incidents finds them having an unexpected late night simple meal green tea over rice is essentially 'leftovers' when nothing else is available and suddenly she realizes she loves him after all.As always with Ozu the richness is in the characters. Taeko played by Michiyo Kogure is spoiled and insensitive but a compelling capricious character. Mokicho the husband under his dull salaryman skin is really a sensitive caring man. The other characters are all vivid and memorable especially Setsuko the headstrong niece. There are also wonderful set pieces usually involving Taekos friends having little girls nights together gossiping about their husbands and plotting marriages.With Ozu a brief overview of his movies always makes him sound dull. But in reality this is funny moving and compelling. Its not first rate Ozu  the theme of the movie is too straightforward and obvious the ending a little too neat and tidy. But second rate Ozu is still head and shoulders above almost any other drama. The humanity of the characters shines through creating a little world we can sink into. The wonder of Ozu is that we are not observing characters we are sitting with them in the middle of their lives.I can't help but compare this to Naruse's 'Repast' another movie about a marriage in trouble where the wife cannot hide her contempt for her husband but in the end they both realize why they love each other. Naruse was more of a pessimist so the reconciliation at the end of Repast is both happy and sad as the characters realize that that living together even without a great love is better than being lonely. In Ozu's more traditional world the couple product of an arranged marriage eventually find love even after many years of marriage by the acceptance of each others little foibles. Taeko learns that simple things can be as pleasurable as luxury. It seems a little trite and it would be in another film makers hands but somehow Ozu finds depths of wisdom even in such clichs.The irony is that Ozu was a lifelong bachelor yet he made perhaps the best movies ever made at examining families in detail. If I had my way I'd put this movie and 'Repast' as compulsive viewing for all engaged couples. It would be more effective than any premarriage course!".

This film is not as good as much of Ozu's output at the time but that includes Tokyo Story Early Summer and Late Spring which are standout classics. The great Setsuko Hara is not in this film and the equally great Chishu Ryu is a bit player but I think you'll still find this film worthy of your time.

Riding in the back of a car are two women one is dressed in modern westernised clothes while the other is dressed in a kimono. Such a shot perfectly captures many of Ozu's themes. Ozu then strengthens his topics with a simple conversation where Setsuko discusses seeing a French movie. Taeko is a bored housewife that insults her husband on a country getaway with her friends and niece. This really offends her niece Setsuko and when it comes time for a wedding interview Setsuko is terrified that she will end up like her cruel aunt. Taeko's husband Mokichi is a very simple man with great patience. He tries to go along with his wife but eventually it all becomes too much. She doesn't like the way he eats the way he travels or the cigarette brand he smokes. If I have one problem with this movie it's that Taeko is the most unlikable of Ozu's characters I have seen. She is simply cruel to an extent that it goes beyond culturegenerational differences. Luckily it all adds together for an incredible ending. In true Ozu style the married couple struggling to make something as simple as rice ignites their love and they decide to really make a go of things. It's really comforting to see a film that avoids all melodrama and rushes to the airports. It proves that subtlety can be a powerful thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu made this 1952 film between two masterpieces Early Summer and especially Tokyo Story and this film suffers a bit by comparison with them. As in other somewhat more accomplished movies by Ozu one thinks especially of the superb Late Spring the plot deals on the issue of whether a young woman should marry and if that marriage should be a love marriage or arranged one. There is a middle aged childless couple the snobbish nasty Taeko Michiyo Kogure and her husband the honest good but a bit dull salary man Satake Shin Saburi. Her nephew the pretty young Setsuko Keiko Tsushima comes to visit she has to go to an interview for an arranged marriage but seeing the loveless marriage between Taeko and Satake and how she mocks him behind his back is not very interested. Ozu's best films haven't dated a bit but this one has somewhat. Moreover while I don't agree with the generalization that all of Ozu's films are slow not all of them are this one is on the leisurely paced side. What's more the movie takes some time to develop its plot so it does require a bit of patience from the viewer. You will eventually warm up to this movie I think but not immediately. On the plus side it is a good interesting movie with believable well developed characters. Chishu Ryu Chikage Awashima and Kumiko Mikaye all regular of many Ozu films have bit roles here.".

Many Ozu films centred around a marriage to be and while that is a subplot here the main story once Ozu gets around to it is about a marriage that already is and how poorly it is doing. What I mainly enjoy from Ozu isn't the plot but the great characters and their interaction and relationships. The wife in this film does walk a fine line of annoyance but in the end redeems herself. The film strolls to a wonderful climax where the estranged husband and wife realise how much they miss each other and after a talk begin love a new over a meal of tea over rice.".

Here we are offered an insight of what informs this the glum husband wants things that are 'intimate primitive familiar and relaxed' from his brand of cigarettes to pouring tea over his dinner of rice. So it seems Ozu gravitates towards his camera and world not from deep introspection or need for formalism but towards an intuition.The benefit is that he naturally envelops space. He doesn't construct it each visual scene is a soft pencilstroke tracing and retracing paths as a way of arriving at shape. Some kind of life emerges. In the scenes of the wife lounging with her friends in a spa around a table with drinks and then lazily feeding the fish in a pond or the two army buddies reminiscing about a beach in Singapore during war with its palm trees a melancholy breeze blows through it carrying sense life contact memory evocation. Individually there are wonderful visual moments here some of the best in his films.In all this he's in line with the great tea master Rikyu's instructions about serving tea whose name appears in the film. It should not be a lavish or formal ceremony but sparse and intimate looking for spontaneous appreciation of what two people relaxing in each other's presence can inspire. Serving tea is merely the opportunity the framework for contact. The flipside of that intuitive approach is that it's enough for Ozu to sketch as he goes. The idea is that life is a bit like this apparent only in retrospect. He does have in mind a larger transition a marriage that has grown cold and distant the lonely night of breaking them apart and as the man's flight is unexpectedly cancelled their coming together again in the empty house. This is a great great notion the idea that you can create an entire life and for this to slowly crystallize realization in a single moment between two people. It resembles more clearly than any of his other films where Cassavetes would take this mentality in his Woman.Ozu had tried this several times. For whatever reason probably a rushed production he's not in control of it here. This is the most disjointed of his films a real mess. The ending is possibly the worst work Ozu has done the wife now enlightened about the purpose of marriage explaining to the young girl and through her to young women in the audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "The artistic path of the Japanese master Yasujir Ozu spreads over 35 years from the latest period of silent cinema until 1962. It's the first time that I see 'Flavor of Green Tea Over Rice' which belongs to the immediate postwar period in his career. Between 1947 and 1957 Ozu back from the war and the army where he had spent seven years made one film each year. A couple of them are considered among his masterpieces and among the best films ever made. It is not exactly the case with 'Flavor of Green Tea Over Rice' which has its flaws and shows signs of aging but it's still a remarkable movie from many points of view.Ozu wrote the first script of the film in 1939 and tried to push it through the Japanese Army cinema unit he was working with but could not adapt it to the requests of censorship in times of war. Released 13 years later it belongs to the series of movies in which the director catches the process of transition that the Japanese society its people and its institutions went through during the years after the defeat of Japan and during the American occupation. The external landscape is much changed normality of peaceful even comfortable life seem to be back we see no visible signs of the destruction brought by war and there is only one scene in which the main hero meets with a former army comrade which does not look too traumatic neither too different from similar scenes that would have been done in other countries after WWII. The changes are at the level of the basic components of the society. While at the work place the working methods and technology have embraced some Western characteristics the hierarchy and the paternalistic approach continue to dominate the work relations. The family keeps the maledominated structure but under the surface there is a revolution under way in what concerns the role of women. Two generations are being presented in the story on screen. The elder one still tries to keep the appearances and cheats the old way. The younger one would not accept the old ways and traditions including the arrangements of marriages. The crisis of the family in the two generations under the pressure of changes around is the main topic of the film.The style of Ozu's story telling and film making is present and easily identifiable. Camera barely moves if at all and each scene is a composition with the characters moving in elaborate sets which are a pleasure to enjoy visually. Much of the action takes place in the home of the midupper class heroes couple and Ozu has no equal in filming inside the house with camera placed lower than most other directors locate it in order to create the feeling of intimacy and the perspective of the inhabitants of the Japanese houses. His selection of actors includes Shin Saburi in the role of the apparently dull hardworking husband whose hidden secrets and deep humanity is gradually revealed and Michiyo Kogure as the wife I liked less her interpretation. The ending is a combination of a great idea with the main reason why this film partly fails. On one side the idea of the family reconciliation through traditional food rice and tea is bright and Ozu opens here a path in the Japanese and Far East cinema that will be followed and will reach exceptional achievements in the works of other film makers many years and even decades later. Unfortunately this beautiful and sensible scene is followed by a badly scripted dialog in which the wife explains to her friends the reasons of the reconciliation. The conclusion seems both very conventional and unjustifiable submissive from the feminine perspective and the way it is being told is also surprisingly bad cinema for a film by Ozu. Luckily there is one more final scene showing the younger couple which opens the gate for the future and the feeling that transformation is on its way and is nothing but unstoppable. Even the fix camera perspective is abandoned in this final sequence. The continuation however belongs to another movie.".

Although the story has been told before  tight filmmaking and nice acting win out . Combination of overwhelming battles  and full of villainy  romance  swashbuckler and heroism . This version covers both the novel Kidnapped and the first half of its sequel Catriona . It is a little slow  at times  in the telling  mainly because of the stolid acting of the sad couple playing David and Catriona . As Lawrence Douglas seems a little frail for the adventurous David Balfour and Vivien Heilbron is hardly casting as Catriona Stewart . But Michael Caine is magnificent  though uneasily cast with his cockney accent  he lends the part sufficient swashbuckling gusto to make it work . As Caine play his character with rush and swagger . The support cast is frankly excellent though many of them were not paid because of cash problems such as Trevor Howard as Lord Advocate  Donald Pleasence as Ebenezer Balfour  Gordon Jackson as Charles Stewart  Freddie Jones  normally seen in comedy characters  as Cluny and Jack Hawkins who had lost his voice in 1966 was dubbed by Charles Gray . The Scottish Highlands are a treat for your eyes in glamorous Technicolor similarly to recent TV series Outlander . Being luxuriously shot by Paul Beeson  he was also the Director of Photography for the film Kidnapped 1960 . Sensitive as well as thrilling musical score by Roy Budd . The movie was well directed by Delbert Mann Separate tables Desire under the Elms Marty . However  the film would be a failure and panned by critics  it nowadays is best considered . The flick will appeal to adventures buffs .They are several versions based on Robert Luois Stevenson classic novel  though producers do seem to choose the most unlikely players to perform Stevenson's Alan Breck  the American Warner Baxter  subsequently Australianraised Peter Finch  then  the Cockney Michael Caine and finally the New Yorker of Italian descent Armand Assante .

Being luxuriously shot by Paul Beeson  he was also the Director of Photography for the film Kidnapped 1960 . Sensitive as well as thrilling musical score by Roy Budd . The movie was well directed by Delbert Mann Separate tables Desire under the Elms Marty . However  the film would be a failure and panned by critics  it nowadays is best considered . The flick will appeal to adventures buffs .They are several versions based on Robert Luois Stevenson classic novel  though producers do seem to choose the most unlikely players to perform Stevenson's Alan Breck  the American Warner Baxter  subsequently Australianraised Peter Finch  then  the Cockney Michael Caine and finally the New Yorker of Italian descent Armand Assante . These are the followings  1938 produced by Daryl F Zanuck  directed by Alfred Werker with Warner Baxter  Freddie Bartholomew  Arlene Whelan  John Carradine . 1960 a Disney movie by Robert Stevenson with Peter Finch  Jamez MacArthur  Peter O'Toole . 1955 Cable rendition by Ivan Passer with Armand Assante  Brian Blessed  Brian McCardie  Patrick Malahide .";

As Allen Breck he made the character everything I felt when I read the book. He looks and talks just as I pictured in my mind. Splendid indeed. David Balfou was drab and shy in the story and I found Lawrence Douglas to be just that. I love that this version follows the true chronicle especially in the beginning and I felt like I was truly along with the characters in every scene. Donald Pleasence played Ebenezer Balfour brilliantly and his scenes with David are true to the original story. No other movie of Kidnapped was the same for me. Captivating as only Robert Louis Stevenson can be.".

Those who would religiously stick to the contents of these novels will be disappointed in the adaptation. However the film has as it should IMHO a world and plot of its own. Moreover the plot is engaging and quite exciting.The film movingly portrays a culture and political cause on the verge of destruction and the politics behind it. To a certain extent it has to modify the plot of the two novels to effectively do so. Now it might have been nice if we could have heard the Scottish language spoken amongst the Highlanders. This absence makes it harder to portray the cultural conflict which was important both in the period and in the novels. However we can forgive the film's makers by remembering that such was rarely done in the early 1970s. The plot may not be entirely accurate in detail the Appin murder etc but the portrayal of the Jacobite Rebellion is both very accurate and insightful surprisingly so for a bigtime film. The ending is a terrific and original attempt to convey the thoughts and psychology of a man through the medium of film. All that aside it is a historical adventure. One either likes that genre or doesn't. If the former then the chances are you will like this.".

I have no problem with the English actors playing Scottish characters Caine here is a passable lowland Scots as Allan Breck. Actors after all are judged by their skills and interpretation of the character and that's all that matters it would be a sad day if we have to be Scottish solely to play a Scottish character. However I'm not sure that Caine's costume would be one anyone would be seen dead in it was clearly awful and hardly the sort of attire a rebel would be running around in.What matters is that it is a fine interpretation of Stevenson's story.".

He is soon rescued by a Jacobite rebel who is presently an outlaw wanted by the British government. The two men form an alliance of sorts and subsequently become involved in an incident that creates various complications.The first thing that stands out from the outset here is that the cockney actor Michael Caine is starring in the role of Alan Breck the Jacobite rebel. It seems like it must be a bit of miscasting as it is difficult imagining Caine in such a role however pleasingly he is very good here and his film star charisma is used to very good effect for this particular character. The film also benefits a lot from plenty of nice onlocation photography from around Scotland. It gives the whole production more of an authentic feel. The storyline is compelling and the direction is wellpaced while the events depicted are less overthetop than in later Scottish adventures set in historical times such as Braveheart 1995 and this for me is a good thing. The storyline eventually dovetails to a very bittersweet ending that seems like the only appropriate way to round things off.".

I guess the dialogue scenes taking precedent over sword fights and battles is caused by the producers hiring the services of some fine actors and wanting them to appear on screen as long as possible . It's fairly well acted  though I'm afraid Caine is rather miscast and he makes Alan Breck boorish and unlikable There is one thing that puzzles me in this movie and it happens fairly often  and that is people recognise Breck as soon as they seem him even though they've not met him before but why should this be ? There was no mass media in the mid 18th Century so they'd be no TV cameras or photography and I doubt if a  Wanted  poster for Breck would capture his likeness and yet nearly every time Breck is spotted someone always gasps  It's Alan Breck !

Mr Robert Louis Stephenson himself once wrote...Sometimes it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive  words to consider if you are to avoid disappointment after deciding to watch this version of Kidnapped";

It is certainly better than the Disney version with Peter Finch. I love the memorable set pieces such as the fight between Alan and David and the duel between Duncansby and David who 'doesn't know the back end of a sword from its front' and who won't 'play at the cards' with Freddie Jones due to his promise to his father. The locations were good with little studio work like the Disney version. The over the top Donald Pleasance and Freddie Jones are wonderful but so are all the rest. I especially liked the nervous dithering lawyer played by Gordon Jackson. Micheal Caine was at his peak so must have been a coup for the producers who were hardly likely to make him a minor character. As previously stated Lawrence Douglas was suitably downtrodden and dowdy. My only question is why he responded to Duncansby's insult so swiftly and violently. As he is portrayed as thoughtful and principled I would have at least thought he would have tried to elicit an apology by reason rather that demanding immediate satisfaction in the knowledge of certain death. I think the only better version was the serialised version with David McCallum as Alan Breck but as a serial had much greater time to give an in depth portrayal.".

The idea of having an Englishman play the role only adds weight to the fiction that anything here resembles genuine Highland history. The i is dotted with the garish swashbuckle mustachio sported by Caine. And that hair. Why?It is also interesting that most of the characters seem to have amazing skill in keeping their hair perfectly clean straight and shiny and if they just left a hair salon when they are yomping around the Trossachs hiding from the English!The dialogue is wrought with semicondescending boring statements. I can not count how many times I heard words like heather bonnie or lassie from people who should not even be speaking English. It is overtly evident that none of the people involved with this movie from the caterers to the director had ANY historical background into Highland history and no knowledge of the culture apart from stereotype and myth.It was wellintentioned and not cynical so it does have some strengths.

What does come across presumably from the script particularly the comments of Trevor Howards character and Michael Caine's 'less is more portrayal' of Alan Breck is the sense of loss of the 'Celtic' past.

Having grown up firmly 'English' I begin to feel that there seems to be an element of 'ethnic cleansing' went on.As an aside study by comparison I recommend John Buchan's 'John Burnet of Barns' 'Thirty Nine Steps' and 'Mr Standfast' which suggest that flight across the Scotish landscape has some deeper place in the psyche of the Scots.".

Not only is the famous Stevenson novel taken to David Balfour's return and vindication but we go a bit farther with the story based on Stevenson's successor novel Catriona and we get the Kidnapped story firmly entrenched in the times it happened.Those times being the days after the Battle Of Culloden where the Scottish people chose between the returning French speaking Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Hanover monarchy of George II in 1745. At Culloden the Stuart forces were destroyed and the Hanoverians firmly in control after that. Those were bad times to be a Highlander and a supporter of the Stuarts.Lawrence Douglas plays young David Balfour and Michael Caine is Alan Breck his friend and rescuer during the kidnapping of young Balfour by Captain Jack Hawkins at the behest of Balfour's uncle Donald Pleasance.I'll not say more as the story of Kidnapped is well known. As for the continuing material from Catriona the differences between Alan Breck and David Balfour are brought out. Lawrence Douglas is a Hanoverian supporter and Breck a soldier in the army of Prince Charles. However Douglas is an honest young man and goes to bat for a Stuart accused of a crime he did not commit. That sets the rival Campbell clan against him and puts Advocate General Trevor Howard in a delicate position.Howard's character is not in the first novel and he's a decent man in an impossible political position. It's Alan Breck however who sets things right in the end for all concerned.Previous versions with Warner Baxter and Freddie Bartholomew and Peter Finch and James MacArthur only concentrated on the Kidnapped story. The FinchMacArthur version was from Disney and marketed for kids. This film is more adult and firmly set in the politics of the time with a good ensemble cast. I'd check this out especially if I liked the work of Robert Louis Stevenson.".

This monster is sillylooking the FX are horrid the music is terrible and the film is a total blast. The X attacking planes and destroying buildings is just good and bad enough to make everyone happy.The reason this film is a blast is because it has a lot of charm and heart. Those are a few of the ingredients that certain giant monster films made back then lack and that's why they are unwatchable and truly bad while films like X From Outer Space are bad but have enough of those things to make it fun. When a film lacks those things and is clueless you get dreck like Queen Kong and A.P.E.There's nothing wrong with The X From Outer Space if you are simply into watching fun giant monster films with actors in suits no computer crap stomping on miniature buildings and swatting airplanes on wires out of the sky.".

It boasts one of the most absurd looking monsters ever who you can't help but love because of his ludicrous appearance.The script goes to great lengths to explain the origin of the creature so the movie drags a little at first.

They divert to an established Moon base after the UFO just wanders off for some reason.You have to wait a while to see the creature named Guilala  but it's well worth the wait. He's part chicken part dinosaur and has what appears to be a snorkel coming out of his forehead. He has beaming red eyes and the best of all two wire antennae that wobble around like those wire things with balls on the end you wear on your head if you're going as a bumblebee or something like that for Halloween. Of course he goes on a rampage in Tokyo shrieking like a banshee the whole time as he smashes buildings and other stuff.The human characters are developed pretty well and the actors actually appear to be taking their roles seriously. As ridiculous as the script is the characters actually have believable personalities and back stories. There's an odd triangle with two beauties named Michiko and Lisa both after Capt. Sanu who just grunts when they talk to him. Fans of insanely cheesy camp will love this one it's just utter craziness all the way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though a bit slow at the beginning THE X FROM OUTER SPACE is one of those overthetop silly Japanese monster movies that they just don't make anymore and is totally fun to watch because you can't believe how silly everything is. The film is very juvenile and was most likely made for 5 year old kids more than anyone else.If you listen to the dialogue at the beginning of the film when the astronauts are introduced there are a lot of double entendres to be heard like when the man tells a grinning Lisa Peggy Neal However you are to touch nothing unless specifically authorised by the Captain Sano. ARF!!! I wonder if the folks who dubbed the film deliberately made it sound so funny.The scene on the moon or in space are pretty much pointless but they're funny nonetheless. The best thing in the movie is the monster itself Guilala what a sad name for a monster!. When Guilala attacks it walks about like a drunken fool as if it got no clue of what it was doing. Maybe the guy in the suit couldn't keep his balance because the models were so cheap and fragile. The monster's roar was really funny to hear. Like someone clearing his throat. When Guilala shoots its fireballs it looks like he's burping them out. The whole moment when the monster destroys a building and Lisa gets trapped beneath some rubble they make a big deal about the fact that her leg is trapped and she's in pain is priceless because soon afterwards she walks about like nothing had happened. Another great scene is when Guilala runs after a truck. It's laugh out loud funny. But the really goofy thing about this film is how fast the characters go from the earth to the moon and vice versa. It's like the moon was only a couple of miles away and as easy to access as the nearest shopping mall.But the film is not all goofiness. When the monster turns into a fireball and flies about Japan destroying everything in its path well the film sorta becomes cool for a fraction of a second. And the ending when the monster is attacked for the last time well I felt bad for the poor old space chicken! But the producers set it up so a sequel was possible. Where's the sequel? I want to see Guilala battle Baragon. BTW the container which holds tiny Guilala at the end looks like a camping lamp.The worst thing about THE X FROM OUTER SPACE is the music. Aside from the fun song the actual music used when the monster attacks is basically the same thing played repeatedly over and over. It gets really tiresome.".

Although  now that I think of it  some people might prefer the dubbed version precisely because of its goofiness. Of course that's just the dialog and even the most handsome presentation of this film can't obscure its marvelously wacky weirdness. The miniatures and effects are kind of a mixed bag. The spacerelated sets and models are actually fairly well executed but the monster effects are often subToho sometimes hilariously so like when an absurdly outofscale F101 Starfighter crashes into the X and just sort of hangs there for a few seconds. I think that's more from a lack of experience with kaiju flicks on the part of the studio and its technicians than pennypinching. In the Criterion edition at least it's obvious that Shochiku put a not inconsiderable amount of money into this production.Silly as it undeniably is there are in fact some very creative moments in this movie such as when the monster absorbs too much energy from a nuclear reactor and turns into a gigantic redhot sphere which bounces around Tokyo wreaking fiery havoc until it plunges into a lake.When you look at the competition stuff like Gappa The Triphibian Monster and Yongary in its very odd and quite unique way this is clearly one of the most entertaining of the Tohowannabe giant monster films of the 60s.".

	schema:reviewBody "Needless to say Godzilla and his pals had something of an impact on the box office. People worldwide were flocking to see Toho studios Kaiju films which was great for the studio. Not only did they have something that was a smash hit in their home countryit was big worldwide. So of course others tried to capitalize. In Korea there was Yonggary. London gave us Gorgo. Denmark offered the world Reptilicus. Even America go into the action with The Giant Mantis and The Giant Claw. I'm sure that Toho was amused and pleased that for a change a Japanese Studio was giving the rest of world a run for it's money instead of the other way around.Of course other studios in Japan tried to capitalize on this. Daei gave the world the Gamera and Daimaijin films. Toei released The Magic Serpent. Nikkatsu responded with Monster From a Prehistoric Planet. However the most out there of these movies was The X From Outer Space which came from the well respected Shochiku studios who gave the world films such as Tokyo Story and Night and Fog in Japan which also kick started a brief foray into the world of genre films.The spaceship AAB Gamma has been sent to Mars so it can investigate reports of UFO's that seem to be surrounding the area. After running into a strange UFO which according to one scientist Looks like a giant omelet! that leaves some strange sporelike substance on the ship the crew decides that would be a nifty idea to bring a sample with them. This of course turns out to be what Gob from Arrested Development would call A Huge Mistake. That's because said sample soon turns into a giant monster that begins to run roughshod on Japan because apparently Godzilla or one of Gamera's enemies were on vacation. Also the monster is named Guilala and he looks like...well he looks like a lizardchicken hybrid.What's interesting about The X From Outer Space is that is all starts out a lot like other space themed science fiction movies from the time. There's a bouncy theme song it's got plenty of cool model and miniature effects there's plenty of matte paintings and everyone seems more interested in chilling out and drinking cocktails while bachelor pad music plays than they are solving whatever crisis is at hand. When Guilala does show up thing takes a turn for the what the hell and doesn't look back. There's a sense of fun to most of the proceedings as if the people who aren't taking all of this too seriously.It's also interesting that even though he craves radiation like a certain mutated dinosaur and it's obvious as all get out that the people behind the movie are doing everything they can to compete with himrip him off it even breathes fire! the whole thing has a lighthearted atmosphere to it. There's little to no attempt at trying to do some sort of social commentary like some of the Godzilla movies or Mothra or the genre films Shochiku released afterwards. This is a to the point monster movie that simply wants to entertain the audience and damn it it succeeds. The whole thing is so thoroughly goofy I dare you not to laugh when an airplane crashes into the monsters head for no reason other than some sort of directorial goof campy and all around fun that it's impossible not to enjoy what's going on here. Only the most stuffy shirted type could not be charmed at the nuttiness on display.At the end of the day The X From Outer Space is nothing more than a light but charming little Kaiju film. It doesn't have the muscle of the best Godzilla movies but it doesn't need it. It's campy light entertainment that just happens to be a lot of fun and that's all I asked for.".

I'm sure that Toho was amused and pleased that for a change a Japanese Studio was giving the rest of world a run for it's money instead of the other way around.Of course other studios in Japan tried to capitalize on this. Daei gave the world the Gamera and Daimaijin films. Toei released The Magic Serpent. Nikkatsu responded with Monster From a Prehistoric Planet. However the most out there of these movies was The X From Outer Space which came from the well respected Shochiku studios who gave the world films such as Tokyo Story and Night and Fog in Japan which also kick started a brief foray into the world of genre films.The spaceship AAB Gamma has been sent to Mars so it can investigate reports of UFO's that seem to be surrounding the area. After running into a strange UFO which according to one scientist Looks like a giant omelet! that leaves some strange sporelike substance on the ship the crew decides that would be a nifty idea to bring a sample with them. This of course turns out to be what Gob from Arrested Development would call A Huge Mistake. That's because said sample soon turns into a giant monster that begins to run roughshod on Japan because apparently Godzilla or one of Gamera's enemies were on vacation. Also the monster is named Guilala and he looks like...well he looks like a lizardchicken hybrid.What's interesting about The X From Outer Space is that is all starts out a lot like other space themed science fiction movies from the time. There's a bouncy theme song it's got plenty of cool model and miniature effects there's plenty of matte paintings and everyone seems more interested in chilling out and drinking cocktails while bachelor pad music plays than they are solving whatever crisis is at hand. When Guilala does show up thing takes a turn for the what the hell and doesn't look back. There's a sense of fun to most of the proceedings as if the people who aren't taking all of this too seriously.It's also interesting that even though he craves radiation like a certain mutated dinosaur and it's obvious as all get out that the people behind the movie are doing everything they can to compete with himrip him off it even breathes fire! the whole thing has a lighthearted atmosphere to it. There's little to no attempt at trying to do some sort of social commentary like some of the Godzilla movies or Mothra or the genre films Shochiku released afterwards. This is a to the point monster movie that simply wants to entertain the audience and damn it it succeeds. The whole thing is so thoroughly goofy I dare you not to laugh when an airplane crashes into the monsters head for no reason other than some sort of directorial goof campy and all around fun that it's impossible not to enjoy what's going on here. Only the most stuffy shirted type could not be charmed at the nuttiness on display.At the end of the day The X From Outer Space is nothing more than a light but charming little Kaiju film. It doesn't have the muscle of the best Godzilla movies but it doesn't need it. It's campy light entertainment that just happens to be a lot of fun and that's all I asked for.";

OK our Rocket Captain Hero Sano is supposed to be torn between his Japanese girlfriend Michiko and a blonde Western scientist Lisa. Michiko is supposed to be intensely jealous of Lisa. And in the end Sano is supposed to realize that he is better off with a Japanese girl 'cause apparently the races are not meant to mingle or something.The problem is Sano never shows any real affection for either woman while Lisa and Michiko are bestest friends when M. isn't pouting over Sano. They even buy each other gifts and show up together dressed for dinner. It becomes much easier to imagine that Lisa and Michiko are the two in a relationship and that M. is jealous of Lisa's attraction to Sano.

Needless to say contact with Earth's atmosphere causes the spore to become Guilala where do they come up with these names?! a cross between a giant chicken and a dinosaur.

For instance Peggy Neal an actress who unwisely used Japan as a starting point for a failed movie career and a Japanese astronaut Eija Okada sadly far removed from brilliant films like Hiroshima Mon Amour bounce across the moon.

It reminds me of Varan The Unbelievable when the army comes up with a detailed miniature model of Varan for their strategy board only minutes after the monster first appears.The miniatures tanks and jets are subpar even for Japanese films. In one scene a jet gets taken out and hits the water looking about as large as an oil tanker. The funniest part of the movie aside from the annoying theme song Stars are our destiny... is the monster. It looks as if the monster suit is a size too large for the actor inside. Guilala shoots fireballs so fakelooking you can almost see the strings guiding them towards the tanks and jets. The monster smashes through the cheap cardboard city buildings a little too quickly obviously the director didn't know that slowing the film speed a little would have helped. It's roar is at first laughable then finally just plain irritating. There's a scene later where Guilala chases after a jeep hauling a trailer full of radioactive material. The jeep's doing about 80 and Guilala's running after it in slowmotion not the slowmo like Six Million Dollar Man but as if the actor was being told to walk oddly to avoid catching up to the jeep too quickly.I saw this film on Creature Double Feature a hugely popular syndicated scifihorror anthology popular in the 1970's and early 80's wow I'm getting old. I watched it just for the laughs when I was only seven so that shows how bad the film is if it can't get past a child.".

	schema:reviewBody "These are some of the lines that actress Peggy Neal has to utter in this silly Japanese monster flick. Story is about a team of astronauts that are to be sent to Mars because the previous ships that went have not reported back and they think it has something to do with the UFO activity in the area. The team of astronauts are led by Capt. Sano Toshiya Wazaki and one of his crew members is an American biologist named Lisa Neal and she is in love with Sano but Sano has a girlfriend Michiko Itoko Harada and she works at the lunar station on the Moon. While in space the ship encounters UFO's but they also discover some sort of growth on the outside of the ship. They collect what looks like an egg and bring it back to Earth. While this egg sits in a lab something happens to it and a creature hatches out. It grows to enormous size and it feeds on nuclear energy. It can spit out fire balls and goes on a rampage across Japan. They figure out that a certain element can stop it and they load up the missile's and send out the jets. This film was directed by Kazui Nihonmatsu and the first 30 to 45 minutes I thought that this was a silly but passable scifi flick but once the monster gets loose than the silliness goes just as you would expect of these Japanese monster movies. Neal recites lines about how she learned something from the monster but one thing that I found to be the funniest is that her character is suppose to be in love with Wazaki who appears to be even shorter than she is. And he spends the whole film being very stoic and keeping things very professional. I also laughed when the team of astronauts are in space and Neal who is a biologist is still expected to get coffee and hand out meals to everyone. So much for being a biologist! The special effects are pretty bad even by Mothra standards and in one scene two people are suppose to be floating while on the Moon but it's obvious that they are jumping up and down on a hidden trampoline in slow motion. The studio brought out the toy tanks and jets and of course when in space you can see the wires. The monster costume is especially laughable and it's kind of a cross between a lizard and a chicken but it has two antenna's on it's head. There is also this spout sticking out of it's forehead and I guess I missed the scene where this was put to use by the monster. I did like the two actress's in the film Neal and Harada and in one scene they are both taking a shower and kicking the soap back and forth. This is your typical low budget Japanese monster movie with extremely bad special effects. Like I said typical!".

We follow the space shuttle crew of AABGamma as they attempt to try once more to reach Mars..but such as the other voyages before them the crew encounter the same UFO which endangers them by leaving emitted clouds of vapor. This vapor leaves their ship at halfpower without the ability to accelerate at full thrust or a navigational system. They collect a mysterious luminous object from their outer hull vacuum sealing it in a canister for further study.

The premise is beyond absurd and weird but there's a lot of enjoyment in store for those who can tune out the silly story. Poor cast really try to sell this picture regardless of the material. The monster itself is hilarious. Goofy mindless fun.".

However Japan's oldest studio Shochiku finally got into the act with what is probably the worst film in the genre. The monster definitely looks like a combination of a reptile and giant chicken and it definitely looked like one of the worst monsters that was ever created. As for the story the writers looked as if they couldn't decide to make this film a serious sciencefiction film or a spoof. Peggy Neal is the typical damsel in distress and makes it worse by acting like the stereotypical ditsy blonde. The rest of the cast is even worse. At least Toho's kaiju films had not only good stories but great acting as well. This was definitely the genre at its worst.".

Then the crazy dubbing over the Japanese voices which is hilarious. Just listen to when they identify the ship AA B GAMMA... AA B GAMMA! There's also the scenes on the moon with the nearly visible trampolines with people in space suits jumping merely up and down. Classic.But then like an hour into the movie the real treat. GUILALA arrives on the scene.When GUILALA pronounce gee la la with little emphasis on the g sound arrives on Earth all hell breaks lose. This space chicken from hell sure packs a punch. He lays waste to the whole Japanese air defense force one plane smacks him square in the face and he keeps on going. His fire ball breath is a riot especially when he hits the one plane directly above him perfectly. He does a lot of cool stuff including absorb nuclear energy and transform in a large energy ball that can set cities on fire sparing a few neighborhoods however.GUILALA should have had his own series as GODZILLA and GAMERA have had. He's got power charisma and a certain cheesy charm with those glowing red eyes and silly antenna bobbing up and down. I love the little guy's roar too. RRRrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaRR!!!Along with my friend Stephanie I felt really sad for poor GUILALA in the end.... SPOILERS!!!   DO NOT READ ANY FARTHER  SPOILERS!!! ...they defeat GUILALA using a rare material known as Guilalium which blocks GUILALA's main drive it stops the flow of energy. Using some remaining jets the Japanese Defense Air Force literally bukkakes the mighty monster into his small harmless spore form. This movie marks the first bukkake scene in history.GUILALA is then launched into space as a spore. Sadly when the end credits roll you too will feel bad for the little guy. Hopefully we may see a remake or sequel down the road but since this was made in 1967 the chances are slim.Note that GUILALA isn't the only space chicken seen in kaiju giant monster movies. GODZILLA's foe GIGAN is also a space chicken although GIGAN came later and he had cybernetic enhancements such as a chest buzz saw.Pray for an American DVD release for THE X FROM OUTER SPACE because it is only available on DVD as an import.GUILALA THE X FROM OUTER SPACE is truly a kaiju classic and it's a lot of fun to watch with a group of friends. Give it a whirl.GUILALA had earned the right to be recognized among Monster Island legends GODZILLA RODAN MOTHRA KING GHIDORAH GAMERA and GYAOS! ALL HAIL GUILALA!".

The script or the subtitling  I don't speak Japanese so I don't know who to creditblame is over the top the spaceship is christened the Astroboat which although perhaps a legitimate translation of the much cooler term starship sounds like some kind of space scow and the flying saucer is described as looking like a half cooked omelette. The monster predates Alien for burning holes in the floor creepy but then leaves an acidic footprint resembling a chicken's goofy. The final monster itself is memorable a beak surrounded by cheeks like Gary Colman's set in a triangular head with BOTH antenna and some kind of horn more of the flugle type than the pointy type usually associated with monsters which is perched on an enormous scaly body propelled by immense chickenlike feet. Plus it shoot fireballs out its mouth and eats radioactivity no surprise there most kaiju eat radioactivity AND turns into a flying ball of radioactive fire! The miniature work especially the space port and moon station are excellent and the Astroboat is imaginative similar American movies would just use stock footage of V2s  forward for takeoff reversed for landing. The spaceship crew is a classic mix of stoic captain sexy female scientist comicrelief guy and cowardly guy who panics when the going gets tough. As well there is a little romantic intrigue between the astronaut eyecandy and the moonbase eyecandy which helps soften the scenes of carnage as the Guilala the eponymous X wrecks Tokyo. On the IMDb 1  10 scale this is a '1' for regular viewers but an '11' for hardcore diakaiju fans and for viewers who have to peer around their bong to see the TV screen so I'll give it a 6 because I lean toward the diakaiju fan side of the equation.".

Julianne Moore is a delight to watch even though her role is less comedic and challenging. Joan Cusack is hilarious. Tom Arnold is quite annoying but sometimes he's okay.

Since I did not see the entire thing let's just leave this review without a score. Does that make everyone happy? Okay great.";

	schema:reviewBody "OK so here's the deal. Take director Chris Columbus Harry Potter stars Hugh Grant Four Weddings Notting Hill Love Actually Julianne Moore Oscar winner and sprinkle with a little Robin Williams and you can't fail  right? Sadly wrong this is so gruesome it must have seen theatre goers leaving in droves before the end. I do not want to write a spoiler review and might accept that if you spend your life with romantic novels think that TV soaps are the height of sophistication and have lost part of your neural reasoning you might survive to the end. But if you still have half an operable brain instead of spending 90 minutes with this drivel you would be better advised to lock yourself away in a dark room and contemplate the meaning of life.There actually isn't a plot girl gets pregnant  father worries  that's a plot??.

Take director Chris Columbus Harry Potter stars Hugh Grant Four Weddings Notting Hill Love Actually Julianne Moore Oscar winner and sprinkle with a little Robin Williams and you can't fail  right? Sadly wrong this is so gruesome it must have seen theatre goers leaving in droves before the end. I do not want to write a spoiler review and might accept that if you spend your life with romantic novels think that TV soaps are the height of sophistication and have lost part of your neural reasoning you might survive to the end. But if you still have half an operable brain instead of spending 90 minutes with this drivel you would be better advised to lock yourself away in a dark room and contemplate the meaning of life.There actually isn't a plot girl gets pregnant  father worries  that's a plot??.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very strange film to watch but easy to do so despite the fact that the plot is only added to near the end of the film with the men in black. It's no masterpiece at all not even on a low budget standard but one thing that brings above a lot of other films is a great performance by Joe Morton as The Brother not an easy role to do but his mute performance is pulled off so charismatically that we can't help but be drawn into to The Brother's adventures. The film is at times very witty very clever and very charming. John Sayles writerdirector did well at adding in just enough subtle comedy. Most of the way through the film is not really a science fiction film it just happens to contain an alien. If I were to hazard a guess at how Sayles came up with the idea of The Brother From Another Planet I would assume he started with the idea of what if everything was kind of new and unfamiliar to you as if you were born again he probably started with that and worked from there to form this delightful film. One down side is the ending because as I mentioned before 80 of the film is not really science fiction like but the ending is very much science fiction but it doesn't spoil the picture too much.I give this gem a firm 810.".

Soon we also find out about two men in black who are after the brother and want to get rid of him. He also shows his many alien talents during the film. Winner of The Caixa de Catalunya Award for Best Actor Joe Morton who plays the brother and Best Screenplay John Sayles who also directed and edited the film at The Catalonian International Film Festival. The Brother From Another Planet has good direction a good script a good performance by Joe Morton as well as a good supporting cast good original music good cinematography and good film editing. The Brother From Another Planet takes a little while to get into but gives us an entertaining story a likable main character and likable side characters interesting situations and the script is filled with good dialogue good character development is full of smart satire and unusual characters and lots of unique situations and plot twists. The film is quite enjoyable and entertaining and is deliciously different. I enjoyed this film quite a bit and it is a nice clever scificomedy.".

Joe Morton as this brother from the other planet has no dialogue but effectively portrays a true illegal alien. He really is a frail being who just wants to do good and be needed. He is being hunted by what appears to be his owners but he affects everyone he comes across in such a positive way that they get behind him 100 and keep these thugs from getting him. He eventually earns his money by fixing things with his otherworldly powersonce he realizes that stealing isn't right and even gets to the point of hunting down a drug dealer in Harlem who has caused the demise of a young one in the neighborhood. This character is probably the most likable alien that has ever been put on the screennext to maybe E.T. and it's definitely a departure from most films. The low production value is certainly evident but the character and the storyline keeps you interested and rooting for this unlikely hero from another planet. These were the type of quiet independent movies that were made in the 80's when it was truly seen that the budget was low but the makers only cared about creating a worthwhile project and John Sayles definitely did that with this one. This 80's relic is not to be missed by a true cinemaphile or anyone who wants to see the benefits of good deeds even if it's coming from someone with feet a little different than ours.".

John Sayles the director is one of the immigration agents while the other is David Strathairn. You've got Fisher Stevens and Giancarlo Esposito in small roles. It just goes on and on. Of course in 1984 they were not known actors but they proved in time that they are good ones.The plot is simple an alien running on Earth from two enforcers but the script is filled with complexity tackling in a subtle way things like racism social status societal satire. And they are part of the story while this quiet Joe Morton doesn't say a word all movie timid alien is discovering Earth with its good and bad points starting from Harlem.Bottom line highly underrated film it is low budget but it has class. I am not surprised it has become a cult classic and I am glad I had the chance to see it. And it's free! You can watch it online royalty free.".

He meets various people such as some quirky interesting black characters in a bar setting who would befriend him even though he doesn't say anything to them. He often sits or looks on as people just chat away. He has gifted abilities such as his touch being able to repair equipment magically the way his right eye can be removed and used as an image recording device can heal wounds or how anything solid object he embraces with his touch can speak from the noise of a past incident. In Harlem he's introduced to racism poverty lust drugs crime sex among other things as two alien policeplayed by director Sayles and his frequent actor David Strathairnare trying to locate his whereabouts so they can haul him in. The film show our alien's particular interest in two tragic dopepushers..and abusersand how their plight might result from wealthy uptown types. I think ultimately the film is a candid fishoutofwater view of Harlem's plight from a babe's pointofview.Introspective tale regarding Harlem and how it is viewed by many a beat cop who chats with our alien two white men from Indiana who get lost etc. I thought the film was on target using comedy as an avenue to expose what had happened to Harlem over the years. Particularly interesting is listening to the men in the bar as they often are our real insight into how Halrem has changed over the years. Joe Morton is really amazing because he has to be convincing without a line of dialogue. Having us believe he's from some other planet is not the easiest task but it's a credit to the actor and his director that this flick accomplishes it. Just a brilliant indie from acclaimed writerdirector Sayles.".

He's taken in by the citizens of Harlem who grow to like him...but he's being followed by two men in black John Sayles and David Stratham who want to bring him back to outer space.An interesting change of pace for directorwriter and editor John Sayles...but it doesn't really work. I caught this in 1984 at an art cinema and was pretty unimpressed. My thoughts haven't really changed much. There's no real plot...just Morton wandering around and meeting all these odd but always friendly people. The dialogue is great and Morton is excellent that's why I'm giving it a 6 but the rest of the acting is pretty bad except for Sayles and Stratham and nothing really happens. It just sort of lays there. It also leads to a real ambiguous ending which could be interpreted a number of different ways. Still this was the kind of independent film that came out in the 1980s and 90s before Hollywood took them over. For that alone this is interesting to watch. It has been beautifully restored by the Anarchists Covention ??? and UCLA. It looks better now than it did in 1984!".

Morton gives a sensational performance as the mute fugitive. Sayles and David Strathairn are a hoot as men in black pursuing runaway slave Morton. The brother has empathic abilities and can fix electronics with a touch but unlike ET and Starman cannot restore people to life. There's a subplot about heroin that seems out of place and the script meanders a bit but on the whole this is a winner.

	schema:headline " Early John Sayles film made it's mark and introduced talent";
	schema:reviewBody "I think John Sayles is one of the greatest directors in America. This is his first commercial film still was small independent and low budget. While Matewan or others may have been better films I think this is a good second place offering from such a talented director. I'm so excited that this film is finally out on DVD. I can see the facial expressions on Joe Mortons face so much clearer it reminds me of when I saw it in the theatre over 15 years ago. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time out of many thousands! It has so much in it of commentaries about American life including of course race and cultures. But it goes much deeper than that. Wildly entertaining and funny while also being a tense thriller at times about someone on the run from the bad authorities. The story is about a runaway slave or convict who has escaped in a spaceship and crash landed on earth arriving on Ellis Island. A new twist on the meaning of illegal alien. He sneaks on the boat to shore and begins exploring New York City learning fast this strange but wonderful culture that of mid1980s New York City which was a wonderfully rich culture. He ends up spending some of his extra time in a rundown bar in Harlem where the regular clientele expound the wisdom of the ages while they try to figure out who this guy is that can't talk. Joe Morton's character has no speech capability but manages to communicate at least as well with his facial and body gestures. Meanwhile the bounty hunters from space are on his trail in NYC just missing him sometimes but getting ever closer.Speaking of characters this film is full of more talent than any other film I can recall. That they did all this on a low budget just amazes me because ALL the actors do such good acting. There is a lot of dialog in this film and a large cast. Most of them have been in many films since and got their start in this one. In addition to being in many of John Sayles' other films David Strathairn has been in dozens of other recent films and is a wellrecognized face. Joe Morton played two of his most outstanding roles in this film and in the cult movie Trouble in Mind. After that he has been in hot demand in Hollywood to this day. I just keep seeing him in movies and he really deserves it he is such a great actor! And the list goes on. Finally the music sound track is just gorgeous mostly light reggae dub and light jazz. Just wonderful and now it is back in print too on CD. Marvelous!".

	onyx:emotionText "I think John Sayles is one of the greatest directors in America. This is his first commercial film still was small independent and low budget. While Matewan or others may have been better films I think this is a good second place offering from such a talented director. I'm so excited that this film is finally out on DVD. I can see the facial expressions on Joe Mortons face so much clearer it reminds me of when I saw it in the theatre over 15 years ago. This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time out of many thousands! It has so much in it of commentaries about American life including of course race and cultures. But it goes much deeper than that. Wildly entertaining and funny while also being a tense thriller at times about someone on the run from the bad authorities. The story is about a runaway slave or convict who has escaped in a spaceship and crash landed on earth arriving on Ellis Island. A new twist on the meaning of illegal alien. He sneaks on the boat to shore and begins exploring New York City learning fast this strange but wonderful culture that of mid1980s New York City which was a wonderfully rich culture. He ends up spending some of his extra time in a rundown bar in Harlem where the regular clientele expound the wisdom of the ages while they try to figure out who this guy is that can't talk.

The film starts out with a bang but then whimpers and limps to the end. Well the ending wasn't really dreadful. But still the writing was far too uninspired while the direction didn't add anything to help it. Of all the other characters I found the woman doctor to be highly annoying. She gives philosophical answers to difficult questions. I suspected who the serial killer would be halfway through the movie and it turned out I was right. Its bit of a clich actually. I know many disagree with me on this but I have to say Milla Jovovich is a pretty good actress and this movie actually proved it.

	schema:reviewBody "I have mixed reactions after watching this movie. In some ways the movie has exceeded my expectations but then lets it down again and again.On the positive side there hasn't been a good whodunit murder mystery in a long time. Taking that into consideration this movie is a welcome change and even starts of as a good murder mystery. Another welcome change is having Milla Jovovich in a more meaningful role as compared to her heroic association with the Resident Evil franchise. As Anna Merchant Jovovich is a primary school teacher who witnesses a horrific murder after a night out with her friends. Dubbed Tearjerk Jack for violating women after killing them and then weeping over their lifeless bodies the serial killer chases Anna until she falls off a bridge. Two weeks later Anna wakes up in a hospital with a rare condition known as Prosopagnosia or Face Blindness where her ability to recognize faces is impaired. The disorder becomes an ordeal when she can no longer recognize her friends the children she teaches and even people close to her like her father. After therapy Anna realizes that Face Blindness is a serious disorder unless she learns to cope with it. In the process she gets close to detective Kerrest Julian McMahon and learns that the serial killer is still at large. Worse the killer knows of her condition and is now closing in to finish the job. Written and directed by Julian Magnat the concept is almost original and suffices as a thriller. Anna's confusion is actually felt because Magnat uses an average of 3 to 4 actors for each character in the movie. Anna's boyfriend Bryce played by Michael Shanks is also played by about 10 other actors. This premise works to some extant by placing the audience in Anna's perspective and each time we see different faces. Prosopagnosia is an actual disorder and portraying it in this movie is a definite tick mark for Magnat. Then it all goes downhill. The rest of the movie becomes so clichd it gets to be annoyingly predictable. With most whodunits the audience is always introduced to the killer sometimes very early in the plot before unveiling who the killer is. With this movie Magnat does the same but places the killer in easy reach of Anna. So why then should we wait till the end of the movie for the killer to strike? Obviously because the film has to be made with a minimum runtime of 100 minutes! But it doesn't stop there. The ending has to be the mother of all clichs when Anna cannot tell the difference between the hero and the killer because they wear the same clothes. Another negative aspect is the unnecessary romance thrown in. In all of this mess Anna is romantically inclined to one character who happens to have the only face she can recognize. Go figure! For a thriller Milla Jovovich is not bad as the lead character. No way is she getting anywhere near an Oscar for her performance here but her portrayal is definitely better than some of her other releases. I can't really say much about the other actors as there are various actors that keep switching each time Anna encounters another character. Since this is Magnat's second foray as director and first as screenwriter I don't want to be too harsh on the outcome. As a learning curve if he had paid a little more attention to the plot and it's execution in the final act this could have been a master thriller.Watch it if you have to but on a lazy day. As an alternative I recommend 1992's Blink a similar concept but with a better finish starring the lovely Madeleine Stowe.".

As an alternative I recommend 1992's Blink a similar concept but with a better finish starring the lovely Madeleine Stowe.";

The movie flows nicely we learn more about Anna's condition some tension building up we start to suspect one or the other and then well it becomes quite clear who the killer is. And from that point on of course things aren't that interesting anymore considering the fact that the thrill kinda lost its touch. Nevertheless overall it is a nice breath of fresh air really trust me you can do a whole lot worse than this one just keep in mind it's not really a horror more of a thriller with some horror elements incorporated but few at number. Also if you liked it and you probably will you MUST try Julia's Eyes! You can call these 2 movies step sisters to be honest in my opinion the Spanish one wins tho!So don't waste more time try it out try both of them out nice adder to the gender!".

	schema:reviewBody "Faces in the Crowd is a watchable partly enjoyable thrillerserial killer film starring a nerdily cute and youthfullooking Milla Jovovich who's one of my alltime crushes I've got to admit it. Her character Anna gets attacked by a serial killer known as Tearjerk Jack. She survives yet loses the ability to recognise faces  so far a nice variant of the classic amnesia and blind witness themes. I actually had come in contact with people suffering from prosopagnosia so when this topic emerged in the film I became intrigued I hadn't known the film was about but had chosen it just due to its cast. It was also refreshing to see Ms Jovovich in the role of a vulnerable character. Don't get me wrong I always enjoyed and always will enjoy seeing Milla kick arse.Sadly some generic and even kitschy plot elements have found their way into the script. SPOILERS We've got the woman who walks home alone and at night mind you and of course takes a 90 rape chance short cut at the first opportunity. We've got the lone cop who protects the sole witness by driving her to his picturesque home town. And we see said hunted witness leaving a hideout because her boyfriend sent her a text message.Furthermore the acting is sometimes a bit on the odd side yet not as bad as it is stated to be in some posts around here. On the upside the main character's face blindness allows some interesting aspects and twists. The effect of the changing faces is creepy achieved by different actors playing the same character and can keep a viewer off balance.So if you are looking for something in the neighbourhood of Blink or Los Ojos de Julia or if you like Milla Jovovich give this one a try.6.510 710 including the Milla bonus".

It is a disorder of face perception where the ability to recognize faces is impaired...so you can see where this can definitely become a nightmare in reality.Faces in the Crowd is a directtoDVD release which surprisingly exceeds expectations. From being her fan in the Resident Evil franchise where acting is put in the back seats to blockbuster action Milla's transition from an action heroine to a emotionally distraught survivor in a close encounter with the serial killer tear jerk jack becomes evident and worthy of applause. Trying to figure out who the serial killer is made a challenge even for the audience since we are not given the true face of the killer as his face changes throughout his encounters with Milla Anna. This helps with the whodunit aspect of the movie........BUT...having said that MINOR SPOILER....it's still too obvious who the killer is. That's the problem with this and every Hollywood crime movie in reality the killer is never someone you know or would have any associations with. The chances of being in contact with a serial killer is probably like winning the lottery even the 10 jackpot. The premise was certainly compelling and what got me to watching this well and Milla but with this typical Hollywood flaw of I'll make the serial killer someone near you it dummies up the movie and makes it a clich instantly. If they only made the killer a total stranger it would have been a smart thriller...Julian McMahon's character as the detective on the case is alright. Nothing spectacular but does his job could do without the slight beer belly and the grubby look though. But the writer just had to make him into a love interest of Anna? LOL.".

	schema:reviewBody "After viewing the trailer for this virtually unknown thriller I got excited for two reasons firstly it stars Milla Jovovich who is exceptional in everything and also because the story looked extremely original and after viewing it doesn't disappoint. The story is very different to the usual thriller a serial killer is stalking women and Milla witnesses one of the murders the murderer chases her and throws her over a bridge where she hits her head which causes her to get face blindness which in turn prevents her from identifying the killer and also puts a severe strain on her personal and work life. The subsequent man hunt for the killer is a cracking thrill ride which will keep you on your toes for the entire duration.This movie boasts a knockout performance by Milla Jovovich she is so much more than an action star zombie killer she has a terrific range and is able to make any character believable she is just amazing in everything I see her in I do hope she continues to land complex roles like this one because she is so great and infinitely watchable.The story at times goes off track towards the end it starts to bring in a romance element which is unnecessary but it's only a minor annoyance the rest of the movie being great makes up for it. The supporting cast are also good Australia's own Julian McMahon does the tough cop act perfectly and Marianne Fairhfull does her cool voice thing very well. The use of different actors playing the same characters was definitely a smart move for this movie it adds a lot to the whole face blindness element the director could have been cheap and used cgi to augment people's faces but he doesn't and it's better that way.Face Blindness is a disease I have never heard of before I don't know If it's even a real disease but my god it sounds scary it would truly be a life ruining debilitation. So if you love Milla Jovovich love thrillers or just after something highly original check this out. Enjoy.".

Folks like my wife with developmental prosopagnosia had the condition their entire life from some unknown etiology and developed coping skills since birth. Those like me with acquired prosopagnosia lived a portion of our lives without the condition and obviously developed no coping skills in advance.Those that cite voice recognition as a flaw in the movie have zero knowledge of acquired prosopagnosia. Sure the voices are indeed quite familiar but they are coming out of unfamiliar faces. That presents confusion far beyond just not recognizing faces. In fact in my case it interfered with my ability to develop coping skills. It took me over 10 years to overcome this confusion brought on by voice recognition and develop real usable coping skills. I have now had this condition for over 40 years and my coping skills are still sorely lacking compared to my wife's as she developed them throughout her life and never experienced what I call being blinded by the face  letting face recognition when I was normal make living with prosopagnosia that much more difficult.I suggest that everyone who sees flaws in the movie see it again. This time with the knowledge that things such as familiar voice gait mannerisms clothing and situations only heighten the confusion when one first acquires this extremely rare condition. Perhaps it will make far more sense to those that gave negative reviews about something of which they are totally ignorant.".

She costars with the aforementioned Julian McMahon and of all people Marianne Faithful. I couldn't believe it. Not only did the main character have a problem with face blindness but I had it looking at Julian McMahon with a pot belly and a pitch black wig and at the older psychologist played by Marianne Faithful a once drugaddicted singer with long blond hair and a face like Roseanna Arquette.Whoa. Jovovich is Anna an elementary school teacher who witnesses a murder and is attacked by the killer. She falls into the water but is rescued. When she wakes up she has a case of faceblindness and can't recognize anyone. Everyone looks the same to her. This means that she cannot pick out the murderer in a lineup or in a book of suspects.This is a real if rare condition that apparently Brad Pitt has. I know someone who worked with him who said he is extremely friendly on the set but doesn't seem to know people off the set. I then read that he believes he has this disorder known as prosopagnosia and at the time of the article he was planning to be tested for it.Anna does not tell her livein boyfriend Bryce Michael Shanks that the disorder has continued. She sees a psychologist Faithfull who teaches her to keep a notebook and to learn to identify people by clothing mannerisms etc. Meanwhile the killer knows who she is and she is in danger of not recognizing him if he comes after her.I didn't mind this film and I find the subject of prosopagnosia fascinating. It didn't have huge production values and there was nothing really to make it stand out as a film. When Sam McMahon the detective involved in the investigation takes her to the small island town where he grew up the water looked incredibly fake.The acting was okay. Mila Jovovich is a striking young woman and she did a pretty good job. Yes this film could have been better many films can. But it was a good plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Your personal rating for this movie depends a lot of why and how you watch it. For the rather simple underlying story about a serial killer it isn't that good. But for how it depicts face blindness and how one might learn to overcome that handicap it is pretty good. I enjoyed it. Milla Jovovich is teacher Anna Marchant. As the story opens we see that she in fact has a very keen memory for both names and faces. But one evening after meeting her friend she is walking on a bridge closed for maintenance and she spots a crime in progress the serial killer is upon his latest victim. She sees him but trying to get away falls into the river hitting her head in the process. In a coma for several days she wakes up with face blindness the inability to distinguish subtelties that allow us to recognize a particular face from the thousands we have seen.Part of the ensuing movie involves police working with her to try to recall the face of the murderer since she is the only one alive to have ever seen him. The other part of the story is how she is able to recognize her boyfriend Bryce by using clues such as how he is dressed when he leaves in the morning what tie he has on etc.When the scene is from the perspective of the audience not suffering from face blindness we always see specific actors playing specific characters. But when the scene is through the eyes of Anna the face seems to change each time she sees it anew. In fact in the credits it showed 15 different actors playing her boyfriend Bryce. Other characters are played by up to 6 or 8 different actors.So as a crime story I found it just soso but as a novelty of how faceblindness might affect someone I found it very interesting and also from the moviemaking aspect.SPOILERS Eventually with the help of hypnosis Anna was able to partially recreate a vision of the face and it turned out to be a policeman helping the main investigator. She also was eventually able to return to teaching in a small community on a nearby island where there were very few students.".

But when the scene is through the eyes of Anna the face seems to change each time she sees it anew. In fact in the credits it showed 15 different actors playing her boyfriend Bryce. Other characters are played by up to 6 or 8 different actors.So as a crime story I found it just soso but as a novelty of how faceblindness might affect someone I found it very interesting and also from the moviemaking aspect.SPOILERS Eventually with the help of hypnosis Anna was able to partially recreate a vision of the face and it turned out to be a policeman helping the main investigator. She also was eventually able to return to teaching in a small community on a nearby island where there were very few students.";

While walking she sees a murder take place and is attacked by the TearJerked Jack serial killer. After falling off a bridge she wakes up as the lone survivor. She also wakes up with a disease called faceblindness a condition which affects you from recognizing any faces...even your own. Lately it seems like the lower budget movies are much better then the big blockbusters. This one is no exception. While this movie started to repeat itself to the point of being annoying it was still tense and keeps you interested and watching through out. Jovovich is becoming a very good actress and she continues to build upon what she did in Stone. A pretty original idea that if it weren't for the repetition of the problem would have been an excellent movie. That said even with the repeating this is still a very good movie that is very much worth seeing. Overall a surprisingly good and tense thriller that deserves more of an audience that it will get. I give it a B.Would I watch again?  I might just to see if I can catch the clues.".

	schema:reviewBody "We don't get to watch many thrillers lately so I was hopeful about this movie. It was actually satisfactory enough the changing faces of the supporting cast was fun and sufficient to emphasize with Milla's character. If this was a bigger budget movie it would be delightful to have some of these faces by more recognizable character actors depending on the situation and her disposition towards them. As it was the film was more like a procession of many extras note the collaboration of 45 studios. For some weird reason I expected and hoped she would at some point see Philip Seymour Hoffman as her husband Luiz Guzman as the cop Eric Roberts as Lanyon but of course that didn't happen  I agree with others that the love affair looked superficial and lacking chemistry but just think after watching the film how it would be elevated by a clever and ambitious casting of supporting actors.On the downside the suspense level was not really high and the film never came close to being chilling. It could have been a much more captivating thriller. Sometimes the story of the killer was almost a subplot and it was her prognosis that was at the forefront I guess Milla preferred it that way for having more opportunity to display her serious acting skills. My alternative would be to have more scenes with Lanyon and also more innovative stalking by the Lurker. That way the audience would engage better in making guesses about the killer's identity and could actually still be amazed by a clever twist at the end.Here is a diversion about the leading actor well the movie became rather dull enough times to give me an opportunity to amuse myself by reflecting on her career. I think Milla is cleverly changing gear she is very positively stuck in my mind with the Fifth Element that was when Bruce Willis was a dashing action star and I noted her acting in the Million Dollar Hotel as well as her portrayal of Jean Darc. When you come to think of it she has a remarkably diverse and rich filmography with leading roles in major films while she was very young. Overall however her last ten years went largely unnoticed by people who are not into resident evil so now she has the chance to make a reentry as a fresh face who happens to have a lot of acting experience. In the next few years she could aptly make her mark as the lead actress of noirs and thrillers a role played by Kim Basinger and Michelle Pheiffer in the last decade.To sum up an entertaining and somewhat original movie which unfortunately is not intellectually challenging. Watch it but with realistic expectations.".

She no longer could distinguish her own boyfriend's voice from a total stranger's? PuhLEEZ!Sure it'd freak me out to hear a familiar voice coming out of a stranger's mouth and for a long time too but it would make me zero IN on voices and THEN maybe clothes and mannerisms.

Her overstereotypicallydone friend calling Milla's character Chica throughout the movie made me want to eat my own ears to avoid hearing it even one more time!Sadly just overall a great idea that wasn't thought out before its creation. If you've already watched grass grow ice melt and paint dry and still need something to do? Watch this movie!";

So this movie was on the border line. However I took a shot this time because I like Milla and was interested in the concept of this movie. Now I am glad that I actually watched this movie.I was really curious about how this movie would depict prosopagnosia. I expected that many characters' faces would be just blank or something like that. Despite my thought this movie represents this disorder by using many actors for each character. Every time Anna Milla sees others faces they look different. Once faces are out of her sight they never look the same no matter how close the person is for Anna. It applied to even her own face. While washing her face her face changes each time she looks at a mirror. I was very impressed by the way this movie describes prosopagnosia. It delivers the idea of how scary and uneasy living like her is to the audience.Some reviewers write that the problem of this movie is that it is too obvious who the killer is from the very beginning but I don't think that's a problem because this movie doesn't attempt to keep it mysterious till the climax. The interesting part of this movie is Anna has no idea who the killer is although the audience knows who. The vulnerability which face blindness brings makes this movie thrilling. We can sense the killer is approaching Anna but the face doesn't look like the killer's because some scenes are shown through Anna's filter. So it seems like the killer is talking to Anna but we don't really know it by looking at the scenes. It can be anyone else maybe her boy friend or just a random guy.If your imagination is rich enough to put yourself in her shoes you will enjoy this movie. It may be like finding a specific person who tries to kill you during masquerade. It sounds nearly impossible doesn't it?7.510".

However it didn't help much. First of all using the camera as her point of view brings a lot of confusion to the watcher. Director probably has forgotten that movie insight of the main character and one of the watcher are two completely different things and cannot be the same. Main character in the movie is fictional and can tolerate fictional insight but we the watchers are real and we need real insight to follow the action. On the other hand movie has just several characters totally so it is pretty easy to guess who the killer is or should I say you can't miss. What I also found pretty irritating is pretty bad acting of Mila Jovovic. All in all don't bother if you ask me.".

Rather the black and white film and noirlike shadows help build the tension while not taking away from the story.

Remick is very effective as a plucky bank teller who's approached from behind and told to steal money from the bank where she works. The only thing she can tell the FBI is that it's a man who has heavy asthmatic breathing.Ross Martin plays the criminal.

Those of you who've seen Experiment should know what I mean.The score the angles the subdued dialogue all help to create one heck of a moody brooding piece of work.  I couldn't agree more with some of the other IMDB comments here...this is a great piece of film noir if not the last great piece of film noir for a particular generation!What I so admire about classic filmmaking from years past is how directors like Blake in this instance don't or couldn't resort to gratuitous blood and nudity to creat atmosphere.  Unlike Lynch who exploits graphic gore and nudity Blake thrills with mere thoughts of sexual deviency and violence.The opening scene to Experiment is one I shall not forget soon!  As our villain forces himself on Remick and proceeds to dirty her ears with the filth of what he could do to her is just simply incredible filmmaking. It reminded me of the scene from Lynch's Wild at Heart where Dafoe's character has Dern's character in his filthy clutches.  Except in Experiment I think it works even better...why?  Because there were no profane words or overthetop characterizations just simple text and superb acting that later matches a villain who seems quite normal as he strolls the streets of San Fran.  I really believed the characters in this film...Blake puts everyone in context.Congrats to Blake Edwards on his only serious movie...I wish you had done more!  And Mancini is as sly as ever on the score.  I could go on and on. Suffice it to say I really enjoyed this movie and am happy to have it as part of my DVD collection.  Although I'd love to see Criterion get a hold of this one...I'd love to learn more about the history of this film.".

	schema:headline " Before the concept of serial killer really caught on.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the film that really established character actor Ross Martin as a superb performer. Up to 1962 he had become a face on television shows such as a couple of episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. But he was possibly best known for appearances on PANTOMINE QUIZ which showed his own wit and talents  but very lightly. He had not been given a sizable acting part in a film and Blake Edwards cast him here as Red Lynch the asthmatic criminal mastermind who uses and abuses women across the country leaving their bodies as his calling card.In 1962 there had been several cases of spree killers in recent years such as Starkweather in Nebraska only five years earlier. But the last serial killers of note were probably the Lonely Hearts Killers Beck and Fernandez in the late 1940s. But to find one like Lynch who crisscrosses the country and leaves victims one would have to go back to the 1920s or so with figures like Charles Pazram Albert Fish and Earle Nelson. But except for Pazram who occasionally committed burglaries most of the serial killers concentrated on depraved sexual killings of one type or another. One would have to go back to H.H.Holmes to find one like the fictional Lynch forcing his victims to assist him in thefts or robberies. As for the concept of these special multiple killers as serial killers the title had not become popular with the public in 1962. It really was not until the 1980s with figures like De Salvo Corona Dahmer Gacy and Bundy that people started to discuss killers who moved about and killed over several states over a long period of time as in a special category.Lynch also has two other characteristics. One is that he is asthmatic. The idea of any villain having a physical condition that might gain him or her sympathy was a new one but Blake Edwards always has a habit of thinking ahead on his movie characters. Secondly Lynch turns out to be a hero to at least one little family. Despite his propensity to murderous rage and violence he actually cares for a young sickly boy and his mother. This too by the way is not unusual among serial killers. They can pick out somebody to be domestic with  a kind of oasis of quiet and apparent normality in their world of violence.From the start of the picture the villain is shown and not shown. We see Martin's lips moving in their threatening manner when he confronts Lee Remick in her suburban garage informing her how easy it is for him to get at her and her sister Stephanie Powers unless she agrees to help rob her business for Lynch'sMartin's sake. The scene is mostly in the dark  like evil snatching at Remick which it really is. Martin's features are only revealed later in the film as Glenn Ford slowly pulls the clues together. But he gets real mileage with the little we occasionally see  watch him on the phone accusing Remick of talking to a cop. He makes the word cop sound like a slang term for a venereal disease.Remick is a woman who is very reluctant to get police help especially as this unknown fiend has threatened her sister as well as herself. She goes to Ford the local FBI man and almost is lost to further openness about her danger but Ford is soon aware of a second woman who also was trying to contact him  one that he was too slow to respond to  whom he finds as a corpse. Soon he is openly seeking out Remick and gradually getting her to trust him and the Bureau to assist her and Powers.All of the leads are fine in this as well as Ned Glass in another one of his offbeat supporting roles. Here as Popcorn he is an informant who has to be treated like he is a detective if you would get information from him  and he is prickly about this.The suspense never lets up as Lynch Martin seems to keep one step ahead of the authorities up to the conclusion at a baseball game. It is an exciting climax for a good thriller. And afterward while Martin never had the full movie stardom his talents deserved he was more than just an interesting face. Artemus Gordon was around the corner and television fame beckoned.".

He informs her that he is aware of her every move and is not afraid to resort to violence if she does not go along with his scheme. The shaken young woman contacts FBI agent John Ripley Glenn Ford who does all that he can to protect the sisters and explore every angle he can to bring Lynch down. He soon discovers that this sadistic criminal has a penchant for women who can get him loot and then leaves their battered corpses for all their effort. Nancy Ashton Patricia Huston is one such lady who contacts Ripley for help but her fate is already sealed watch the eerie voyeuristic sequence in her mannequin filled apartment  shiver.It begins to drag a bit in the second hour with the introduction of a Chinese woman Lisa Anita Loo who is an unwitting file cabinet for Lynch  the evil killer is paying for her handicapped son's medical treatment. While this element may not have been needed Ford's interaction with the boy is utterly touching as is his concern for Kelly and her younger sibling.

With Kelly in the crossfire Ripley and his fellow agents close in on him in a memorable climax in Candlestick Park's baseball stadium.Unlike the gratuitous violence and nudity often found in films today Experiment In Terror relies on plot development effective camera angles and concentrated performance in order to bring out fear in the viewer and for the most part it does it in spades. Ford's courageous quiet embodiment Remick's strong yet gentle performance and Stefanie Power's moving sweet vulnerability give this taut movie all that it requires.

	schema:headline " Late Film Noir well done falls short of the top";
	schema:reviewBody "When I saw that this was directed by Blake Edwards and with music by Henri Mancini I was a bit worried but things turned out OK. Edwards works wholly within the established conventions of the film noir genre and he is very competently supported by camera and lighting work. There is no brilliant innovation but everyone definitely knows what they are doing. Mancini's music is completely appropriate and as good as one could ask for. Thus if you are studying film noir and how to produce such films this is a good representative technical example. In 1962 the elements however well executed must have been very familiar to its audience. However if you are coming to it without having seen many others it will grab you. In fact the opening scene will grab anyone. The various elements work very well and the viewer is pulled right in. However the strength of that opening scene is one of the reasons the film falls short of a top rating. Great suspense and sense of threat is created there but it cannot be sustained. Instead of building to a crescendo we are dropped solidly into the deep water but allowed to meander our way to the shallows until we emerged relatively relaxed at the end. The film does throw in twists and turns that keep you guessing at times but the level of tension ebbs away. The contrast with other films of this type that succeed in genuinely having you on pinsandneedles toward the end is strong. One of the reasons for that could be that we see Ford and his FBI colleagues so numerous and well mobilized on the case. Much of the film consists of their earnest investigations and support of the intended victims. We thereby get the sense that they will inevitably prevail. We also see Ross Martin's villain as multifaceted and not as allthreatening as he might be despite the very convincing start up. The acting as noted by others is good from top to bottom and in the case of Martin top notch. If we could only get that more often today!!".

Many stretches of film go on too long before the key point is made as for example with the woman who has an unusual occupation.There are several edge of the seat moments but this could have had even more impact if the pace were quickened rather than slowed down in spots toward the segment of the film that deals with the sister's kidnapping.

	schema:headline " Nononsense thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "There's nothing in the least splashy about this crime thriller. No car chases so squib charges no fireballs no big fat ugly guns and very little violence but it gets the job done in ways that make you nostalgic for the prejunk period.It's crisply photographed in wide screen black and white. Mancini's score leans heavily on cool low woodwinds and piano and is used sparingly. Decent use is made of San Francisco locations without that pastel tourist mecca being thrust in your face. I do wish though that some day a good movie would have a scene shot in my favorite pub The Edinburgh Castle on Geary. I've only seen another of my favorites in one movie Julius's in the Village before it went gay. A scene was shot there for Next Stop Greenwich Village I think. I wonder if my initials are still scratched on the men's room wall. It was a filthy saloon festooned with cobwebs and may not have been painted in the last quarter of a century. Where was I?Oh yes Experiment in Terror. Well the acting is like the rest of the movie solid professional craftsmanlike. Stylishly attractive Lee Remick a bank teller or cashier or something is coerced by asthmariddled Ross Martin into stealing lots of cash from the bank. Contrary to instructions she contacts FBI agent Glenn Ford. Ford and his colleagues go about coaching her in how to respond and what to do next. There are some unforeseen slipups along the way. The landlord of a murder victim's apartment is introduced as an early lesson in how to portray a gay guy on screen. Martin kidnaps Remick's younger sister Stephanie Powers and hauls her away to a deserted clothing storehouse where during a scene of intense expectation he makes her undress. The men in this early 60s audience may have been panting to see more of the teenage Powers but all they get to see is an unflattering bra and half slip that look like they were issued by the United States Army. Well I didn't say the movie was perfect. But seeing her undress reminded me that women are built differently from men entirely aside from reproduction. If a dress zips up the back a woman can reach over her shoulder to the zipper with one hand and up behind her back under her ribs with the other and unzip the dress using both hands. No human male is capable of such contortions not even those who wear dresses. Pardon my divagations but the voices tell me to do it.Maybe a bit too much time is spent at the ballgame in Candlestick Park. I was never a Dodger fan even when they were in Brooklyn. And one closeup of Don Drysdale's face goes a long way although he pitches one ball that makes me leap in my seat a little. Some spectacle is added to the shoot out but it still comes across as forced and a little dumb. Martin is alone in the middle of Candlestick Park surrounded by cops and covered from above by a police helicopter. He's been cool and under control all along. But what does he do now? He panics and begins shooting at the helicopter.Martin isn't a onedimensional villain though. He is having an affair with an attractive Chinese woman attends church with her and is fond of her son to the extent of paying for the kid's hip operation visiting him bringing him presents. It's this sign of humanity that trips him up at the end. A touch of humanity is also given to Ned Glass as an informant who sells criminal information to the highest bidder. He's all business. But after coming face to face with Remick and her threatened sister he decides not to sell his information to the papers but to hand it over to the police to use as they will. This costs him his life. And the cops look dispassionately down at his body and one of them remarks Well I guess you can't expect to live forever in his line of business. No good deed goes unpunished. You should see this if you have the time. If it's never gripping it's still never less than interesting. Fans of current action movies might not enjoy it much. It's in black and white and nobody's head gets wrenched out of its socket.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before watching Experiment in Terror like most people I associated Blake Edwards with films like The Pink Panther Breakfast at Tiffany's and S.O.B. And while those are all fine films they share a common thread in that they are all fairly light entertainment. That's not the case with Edwards' Experiment in Terror. In contrast to the other films I've mentioned Experiment in Terror is an entertaining thriller with some nice tense moments and at least one edge of your seat scene. The whole thing was a very unexpected surprise.The opening scene is amazing. A woman arrives home at night and parks in her garage. As she gets out of her car the garage door closes on its own remember this was before garage door openers. As frightened as the woman initially appears its nothing compared to what happens next. Out of the dark a pair of hands grabs her from behind. A threatening voice tells her that she is being watched and followed and if she doesn't do as instructed she and her sister will be killed. The voice tells her that she is to rob a bank. She's further instructed not to contact the police as that will mean a certain death.In addition to the moments such as I've described the movie has a noirish quality to it that I thoroughly enjoyed. Experiment in Terror for lack of a real description looks great. Filmed in black and white it's a throwback of sorts to the thrillers of the previous decade. Edwards' direction is spot on and he takes full advantage of most of the sets lighting and cast at his disposal. Technically the film is near flawless. All of the actors do a more than adequate job with their performances. Overall it's a quality little thriller that deserves a wider audience.However good or much I enjoyed Experiment in Terror it does have one glaring weakness. The film runs a little long and there are several scenes and subplots that could have been edited out altogether without hurting the plot. The best examples I can think of are the scenes dealing with the Asian woman and her sick son. While these scenes don't necessarily feel like padding the film would have been just as good and a little tighter without them.".

	schema:headline " EXPERIMENT IN TERROR Blake Edwards 1962 ";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an exceptionally tense crime drama that succeeds as well as it does because the film strives for realism and the overall writing is so good. Instead of the film being told in a Film Noir style which predominated in the prior two decades the film is a straight FBI drama that avoids the usual cop movie clichs and expected twists and turns. This is heightened by simple yet realistic performances by Lee Remick and Glenn Ford as well as a very convincing psychopathic performance by Ross Martin. Martin's evil wheezing criminal genius was highly reminiscent of the character he later played on The Wild Wild West as he used disguises very effectively and convincingly. The writing was generally good and Blake Edwards simple direction excellent as well. About the only negative and it's a very small one is when the younger sister played by Stephanie Powers so easily falls into the trap of Martin towards the endit really seemed a bit too easyespecially since she knew the psychopath was ready to strike. Regardless it's a dynamite and tense drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat.PSFor fans of old time baseball look closely for shots of Don Drysdale John Roseboro and others during the final scenes at Candlestick Park.".

	schema:headline " The Menace That Lurks In The Shadows";
	schema:reviewBody "The threatening atmosphere that quickly develops soon after the start of Experiment In Terror sets the tone for everything that follows in this disturbing story of a young woman who's attacked by a violent psychopath and forced to carry out a serious crime on his behalf. The woman's ordeal continues as she's used as the bait to catch her tormentor and her life remains in grave danger all the way through to the movie's spectacular climax. The uneasy mood of the piece is effectively enhanced by Henry Mancini's creepy score and some wonderful cinematography strongly reinforces an awareness of the everpresent menace that lurks in the shadows.One dark night Kelly Sherwood Lee Remick who works as a teller in a San Francisco bank returns to her home in the Twin Peaks area of the city and after having parked her car in her garage is grabbed from behind by a man who threatens to kill her and her teenage sister unless she agrees to steal 100000 from the bank where she works. The man who remains unseen throughout the attack is an asthmatic who tells Kelly details about herself and her sister which unnerve her and adds that he's already killed a couple of people in the past. He warns her not to contact the police because he'll be watching her to ensure that she obeys his orders.When Kelly gets the opportunity she contacts FBI agent John Ripley Glenn Ford who takes charge of the case and soon identifies the attacker as Garland Red Lynch Ross Martin who's a criminal with a long record of convictions for violent crimes. Ripley's very methodical investigation doesn't achieve much success initially as a couple of characters who could potentially provide useful information are killed and another refuses to cooperate because Lynch had previously been very kind to her son and paid for some expensive medical treatment that he needed.Lynch kidnaps Kelly's younger sister Toby Stefanie Powers just before he wants Kelly to go ahead with the robbery and Ripley arranges for Kelly to follow Lynch's orders so that she can be used to trap him. The way in which the events that follow play out prove to be extremely tense unpredictable and dangerous.Lee Remick in a brilliantly measured performance conveys the extreme fear and vulnerability that her character feels after being attacked terrorised and stalked by a ruthless maniac and the composure that she also displays in some frightening situations testifies to her courage and resilience. Glenn Ford shows Ripley's genuine concern sincerity and efficiency very convincingly and Ross Martin is terrific as the madman whose actions cause so much distress and fear.Experiment In Terror looks great and is well directed despite a few unnecessary lapses in the momentum of what happens on screen. Some dramatic camera angles emphasise the chaos into which Kelly's life descends after she's attacked in her garage and the extreme closeups ratchet up the tension that's such a powerful feature of this superb movie which ends in style with a very memorable and well staged finale.".

I found myself appreciating the film as a technical achievement rather than an entertaining slab of noir or detective drama. There are no points in the film we really think Lee Remick might be at risk she just walks her way through the film. Some slow scenes involving an Asian child and it's mother really add nothing to the film and take away from the already nonexistent tension. Filmnoir fans should see this for the moody lighting especially a bizarre scene in an apartment full of mannequins and brooding story otherwise I would not recommend this movie to the average moviegoer. And anyone interested in the scoring work of Henry Mancini should see this his title theme is a classic.".

I've heard several people comment on how this movie reminds them of David Lynch and in the first seen you can see Lee Remick driving past a sign that says twin peaks. This was directed by Blake Edwards and this was a change of pace for him with the exception of Days of wine and roses also with Lee Remick.

Although I enjoyed watching them do their very professional jobs of attempting to portray the rather unrealistic characters I did not enjoy the film at all. It is simply an inferior piece of work and a hackneyed story line. The film was directed by Blake Edwards and from time to time he or his cinematographer manage some atmospheric shots. There are lots of expressionistic shadows of Venetian blinds in the background of shots hardly an original idea and there is one shot near the end looking up from floor level at three men talking who loom over the camera in an effective manner which heightens the tension. But by and large this film is a waste of time. The psychopathic criminal who threatens Lee Remick is overdone the whole effect is corny we have seen it all before in films which have been much better scripted and better directed than this one. And frankly this genre is pretty boring in any case. The world is threatened by so many psychopaths on a daily basis that it is difficult to have too much sympathy for an arbitrarily chosen single woman and her harrowing ordeal when whole nations and peoples are going through much worse than that. This film is an overt attempt at exploitation of the horror of menace to try to appeal to an audience and make some money. It has no integrity as a project.".

Remick is lovely and strong as the woman being blackmailed into stealing money or die. Powers is okay. Ford using some restraint gives a nice even performance.
