The film was initially promoted as Pandora and the Flying Dutchman  but when it came to the Paramount they changed the name to The Loves of Pandora.

Were they experimenting with changing the name to get more patrons? I have not read anything about this anywhere on the internet.

Ava Gardner never more beautiful and just about to emerge as a star is the Pandora of the title a nightclub singer and femme fatale engaged to be married to a gentlemanly racing car driver Nigel Patrick but with a hotheaded bullfighter Mario Cabr eager to win her. Enter the Flying Dutchman Hendrick van der Zee trying to find a woman willing to give up her life for him so he can gain release from his eternal roving of the seas.  James Mason's performance as Hendrick is one of the main salvations of the movie. With his grace good looks and wonderfully expressive voice he is able to give credibility to situations and lines that would be fatal for other actors.  But the film's prime asset is its visual richness. At a straightforward level there is lovely Mediterranean scenery and some great action sequences notably the flamenco dancing  landspeed record and bullfight scenes. Then there are quite a few references to surreal art matching the surreal nature of the film such as Hendrick's Chiricolike painting of Pandora and a remarkable shot of her lying on her back with the profile of her face in closeup like a Dali painting. The film is set on the Costa Brava near Dali's home town of Cadaques. And throughout there is Jack Cardiff's creative camerawork in beautiful technicolor. These visual qualities outweigh such flaws as an intrusive voiceover and the stress laid on the  for me  irrelevant Moving Finger quatrain from the Rubaiyat.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like to see giddy romantic movies where those on screen lives beyond my wildest dreams or the wildest dreams of most people. A perfectly delicious and contentedly cruel Pandora Ava Gardner here lives the great life she has both the world land speed record holder and Spain's champion bullfighter after her both of whom she treats callously. She's a heartbreaker with more than one suicide under her belt no doubt. She lives in Esperanza in Southern Spain where near dusk there are soulstirring pinesilhouetted coastlines with turquoise beams from littoral whitesanded patches mesmerising. Though cruel she's not stupid she's definitely perceptive emotionally and intellectually perhaps she may be termed an ethical egoist or Randian. In any case a very interesting character.The central message of the film which is very potent is that The measure of love is what one is willing to give up for it. For The Flying Dutchman his Lazaruslike wandering of the globe can only be stopped by his falling in love with a woman who is prepared to die for him.The movie tries to portray itself as quite clever but at times falters with a classics professor who cannot pronounce Phoenician and quotations from the Ruba'iyat that are a little screwy in terms of context. Additionally the Dutchman's explanation of his painting which is a clear Di Chirico pastiche something of a directorial trait following the Gauguin pastiche in The Moon and the Sixpence sounds less than authoritative. Pandora's response to the Dutchman quoting the ending of Matthew Arnold's Dover Beach suggests that she hadn't fully grasped it and he only halfgrasped.On the other hand Marius Goring who is underused gets a good line from Webster's The Duchess of Malfi I know death hath ten thousand several doors  For men to take their exits and 'tis found  They go on such strange geometrical hinges  You may open them both ways It probably helps if you understand that the last line is a reference to suicide versus involuntary death which requires Dover Notes for me and perhaps most viewers! Statues recovered from the sea remind one of the beautiful Artemision Bronze hauled out of the Med during the era in which the movie is set. Archaeologist Geoffrey Fielding is a rather odd sort buried amongst books and inscriptions and bizarrely aloof from the tempestuous desires of the other characters though not out of ignorance.The occasional pseudoliteracy is perhaps at one with what is a Technicolor delirium a film that maintains its giddiness throughout. And yet although the film is quite the most outrageous love story Lewin does provide a brief counterpoint when John Laurie's mechanic quite wonderfully cocks a toast to Sheila's Sims' Janet when she epically denounces Pandora's way of life at a celebratory dinner.A feature of Technicolor films which is always nice to see is that the directors generally didn't take colour for granted. One trick to show off the Technicolor wares is to have grandiose flower arrangements in the movies here in Pandora's home. I think the greengold lining of her cloak is an unusual colour that really ravished the screen. Actually the film is rather erotic at one point although Fielding's description of the full moon as erotic at one point is quite titterworthy mainly due to delivery just after said cloak is jettisoned and Pandora swims out to the Dutchman's yacht naked as the day she was born.The scenes that will remain in my head the most are probably the shots of revelry coming after the Laurie toast. I think there's something quite Elysian about them transporting even. The movie manages despite many absurdities the Dutchman has a 17th century photograph to hold together well even with the central absurdity which is that the love that Pandora has for Hendrik van der Zee is basically groundless we're never even shown how it came about.".

James Mason is the Dutchman of the title who murdered his beloved wife hundreds of years ago when he thought she had been unfaithful she hadn't. He is doomed to sail the Seven Seas until he can find a woman willing to die for him. That woman appears as Pandora Reynolds played by a ravishing Ava Gardner. Pandora entrances every man she meets but something is missing in her life and her relationship with Mason's Hendrik brings her to learn the meaning of undying love and the sacrifices we might make. Occasionally the film lapses into pretension thinking it's a bit clever for itself. The voiceover jars a bit at times and some of the dialogue is very flowery and ohsomystical. But it's still a great film because it creates an atmosphere so unlike any other. I believe the print is in major need of restoration because I can't fathom how a Jack Cardiffphotographed film could look so poor in some places Mason's teeth etc. It's very romantic and I loved the flashback to when Mason killed his beautiful wife. It really shouldn't work because it's very dramatic and a bit too orchestrated but it does because Mason's acting is so terrific. I swear I love him more every time I see him.".

There's an immediate nod to A Matter Of Life And Death both in the central couple  one dead one living  and the use of Harold Warrender a 'scientific' type who complements perfectly Roger Livesey's 'doctor' and also serves as narrator.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a reworking of the legend of the Flying Dutchman. A wild and slightly crazy lady Ava Gardner is flighty and well rather nuts. When a sailboat nears her home in Spain she impulsively swam naked out to the boat and meets a man James Mason after she wraps herself up in a bit of canvas. He seems VERY preoccupied and moodyand is working on a painting that looks a bit like Gardner though I didn't think it looked nearly as close as the film said. She is clearly intrigued by this new man and wants to spend much time with him.A bit later Gardner's friend Nigel Patrick shows the moody dude something written in 17th century Dutchand Mason seems to be able to read it with ease. That's because it is in fact his own personal memoirs! It seems he's the famous Flying Dutchman and the paper explains how he came to be cursed to wander the seas alone for eternityunless and this is weird he can get a lady to agree to die for him.

	onyx:emotionText "This film is a reworking of the legend of the Flying Dutchman. A wild and slightly crazy lady Ava Gardner is flighty and well rather nuts. When a sailboat nears her home in Spain she impulsively swam naked out to the boat and meets a man James Mason after she wraps herself up in a bit of canvas. He seems VERY preoccupied and moodyand is working on a painting that looks a bit like Gardner though I didn't think it looked nearly as close as the film said. She is clearly intrigued by this new man and wants to spend much time with him.A bit later Gardner's friend Nigel Patrick shows the moody dude something written in 17th century Dutchand Mason seems to be able to read it with ease. That's because it is in fact his own personal memoirs! It seems he's the famous Flying Dutchman and the paper explains how he came to be cursed to wander the seas alone for eternityunless and this is weird he can get a lady to agree to die for him.

	schema:reviewBody "Funny thing about the legend of the Flying Dutchman is that nobody knows what it exactly is all about. Different stories about the history of the alleged ghost ship exist and different names of its captain also float around. Hendrik van der Zee as he is being called in this movie is one of them.This is a movie I just can't really put my finger on. I don't understand what this movie is trying to tell really. It's hard to label this movie as well. It's a romantic drama with fantasy elements in it as well. It doesn't have an everyday story and also some not so everyday characters in it. Guess the movie is about love and human nature but for me it wasn't very appealing all. The main characters are quite repulsive ones of which the female deliberately hurt other persons feelings to get what she want and the man killed the woman he loved out of sheer jealousy. Why should we care about a love story between these two. Of course the characters redeem themselves but no I just wasn't drawn into it.It's also a rather slowly paced movie. Some excitement wouldn't had harmed the movie. Not that it's dull but its slow pace just makes the movie drag on in parts. You have the feeling that the movie could had easily been halve an hour shorter. The movie does still takes some nice turns though making this movie all in all still a perfectly watchable one.The movie is also good looking. It's a period piece shot in color. It actually was the first motion color picture Ava Gardner appeared in. It still obviously wan't the most expensive movie to shoot judging by its visual qualities but it helps that movie that it was being shot at location rather than in soundstudio somewhere.Ava Gardner and James Mason are both obviously some capable actors but because I just wasn't drawn into the movie and it's story I also didn't really got into their characters. Can't blame the actors for that really since they are obviously doing the best they can with the material given to them.By all means its not a badly made and constructed movie I had just wished it's execution would had been a bit more lively and perhaps also some more fun. The movie is being mostly serious of tone making this movie more heavy than it really should be.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

You know what you're in for when the Rubaiyat turns up in a drowned man's hand.

This Indiana Pandora is unable to love...until she discovers that the sailor who is also a sort of Sunday painter he gets bored out there by himself has worked up a portrait of her sight unseen.I liked this movie in spite of myself but the truth is its success depends entirely on the casting not the writing. Like LAURA it depends on having a beautiful female lead. It needs one even more than usual because Gardner's idea of how to play an enigma is about as credible as the idea of a playgirl from Indianapolis. In France where they like beautiful things that don't make any sense Gardner's performance was celebrated. Like LAURA it also needs a moody haunted selfloathing yet attractive male lead who can play solo scenes and put over brooding emotions in closeup.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is set among a group of expatriates mostly British living in Esperanza a small fishing port in preCivil War Spain. The central character Pandora Reynolds is a beautiful young American woman who is very much the femme fatale of this group. Fatale in the quite literal meaning of that word because a young man commits suicide out of unrequited love for her near the beginning of the film. The coldhearted Pandora however is left quite unmoved by this incident.Pandora is the fiance of Stephen a young British racingdriver whom she also treats cruelly. In one scene she persuades him to push his beloved racingcar over a cliff in order to prove his love for her. She has another admirer in the form of Juan an arrogant swaggering bullfighter but she herself seems to be fascinated by Hendrik van der Zee a mysterious Dutchman who arrives in the town on board a large and luxurious yacht which seems to have no crew. Van der Zee is in fact the legendary Flying Dutchman. In this version of the legend he is condemned to wander the seas for ever for the crime of murdering his wife a crime provoked by groundless jealousy. He is an Othello figure who unlike Shakespeare's character cannot escape his burden of remorse through suicide. He is however permitted to come ashore for six months every seven years and will be freed from his curse if during those months he can find a woman who is prepared to give her life for him.I was surprised that several reviewers both on this board and elsewhere have commented on the film's lush colour there is evidently more than one print in existence because in the version that I saw on British television the colour was very poor the night scenes almost looked as though they had been shot in monochrome. The quality of the acting is rather mixed. The best contribution is from James Mason as the brooding tormented Hendrik. Mason's acting often had a resigned worldweary air about it and this quality serves him well here as he makes Hendrik seem a tragic figure whom the audience can pity despite his crime. I also liked Harold Warrender an actor I had not come across previously as the rational scholarly Gerald the older man who acts as the narrator of the tale. The other characters were less satisfactory. Juan the hotblooded violently passionate Spaniard is too much of a stereotype to be wholly convincing and Stephen is a rather weak figure. As for Pandora she never really comes to life. Although Ava Gardner with her striking beauty was physically right for the part I wondered whether she had enough depth as an actress to portray the character successfully. Perhaps I am being unfair to her and the real fault lies with the script it may be that no actress could have succeeded in making Pandora convincing. The contrast between the heartless Pandora of the earlier part of the film and the noble selfsacrificing heroine of the later scenes is too great to enable us to perceive her as a rounded character.This is one of the more ambitious British films of the fifties an attempt with the aid of an exotic foreign location and a glamorous Hollywood star to duplicate the success of American supernatural fantasies such as Portrait of Jennie and It's a Wonderful Life. In my opinion however it does not succeed nearly as well as either of those films both of which despite their fantastic plots are deeply satisfying on an emotional level. There is something much less satisfactory about Pandora and the Flying Dutchman. It is essentially a rather cold and shallow film with a cold and shallow young woman at its centre. Even her final sacrificial gesture a gesture which it should be noted involves yet another betrayal of the hapless Stephen cannot make us either believe in her or sympathise with her. 510".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is set among a group of expatriates mostly British living in Esperanza a small fishing port in preCivil War Spain. The central character Pandora Reynolds is a beautiful young American woman who is very much the femme fatale of this group. Fatale in the quite literal meaning of that word because a young man commits suicide out of unrequited love for her near the beginning of the film. The coldhearted Pandora however is left quite unmoved by this incident.Pandora is the fiance of Stephen a young British racingdriver whom she also treats cruelly. In one scene she persuades him to push his beloved racingcar over a cliff in order to prove his love for her. She has another admirer in the form of Juan an arrogant swaggering bullfighter but she herself seems to be fascinated by Hendrik van der Zee a mysterious Dutchman who arrives in the town on board a large and luxurious yacht which seems to have no crew.

The only potential handicap to it was the Germanlanguage sections had only Taiwanese subtitles but I think I got the gist of those scenes which are few.This thriller is a tale of deception involving David Fish played by writerdirector Dani Levy a busy young Jewish man whose mother escaped Germany but who always thought the rest of her family didn't survive the Holocaust.  When she goes to meet someone from Germany who may know about her father she winds up dead in a hospital having been found unconscious with a head wound in a hotel hallway by Lena Katz played by cowriter Maria Schrader a young German woman visiting New York to cover a fashion shoot.David and Lena start getting involved and David soon learns that Lena's family and his have secret connections neither knew about before.  Also pushing things forward are the investigative efforts of the activist lawyer Charles Kaminski played by David Strathairn who is the best thing in the movie who knows more than he lets on and pushes David to find out the true identity of Lena's grandfather and mother.The plot is very complex but not difficult to follow.  What makes this film merely competent as a whole are much hackneyed dialogue between David and Lena and belowpar acting on the part of the two leads.  Levy is particularly wooden and unsympathetic as David failing to make us feel David's mixed emotions as he manipulates Lena to find out more about her family.Fortunately Strathairn is in the film enough to compensate and his fiery electric performance is refreshingly different from the more frequent lowkey characters he tends to play on film.The pacing in Meschugge is fast and the film is never dull though there is the occasional cinematic cliche the 360 degree whirling camera around a character trick should be permanently retired IMO. The remaining cast is good though the talented Jeffrey Wright of Angels in America is wasted in an irrelevant role as a photographerlove interest of Lena's who is tossed away quickly. Based on this film Levy has more talent as a director than as a writer or actor.".

	schema:headline " Got Much More Than I Bargained For";
	schema:reviewBody "To someone picking up this little flick without bothering to go into it a bit more you are probably expecting some Disneylike movie Just look at the box cover and the premise even suggest it A man is reincarnated as a dog and goes on a search to find his family. Boy was I surprised. Not only is the dog trying to find his family he's out for revenge against the man who put him in the situation in the first place. Full of mature themes and gripping moments this is one of those rare movies that will definitely make you think and as stated by everyone else here shed a few tears.We follow Fluke from puppyhood to adulthood as he starts trying desperately to find out who he once was. After putting 2 and 2 together Fluke does indeed set out on a journey to find his wife and son much to the dismay of his illfated friend Rumbo a dog who was also human. When Fluke finds them he's living the good life that is until his crooked business partner comes in and crashes the party. Fluke is determined to make sure he won't do any harm to his family as he did to him. But is Fluke going by truth or what he wants to believe?... The main thing about this movie that hit me at first was the music. The beautiful orchestra soundtrack accompanied this film perfectly. There were a few times I watched the credits simply to hear the music. And of course what's good music without good filmography to go with it? This movie has that too. Some of the most bright natural filming can be seen with the dog as he braves mountains and rivers on his long journey or during the more peaceful moments as he plays with his family out in the sunshine. All in all the filming and soundtrack itself is definitely a step up from a few of the more wellknown animal movies like Homeward Bound for instance.The story itself is very unpredictable another thing I was not expecting from a movie such as this. Fluke's acts and visions will keep you watching to find out the real story behind his past. But while he's fending away his partner he's trying to convince his family that he's more than just some old dog. Many of these scenes had me stop the movie just to pull myself together such as when he did his fatherly duties of tucking his son in and laying on his side of the bed during the night. Acting in the movie ranges from good to alright. It's not the best acting in the world but the humans weren't the ones I paid attention to and even then the dogs still had the best lines and voicing despite the fact that they talked only for a short while. The little boy had to be the most irritating of all though especially in scenes when he was distressed in any way. I also feel the lab scene could have been executed a bit better. That scene seemed to pass by too quickly or just put in the middle of the movie with no purpose but it did help explain a major event so I can't complain.In conclusion Fluke is a timeless gem and a very impressive attempt at a family drama from such an unknown director. The filmography score and plot itself made this movie one of best animaloriented movies of the last century. Only the acting from the humans and a few of the sometimes outofplace scenes hurt the movie just a tad but not enough to stop me from giving this underrated movie the recommendation it truly deserves.".

Oh No 'Fluke' is different its a lot more special than that. I cannot say that there aren't mistakes but still when you watch you can feel the magic of the movie and you don't really notice anything wrong with it. Anyway this is a very weepy film it is bound to make you cry if you are either a sensitive adult or a child. This film made me cry about three times but then again I am a very soppy person when is comes to weepy movies of any kind.   If your wandering if its worthy of your viewing then I'll tell you now it is completely and utterly worthy of anyone's viewing. If you see it in a video store and you haven't rented it out before then rent it out watch it it's a brilliant film. The animal actors are superb and I just loved this film real tearjerker. Well I'm going to stop repeating myself and let you decide on your opinion on it. See it's a top movie! Oh and one more thing the message in this film is quite a common message that is portrayed in a lot of films but the way this film does it is very unique and powerful.

	schema:reviewBody "Fluke is directed by Carlo Carlei who also coadapts the screenplay with James Carrington from the novel written by James Herbert. It stars Matthew Modine Eric Stoltz Nancy Travis Ron Perlman Bill Cobbs Jon Polito and Samuel L. Jackson. Music is scored by Carlo Siliotto and cinematography by Raffaele Mertes.Workaholic Thomas Johnson is killed in an auto accident and is reincarnated as a dog. As he grows from pup to adult dog he starts to remembering things from his human life and sets about piecing together exactly who he was and what happened to him.It was a box office flop a hard sell anyway with its cross genre themes but MGM didn't know how to market it. Was it an animal adventure for the kids? A family drama message movie? Or a metaphysical bit of dalliance? Truth is is that it is all three an engagingly thoughtful movie that is flavoured by fantastical whimsy whilst also beating a poetic heart. There's humour in here too especially when Fluke teams up with the wise and shaggy Rumbo Jackson. But predominantly picture is about emotional beats sitting in that void between genuine warmth and tragedy. It's unashamedly sentimental but that's a good thing and it's not just confined to the animal aspects of the story this is still a very real human drama. The messages within are handled with care there's no beating us over the head here.Director Carlei disappeared from Hollywood after the failure of Fluke which is a shame since he crafts a great picture of strength. His dog POV camera work is smart in bringing us into Fluke's world and many shots are gorgeously framed and filmed by director and photographer alike. It's also admirable in how he handles the excellent canine actors Comet as Fluke is mightily impressive and expressive it's no disgrace to the human actors to say the canines own the movie. There's some implausibilities obviously and one or two moments are too surreal for their own good a laboratory break out sequence is cheer worthy but Carlei overdoes it but this is still a lovely and interesting movie. Just like the great John Herbert's novel is for adults so is the film. You can watch it with the kids for sure so long as you have the fortitude to discuss with them the film's inner workings. 810".

As he grows from pup to adult dog he starts to remembering things from his human life and sets about piecing together exactly who he was and what happened to him.It was a box office flop a hard sell anyway with its cross genre themes but MGM didn't know how to market it. Was it an animal adventure for the kids? A family drama message movie? Or a metaphysical bit of dalliance? Truth is is that it is all three an engagingly thoughtful movie that is flavoured by fantastical whimsy whilst also beating a poetic heart. There's humour in here too especially when Fluke teams up with the wise and shaggy Rumbo Jackson. But predominantly picture is about emotional beats sitting in that void between genuine warmth and tragedy. It's unashamedly sentimental but that's a good thing and it's not just confined to the animal aspects of the story this is still a very real human drama. The messages within are handled with care there's no beating us over the head here.Director Carlei disappeared from Hollywood after the failure of Fluke which is a shame since he crafts a great picture of strength. His dog POV camera work is smart in bringing us into Fluke's world and many shots are gorgeously framed and filmed by director and photographer alike. It's also admirable in how he handles the excellent canine actors Comet as Fluke is mightily impressive and expressive it's no disgrace to the human actors to say the canines own the movie. There's some implausibilities obviously and one or two moments are too surreal for their own good a laboratory break out sequence is cheer worthy but Carlei overdoes it but this is still a lovely and interesting movie. Just like the great John Herbert's novel is for adults so is the film. You can watch it with the kids for sure so long as you have the fortitude to discuss with them the film's inner workings. 810";

The film was amusing and pleasant to watch. Fluke goes a few steps further than this and is really excellent on all counts. This time it is a human who comes back as a dog and the story is slightly different. It is rare for a film to accumulate so many good points on so many aspects......... beautiful score magnificent picture quality and sets plently of humour and excellent plot from beginning to end with not a dull moment a surprise ending and above all a HUGE dose of emotion. I must confess to having watery eyes throughout most of the film and the scene close to the end where Fluke is on the tombstone scratching away with his paw at the snow to uncover the writing on the tombstone was just too much. Although there is humour to offset the sad side of the film it is nevertheless very disturbing especially to those people who may have a tendency to believe in reincarnation. It is in no way a simple kiddies animal film along the lines of Beethoven or Babe it is really much deeper than that. I'm just surprised that I never heard of the film when it actually came out in the cinema and have waited till the year 2004 to discover it. It's true as well when a dog looks at you questioningly with hisher head slightly tilted to one side one does wonder what on earth is going through their mind ?

Despite some familiar kidmovie trappings actually when you first hear the two dogs talking to each other you may be disappointed that yet another movie has used that gimmick but at least the other dog is voiced by Samuel Jackson this film isn't very accessible to kids it's very unusual rather grim and pretty much of a downer. Older viewers though should appreciate the consistently interesting story the excellent cinematography and the remarkable performances by the dogs their trainers really did a great job. ".

With some clues Fluke the dog will be accepted as the reincarnation of the dear daddy.I've lost my father at the age of 3. Sometimes is very hard think of it but I've got a special feeling with my cat. She's with me since 11 years now I'm 26 I can see in her eyes a true spirit like an angel standing by.With the help of this movie I've raised the conviction that animals should be guiding souls of exhaled dears for us.Yes I still believe though my old age in such romantic things.

	schema:headline " Fluke  not your typical doggie flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on James Herbert's novel of the same name Fluke is a unique touching fable of life love and loss told through the eyes of a beautiful dog who isn't all that he seems.Thomas Johnson Modine a workaholic estranged from his family and best friend is killed in a tragic car crash. Sometime later he is reincarnated as a puppy named Fluke. As he grows up Fluke starts having flashbacks of his past life and believing his family is in danger from the man he holds responsible for his death sets out to find them.Fluke isn't your typical doggie movie this isn't Old Yeller or Homeward Bound. This is a touching story about mortality and how love goes on after death. It raises important questions for both children and adults  is everything as it seems? What happens when and our loved ones die? Are they happy what's in store?Yes the film is at times cheesy but it isn't wholly distracting and is forgivable. The training is amazing and the voice acting Modine as FlukeJohnson and Jackson as his friend Rumbo gives a depth and personality to the canine characters. There is beauty in Fluke's love for his wife and son in the subtle relationship he shares upon his return in dog form. The music is wonderful. There is much depth to this film that one would not know upon picking up the box.I first saw Fluke at around ten years old I was obsessed with dogs and my mom told me that there was a film about a dog finding his family on TV one night. I fell in love with this movie instantly and it's still a firm favourite to this day. It is nowhere near perfect but it's fascinating and beautiful  this is quite possibly one of the most important overlooked films of all time. This isn't just a kiddie dog film this is a film about something deeper. Give this underrated gem a chance it may touch you in ways other stories can't. This is a film for everyone  not just children.p.s. Parental Guidance advised  the themes are serious and dealt with extremely well. but there's no dumbing down. Please watch WITH your children.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Fluke' is more than just a dog movie it belongs to the list of classic dog movies such as 'Old Yeller' 'Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey' and 'Napoleon'. Even though it can conflict with the spiritual beliefs of some it is by no means stupid. On the contrary it is very moving blue heartwarming and tragic. A heavily misunderstood and underrated great little film that has aged with dignity and flopped because it's not for everyone. There are many powerful scenes and there is something magical about it. Other than the story journey and gorgeous landscapes the wonderful soundtrack accents this magic and emotional feeling. This soundtrack is just so beautiful! The soundtrack combined with the powerful scenes... worth to have a Kleenex nearby.The journey of Fluke the dog is so emotional and he is such a sweetheart that we almost don't even think that he was once a human being and how he was like then.By no means it is a perfect movie. It has some flaws at least to me but the global result is very good. The actors are generally good Max Pomeranc as the sweet boy Brian Matthew Modine as Tom Johnson and as the voice of Fluke Nancy Travis as Carol Eric Stoltz as Jeff Newman Collin Wilcox Paxton as Bella and of course the dogs Comet as Fluke Barney as Rumbo and all the other animals. I don't like Samuel L. Jackson but he does a good job as Rumbo's voice.It's a shame that Max Pomeranc didn't feel like doing more movies after this. He had charisma and he could act for real. But it was his decision and I understand and respect that. I have to.I am surprised that there are two versions of this. I didn't know. I always knew the original version from 1995 so it's a surprise for me to find out that there is also a 1996 version in which some scenes were removed and the scene of Jeff's car accident was slightly modified. Changes are minor and it's the same movie anyway but I prefer the 1995 version for me the true version. Title in Portugal 'Fluke'.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dirchs wilde Kurdistan or Wild Kurdistan is a West German  Spanish coproduction from 1965 so this film already had its 50th anniversary last year. German audiences in the 1960s were truly crazy for these Karl May film adaptations and writer and director Franz Josef Gottlieb gave them exactly what they wanted. He is known for having a good touch with what the masses want to see as he also worked on many Edgar Wallace films and some of the German semiknown softcore porn movies. But back to this one here. At some point people realized Lex Barker was too big of a star to play second fiddle to Pierre Brice in the Winnetou movies so he got his own Kara Ben Nemsi franchise. This film here follows Der Schuch. Unfortunately the film has not aged very well by today's standards. The story is predictable and the film lacks shades completely in terms of who's good or who's evil. It's either one or the other. And Barker's character is presented as the ultimate man. Every woman desires him the bad guys fear him his friends admire him. He is basically God in a human's body and it gets annoying pretty quickly. Barker is not the worst actor it is mostly about the way the character was written. Other than him this 100minute movie includes a handful of actors that are known from other Karl May adaptations. But it is all too generic and stereotypical and the way the story was written with the main antagonist and everything cannot make up for that. I don't recommend the watch.".

	schema:headline " Excellent bodiceripping historical romance by Brad";
	schema:reviewBody "I loved Brad Armstrong's Eternity far more than a Stormy Daniels vehicle but a tribute to romantic novels and their eroticism even in a XXX context. As usual I diverge from the industry consensus as male lead Randy Spears' onenote villain earned him awards but for me heavily detracted from the film's overall effectiveness.That's because unlike porn critics and organizations like AVN I bring a film buffhistorian's POV to the table when watching Adult Cinema. Armstrong is not cranking out mindless junk but rather attempting with some success to create explicit sexual movies that play just like mainstream films.So as this story of a romantic heroine from the 1800s plays out I am reminded of the classic British movies of the 1940s from Gainsborough Pictures fabulous period pictures with memorable heroines and dashing villains and a romantic sensibility never approximated by any other movie company before or since. Their best work in this vein iis typified in The Wicked Lady and The Man in Grey both with James Mason and surviving as classics though the Studio is also associated with many mainstream winners including Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.But instead of a multidimensional fascinating villain Randy Spears plays dastardly Sir Adam Dalton on onenote an irritable and irritating tyrant who marries Stormy's character Silvia after first arriving to seize her home and lands as a ruthless creditor. Stormy has a dual role also playing namesake Silvia's greatgreat granddaughter on her wedding day 200 years later in the 21st Century. Film unfolds narrated by the great Veronica Hart as the latterday mom presenting Stormy with the family locket and relating the tragic but inspiring tale of her ancestor a legend that will live on for eternity.Armstrong's wellwritten script hits all the cliches and hearttugging elements of romantic fiction and creates tremendous identification with Stormy perfect for a star vehicle for his Wicked Pictures. Cast as her loyal hand maiden is fellow Wicked contract star jessica drake her usual lower case billing and a bevy of beauties is skilfully woven into the 212 hour picture for sexual stimulation of the target audience.Brad's skill at piloting such a project is evidenced throughout other than his blinders as to the central Spears performance which Brad in the Making of featurette on the 2nd DVD in the deluxe release package is aimed at winning industry awards almost as if a fix was in hint hint. Shot in 35mm it features lavish locations beautiful costuming and wigs for the ladies romantic photography by house d.p. Francois Clousot and wellexecuted mainstream elements as in swordfighting a duel with pistols and a wonderful trained horse for Stormy to ride. Hart's NonSex participation adds immeasurably to the class of the picture.An interesting sidelight is related by Brad in that he spent many years planning this project first conceived as a Stephanie Swift vehicle set in Spain and later fashioned for another Wicked superstar before Stormy ever entered the Adult biz. Winters proved to be a fine choice utterly lovely and sexy as always and good enough to overcome the handicap of battling such a cardboard male lead.".

I found the journey of the young men and their evolution through extreme turmoil delivered in a raw manner that one does not get through main stream media. The raw look at life and oppression that continues from the old Saddam regime into the new present day Iraq is shocking. The movie is shown through several time periods in the bands life and how playing music is the only thing that keeps them going. The band members that are interviewed are well spoken articulate and emotional. That emotion keeps coming back in the film and every happiness in their lives is tempered by the Iraq war to such a degree that the true impact of what's happening over there is just now becoming clearer. For me the true role and impact of the mass market mainstream media has been exposed and for that reason alone I would suggest watching Heavy Metal in Baghdad. I also look forward to any subsequent sequels or Vice production regarding the lives of the band members but especially Tony and his pupil Mike.Thank you Eddy and Suroosh.".

The members of Acrassicauda just wanna rock too. The problem is that unlike most young bands Acrassicauda Latin for Black Scorpion happens to be the first and so far only heavy metal band from Iraq a country which is obviously not known for its rock and roll scene. That's the set up for Heavy Metal In Baghdad a fascinating documentary that puts a human face on the misery currently facing the population of that war ravaged country. The members of Acrassicauda thought they had it bad before the American invasion. They couldn't wear their hair long for fear of persecution their songs had to be proSaddam Hussein and their music is accused of promoting Satanism. Just getting the band together in one place to play a concert was a massive undertaking. Unbelievably the situation got even worse once the American liberators took over. When a pair of Canadian journalists who serve as our narrators arrive in Baghdad in 2006 the country is more or less the Wild West. They travel with an ATeam of bodyguards wherever they go and wear flak jackets at all times. It's not safe to be on the streets for more than a few minutes for fear of being kidnapped shot by a sniper or hit by a stray rocket. I found these ontheground segments particularly fascinating as the team captures the desperate daytoday life in Baghdad that you don't see much of on your sanitized nightly TV news.When the film crew finally reconnects with Acrassicauda the band hasn't played a concert in a year and in fact all of the members haven't even been in the same room together for nearly six months. Acrassicauda seem to be likable guys they're just your average joes in Metallica and Slipknot shirts prone to throwing the metal devil horns as much as possible and speaking surprisingly good English peppered with the expected Fbombs this is a heavy metal band after all bemoaning the fact that they can't just get together whenever they want to kick some ass like any other band around the world.Eventually the scene shifts to Damascus Syria where the band members have emigrated to escape the war in their homeland. They may be out of the war zone but they're still miserable. Packed like sardines in tiny apartments scraping by with deadend menial jobs and missing their families one band member even admits that he misses the sounds of bombings and machine gun fire. The film's narrators arrange for the band to lay down some tracks for an EP in a primitive recording studio in Damascus finally fulfilling their dream to have their tunes preserved on tape. When the band is playing their music we finally see how much joy it brings to their lives. From there Acrassicauda puts on their first concert outside of Iraq in the basement of a pool hall saying that if it's not well attended the band will break up. Happily the small crowd of rockers eats up the band's music inspiring them to continue onward.From the description you might say this sounds like Anvil! The Story of Anvil against a war backdrop but it's way more than that. Even as the film ends the band members are depressed and angry about their situation and the band's future remains in doubt. A crawl at the end of the film says that Acrassicauda were in danger of being deported from Syria and sent back to Iraq as their Visas had expired. I understand that since this film was released they have all emigrated to the U.S. and have picked up their musical dreams where they left off. I haven't heard the four song EP they recently released but I'm definitely interested in doing so. Heavy Metal In Baghdad is absorbing fascinating and depressing all at the same time. I can not imagine going through the sort of things that Acrassicauda have experienced on a near daily basis so they have my respect not only as musicians but as people. The next time I read an interview with some spoiled rock star complaining about how tough his life is I hope someone tells him to shut up and watch this movie.".

But that doesn't always mean that previous efforts were always the best ones.  That's where this little gem comes in.Dying To Live a 1999 MadeforTVCable film is about a aspiring marine biologist named Rachel Linden Hayley DuMond who has the world on a stringa great boyfriend in high school swim team star Matthew Jannett Gabriel Mann and a good friend in cute and sassy Leslie Chambers Linda Cardellini who has a heart arythmia and says that she could die at any time.  Enter Vanessa Cannington Shannon Elizabeth Matthew's jealous exgirlfriend who wants Matt back and will stop at nothing.  She spikes his punch with a strong tranquilizer at a school dance and he takes Rachel outside to the pool.  He begins to get disoriented and plunges off the diving board. Rachel in a valiant attempt to save him stumbles on a ladder and bangs her head on it.  She falls into the pool and drowns.  Matt is so disoriented that he cannot speak let alone save Rachel.  He is hospitalized but later arrested for killing his girlfriend.  Rachel then steps out of her dead body at the funeral and wonders why everyone is crying not realizing she is dead.  A mysterious man named Will Jonathan Frakes who is a gaurdian angel informs Rachel that she must expose her killer to the world so she can go to her eternal life.  Rachel wants to live but must rely on a mutual soul one that both she and Matthew could trust to expose the truth.  Along comes unsuspecting Leslie.  Rachel must use Leslie's body to expose the truth even though it means risking Leslie's fragile condition.  Can Rachel accomplish her task?This movie was truly upsetting but I really enjoyed it.  It didn't try too hard to be overburdeningit didn't need to.  It moved at an even pace and the story was wellwritten.  I only saw this the other night on the SciFi Channel. The only real problem I had with this movie was how long it took for Rachel to begin trying to expose her killer. It took some stretch of time for any action to begin.  But maybe that was a good thingthe action was forthcoming and excellent. I like how Rachel would temporarily occupy Leslie's body to get her point across.  Linda Cardellini had so much expression on her face and she is quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses and role models.  Hayley DuMond put on an excellent performance and I could certainly relate to her character.  If something happened to me that cut me off too soon I would want to expose the truth behind it. Gabriel Mann who I only just found out was Freddie Prinze Jr.'s friend Auggie in Summer Catch was also excellent as Matthew Jannet who just wanted to prove to the world that he would never have killed Rachel.  It was another soso performance for Shannon Elizabeth who aggravated me very much but that was probably the pointyou wanted to hate her.  Jonathan Frakes was decent as Will and who he really is will shock you at the end.Ok favorite scenes The scene where Rachel first occpies Leslie and when Leslie looks in the mirror she sees Rachel and backs up.  I think Cardellini has great expression as I've mentioned earlier.  I also enjoyed the scene where the teens were having a good time in the pool earlier in the film the scenes that Rachel tries to get Vanessa exposed and the pivotal scene where Leslie as Rachel finds the evidence in the bleachers.  I won't give away much about this or the end because that is my absolute favorite part and I couldn't spoil it for anyone.  That's not my reviewing style.Anyways long story short this is a welldone wellacted nice telepic. Just some light fare nothing bad and certainly harmless enough.  The stars are great and I will definitely enjoy the copy I made of this movie the other night.  If you get the chance PLEASE see this film.  You will enjoy it and certainly not regret it!".

Special mention must be for the three main females who play each of their parts well. The script throughout is never too slushy or biblical.

	schema:reviewBody "Dying to Live was really a good movie! Considering most TV fare this film came through for me unlike most teen films made for the small screen. Acting was generally good but not much depth was required of the actors. Little was asked of Jonathan Frakes who was not much more than a narrator. Gabriel Mann was very good as Matthew but I think he fell short when true depth and emotion was needed. Linda Cardellini was convincing as the cute Leslie as was Shannon Elizabeth as the pathetic Vanessa but it was Hayley DuMond who really put effort and heart into her roll. DuMond really shone. She was adorable as Rachel. She brought emotion and depth to the part and credibility to the story.

	onyx:emotionText "Dying to Live was really a good movie! Considering most TV fare this film came through for me unlike most teen films made for the small screen. Acting was generally good but not much depth was required of the actors. Little was asked of Jonathan Frakes who was not much more than a narrator. Gabriel Mann was very good as Matthew but I think he fell short when true depth and emotion was needed. Linda Cardellini was convincing as the cute Leslie as was Shannon Elizabeth as the pathetic Vanessa but it was Hayley DuMond who really put effort and heart into her roll. DuMond really shone. She was adorable as Rachel. She brought emotion and depth to the part and credibility to the story.

All in all this flick is just 90 minutes of harmless fun with some decent acting a few funny one liners from Jonathan Frakes and enough plot jogs not quite twists to keep you watching. Hayley Dumond gives an excellent performance as a HS girl who's life is cut short by the scheming nasty Shannon Elizabeth. Jonathan Frakes who plays an angel on a mission arrives back on Earth to help her make the transition from her mortal life to her eternal life in the 'hereafter' but first he's got some work to do. Through his Frakes help the real killer is finally caught and his work here on Earth is done. And if you've ever seen a movie or read a book that involves an angel returning to the 'mortal world' you can kind of figure out what's going to happen once all the clues fall in to place. Even if you figure it out ahead of time it's still an OK movie. Now back to Linda Cardellini. In this flick she plays the cute tough friend that she's played in a number of movies and TV shows already. If you've never seen her or experienced her work I'd advise getting a copy of the TV show 'Freaks and Geeks'  this woman is phenominal! Talented and heartstoppingly beautiful Ms. Cardellini can convey more emotion with her facial expression than most actors can get from five pages of dialog. She is truly amazing. Keep your eye on her 'Scooby Doo' not withstanding she is a tremendous talent. All in all 'Dying to Live' is an interesting little made for TV movie made all the more watchable because of two female leads that you'll be seeing a lot more of in the future.

Now this movie is slaughtered by Italian critics and fan because of his infidelity against the comics in the movie there is no Groucho DYD assistant no inspector Bloch no London and that is enough to cause the terrible reaction of all Italian fans. Obviously the greatest part of DYD fans decided to suppress this movie months before it's coming in cinemas. I've seen Dylan Dog Dead of Night and I must say that it's a very funny movie with a good balance of horrorcomedyaction parts. Brandon Routh is able to play the part of Nightmare's Investigator and his character is more faithful than what is said. For reasons of money it was impossible to set the movie in London but the setting of New Orleans is the best alternative option that director Kevin Munroe could do. For the same reason there isn't Groucho DYD assistant but the character of Marcus replaces him with no regrets. I think it's a miracle that an American production company decided to make a film about an Italian comic and I'm very glad for this decision and for the result because I've seen in this project two very precious qualities very important to make a good adaptation passion and respect. I'm waiting for a sequel and I recommend to everyone to see this movie!".

One of the most important character is missing Dylan's sidekick Groucho Marx who gives whole new dimension to the comic and is one of the reasons why is this comic so great.This could be fun for the people who never read Dylan Dog but for us fans this is desecration of a great comic. I'd rather recommend Dellamorte DellamoreCemetery Man with Rupert Everett which was written by Tiziano Sclavi the author of Dylan Dog.For fans who like their comics with good stories and not with just smashbash and who like supernatural stuff i recommend you not to waste time with this move but to try to find comic Dylan Dog and like me to wait for someone to make a really good movie about Dylan Dog.".

One of the most important character is missing Dylan's sidekick Groucho Marx who gives whole new dimension to the comic and is one of the reasons why is this comic so great.This could be fun for the people who never read Dylan Dog but for us fans this is desecration of a great comic. I'd rather recommend Dellamorte DellamoreCemetery Man with Rupert Everett which was written by Tiziano Sclavi the author of Dylan Dog.For fans who like their comics with good stories and not with just smashbash and who like supernatural stuff i recommend you not to waste time with this move but to try to find comic Dylan Dog and like me to wait for someone to make a really good movie about Dylan Dog.";

After looking through them they seem to all have one thing in common  anger that this doesn't seem like a faithful adaptation.I'm willing to bet that most of the US audience for this film has never read the Dylan Dog comics and like me had never heard of Dylan Dog before hearing the title of this movie.Now putting aside the negativity that comes from fans of the source material I think most fans of the genre will like this movie. It is very in the vein of things like Joss Whedons Buffy  Angel as well as sharing some similarities to things like Constantine and the Dresden Files book series. Let's be honest this is urban fantasy. Most people know if they enjoy the genre or not.The film does a decent job of keeping a film noir tone and using noir tropes to it's advantage. Routh is good as the title character doing a nice job of trying to be the tired detective without being a weary stereotype. Sam Huntington is great as Marcus who I think ends up stealing the movie because he really has the lions share of memorable moments.Yes chances are you'll figure out the who done it before the movie reveals it and you'll figure out impending double crosses from the moment characters are introduced. That's the danger of being a genre film but it doesn't detract from the fact that the movie is really fun and very funny in quite a few places.If you like things like Buffy Constantine or Harry Dresden give this movie a chance cause I think you will probably end up liking it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Poor Brandon Routh. After snagging the iconic role as the Man of Steel it's a little bit unfortunate that Bryan Singer's Superman Returns fell short of the studio's expectations and he no longer plays a part in any future installments starting with Zack Snyder's reboot. No matter after all with that build and chiselled good looks one can waltz into another superhero franchise isn't it?Unfortunately Dylan Dog is an Americanized version of the Italian horror graphic novel character and as far as adaptations of comics from another culture goes this one hits the mark in expectations where the source material got extremely dumbed down its unique selling points dissolved into mediocrity and bastardized. Save for the trademarked coat and red shirt director Kevin Munroe's vision of this character became somewhat of a generic monster hunter type of film though a plus point would be its treatment and narrative style in full detective noir with Routh's Dylan Dog being reluctantly pulled from retirement by his client Elizabeth Anita Briem to investigate the death of her father as well as that of his assistant Marcus Sam Huntington.This investigative trip of course introduces the audience unfamiliar with the Dylan Dog mythos that the undead from vampires to werewolves to zombies all have hidden human identities and walk the Earth quite undetected with a truce in place to keep the peace and Dylan being the only trusted human for the monsters to go to when someone crosses the line or breaks the peace. There's a little backstory here on Dylan's origins and the reasons behind his forced retirement but nothing truly to wow or build upon any depth to the character which is potential that's wasted in giving Dylan more meat in background becoming instead just another human detective on his rounds.The thrill factor of course is the make up and effects in having the monsters look their nasty part although they aren't something that hasn't been seen before on screen. Action sequences are hohum with the nagging feeling that the story by Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer can't quite decide how to empower Dylan making him become as powerful as Routh's previous comic book outing in at least the indestructibility factor while equipped with some funky weapons that we should see more of. And the trailer while pretty tacky actually summed up the entire plot having reveal too much and letting out that the filmmakers aren't quite confident with their end product and the marketers a little bit clueless on how to sell this film hence its verbosity.While Brandon Routh has a limited acting range his physique actually suited him fine here and basically that was all that mattered since you aren't going to remember much about his rather bland performance. Perhaps it's also because Sam Huntington his costar from Superman Returns as well as he played Jimmy Olsen then scored much of the flak in this film being the very whiny assistant whose wisecracks and constant shouting get onto your nerves and you wonder when his character could shut up if at all for five minutes. The Marcus character doesn't exist in the books simply because of a potential copyright tussle if what was deemed as a Grucho Marx lookalike got interpreted but this modern replacement was as unfunny as he was unnecessary in a lot of ways.Don't expect this monster squad outing to be too cerebral. It's filled with corny one liners involving various body parts and in essence is a poor man's cousin to Men in Black replacing aliens in our midst with that of monsters roaming around. If only it had stuck more faithfully to its source then it could have been something quite unique.".

The outcome of such a mix is hardly ever entertaining or originative but more like boisterous pretentious and derivative. For a very short while I was actually very enthusiast to see Dylan Dog as I read that it was based on the work of the Italian comic book artist Tiziano Sclavi. This also just happens to be the inventor of Dellamorte Dellamore one of the top five greatest zombie movies ever made and still one of the most shamefully underrated horror movies in the history of cinema. But then I realized again that comic book adaptations hardly ever make good films and in most cases they barely reflect even a glimpse of the coolness of the original comic book. Sclavi's eccentric universe offers a whole lot of potential and terrific gimmicks like first and foremost the New Orleans setting and the rather peculiar story aspect of monsters harmoniously existing together and director Kevin Munroe TMNT also tries hard to make his film accessible to all kinds of cinematic audiences but the whole thing is just too damn derivative and reminiscent to other also inferior franchises like Underworld Constantine Van Helsing Watchmen and who knows what else. Brandon Routh the new but unsuccessful Superman depicts a different type of heroic character this time as he's a supernatural detective and the human guardian of the peacepact between the New Orleans' opposite monster clans. He's actually retired as there haven't been any incidents for a while now but the pact is rudely broken when a rich antique dealer is savagely killed by a lycanthrope of patriarch Gabriel's clan. The murder generates a bloody war with at stake an ancient religious relic holding the power to awaken an invincible demon named Belial. Along the process Dylan's loyal assistant and comic relief character Marcus reluctantly transforms into a zombie and loses his limbs and our private eye falls in love with the victim's daughter who clearly has a hidden agenda since the start. It's truly incomprehensible how a movie featuring so many versatile horror themes and monsters eventually results in such a dull and painfully clichd wholesome. Dylan Dog doesn't feature a single highlight or memorable sequence and on top of it all director Munroe often reverts to rookie mistakes like the redundant narration and an overuse of comedy interludes at the expense of story coherence andor atmosphere. The special and makeup effects albeit plentiful are too obviously computer engineered and hugely disrespectful towards admirers of oldfashioned horror lovers. I watched this film at the Brussels' Festival of Fantastic Films during a midnight screening and in a theater chockfull of outrageous and hyperactive genre fanatics. The crowd's reactions were lukewarm and harsh. I guess that says enough about a film whose desperate aim is to be a crowdpleaser".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so the movie isn't set in London. So there is no Inspector Bloch Dr. Xabaras or Groucho Marx. So the zombies are more Shaun of the Dead than Dawn of the Dead. It's still a good movie.Dylan Dog Dead of Night stars Brandon Routh Superman Returns Scott Pilgrim vs. the World as the eponymous nightmare investigator with Sam Huntington Being Human as his undead sidekick Marcus. When the movie begins Dylan has retired from keeping tabs on the paranormal beings that walk among us and they walk all among us and has settled into a more conventional private detective gig. One day though a potential client named Elizabeth Anita Briem Journey to the Center of the Earth tries to hire Dylan to solve the death of her father. He refuses until he returns to his office that night to discover Marcus has also been killed. The two slayings are just the beginning as Dylan his now zombified assistant and Elizabeth crisscross New Orleans in search of the monsters responsible.Now readers of the Italian comic books on which the film is based have blasted the movie for its unfaithfulness to the original works by Tiziano Sclavi. While it would have been nice to see Brandon Routh playing the clarinet once or twice the realities of moviemaking must intrude at some point. A low budget for example means not being able to film in London where the comics are set. The American city of New Orleans probably comes closest in old school creepiness though apologies to the people of New Orleans and of London I guess. The same goes for Groucho Marx the blackandwhite era comedian on whom the comics' Dylan's assistant is based and whose likeness is very expensive to use in the States. While they show pictures of people in Groucho glasses and posters for Marx Brothers movies the cost for securing the rights to have an imitator was likely quite high. Even the American adaptation of the comics had to shave Groucho's mustache and change his name to Felix for similar reasons. Sam Huntington more than fills the role of comedy sidekick though as he struggles to adjust to the fact that he's dead and he and Routh have excellent chemistry due to their time working together on Superman Returns.Anita Briem's character seems like a bit of a misfire at times but she certainly follows the path of most female characters in the comics. Often Dylan Dog finds himself taking the case of an attractive young woman who has lost a loved one or several and needs his help coming to grips with the supernatural world into which she's been thrust. And while the supernatural world of the movie differs noticeably from that of the comics the atmosphere it presents is almost instantly recognizable. The walk they take through the streets at night as Dylan tries to open her eyes to the presence of the undead as they literally pass in front of her eyes would not have seemed out of place on Sclavi's pages I feel. Sure the monsters themselves are different but again you've gotta give American moviegoers a bone every now and then show them something they'll recognize as well.And then there's Dylan himself. Brandon Routh is a fine actor I don't think anyone can deny that. He works very well with what he's given and in this case he did an excellent job as Dylan Dog. The movie character shared much in common with the comics character mistrust of technology the comics Dylan refuses to use a cell phone the movie Dylan still uses cameras with film in them a deep brooding disinterest in the world at large drives the same VW Bug even though the colors have been inverted and though some may disagree he even looks a lot like the Dylan from the comics. Dylan is an old school private investigator whether he's investigating the living the dead or the undead. In the movies though he's given an additional role keeping the creatures of the supernatural world from getting out of line. A pact was formed presumably to protect the monsters from being wiped out entirely by humanity and as part of that pact a human was chosen to sort of police the undead to keep them in check so to speak. In our day that's Dylan or at least it was until he retired.That last part is probably the biggest difference between the comic books and the movie. It turns the character from a sort of Philip Marlowe of the undead world into another version of Keanu Reeve's John Constantine another movie character who wasn't that closely based on his graphic novel counterpart and it is probably the part of the movie about which fans of the Dylan Dog comics will be the least forgiving. I'm enough of a purist myself to agree that the movie should have done more to adhere to the source material. That being said I liked the movie a lot. I think they did a fine job with not that much in the way of resources and they created a very believable underground world that could very well coexist with our own. Brandon Routh has always been a favorite actor of mine and even if this is the latest in a string of underrated movies in which he starred he and Sam Huntington did a great job in it.".

In our day that's Dylan or at least it was until he retired.That last part is probably the biggest difference between the comic books and the movie. It turns the character from a sort of Philip Marlowe of the undead world into another version of Keanu Reeve's John Constantine another movie character who wasn't that closely based on his graphic novel counterpart and it is probably the part of the movie about which fans of the Dylan Dog comics will be the least forgiving. I'm enough of a purist myself to agree that the movie should have done more to adhere to the source material. That being said I liked the movie a lot. I think they did a fine job with not that much in the way of resources and they created a very believable underground world that could very well coexist with our own. Brandon Routh has always been a favorite actor of mine and even if this is the latest in a string of underrated movies in which he starred he and Sam Huntington did a great job in it.";

	schema:reviewBody "How can a movie that has zombies werewolves vampires and a giant demonic creature named Belial be so freakin' boring?!?! Brandon Routh is as dull as the movie portraying handsome human hero Dylan chosen by the monsters to service their need to keep the peace yes a human as peace maker for all the monsters I laughed a lot at this idea between True Bloods the vampires and Gabriel's family the werewolves who operate a meat packing plant yes you read that correctly. The zombies are not allowed to feast on the living having to follow the same code of nonviolence toward humans as the vampires and werewolves. Humans are called breathers by Vargas Taye Diggs who seems to lack any type of charisma for a stud vampire who wants to get his undead hands on a crucifix with the blood of Belial known as the Heart of Belial. The crucifix is thrust into a host body and the one who uses the heart as a weapon is master of the beast that will be given birth by the blood of Belial.Going through the formalities. Elizabeth Anita Briem calls on Dylan to find her father's killer which turns out to be Gabriel's Peter Stormare daughter. A vampire who stole the heart from Elizabeth's father has hidden it and so it is desired by both the True Bloods and Gabriel's brood including his son played by TNA Impact Wrestling's Kurt Angle. Dylan will try to secure the heart before it winds up in the wrong hands. Dylan's best friend Marcus Sam Huntington is attacked by a giant zombie controlled by someone or something turning the young man into a zombie himself. Marcus will accompany Dylan as they search for the heart Marcus and his condition are used as comedy relief perhaps Marcus is the sole entertainment value this dead horror comedy has going for it. Liz may be more than she appears adding a twist to the proceedings. Dylan had retired from his gig as human peacekeeper of the monsters due to the murder of his beloved Cassandra having slaughtered a group of elder vampires in turn placing Vargas in a position of power. Who do you really think was responsible for Cassandra's tragic demise? Yeah it's that obviousto everyone but the supposed knowitall investigator.I could go on and on but the film isn't worth the extra time. Set in New Orleans there's no reason this shouldn't be more energetic and fun. It just isn't. A dire lack of juicy bloodshed or visceral thrills only worsens a film loaded with monsters that normally leave plenty of gore in their wake. And when your star is as leaden as Routh there's really no hope in that regard either. Just a shame Dylan Dog Dead of Night has such little to offer when the potential for an enjoyable experience is ripe for the pickings. The plot stays busy but doesn't really offer any original ideas that warrant the kind of enthusiasm a monster mash should entail. The story also includes a religious sect of monster hunters one unveiled and equipped with martial arts and swordfighting skills but even her fight scenes with Diggs falls flat due to poor editing during the action. Just a flat out misfire. There is a great scene has Dylan going to a body shop to get Marcus a new arm a loaner but it's one too few.".

	schema:headline " Forgettable Adaptation of Italian Graphic Novel Series";
	schema:reviewBody "The most aggravating movies in my opinion are the ones where the premise sounds like something that could make for a really awesome movie but the actual product falls completely flat. Dylan DOG is not a horrible movie it's just another movie that might entertain a bit while you watch it...might elicit a chuckle at times...but overall is completely forgettable. It's based off an Italian graphic novel that I'd honestly never heard of but might be interested in checking out to see if it's better than the movie. Dylan Dog is a private investigator in New Orleans who finds himself confronted by a part of his past that he thought he'd left behind. Before Dog began catering to the city's sleazy human population he was an investigator for the paranormal citizens of the city vampires werewolves and zombies all living quietly alongside us. When a werewolf appears to have murdered a human Dog is drawn back in to his old life to investigate and uncovers a plot to unleash an ancient evil that could wreak havoc on the supernatural underworld before ultimately spilling over onto humanity.I've seen this movie twice now and I can barely remember anything about it. That's not a good sign. I really thought this movie had the potential to be cool but it feels more like a SyFy original movie. The story wanders and never builds tension. It just sort of meanders from one plot point to another lazily following the trail of clues until the final confrontation. And the special effects...wow. I realize this film was a lower budget than usual compared to your average Hollywood effectsheavy film at 20 million but come on. I've seen some pretty amazing films created out of budgets this size. DISTRICT 9 was only 30 million and that movie blew my mind with awesomeness. Dylan DOG's got a decent independent budget and the creature effects in this film feel twenty years old! For example the tattooed zombie a major element of the film that couldn't be bothered with an actual identifying name looks ridiculous. It's mouth barely moves and it's only means of intimidation is waving it's arms around like a weekly villain from the old Power Rangers TV show. I love practical special effects and I prefer some real well done practical creature effects over CGI anytime. But if you can't make a creature look like anything more than a bodybuilder in a bad Halloween mask perhaps you should consider another option.Dylan DOG is director Kevin Munroe's second film and seeing as how his first film was the animated TMNT I really don't know what I should've expected. TMNT was decent but I suppose it's not hard to look better when the preceding film in the Ninja Turtle series had men in rubber turtle costumes riding horses. I have to wonder if the effects in this film were so poor where did the budget go? It couldn't have been the cast. The movie is filled with Hey I know that guy from somewhere level actors. Brandon Routh feels as if he should be Alist by now but his project selections aren't letting him get far. He showed us he could do comedy with some great jobs in ZACK AND MIRI and SCOTT PILGRIM but he feels flat here. A couple of oneliners but mostly emotionless. Sam Huntington is the best part of the film as Dog's newly zombified sidekick Marcus. He gets the best parts of the film and I think the filmmakers realized this because he gets more screentime than his character probably should. Peter Stormare the actor with the most clout in the film is wasted as the head of a werewolf clan and Taye Diggs doesn't feel like he's taking this thing seriously.If I'd known ahead of time the film had given a part to pro wrestler Kurt Angle at least I would've known what I was walking into. No offense wrestling fans but wrestlers suck as actors 99 of the time and Angle is no exception here made more laughworthy when they strap on the lamest werewolf makeup in the last few decades. Dylan DOG feels like a movie where no one was really trying. I'm sure it was just a paycheck to some of those involved but this has got to annoy fans of the actual graphic novel who might've been excited to see their beloved property brought to film. Dylan DOG is yet another comic property where we just need to hope that somewhere down the line a studio decides to reboot the series and...I don't know...try to make an entertaining film.".

	schema:headline " Predictable boring dumb and with visual's that are bad for the eighties. Well early nineties.";
	schema:reviewBody "Dylan Dog Dead Of Night is as far from the actual Dylan Dog as a movie based on it can actually be. I read somewhere that this was not supposed to be a Dylan Dog movie but that the title was put during the production to get some marketing. If it's true than it's no surprise. But truth or not that doesn't change the fact that the movie would suck anyway. While the comic book's are something of a horror written like movie noir with some elements of comedy this is just a dumb movie that tries to mix action and horror genre with comedy and fails at all three disastrously. Also it need's to be mentioned that some of the most important character's from the comic book's are not even in it. In the matter of fact there is Dylan Dog and that's it. And not to mention that Dylan's character in this film is nothing like Dylan in the comic books. This guy is more like Rambo off steroids with a teenagers personality. And while all those flaws could even somehow be accepted if it wasn't a Dylan Dog movie the fact that every scene is there for only one purpose and that is to lead to another dumb action packed sequence and that the dialog is so stupid that a child can say 'it's obviously written' all of it together just makes it too bad to be bearable. There are plenty of movies out there that are bad adaptations and that are plain simply bad movies but they at least tend to have something to offer. Something like a brainless entertainment. This one can't offer anything. Not even that. It's boring and dumb it's trash. And just for the record werewolves and vampires are not supposed to look the same. And when the entire movie is about someone trying to bring back to life a super powerful monster make sure that the monster is actually powerful instead of just knowing some karate and having wings and horns.

Actually forget that last part. He wouldn't need a set of lights. And i don't know who directed this but he should stop directing. Dylan Dog Dead Of Night is a predictable boring and dumb movie with terrible acting all around that has nothing to do with it's title. No matter what you do make sure you avoid watching it. Especially if you are a fan of the comic books.".

	onyx:emotionText "Dylan Dog Dead Of Night is as far from the actual Dylan Dog as a movie based on it can actually be. I read somewhere that this was not supposed to be a Dylan Dog movie but that the title was put during the production to get some marketing. If it's true than it's no surprise. But truth or not that doesn't change the fact that the movie would suck anyway. While the comic book's are something of a horror written like movie noir with some elements of comedy this is just a dumb movie that tries to mix action and horror genre with comedy and fails at all three disastrously. Also it need's to be mentioned that some of the most important character's from the comic book's are not even in it. In the matter of fact there is Dylan Dog and that's it. And not to mention that Dylan's character in this film is nothing like Dylan in the comic books. This guy is more like Rambo off steroids with a teenagers personality. And while all those flaws could even somehow be accepted if it wasn't a Dylan Dog movie the fact that every scene is there for only one purpose and that is to lead to another dumb action packed sequence and that the dialog is so stupid that a child can say 'it's obviously written' all of it together just makes it too bad to be bearable. There are plenty of movies out there that are bad adaptations and that are plain simply bad movies but they at least tend to have something to offer. Something like a brainless entertainment. This one can't offer anything. Not even that. It's boring and dumb it's trash. And just for the record werewolves and vampires are not supposed to look the same. And when the entire movie is about someone trying to bring back to life a super powerful monster make sure that the monster is actually powerful instead of just knowing some karate and having wings and horns. And the cinematography... Oh God. Let's just say that if i had a son and if i bought him a cheap indie camera and if i would give him a set of lights he'd make it look better. Actually forget that last part. He wouldn't need a set of lights. And i don't know who directed this but he should stop directing.

Many fans watched the movie because of the title of the movie and I can say they are right in defending the one of the most famous comic books in Italy. Our product has been damaged by the director Brandon Routh and the screenwriters. They probably haven't read one page of the comics. They decided to use the name to sell the movie. It looks a mixture of the bad copy of Buffy and Constantine. At the beginning the movie was to be titled Derek Donovan I would have been much better if that happened. But it's Bonelli's fault who sold the right of the movie to Americans without any garantee. That's because Italy has no big production companies. You can find the real Dylan Dog in The Cemetery Man even though the character is different. Probably the director thought that with the clothes of Dylan Dog you have Dylan Dog. There isn't the nightmares the fears the anxiety the terror of the comics. Highly not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dylan Dog Dead of Night is an extreme underdog of a movie. It doesn't have an Alist cast. Its budget is small for a widereleased genre film. It even has the dubious distinction of being badmouthed by the Italian press well before its North American release. But don't let any of this fool you it's still an entertaining movie.First off this isn't the character created by Tiziano Sclavi. This is an approximated overly americanized version of his seminal creation. London isn't the backdrop and there is no Groucho. So if you grew up reading the comics you might not recognize the character in anything other than name. However if you never heard of Dylan Dog before this flick made purely for fans of the genre should do you just fine.Taking place in Louisiana the story involves an impending war between varying supernatural factions over an object of great power. Some want it to ensure its safekeeping. Others want to use it to overthrow the natural order. In the middle of this is the eponymous character that gets caught in the middle all while trying to solve a murder.With a running time of 107 minutes and so much material to cover it might seem things would become unbearably muddled. Thankfully this is not the case. Following Dog's investigation we're introduced to many of the supernaturals that call the Big Easy home in a brisk yet naturally flowing manner.There are the werewolves headed by Gabriel Peter Stormare. A lycanthropic man of honor you could see how full moon or not he was literally fighting back the darkness just under the skin. The vampires were led by Vargas Taye Diggs. A polar opposite of Gabriel Vargas was gleefully opportunistic and ultimately a charming parasite. And then there was Big Al Dan Braverman. He was an absolute hoot as the ever so humble owner of Zombie Martthink of an auto supply store but for body parts. Watching his undead clientele casually peruse the selection of arms legs and scalps available for purchase was surreal and really conveys the tone of the movie.Leading us through all of this was Dylan Dog Brandon Routh. Despite being human he was the most dangerous and resourceful person in the film. A highlight of this was when he shot his way into the vampire's stronghold in broad daylight. Cornering Vargas in his bedroom with the sunlight directly behind him Dog used his shadow to shield Vargas from the sun. Every time the vampire lied or refused to answer a question Dog simply moved and let him burn to force the truthright awesome. His assistant Marcus Adams Sam Huntington added some much needed comedy as he slowly came to terms with his newfound status as a zombie. He went from refusing to accept his condition to wanting to die with dignity and finally to acceptance. He even gets to be the hero by wielding his own severed arm as a club. The client Elizabeth Ryan Anita Briem at first seemed to be a typical dame in peril. But as the story progressed it became apparent she was hiding a secretone which provided the best fight scene in the film.So yeah some of the creature effects were a bit less than inspiredwerewolf designs have been in decline since Landis' 1981 masterpiece. Dog lived through so many hard bonerattling and body flying through the air blows it started to become a little bit too unreal by the film's end. Also while he's come a very long way since Superman Returns I felt Brandon Routh came off as playing himself pretending to be Dylan Dog instead of just being the character. It wasn't a big deal here but it was noticeable. All he needs to do is completely let go of himself and between the calls of action and cut simply be whoever he's signed on to play.Despite these minor nitpicks Dylan Dog is a good movie that never once lost sight of what it was or what it was supposed to be. I'm pretty sure it won't do much business in this day and age of animated features romcom's and remakes. But that doesn't mean I didn't have a blast watching this in the theater and won't be waiting for this on DVD. If you're a fan of properties like Men in Black Hellboy and Ghostbusters you owe it to yourself to check this out on the big screenit was tailor made for people like us. No it's not a flawless film.

Dylan Dog is like a Sherlock Holmes for the supernatural. He always wears the same clothes he plays the clarinet lives in London  not New Orleans  his assistant looks like Groucho Marx not a zombie he is a reformed alcoholic and has many many fears and phobias. One of the most notable is claustrophobia which is ignored by the makers of this movie as they shot a scene where Dylan is sealed into a crypt with his zombie assistant. He stays cool as ice while the zombie guy freaks out. Thank you writers and producers for making him the most uninteresting person in the world. For those who know the comic and like it please don't watch the movie. Its not Dylan Dog. It doesn't come even close.And the movie if we suppose the title would be John Smith Dead of Night is as bad as it gets. New Orleans is apparently littered with zombies werewolves and vampires. You just have to look closer. Zombies are everywhere. They work in fast food joints the morgue walk the streets at night have zombie support groups...Vampires make their money peddling their own blood as a party drug. And werewolves supply the city with meat. Makes sense. On the whole this movie is only slightly better than the Uwe Boll stuff. The plot is not worth mentioning. The acting? Don't know really. The zombie assistant did yell a lot. And Routh or whatshisname speaks with the same tone of voice during the entire movie. Doesn't matter where he is and what he is doing. The girl's accent seemed to change for about three times during the whole movie. Even the special effects are horrible. The vampires and werewolves look about the same. The latter just have more hair. Peter Stromare is a good actor and is convincing as an alpha male of the werewolf family. Sadly his part in the movie is small. Taye Diggs is unconvincing as the head of the 'trueblood' vampire family. His portrayal of the bad guy in the movie is useless. I don't know how much of that is his fault because the script is so weak. Most of the action sequences feature Dog fighting vampires or werewolves. Its your basic shootout and fistfight routine. The zombies are there for the laughs. You might get a few at the beginning but all the clichs and Huntington antics combined with a loud highpitched voice get annoying as the movie progresses. I would have probably left the movie before the ending if the plot would not promise me the reincarnation of Belial the demon. I was curious to see this beast. Boy was I wrong. It was a spectacle. They failed spectacularly. It looked like it was made out of plastic. Was there a budget issue? Did they run out of money so they thought they'd save some by using cheap but crappy special effects? So much potential and such a screw up. The name Dylan Dog is in the title just to get a few dollars more out of the comic fans. I can't think of any other reason. This one makes Constantine and Keanu Reeves look brilliant.".

	schema:headline " Brandon Routh is a tad too dead serious in this passable production which could do with more fun and silliness";
	schema:reviewBody "Brandon who? The name's Brandon Routh the former fashion model who was supposed to save the Superman series by playing the caped superhero in 2006. Alas despite positive reviews for the Bryan Singer directed movie the planned sequel for Superman Returns never materialized. What happened to the chiseled good looker? He went on to play supporting roles in several TV series he had a 12 episode stint on Chuck and movies 2008's Zack and Miri Make a Porno being the most memorable before landing himself on this project which according to the movie poster is based on one of the world's most popular comics.Err doesn't that accolade belong to the gang from Marvel?Jokes aside Routh plays the titular Dylan Dog a supernatural private eye who seeks out monsters to bring peace to New Orleans. With a zombie as his assistant the ace detective must come face to face with vampires and werewolves so that the world can be safe once more.Research tells us that the horror comic series this movie is based on originated in Italy where a good one million copies are sold each month since its publication in 1986. The filmmakers have taken liberty to shift the setting of the movie from London to New Orleans and replacing the sidekick character with an undead assistant due to copyright issues. So here we have Routh donning the comic character's signature red shirt black jacket and blue jeans to hunt those monsters down.Truth be told the dashing star does look good in the movie with his 1.9 meter frame. The Iowa born actor has the quality of a leading man check out those sculpted facial features and broad shoulders but charisma alone is apparently not good enough to make Routh a credible actor. There is a lack in his character portrayal and it is rather unfortunate that his acting was as dead as the creatures he has to battle. The tiresome voiceovers do not help to sustain our interest in the character either.Laughs come in the form of Sam Huntington he played Superman's pal Jimmy Olsen in 2006's Superman Returns which explains his pairing with Routh in this movie who plays the underappreciated friend who becomes a zombie. The endearing actor gets some of the best moments in the movie including one which has him going to a zombie support group so that he can come to terms with his newfound status as an undead. His presence in the otherwise dreary movie provides the much needed perks.Regrettably Huntington alone isn't enough to save the 108 minute production from being predictably lackluster. His co stars include Anita Briem Journey to the Center of the Earth who tries her best to take on the role of an attractive client Peter Stormare The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus who tries his best to look threatening as a werewolf and Taye Diggs Chicago who tries his best to send shivers down our spines as a vampire. Maybe it's the B grade movie feel of the production or maybe it's just the unsurprising plot developments but we just cannot find ourselves being impressed by the ensemble cast.Special effects aren't too shoddy in this Kevin Munroe his other feature film credit is the disappointing TMNT directed movie but we can't help but feel that this is one movie best played on late night television.www.moviexclusive.com".

He went on to play supporting roles in several TV series he had a 12 episode stint on Chuck and movies 2008's Zack and Miri Make a Porno being the most memorable before landing himself on this project which according to the movie poster is based on one of the world's most popular comics.Err doesn't that accolade belong to the gang from Marvel?Jokes aside Routh plays the titular Dylan Dog a supernatural private eye who seeks out monsters to bring peace to New Orleans. With a zombie as his assistant the ace detective must come face to face with vampires and werewolves so that the world can be safe once more.Research tells us that the horror comic series this movie is based on originated in Italy where a good one million copies are sold each month since its publication in 1986. The filmmakers have taken liberty to shift the setting of the movie from London to New Orleans and replacing the sidekick character with an undead assistant due to copyright issues. So here we have Routh donning the comic character's signature red shirt black jacket and blue jeans to hunt those monsters down.Truth be told the dashing star does look good in the movie with his 1.9 meter frame. The Iowa born actor has the quality of a leading man check out those sculpted facial features and broad shoulders but charisma alone is apparently not good enough to make Routh a credible actor. There is a lack in his character portrayal and it is rather unfortunate that his acting was as dead as the creatures he has to battle. The tiresome voiceovers do not help to sustain our interest in the character either.Laughs come in the form of Sam Huntington he played Superman's pal Jimmy Olsen in 2006's Superman Returns which explains his pairing with Routh in this movie who plays the underappreciated friend who becomes a zombie. The endearing actor gets some of the best moments in the movie including one which has him going to a zombie support group so that he can come to terms with his newfound status as an undead. His presence in the otherwise dreary movie provides the much needed perks.Regrettably Huntington alone isn't enough to save the 108 minute production from being predictably lackluster. His co stars include Anita Briem Journey to the Center of the Earth who tries her best to take on the role of an attractive client Peter Stormare The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus who tries his best to look threatening as a werewolf and Taye Diggs Chicago who tries his best to send shivers down our spines as a vampire. Maybe it's the B grade movie feel of the production or maybe it's just the unsurprising plot developments but we just cannot find ourselves being impressed by the ensemble cast.Special effects aren't too shoddy in this Kevin Munroe his other feature film credit is the disappointing TMNT directed movie but we can't help but feel that this is one movie best played on late night television.www.moviexclusive.com";

I wonder how many episodes the director read because I have the impression that he has no idea at all about Dylan Dog. He should have at least taken 5 min of his time to read about the character on Wikipedia. Even the more simple details have been ignored or changed. If the production had not enough money to film the movie in London and create a more credible character why they did not just based the story on a new invented one. They could have saved the money paid to Sergio Bonelli and the image of such a nice comic.........".

	schema:reviewBody "'DYLAN DOG DEAD OF NIGHT' Three and a Half Stars Out of Five The George Lazenby of 'Superman' films Brandon Routh stars in yet another comic book adaptation in this one he's a private eye who specializes in the supernatural Routh only played Superman once in 'SUPERMAN RETURNS' before being replaced like Lazenby only played James Bond once. The film is based on an Italian horror comic titled 'Dylan Dog' which premiered in the 1980's and was created by author Tiziano Sclavi. This film was written by Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer and directed by Kevin Munroe who's only other feature directing credit is the 2007 animated 'TMNT' film. It costars Sam Huntington as Dylan Dog's zombie sidekick Huntington also played sidekick to Routh in 'SUPERMAN RETURNS' as Jimmy Olsen. The film has gotten horrible reviews from the critics performed dismally at the box office and p off diehard fans of the comic book who say it's completely unfaithful to the source material. I happened to like the film though and found it surprisingly entertaining.Dylan Dog Routh is a P.I. who used to specialize in cases involving the supernatural due to his expertise and knowledge in the area. He's long given that up and has taken up normal routine cases involving the likes of catching a cheating spouse on camera in the act. He's pulled back into the world of vampires werewolves and ghouls when a young woman Anita Briem calls looking for the Dylan Dog of yesteryear. He initially rejects the case wanting nothing to do with that part of his life anymore but finds himself once again caught up in his old ways when his assistant Huntington is killed and turned into a zombie which in this film are not brain dead but in fact think like everyone else.The film has been criticized by fans and critics alike for taking far too many creative liberties with the comic book source material like setting the film in New Orleans rather than London and changing Dog's sidekick from a Groucho Marx impersonator to a friendly zombie but many of those changes were done due to budget restraints. The movie was made for just 20 million which is pretty low budget by Hollywood standards and it's actually surprising that the film was even released in theaters although it only received a limited release. So the weak box office performance isn't all that surprising I'm sure it will do much better on video and hopefully live on to be a cult classic. I never read the comic or knew anything about it prior to first hearing about the film so I had no preconceived expectations in that way going into the movie although I did know about it's weak critic and fan rating and poor box office numbers so I actually was expecting very little from the film which is the best way to go into a movie in my opinion. So due to my expectations I was pretty pleasantly surprised by the film. It is very funny at times as well as thrilling and a nice piece of stylized genre monster film. It's got all of my favorite elements of this type of flick. Routh is adequate in the lead I actually like Routh and am disappointed he won't be playing 'Superman' again and Huntington is a scene stealer. The directing is decent and the writing is amusing. It's got a strong 'BUFFY' and 'SUPERNATURAL' feel to it as well so if you're a fan of either of those TV series you'll probably like the film also. It's just a fun time at the movies so if you're not a big fan of the comic and therefor not looking for a sincere adaptation you'll probably enjoy it as well.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vaotBOLCPYg".

MGM's exciting and technically innovative 1929 production DYNAMITE is exactly that... a moral fable of a vulgar wealthy woman and her immoral flighty glamor friends learning about the hard working honest poor side of life. This is all of course an excuse for Cecil B De Mille then at MGM for three films to showcase the latest in talkie production methods. I agree with the other positive comments on this page that DYNAMITE is a 20s art deco masterpiece and an absolute feast of Jazz age wildness and lavishness. You will also find this level of breathtaking snazzy art deco 20s life in The Divorce of 1929 and the 1930 Douglas Fairbanks film from united Artists Reaching For The Moon.... each film absolutely essential for early talkie art deco astonishment for anyone who loves this early talkie period before The Depression stopped the party. DYANMITE is a good film with a compelling story... and the pre code language and sex topic at the peppy sports party with the wheel race with the women spinning about in the latest in art deco swimming costumes will re set your dial for 20s party frankness. See handsome Joel MacCrea as an almostextra. This has been screening on a daily loop on TV in Australia so we can see it and examine it repeatedly. Well worth your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe this was made in 1929! It would seem much later. 'Dynamite' was directed by Cecil B. DeMillle and featured Conrad Nagel Kay Johnson Charles Bickford Julia Faye and Joel McCrea.. Apparently it was DeMille's first talking picture!I got lucky because they broadcast this on TCM the same week the classic movie channel premiered their recent biography 'Cecil B. DeMille American Epic 2004' another TCM film worth watching. It is devoid of the usual colossal cast and the behemoth type epic drama associated with most DeMille movies but am I ever glad I stayed up late for this one...the sets and costuming  were pure eye candy! And while it is more simplistic than movies we think of as DeMille classics there are some remarkable scenes in this film including a glass walled bathtub with bath salts as big as the coal chunks mined out of the heroines'temporary' husband's work place.  I'll not quickly forget the women's 'aero wheels' event during the sporting day at the country club. Could this have even been the inspiration to the wacky Busby Berkeley extravaganzas that didn't appear for at least another four years after 'Dynamite'? The costumes in this movie are museum worthy. There's also tremendous amount of Deco decor which is discriminating and sublime as a period piece.The plot premise is rather sappy...spoiled rich kid falls for poor coal miner who teaches her a lesson in reality...where haven't we all heard that story before... but it's easy to forgive some minor flaws with this picture because visually it's too damn delicious to forget. The acting was decent and at times even humorous especially amongst the love triangle. This relationship was obliging liberated given the era. And oh...the parties!I also appreciate the lushness of a truly dynamic black and white movie from someone who understood how color translates when it desaturates. If I saw this movie when it premiered I would have marked it an 8 12 on a scale of 10.".

	schema:headline " Now We Know How The Roaring '20s Roared";
	schema:reviewBody "There is no doubt that this is movie resurrected by the Turner Classic Movie network which reminds us all that fine cinematic entertainment was being made at the very beginning of the Talkies.  The plot was fairly clever for that day and time and it simply shreds conventions.The inbetweenthelines context of this movie is also remarkable.  Recall that Prohibition of alcoholic beverages had been in effect as a federal mandate for nearly ten years and that many States had been dry with Prohibition for longer than that.  But the glittering society depicted in this movie was positively soaking in booze.  Clearly this movie was written and filmed well before the banking crisis of 192829 turned into the bank failures and bank runs of the early 1930s.  The pace of the language the styles the ways of talking and relating expressed in Dynamite show the viewer  now seventyfive years later  that the Roaring '20s were very frenetic indeed.Prohibition was something for the small towns and rural areas or so it was said then.  It came into being because activist female leaders made their case that drunken behavior and alcoholism were twin punishments on women and on their children.  The majority of bad and abusive drunks in that era 1880 to 1920 were men of course.  The ones who suffered from their abusive behaviors were their women and their children or others in their families.This is a movie which is all about women and men.  The lead character Buddy Derks is about to be executed for a murder he didn't commit.  In a drunken carouse the young man who committed the murder assaults his drinking buddy with a knife and this fellow in his turn shoots his friend fatally wounding him.  Before he dies on the floor of the swank club where they're drinking he confesses to the murder which Derks has been saddled with. Justice is swift surprisingly so and Derks is suddenly released from death row.He goes then to confront the society 'dame' who paid him 10000 to marry her in a jail cell ceremony.  The why and wherefore of this marriage of convenience are really extraordinary and that twist makes the movie worth seeing alone.  But suddenly the dame has a husband that she really does not want and that's where the fun begins ....Bickford is amazing in this movie.  He clearly overacts but it seems somehow so natural for him to do so.  Everybody in this moving is either dancing or roaring it seems so now we know something about how the Roaring '20s roared !This Dynamite is pure dynamite.  TCM has done film buffs a great service by showing it all and there's every reason to petition them to show it again and again and not just in the middle of the blooming night !!  This movie earned an  8  for my vote and I would have given it higher marks if the sound track was made more clear all the way through.  As it stands it is a unique and appealing cinematic treat.I recommend it most highly and without mental reservations.".

My favorite movies were mostly made in the Thalberg era.  I am so sorry your time Thalberg was so short lived.  And I still weep for the  demise of MGM.  MGM really did lose its shine when it lost Thalberg. This story was complex.  The sets were wonderful I loved the mirror over the bar in the apartment and the bathtub with the bowl of bath salts. Every actor  no matter how large their role  handled their part convincingly.  Several small roles  the little sister the judge the girl next door in the mining town the servants etc. all deliver performances that make you pay attention.  Many scenes stand out.  The competition among the women in the 'circle' races I never saw such contraptions.  The little girl clinging to her brother that little actress did a fine job.  The fiance who really was likable and a real stand up guy.  I was amused by kitchen scene.  The 'modern' way of women dating each other's husbands struck me and I have seen this as a plot line before in movies of that period.  The 'speak easy' preoccupation with drinking lifestyle of the time is an education as is the portrayal of life in the lower classes.   Of all the movies I've seen in this time period I feel this one most closely clues us in on what life was like.".

	schema:reviewBody "In his memoirs Cecil B. DeMille got the idea for Dynamite which became his first all talking film after reading a small article about a man on New Jersey's death row who got married three days before his execution. What if DeMille reasoned the execution was canceled and the two had to live with each other? What might be the consequences. From this germ of an idea DeMille got his favorite screen writer and sometimes mistress Jeanie MacPherson to fashion a story for the camera. The result was Dynamite.DeMille was doing the first of a three picture deal with MGM and his memoirs do talk about his having to deal with sound in fact they read a whole lot like the scenes from a future MGM classic Singing in the Rain. You ought to read them.Charles Bickford is a coal miner on death row for a crime he didn't commit. His only concern is the care for his younger sister Muriel McCormac when he dies. He even offers to sell his corpse to medical science.At the same time good time party girl Kay Johnson has a different problem. According to the terms of her grandfather's will Johnson can't inherit until her 23rd birthday and at that time she must be a married woman otherwise she gets zilch. The guy she's in love with is polo player Conrad Nagel who is married to Julia Faye who in real life was another of DeMille's mistresses. Faye always got parts of varying size in just about every DeMille production and in this one she's got one of her more substantive roles. She'll part with Nagel for a price but in the meantime she's got young Joel McCrea on the side.Johnson reads about Bickford's offer and pays him 10000.00 for a prison wedding right their on death row. But wonder of wonders within minutes of the execution someone else confesses to the crime and Bickford is freed. And he wants to exercise his husbandly prerogatives also. Instead of the usual triangle what we've got is a lover's pentagon. Obviously one of the men will have to be eliminated in some fashion but who will it be? That is the crux of Dynamite.Cecil B. DeMille did a lot of discovering here. Dynamite was Kay Johnson's motion picture debut and was Bickford's second film and first substantial role. DeMille personally selected both of them from the stage because of sound to be cast. As for Joel McCrea in his memoirs DeMille says that McCrea and his daughter Cecilia went to Hollywood High School together and he remembered him as one of Cecilia's friends over at his house many times. McCrea had several bit roles in silent films before Dynamite but this was his first part of substance. In the book The Films of Joel McCrea McCrea states that he was forever grateful to DeMille for this exposure. It led to a contract with RKO and his first lead the following year in The Silver Horde.The song How Am I To Know comes from this film and its sung during the scenes on death row by a young convict who was starting his all too brief career. Written by Jack King and lyrics by Dorothy Parker it's sung by Russ Columbo who got his first critical notice after several other bit parts that year. Quite a staggering list of people for whom this was a key film.It wouldn't be a DeMille film without a big bacchanalian party and and some spectacular special effects. DeMille could show debauchery on screen like no other usually followed by a sermon on living a clean and sober life and Dynamite is no exception. The jazz age scenes with Kay partying with her friends are good risqu before the Code stuff.And the mine cavein at the end is also well staged in true DeMille style. Even his severest critics always credited DeMille with handling spectacle like no other.Dynamite is a film that's melodramatic overacted as most early sound films were and definitely does not hold up well today. Still it's good for its type and as it turns out a key film in many lives.".

The cinematography sound and set design are excellent and the acting toned down the overdramatization that most early sound films wallowed in.  Just view DeMille's King of Kings directed two years earlier to witness the advancements being made in film at the time.  From the elaborate Deco rooms to a shanty neighborhood and mine shaft DeMille puts on quite a show.  My only complaint would be the opening courtroom scene which definitely does NOT set the scene for the rest of the movie.

	schema:headline " Incredibly Entertaining No Matter How Wild It Gets";
	schema:reviewBody "Dynamite 1929  out of 4Cecil B. DeMille's first talkie was the first of three pictures that the legendary director would make at MGM. The filthy rich Cynthia Kay Johnson needs to be married on her birthday or else she'll lose millions from her grandfather's will. The only problem is that her boyfriend Conrad Nagel is already married to a woman who doesn't mind her husband dating Cynthia but she refuses to marry him unless the money is right. On the other side of the tracks convicted killer Hagon Charles Bickford is about to be put to death and offers his body for 10000 so that his kid sister will be taken care of. Cynthia decides to marry the death row inmate so that she can be married on her birthday and since she'll be a widow soon after she can get back to her normal life. The only problem is that after the marriage the real killer comes forward and Hagon is set free.Is that enough plot for you? DYNAMITE features enough plots for about ten different movies and everything I wrote above is just the opening fortyminutes and that leaves eightyseven more minutes of craziness. This is without question an incredibly bizarre film but there's no question that it's highly entertaining on so many levels. One such level is that it's just downright nuts from start to finish and I just sat there watching it in a complete amazement that anyone could actually pull it off. DeMille proves what a genius he was by taking this outrageous stories and making them work. If any other director had tried this we'd laugh them right out of the theater. I'm not sure what DeMille's secrets were but he makes us care about the characters and their fate. It also doesn't hurt that we're given some excellent performances with Bickford leading the way as the tough coal miner. This is the type of role he could play in his sleep and he pulls it off wonderfully. Johnson is very believable and good in her part as is Nagel. Julia Faye plays his wife and we get supporting performances from Joel McCrea and William Holden.DYNAMITE features some very campy moments including the scene where the killer confesses to the crime. I dare you not to laugh during this sequence. I also found it rather hilarious how casual the wife her husband and the lover were at hanging out with each other. I think this threesome relationship is something that even Jerry Springer would roll his eyes at. Still this is so entertaining that it really doesn't matter and it would make a great double feature with DeMille's other 1929 film THE GODLESS GIRL.".

	onyx:emotionText "Dynamite 1929  out of 4Cecil B. DeMille's first talkie was the first of three pictures that the legendary director would make at MGM. The filthy rich Cynthia Kay Johnson needs to be married on her birthday or else she'll lose millions from her grandfather's will. The only problem is that her boyfriend Conrad Nagel is already married to a woman who doesn't mind her husband dating Cynthia but she refuses to marry him unless the money is right. On the other side of the tracks convicted killer Hagon Charles Bickford is about to be put to death and offers his body for 10000 so that his kid sister will be taken care of. Cynthia decides to marry the death row inmate so that she can be married on her birthday and since she'll be a widow soon after she can get back to her normal life. The only problem is that after the marriage the real killer comes forward and Hagon is set free.Is that enough plot for you? DYNAMITE features enough plots for about ten different movies and everything I wrote above is just the opening fortyminutes and that leaves eightyseven more minutes of craziness. This is without question an incredibly bizarre film but there's no question that it's highly entertaining on so many levels. One such level is that it's just downright nuts from start to finish and I just sat there watching it in a complete amazement that anyone could actually pull it off.

The problems start when Bickford is freed from prison he has been wrongly accused and enters Johnson's life again. She is at first horrified she has also made a deal to pay off the wife of her lover for a divorce. It all gets quite complicated with Kay Johnson torn between marrying her lover and now a husband she doesn't know. Bickford gives a rough performance as a coalminer far from the wealthy jetsetting life Johnson leads. The film descends somewhat into silliness as these two opposites try to live together. A word about the performances Kay Johnson does an admirable job playing a complicated woman and seems to handle the new sound medium fine. What a shame she never had much of a career. Bickford is good and he would go on to have a long career playing pretty much the kind of workingclass man he does here. Oddly this film is directed by Cecil B. DeMille and it seems to bear no resemblance to his previous epics. Perhaps he was struggling with the adjustment to sound as well. DeMille had gone to the newly formed MGM studio and they were a studio just on the cusp of being the Tiffany of all the movie studios.".

Unlike many films from 1929 it's worth a repeat viewing for the entertainment value not just the novelty of seeing an industry in transition.That doesn't mean that there isn't plenty of an industry in transition on exhibit but rather than inane musical numbers De Mille uses sound appropriately and also employs largely unknown actors from the stage to keep the emphasis on the plot and in particular the relationships. From the hammering of the builders of Hagan Dirk's gallows and the singing of How Am I to Know by a fellow death row prisoner played by Russ Columbo during the wedding scene to the strange aero wheel race at the country club to the playing of a particular song on the radio introducing a romantic moment this film was an innovative technological marvel when it was first released. However technological marvels fade with time and what you do remember are relationships that hit home and are memorable. Many have already stated the outrageous premise of the plot. What is not outrageous and rings true after almost 85 years is how you don't get to pick who you love  it just happens and it can often be most inconvenient and how heroes can be found in the strangest places and in people you would not think would be up to the task.

The film begins with a group of rich jerksthe type who love parties but don't make anything of themselves and have little regard for others. They are smug and superior...and have absolutely no reason to feel superior to anyone. One of these rich jerks Cynthia Kay Johnson is in love with a married jerk Roger Conrad Nagel. Roger's wife really doesn't careall she wants is a good settlement. Here's the rubRoger doesn't have any of his own money and his wifetobe is expected to buy off the wifeotherwise she won't grant him a divorce. While Cynthia is more than willing she cannot as her fortune is tied up in a will with an interesting clauseCynthia can't touch the money until she is married. And she can't marry Roger until there's a payoff. So to get around this Cynthia finds a man on death row and marries himknowing that in a few days he'll be dead. Then she'll inherit the money pay off the wife and marry Roger. So far so good. The marriage goes off as planned but soon a monkey wrench is thrown into the worksa man confesses to the crime for which the guy Charles Bickford in about to be executed! So now Hagon Bickford is STILL married to Cynthia and Cynthia cannot marry Roger until both marriages are dissolved.The scene where Hagon arrives quite unexpectedly on his wife's doorstep is priceless. She has no idea he's not dead and she is about to have a party. Hagon won't leaveas far as he's concerned he IS married! So he stays. And when Cynthia's party guests arrive Hagon is horrified to see that they're all a bunch of worthless jerksjerks who drink and party to excess but otherwise are vacuous idiots. He's so burned up by this crowd that he explodesand throws them out of HIS house!! Although he isn't the least bit apologetic towards Cynthia for doing this he does realize the marriage cannot work and agrees to leave as well as a divorce. So far this is a VERY complicated and unusual plot. What's to become of Cynthia Roger and Hagon? See the film and find out for yourself. There's much more to it and my description only covers the first half of this very unusual film.While what follows is a bit predictable and a bit overly melodramatic for my taste it still is a pretty good filmparticularly for 1929. Most 1929 films have not aged welldue to poor sound quality since sound was so new the people making films didn't know how to use it AND the equipment was lousy. Most of these films are just too stilted and talky. However compared to the films of the day I must admit that DeMille was very very good and the overall product is quite nice. For today's audiences I'd rate it a 7. Compared to other films of the era a 9. So an overall score of 8 seems reasonable. I was particularly impressed because unlike most of the later DeMille films this one emphasized characters and had a lot more depth than his huge spectacles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Veteran director Harald Reinl took the helm for the last three Jerry Cotton films.  Reliable' Reinl was by this time a mainstay in German cinema with Edgar Wallace krimis Dr. Mabuse thrillers and Winnetou westerns already under his belt.  He shows a certain amount of restraint in Death and Diamonds the sixth film in the series over all handling the elaborate robberies with an assured if unspectacular hand.  As the English title implies a diamond heist is at the heart of this entry as Jerry again infiltrates a gang run by a mysterious disembodied voice. This is the Cotton film notable for the uproariously poor English accent that George Nader affects when Jerry Cotton must impersonate alarm specialist Rick Trevor.  Nader must have struggled mightily indeed to sound British without coming across as effeminate but the result rings completely false a major lapse in judgment that nevertheless is highly amusing for the viewer. The bulk of the action in the film is set in southern California a change of pace in the series.  Right off the bat as Jerry arrives in LA to meet the gang we are treated to unconvincing rear projections of the newlycompleted LA airport a highly recognizable landmark.  Part of the reason for the lack of believability in these few scenes is that the filmmakers had a difficult time matching the southern California light with Jerry and company appearing a bit drab next to the harsh desert sun in the background.  We get to see a lot of film of midsixties LA enjoyable in itself including the inevitable shots of the Cascade Car Wash that has graced many a movie and a short but fun collage of LA signage kitsch. One wishes for more glimpses of that vanished art. Another minor quibble with the LA setting is the nightclub used as headquarters for the gang.  The building housing the Green Silk bar is obviously older than Los Angeles itself!  Inside however we are treated to the prerequisite gogo chicks dancing away to the tunes of Peter Thomas always a delight.  Reinl has fun with this bit cutting from a pair of white billiard balls to the jiggling white bikini top of one of the dancers.  We also get to spend a lot of time in the factory basement that has made an appearance in every Cotton film thus far.  We'd miss it if it weren't there. The action and stunts in the film are handled comparatively well in this entry.  The robberies are elaborate in nature and are even commented upon by one of the characters in the film who wonders why the mastermind Stone goes to so much trouble.  The viewer will no doubt feel the same as no answer is in evidence.  The heist that all this builds up to is the theft of a large quantity of diamonds.  The thieves use a highly unlikely method of obtaining the stones a remote control vacuum cleaner.  There's a lot of technical hooey used to gloss over the details of what would most likely be a complete failure.  Reinl does manage to pull off the staging well enough to be forgiven which is quite the feat given the circumstances. Jerry as Trevor balks at every alarm he has to disconnect and is such a nosy whiner in general that one starts to feel empathy with the gang who tire quickly of his antics.  At one point they throw Jerry into an industrial furnace and crank up the heat.  This is a good suspenseful scene as Nader is obviously pretty close to the fires and if he wasn't our hero his fate would seem inevitable.  Not to spoil anyone's fun but how many furnaces have a back door? Later Jerry manages a couple more imaginative but equally improbable stunts.  When several of the baddies are attempting a getaway Jerry manages to jump through the windshield of their oncoming car.  The stunt is impressive enough but Jerry adds much panache by suavely punching the driver after arriving unannounced in the front seat taking charge of the situation without mussing a hair on his head.  A one hundred foot jump from a bridge onto a moving boat sets up the explosive finale of the film.  No wonder Jerry's mom remarks early in the film that the last time he said there was no danger involved he spent seven months in the hospital. To top things off there is a whipping scene in an industrial setting as Mabel Marlies Drager lets Lana Silvie Solar feel the lick of her lash. This actually sounds better than it turns out to be but it is another fun element in a film that doesn't intend to be an exploitation piece. Further fun is to be had in spotting familiar faces including Silvie Solar given more to do in this film than she did in Manhattan Night of Murder 65 Carl Mohner Rififi 56 and Dieter Eppler to name a few.  Eppler was a genre favorite appearing in many of Harald Reinl's films.  Another recognizable face is that of Albert Bessler a regular in mystery films of the time. Interestingly enough Bessler has a cameo in Secret of the Black Trunk 61 a Bryan Edgar Wallace adaptation as an American FBI man!  All in all Death and Diamonds is a middle of the pack entry not without its charm and Reinl was a welcome presence in a previously uneven series.".

And I didn't even mention the womantowoman whipping scene! which is far too short!. George Nader continues to be proficient in the role of Jerry Cotton though his British accent  Cotton is pretending to be a British safecracker for the majority of the movie  is questionable at best. As the icy bad girl delivering the aforementioned whipping Marlies Draeger is STRIKINGLY beautiful  if the movie wasn't so obscure I'd even call her green dress iconic. 12 out of 4.".

This is the first of the Cotton films I've knowingly seen and it was a pretty good little crime caper film with a Euro touch. Clearly the US setting was faked thanks to second unit photography and some laughable rear screen work. Here Cotton is called in to impersonate an English safe cracker who is brought to the US to work for a super criminal named Stone. No one knows who Stone is and Cotton is to find out. Complicating matters and the one weak link plot wise is the fact that Stone is known to kill anyone he works with when they have served their usefulness. Why anyone would work for him knowing this is beyond me but hey it ends up not being that vital to the story. Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon on the couch. I'm actually looking forward to seeing the rest of the films.".

Fortunately one of these poor devils isn't quite dead and tells the police that the killer was Stone and something about a cellmate called 'Trevor' who is about to do a job for Stone. It turns out Treavor is still in prison and is about to be released...and the plan is to substitute Agent Cotton George Nader for the famous safecracker.

Compared to the first the production values are a bit betterwith color film and some nice Los Angeles location shooting. HOWEVER it's obvious that Nader isn't in these scenes and the shots are clumsily back projected with Nader and others acting in front of this screen. It's a very poor system...but even for rear projection this is the worst I have ever seen!! It's worse than the system that was used in The Bank Dick almost thirty years earlier!! The production team should have been embarrassed to use these scenes.The most important parts are the plot writing and acting....so are they any good? Of course. In fact if the production values had just been a bit better the movie would have scored an 8. Quite enjoyable.By the way although I have enjoyed seeing the Agent Cotton films unfortunately not all of them on YouTube are dubbed or even subbed into English.

Larenz Tate isn't entirely convincing as Frankie LymonI guess they just cast him because he's real short.  The concert scenes and TV appearances where he sings are noticeably lipsynched and look pretty cheesy.  But actingwise Tate did a fine job.  Obviously they didn't really delve into his drug addiction to keep with its lighthearted feel.  So we don't get to experience the heavy drama of Lymon's short life.  The actresses were goodHalle Berry Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon.  Their performances were equally effective and amusing.  The great Little Richard has some spirited cameos.  He definitely brought the mood of the film to an alltime high.  I just wish he could've been in it for longer than 10 minutes.  The whole movie basically concentrates on the romanticcomedy portions of Lymon's lifesome true some fabricated.  There were some dramatic moments but they occur mostly towards the end.  But I got a lot of laughs and the film just has a fitfully satisfying upbeat tone.  Of course I LOVED the music.  I have to admit that was one of the main reasons I enjoyed it so much.  Why Do Fools Fall in Love is a moderately loose portrayal of Lymon's life but it makes great entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why Do Fools Fall In Love is an unexpected gem. In the previews it looks like a movieoftheweek bio of a long dead celebrity but this is actually a carefully crafted well acted and visually fascinating film. With films that claim to be based on actual events it is important to consider that those events have been interpreted by a writer director and actors. Whether this film accurately portrays events in the life of 1950's singing sensation Frankie Lymon is immaterial to the success if the film. The fact remains whether truthful or fictional the film is interesting to look at entertainingly written and cleverly constructed.Director Gregory Nava has sculpted the film into a richly intertwined series of flashbacks reminiscences and moments out of pop history. The performance scenes where we see Frankie Lymon before an audience either as a raw kid or as a fading icon are wonderfully integral to the story and not just blatant rationalization of the sound track cd on sale soon at music stores everywhere. Nava allows the innate energy of the music to flow into the film through lively editing camera movement colourful setting and costume. Particularly interesting are the long continuous Steadycam shots and the processing of footage to look like old home movies or 1950's live TV images.Larenz Tate The Postman made an explosive impact early in his career with his role of ODog in Menace II Society and then excelled on the short lived TV series South Central. Here he is considerably reigned in either by the film makers or by his own sense of how Lymon should be played. His performance although capable seems shallow at times and never really delivers any insight to what makes the man tick. The film makers knew that the strength of the story was in the perspective given it by the three women who each claim to be Lymon's widow and entitled to a share in his estate. The character of Lymon as seen from these different points of view is at times childishly naive brutally malicious or tremendously generous and unselfish.The film's best performance is from Vivica A. Fox Booty Call Independence Day who plays Lymon's first' wife Elisabeth Waters. Fox mixes a wry intelligence with a crude and unpolished demeanor to portray the woman who so loves Lymon in the decline of his career that she will work as a prostitute to pay for his drug rehabilitation in a private clinic. The tragic irony of her pouring so much of herself into Lymon's empty shell is that she survives the giving while he can never find what he needs in the taking.The two other wives are played very ably by Halle Berry Bulworth who appears as Zola Taylor of The Platters and Lela Rochon Waiting To Exhale as Emira Eagle. Zola is attracted by Lymon's talent and charisma and is so won over by his sincerity and her own belief in his character that she allows him to destroy all that she has earned as he destroys himself. Emira is the wholesome Godfearing school teacher who finds the committed romantic in Lymon and manages to help him settle into a simple domesticity for a time before the call of his lost celebrity takes him from her in a last attempt to reclaim his fame.The period detail is vivid and slides up and down a continuum that ranges from deliberately romanticized to unbearably sordid. The film makers have wisely avoided the trap of dwelling on Lymon's heroin addiction. There is very little portrayal of the actual use of drugs just an examination of their effect on Lymon and on the lives the women who love him.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was true in the '50s and still is today it's no exaggeration to state that most hitmaking careers are over in 18 months. Teen idols fare the worst and such was the fate of Frankie Lymon who scored but three Top 20 hits between February 1956 and the summer of 1957 Why Do Fools Fall In Love I Want You To Be My Girl both with The Teenagers and Goody Goody as a soloist. After that the industry and music buyers considered him to be yesterday's former fresh face. And like most young teens who become overnight sensations Frankie's fireworklong popularity came to cripple him later as a people would not accept him as anything other than a 13yearold and b he was utterly unprepared to cope with real life once his flash of fame had ended. An insightful peek into Frankie Lymon's mercurial life would have made a great movie  but this isn't it. Instead we get only a superficial look at Lymon as the movie focuses instead on the three women who claimed to be his wife. Lymon does not deserve to be shoved into the background of his own biopic especially as his story is representative of the rise and fall of many flashinthepan artists who find themselves revered by the public one minute and then dumped into history's ashcan the next  often before they really reach the summit of their skills. Believe me  as the writer of The History Of Rock 'n' Roll I know this all too well. The three women battling over his estate were more a footnote to his story than the real drama and far too much time is allocated to letting the three female leads each take a star turn. Yes Zola Taylor was the bestknown of the three but she is portrayed following her run with The Platters as an inthemoney solo star headlining live shows with her giant hit Only You. Are the producers kidding? Zola Taylor didn't even JOIN The Platters until AFTER Only You had become a millionseller! The Platters scored big as the most successful hitmaking singing group of the late '50s 19559 despite the fact that the group was really lead vocalist Tony Williams  with the others as mere background singers. What were The Doors for example without Jim Morrison? Zola only sang lead on a couple of minor Platters chart items  and after leaving the act immediately sank into near total obscurity. The Platters' golden era ended in 1960 after Tony left on his illfated solo career. I explored this in great detail while assembling a 60track Platters career retrospective 3CD box set. None of The Platters really made much money at all  as they were mere salaried employees of their manager Buck Ram. Ram wrote much of their material told them what to sing and how produced their records owned The Platters' name and no surprise kept nearly all of the loot himself. The portrayal of Morris Levy who owned several labels including Gee the recording home of Lymon and The Teenagers was pretty accurate. Not all record labels screwed artists as thoroughly as Levy's did but his methods were none too unusual for the time. In fact they're not much different than what the industry does today!".

However as the title indicates it is really about three women who fell in love ... with a guy named Frankie Lyman.  As the movie brings home fairly early there is not much about Frankie to love. He is portrayed as a shallow selfcentered fool with as little understanding of the music business as of the women he scams into being his wives.  Did Frankie have raw talent?  Of course he did.  Did Frankie do anything to develop this raw talent into an enduring musical career?  No evidence of that.  So much for Frankie.  Larenz Tate plays him fairly well on stage and rather flat off stage.  We are not given a clue as to what the attraction may have been.And since two of the women were relatively unaware of his celebrity status when they were first taken with him and the third had a celebrity status of her own we expect the movie to answer the title question.  The women do not entirely succeed in this but they are terrifically watchable while they try.Halle Berry is great as Zola Taylor singer with the Platters.  Viveca Fox is almost as good as the home girl who turns hooker to support Frankie  and Lela Rachon is perfect as the goodietwoshoes last wife a Godfearing and educated working woman.The music scenes are good and the courtroom scenes are outrageously unrealistic.  This would have been a better movie if they had not specifically based the story on Lyman but only alluded to him.  In this manner the Hollywoodization of the story would have been less noticeable. Unfortunately realizing that such a course would inevitably preclude using the Lyman hits they chose to make this a triography of the wives and allow them to play off Tate's weak Lyman persona.All in all a good couple of hours of enjoyment that is not too compelling.

This deprives one and all of seeing the simple true source of Frankie's problems. Too much fame too fast and too young. Larenz Tate struggles with the role where he sometimes looks more like a young Sammy Davis than Frankie. The singing and dancing sequences are acceptable and Tate brings the music off adequately.The racial issues which the film deals with have some truth but the details are inaccurate. In 1957 audiences in some venues were segregated but in others were mixed and not a problem. The idea that this music helped end segregation is mentioned but not really seen except for the incredible scene of Frankie dancing with a white girl on 'The Big Beat'. This big surprise is very effectively handled and has major impact.I don't think Nava understands doowop or the relationship of the lead singer to the backups. There is a big difference between the Platters essentially a white pop adultish Ink Spots type group and the Teenagers who were rock 'n' roll appealing to those under 21. This just never comes across.Nava does do some clever things pointed out in the director's cut not recommended way too 'Goody Goody' as he uses a continuous roll camera to suck you in and wrap you around the scene he is filming.The attempts to stylize 'Fools' mostly works. The theme of creating the four main characters as Earth Lela Rochon as Emira Eagle Fire Halle Berry as Zola Taylor Water Vivca Fox as Elizabeth Waters as the 3 wives to play off Wind TateFrankie is clever and consistent. The use of scatchy 8MM flash backs is a bit over done but gets the point of flashbacks across.All three of the parts of the wives suffer from being overly dramatic and over actedwith the need to fit truth to the story rather than the other way around.Most disturbing is the handling of Frankie's music. Its hard to tell his solo work from his Teenagers stuff and the sequencing of the music is out of order. At least Nava makes it clear Frankie was not a 'One hit wonder' and he had four years of outstanding singles and not mentioned at all some super albums mostly as a solo. As one of the wives mentions above all he could sing my panties off. If you don't think so play Frankie's version of Why Do Fools Fall in Love followed by the weak sad Diana Ross version.Next time Mr. Gregory Nava when doing an autobiography spend as much time keeping your facts straight and in order as you do with clever stylization.Not recommended unless your a fan of any of the elements involved. Wanna a good music bio from more or less the same period and effectively dealing with drug addiction watch Ray the magnificent Ray Charles story.".

	schema:headline " Accurate Biography? Who knows? Entertaining film? You Betcha!";
	schema:reviewBody "WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE? is a supremely entertaining biopic of the young singer Frankie Lyman which unfolds in a clever variation on the traditional flashback form of storytelling. The film opens with three women arriving at Frankie's former manager's office after his death trying to claim his estate all claiming to be the legal widow of Lyman and it is during the trial to determine which of these ladies is Lyman's legal widow where Frankie's story unfolds. As with all movie biographies you never know how much you're watching is based on fact and what has been enhanced or diluted for dramatic effect. In this screenplay Frankie is a charismatic young singer who apparently had no problem charming women out of their clothes and their money the latter of which apparently went to support his drug habit. Frankie's drug use is somewhat glossed over and the screenplay tends to concentrate more on Frankie's manipulative ways with these three women and how he at one time or another managed to convince all three of them that there were the only women in the world. Babyfaced Larenz Tate plays Frankie with a sincerity and sexiness that possibly oversells Frankie's real womanizing but he manages to keep Frankie likable despite some of the slimy things he does. The three women in Frankie's life are well played by Halle Berry Viveca A. Fox and Lela Rochon with Fox a standout in probably the best performance of her career. The musical sequences are troublesome...Tate works hard at lipsyncing authentically but I never bought the lipsyncing in the film...all of the musical sequences in the film come off sounding canned. Still Tate and the ladies commit to their roles and do make the movie worth watching. I don't know how accurate the film is as a biography of Frankie Lyman but it is a very entertaining film that will effortlessly hold interest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frankie Lymon died of a drug overdose in 1968.As a big one hit wonder with his song Why Do Fools Fall In Love Lymon might have received some royalties from the record but didn't. When three former wives hear a version of the song done by Diana Rossthey want to sue for royalties but first each of the three women must win a court case to prove who was the real and legal wife of Frankie Lymon. The movie Why Do Fools Fall In Love is a shoddy and disrespectful look into the life of Frankie Lymon. The movie is truly about these three women trying to win the royalties of the song not to prove they really loved Frankie Lymon.  It is bad enough that Hollywood makes a movie about a black male celebrity that Hollywood always brings up the details of Lymon's drug use and points to him for the audience that he is a loser after his singing days are over. We never get a true look at Frankie Lymon and his life.Where did the movie fail in one big detail?  Lymon was not as short as the actor who portrayed him the talented Larenz Tatehe grew up to over six feet tall.His singing voice changed of coursehe couldn't sing those sweet songs of his youthbut he had a decent voice in his adult years. But no one wanted the grown up Frankie Lymon.They wanted this little kid with the falsetto voicenot the adult Frankie Lymon and he couldn't get noticed in the new RB market that came to pass in the sixties. His story and the story of his former group the Teenagerswas done quite well in a PBS documentary about the group called I Promise To Remember.This was shown several years ago and it is worth while to look at about what happen to the group where they are nowwhere they were at the time of the broadcastand and what happened to Frankie in truth.It is a well done program. The movie is nothowever.Filled with profanitythe women come off as bitter uneducated jerks only going for the money.The film and the film makers in essence then to degrade the subject as a three timing drug taking failure.The film lowers itself then as the wives complain about Frankie and start the feminist cant about men in general and Frankie in particular.It doesn't bother the filmakers that Lymon's real life family has to watch him being dragged thru the mud and embarrassed and that they have to have him and themselves disgraced in this fashion. The three women got thankfully very little after in the end and the viewers of this film receive the samevery little.Frankie Lymon was not perfecthe was no saint.But this film disgraces him just like Bird did to Charlie Parker.In the end of the film we see the real Lymon singing GoodyGoody on a TV show.It is the only glimpse of the real Lymon in the movie.But after this film Frankie Lymon shall be looked at in one way and one way onlyas a tragic disgrace.".

It is bad enough that Hollywood makes a movie about a black male celebrity that Hollywood always brings up the details of Lymon's drug use and points to him for the audience that he is a loser after his singing days are over. We never get a true look at Frankie Lymon and his life.Where did the movie fail in one big detail?  Lymon was not as short as the actor who portrayed him the talented Larenz Tatehe grew up to over six feet tall.His singing voice changed of coursehe couldn't sing those sweet songs of his youthbut he had a decent voice in his adult years. But no one wanted the grown up Frankie Lymon.They wanted this little kid with the falsetto voicenot the adult Frankie Lymon and he couldn't get noticed in the new RB market that came to pass in the sixties. His story and the story of his former group the Teenagerswas done quite well in a PBS documentary about the group called I Promise To Remember.This was shown several years ago and it is worth while to look at about what happen to the group where they are nowwhere they were at the time of the broadcastand and what happened to Frankie in truth.It is a well done program. The movie is nothowever.Filled with profanitythe women come off as bitter uneducated jerks only going for the money.The film and the film makers in essence then to degrade the subject as a three timing drug taking failure.The film lowers itself then as the wives complain about Frankie and start the feminist cant about men in general and Frankie in particular.It doesn't bother the filmakers that Lymon's real life family has to watch him being dragged thru the mud and embarrassed and that they have to have him and themselves disgraced in this fashion. The three women got thankfully very little after in the end and the viewers of this film receive the samevery little.Frankie Lymon was not perfecthe was no saint.But this film disgraces him just like Bird did to Charlie Parker.In the end of the film we see the real Lymon singing GoodyGoody on a TV show.It is the only glimpse of the real Lymon in the movie.But after this film Frankie Lymon shall be looked at in one way and one way onlyas a tragic disgrace.";

Instead of focusing on the music the film follows the court case of the three wives that Mr. Lymon left behind. Halle Berry Lela Rochon and Vivica A. Fox play the three women with style and humor.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Walter Hill's Undisputed is a great guy's movie. It's a fight movie set in Sweetwater Prison in the Mohavje Desert starring tough guys Wesley Snipes and Ving Rhames. What distinguishes this guy's movie are a couple things the expert and lean direction of Hill the crisp and intelligent script by David Giler and Hill and one of the best boxing fight scenes ever done in the movies.Ving Rhames plays former undisputed Heavyweight Champion James Ice Man Chambers convicted of rape and stripped of his title and sentenced to serve his time in Sweetwater. While there he learns that Monroe Hutchen Wesley Snipes is the undisputed champ at Sweetwater and he has been undefeated champion for ten years. For the Ice Man there can be only one champion and that would be himself. It is predictable that the two will fight at the end and this is arranged by mobster inmate Mendy Ripstein a very good Peter Falk. What is not predicable is that Giler and Hill make both Ice Man and Monroe admirable and fascinating characters. You have to credit Rhames and Snipes. Rhames takes what could have been a Mike Tyson caricature and transformed him into a complex and empathic character. His Ice Man is vicious crude arrogant but also both smart and articulate. Credit Rhames on several occasions for scaring us with the ruthlessness of his Ice Man and for also surprising us with his understanding of his stature in life as a Heavyweight champion. Ice Man is definitely the more showy character. Snipes underplays it right as Monroe a great foil to the Ice Man. Snipes's Monroe is not afraid. Monroe knows that Any fighter can be beat on a given day... and the game is how long you stay on top and be the best. Monroe is matter of fact and always in control the last time he wasn't got him in prison. Ice and Monroe are both convicts that operate by a code of honor and that makes all the difference in the movie. It's all about standing your ground and whoever wins wins. Undisputed also is an homage to boxing and it's history because ultimately it is about two men seeing who is better on that particular day. There is something pure and whole about that which is both appreciated and respected.The final boxing match is awesome. Snipes is an accomplished martial artist and he trained with Emmanuel Stewart. Snipes looks amazing as a boxer body movement and combinations. Rhames also looks very impressive and fearsome. It's a 15 minute fight in a 90 minute movie. Walter Hill is the Man.Undisputed is a no nonsense boxing movie that entertains and makes us think. And that is not bad for a very unpretentious movie.".

	schema:headline " Two sets of genres are run together clichs and all in a film that has little substance but just enough energy and style to make for a distracting piece of entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "When heavyweight champion of the world James Iceman Chambers is found guilty of rape of a showgirl he is sent to a new prison in the Californian desert where they send all the more unsavoury prisoners to avoid contaminating those only convinced of lesser crimes. However there already is an internal boxing contest within the prison and it already has a champ of over 10 years  Monroe Hutchens. Keen to establish who's is bigger Iceman shows him up in front of the other inmates. To avoid a riot the warden puts Monroe in solitary while Iceman continues to tough it out in prison. As his expensive legal team prepare an appeal and defend all sorts of other actions elderly mobster Mendy Ripstein starts pulling the strings to put on the only fight anyone wants to see  Monroe v Iceman.Starting with a solid 15 minutes of style and energy I wondering if the film would be able to keep the pace up but despite turning it down a little bit the film does essentially keep moving with energy and style right till the very end. And it is just as well because there isn't really any substance to talk of in this rather noisy affair. The main character is essentially the writer's take on Tyson but the film doesn't really do anything more interesting with it that just hang the suggested similarities out there  Rhames may occasionally try to express something deeper than this but the material isn't there to help him. As it is though Hill's direction and manner of keeping the screen busy and the camera moving helps inject life into what is really just a cross of clichs from sports movies and prison movies. It had enough to it to engage and entertain me without ever threatening to stick in my mind for much longer than the time it took to watch it.The cast do a lot to help the impression of substance by providing lots of faces who put in effort. Rhames is a solid lead who does his Tyson impression well without ever lifting the material. Snipes matches him on this level by producing a simple performance but adding an impressive physical presence to the proceedings. The support cast are not all used that well but are essentially an impressive collection of well known faces who do add a sense of quality even if it doesn't deserve it. Falk was a strange but enjoyable find while Rooker Seda Studi Stevens Lover and others all fill in around the edges.Overall this is a fairly vacuous affair that gets by on huff puff energy and style and just about does it well enough to provide a distracting film without doing anything great. Two sets of genre clichs are pushed together and delivered with energy by Hill and his impressive cast and while it isn't anything special it should at least provide brainless filler for 90 minutes.".

I was watching it with friends and we were wetting ourselves laughing by this point. I think the whole film was made on a budget of about 500 and this was probably spent on the helicopter flight near the beginning.The Icing on the cake is probably the climax of the film The Big Fight. The Prison rap group singing the USA National anthem was Hideous what was everyone thinking as they filmed that ?? We had to fast forward that bit it was so poor. The fight goes on with possibly the worst audio dubbing I have yet to hear in a film Both fighters with limitless energy and not a bit of blood on either face even after getting smacked in the face about 300 times each.All in all a ridiculously obvious plot if you can call it that with every cliche in the book thrown in.

As soon as a character is introduced BOOM a rap track starts and we see a caption giving the characters name  their crime and date of sentence . One can't feeling that this young director wanted to include a flashback scene but possible litigation by HBO stopped him . The real bad news is that the director of UNDISPUTED isn't a young hip director who has potential  the director is Walter Hill and it's obvious his career is in free fall as he bombards the audience with all types of choppy MTV effects This wouldn't be so bad if there was a great storyline but the script doesn't even reach being mediocre and it's really quite bad . Heavyweight champ James  Iceman  Chambers is sentenced to 6 to 8 years for rape  Gosh I wonder who that could be based on ?  and the prison Mr Fixit Mendy Ripstien arranges for Iceman to go head to head with prison champ Monroe Hutchen . I take it Ripstien is Jewish ? And he's sentenced for tax evasion ! Hey don't worry about clichd stereotypes or anything like that . Oh and despite being a maximum security prison Mr Ripstien has friends who are white  Latino and African American . Even Hutchen has a colleague who's white . Hey anyone who wants to see what a success American ethnic diversity and multiculturalism is really must get themselves sentenced to some serious time in an American maximum security prison where everyone respects one another and never judge anyone on the colour of their skinI suppose the laughable unreality of a melting pot inside an American prison stops everyone noticing the rather poor casting choices in this film . I notice Ving Rhames is very often filmed from the chest upwards and rarely takes off his shirt . Is this because the audience won't be fooled into believing a 42 year old man with a fair amount of flab is unconvincing as a heavyweight boxing champ ? I think it might . Wesley Snipes is well buffed but it's painfully obvious he's far too short to be considered a heavyweight and in reality he'd only be a middleweight in boxing terms . That said I doubt if the audience will be able to connect with either fighter anyway since one's a rapist and the other is a murderer so why should we be cheering on either man ?".

The final fight which is I think no spoiler since every boxing movie ends with a big match was thrilling you wouldn't know until the end who was actually going to win which is rather unrealistic but also inevitable for a movie that considers itself as action and also wants to entertain the audience. My big problem with the movie were the characters. Not only are they onedimensional we don't even learn too much about them. It is like and that might be the movie's intention life only takes place in prison everything what the human individuals have been before they were sent to jail now doesn't count anymore. That's actually a nice concept but not if the only solution to achieve this aim was to avoid giving the characters any background. The protagonists remain without soul we never get to know whether they are good or bad whether they committed their crimes and whether we are supposed to feel for the one or the other. Who is the antagonist in the movie? Is it the one who is supported from all the prison inmates and guards who is undisputed in the prisonfightsystem or is it the one who shouldif the outside world ever should learn about the fight and maybe even not if have the public's support who is undisputed in the normal boxing world. both have their pros and cons and only the outcome of the fight made me know who I could have thought of as the good guy since he won. My problem was I liked the other one better. But that was just me and is up to anybody else since this movie really lets you make your choice on your own. And again A good idea A boxing movie where both fighters are illuminated the audience learns to know them both and both have the same screen time. Imagine we would have learned about Drago's degradation by the military of becoming a boxing slave for them. But both characters remain flat and really likable is none of them. That was a pity since you could notice that this was no rushed movie there was a good concept and a good though rather shortan actionplot and great names  Ving Rhames and Wesley SnipesIt's worth watching the movie just to see them on screen together. But all in all there is something missing what could have made this movie great. Part II has that something but that one is dumbbut it's more violent and the action sequences are also due to that maybe even betterthough it's no boxing anymore what I found stupid since the first was nothing but a boxing movie.".

The plot obviously is based on a parallel universe where Mike Tyson got into lots of fights while in prison and in which there are plenty of underground jail boxing matches.Most action oriented movies lack some degree of originality which is forgivable under certain circumstances.  The first is if the characters are interesting.  In this case the characters are very one dimensional each portraying basically one emotion or trait.  The most depth any character has is Snipes' who is the typical tough guy with a creative side.  The second way an action movie can redeem the lack of originality is by having good action sequences.  In this case the majority of action scenes are that new fangled shaky cam.  If any director is reading this NO ONE LIKES THE SHAKY CAM.  We like to see what is happening.  There were a few brief moments when it was basically clear what was going on but generally not.  Another way to save an action movie is to have plenty of action...  In this case there was one main fight a couple of flashback fights and a few one punch fights. Not enough to make up for the lack of plot characters or quality.All that being said it can't be said this movie was terrible.  There were a few good moments and sparks of quality but overall the effect was unimpressive.  One nice idea was that neither Snipes not Rhames played particularly good people.  Snipes plays a character who is basically neutral.  He definitely isn't good but not truly bad either which is the only truly redeeming quality of the movie.For fans of the actors the movie might be worth seeing.  For fans of boxing there are a very few redeeming scenes.  For everyone else wait for it to come out on video.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a pretty boring jailboxingflick yah what a word! that features very little story uninteresting main characters and a concept that focuses purely on the boxing aspects and forgets basically everything else.There is one big problem with this movie it's two main characters played by Wesley Snipes and Ving Rhames. Both are boxing professionals who got convicted one for murder the other for rape. Seems like the Snipes character got somewhat based on Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter and the Rhames character obviously on Mike Tyson. But fact is that both are tough criminals who obviously are no choir boys. They are not really portrayed in a likable way and you just don't know who to cheer for. My guess is that it was the movie its intension to make the Snipes character the more likable one but he's portrayed in an incredible unsympathetic way and quite honestly I would always rather hang out with Ving Rhames than with Wesley Snipes no matter what crime he committed. The movie features of course other characters of which some got portrayed by some good and well known actors Peter Falk Michael Rooker but you just don't ever care about any of them and most also feel rather pointless within the movie.So yes the main characters are a problem but so is its story. Basically all the story does is build up to its inevitable end fight. It's makes the movie predictable but boring as well since basically very little else is ever happening in the movie.Walter Hill was once a new promising action movie director but with movies like this he shows that he sort of has lost his touch. It's a very clichd made movie that features all of the ingredients you would expect from it. The already bad and uninteresting story gets also told in a bad and uninteresting way within the movie. He tries to give the movie some style and pace but it really doesn't work out too well.Normally I'm still quite fond of boxing movies but this movie just has very little redeeming qualities. The movie just doesn't offer anything new or exciting to watch. The boxing matches within the movie aren't exactly anything adrenaline pumping also because you already know in advance how they are all going to end.Not really recommendable...410".

I understand that movies ask you to suspend your disbelief but I was hardly expecting a fantasy movie when I popped this one into the DVD player. Honestly I really had a hard time sitting through the movie just because of the way that it portrays prison life. Ving Rhames should've been shanked at least 50 different times. The holes in the prison story aside this movie still leaves much to be desired. I found it laughable that the ringside announcer called one of the fights the best fight that I have ever seen! because right before he said that I was thinking these boxing scenes are worse than Rocky. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of the Rocky series but let's be honest the boxing scenes were very unrealistic. Well Undisputed took that unrealism to new heights. I rated this movie a 2 only because I CAN think of maybe 20 movies that were worse. If you read this before you ever watch this movie take my advice don't.".

	schema:reviewBody "I got knocked up side the head on one side and slammed on the other. Undisputed' was a knock out.  This movie is what I like to call 'bada'. A little too convenient in some parts but as a whole this movie delivers a solid punch.Ving Rhames is the former undisputed Heavyweight Champion James Iceman Chambers convicted of rape stripped of his title and sentenced to serve his time in Sweetwater Prison. Sweetwater Prison?  What is that all about? I guess we will never know.  Once inside Chambers learns that Monroe Hutchens played by Wesley Snipes is the undisputed champ at Sweetwater. Hutchen has been the undefeated champion for ten years. As far as the James Chambers is concerned there can be only one champion and that would be hi m  The Ice Man and he is out to prove it.I liked Wesley Snipes' portrayal of the Monroe Hutchens.  He had an interesting split personality of a ruthless fight to the finished brusher that had an interesting calmness about him in situations that he knew he could not fight his way out of.Ving Rhames' character was just strange to me.  He continues to maintain his innocence throughout the movie just like a good prison character. However his demeanor is anything less than admirable.  With Ving Rhames knocking people around proving that he is the strongest baddest hardest hitting sledgehammer walking the face of the earth you can not help but hope that he gets a major butt kicking.I must clue you in on the happy little surprise character Marvin Bonds played by Ed Lover.  I love Ed Lover ever since back in the day of Yo Mtv Raps when Mtv used to play music videos.  His colorful officiating is just as hard hitting as the boxing.  The final box match is brought to a hilt by the stylistic banter of the 'Lover'.Undisputed is a full bodied entertaining hardnosed flick that will stimulate your mind as well as your emotions.  Go see this before it slips away. That's my word for what's on the screen.".

After all it's not just about boxing and prison it's about boxing IN prison.The plot is pretty simple  The Iceman Ving Rhames is the unbeaten heavyweight boxing champion who has been convicted of rape.  Does that sound familiar?  Monroe Hutchens Wesley Snipes a former ranked boxer who lost his temper and beat his lady's boyfriend to death 10 years ago is the unbeaten champion of the maximum security prison in the Mojave Desert to which the Iceman is assigned to serve his sentence  or at least until his expensive lawyers can get him out.  Naturally the two must meet to decide who will be the Undisputed champion.  Meanwhile Mendy Ripstein Peter Falk an aficionado of the sweet science and oldtime mobster who because of his wife's allergies left Florida  where they know who's who  for California  where they don't  and fell afoul of the tax authorities plots to make a killing betting on the fight.You can guess who wins but that's hardly the point.  The enjoyment in the movie comes from its execution which is stylishly handled by veteran Walter Hill who moves things along at a fast enough pace that you don't have time to dwell on the prisonmovie cliches  this place owes more to Oz than to any real prison I suspect  and the occasional hyperbole.  Was it really necessary to weld the door shut when Monroe is sent to solitary?  And do inmates anywhere still bang their cups and do the Big House Chant?  Holy Jimmy Cagney.Rhames plays his part with plenty of mean mother style and even a little pathos Snipes is adequate and Falk is hilarious.  Fisher Stevens playing a very seedy arsonist who acts as Monroe's manager leads a solid supporting cast.Warning  this being a boys' movie you may find your audience offputting. When I saw it the boys jeered whenever the alleged victim appeared on screen to tell her story.  She seems quite credible and sympathetic but of course the Iceman contends she really wanted it and made her accusations merely to score and as he says when you can fight people love you. Well some people do and as shown by the case of the fighter on whom Iceman is obviously based they're willing to give a chance to a man who can fight which they wouldn't give to any ordinary criminal.  If this breezy piece of escapism has a point that would be it.".

A series of locked off shots where a train not visible at first enters frame goes all the way through and leaves frame.

The variations between the trains themselves are fascinating as well so by the end this becomes a study of the nature of perception as much as anything. Benning also adds context over a few of the images by adding audio clips from the past Eisenhower's famed militaryindustrial complex speech a snatch of 'This land is your land'. While some have understandably criticized these sound bites as too intrusive and too on the nose to me in such a strange context they worked wonders opening my mind up to the films' possible bigger meanings trains as an instrument of imperialism as a symbol of destruction of the environment as a great equalizer that made long distance travel possible for the masses. Plus lets face it trains are simply cool to look at. Something about their power size history makes them almost mythological presences in themselves.".

The movie was inappropriately funny or unfunnybadly written and directed. The only redeeming feature where the really cool creature effects helmed by CoDirector Steve Wang.Then came Guyver 2 this time helmed by Wang and it has to be one of the best sequels ever made. It stays more true to the comicfeaturing some very cool monsters and some brilliant fight scenes choreographed by Drive action director Koichi Sakamoto which Steve Wang also directed.It seems Wang wanted to be as faithful as possible to the original comic and he does it very well. One thing worth mentioning is a good acting turn by the voice of Solid Snake David Hayter who plays the role of Sean Barker a role horribly done by Jack Armstrongwho? in the original.The story is better written in which Sean struggles with his curse that is the Guyver.Although the acting is very hammy at timesWhat do you expect for a scifi bmovie I recommend that people wanting to find out about The Guyver best watch the original anime show then view this live action version before viewing the first movie.I also recommend you pick up the Region 1 uncut DVD as it presents the film in all its gory glory.".

	schema:headline " Low budget does not hinder this entertaining intense and brutal adaptation of the cult manga hit";
	schema:reviewBody "Three years after the dismal joke of a movie Guyver we are greeted with a second attempt at bringing the mildly popular manga to into live action with the movie Guyver Dark Hero a loose sequel of the first guyver movie. For starters I am really glad that the film rights to Guyver has passed into more competent hands. Gone is the campy feel and laughable story of the first film replaced with a more competent script and a serious science fictionaction feel that still threads the line of B movieness but is careful to not fall headlong into the category of silly.Needless to say Guyver Dark Hero is a highly enjoyable and entertaining adaptation of the beloved manga series and is easily one of the better live action adaptations of manga in existence today. I believe it was a good move on the part of the producers to leave out the convoluted intergalactic backstory elements like the 13 Zoalords the Lost Numbers Hyperzoanoid teams etc. All that would have just confused the heck out of the audience who already would have trouble following the single backstory of the Guyver units' origins in this movie. Instead they left this story as down to earth as possible wile still keeping the more crucial elements of the guyver mythos. In Guyver Dark Hero the plot sees Chronos organization dispatch a team of Zoanoids to infiltrate an archaeological dig and excavate an ancient alien space craft which contains technology related to the Guyver. On face value the storyline may seem rather simplistic to some. But upon subsequent viewings it is actually quite a well written tale. The main character of Sean Barker is played very close to his manga counterpart Sho Fukamachi with only some Slight differences in his name age and more realistic and mature approach in dealing with the responsibilities that come with possessing the violent power of the Guyver unit. Sean discovers that the Guyver seems to bring out the most violent side of him which leads to a tendency for uncontrolled indiscriminate killing. That and his constant obsession with taking down the Chronos organization which was thought to have been destroyed in the first Guyver movie but Sean believes otherwisehas left Sean Barker without any friends all alone in the world. He is afraid to get close to anyone since he is still a target for Chronos and he fears he may accidentally hurt those he cares about should the Guyver's violent side manifest. The second difference is that unlike Sho who seems to fine with the violent tendencies and highly destructive powers of the Guyver Sean Barker chooses to use the Guyver merely to augment his own fighting skills only giving in to his savage violent side and using more destructive force when absolutely necessary. He is given ample character development in this movie and ends up coming across as a very likable character in the end. David Hayter turns in a strong performance as the main protagonist and masterfully portrays the part of a reluctant individual cursed with an alien power that he would rather have not have. Sadly the rest of the cast does not fare as well. Aside from David Hayter's role as Sean Barker the rest of the characters are not much to write home about. They are boring two dimensional stock characters which might turn off some but I can safely say that the manga itself was just as much laden with the usual teenager and villain stereotypes commonly seen in such genre of comics. Some may go so far as to call it corny but this movie is no less corny than the manga and anime OVA that preceded it. Steve Wang's credentials as a special effects and design supervisor are evident in the impressive amount of realistic detail given to the creature costumes. The zoanoid and guyver costumes are a huge step up from the previous movie. They look quite good for a 1994 production. Steve Wang does an adequate job as director here nothing revolutionary to wow the audience but nothing painfully boring either. Despite the low budget of the film I heard it was barely 900000 he still manages to make the most of it and delivers one hell of a viewing experience this show manages to look better than some other movies with more than 10 times the budget.The high point of this movie is definitely the fights. Violent fast paced brutal and inyourface. Skulls are crushed throats are slit eyeballs are blasted out of their sockets and bloodletting is at an all time high when compared to other tokusatsu genre shows like Kamen Rider Power Rangers or Ultraman. The fights are beautifully choreographed with slick martial arts moves and intense wire stunts with minimal camera tricks or gimmicks like slow motion. It amazes me how the stunt people were able to pull off such acrobatic martial arts moves while wearing such intricately designed and most likely heavy suits. Do not let the low budget of this movie put you off watching it of Guyver Dark Hero is proof that a low budget movie can still be a highly entertaining piece of work when left in competent hands with a little fanboy dedication thrown inSteve Wang is a huge fan of tokusatsu movies like Ultraman  . Though this film is by no means perfect and would not stand up to being compared to more recent big screen comic book adaptations it is quite good considering its age technology and budgetary constraintsand seriously deserves more than its current IMDb rating. It keeps very faithful to the look feel and spirit of the original something so many other live action adaptations lack while presenting a fresh perspective on the Guyver mythos.".

The Japanese Guyver never worried about killing bad people or is he turning into a monster. That's the whole American thing about killing is wrong even to save your own butt and that's just crazy talk. But enough about that let's see what else. Ah the script follows close to the script of the anime like the first movie. The broken Guyver unit situation is cool. It's basically a good movie besides the whole dark hero thing. 9 STARS!".

The story line is more original and intellagent and it has the seriousness deserved rather than that early 90's slap stick humour fad.  Come on its cool on The teenage mutant ninja turtles but not a Guyver movie! Guyver 2dark hero is a huge improvment to the original but unfortunatly still fails to live up to the manga series. The key word is budget.  This movie could had been a scifi masterpiece but suffered because its budget was only 1 million dollars. Saying this the Special FX and Guyver and zoanoid suites and the ancient alien space ship look really good!  And this movie does not look cheap and I was pretty surprised when I found out it was made under 1 million. However it does show at times. The guyvers suite has dramaticly changed from the first movie and is a bit of a lessor effort.  It doesn't look metalic.Again don't be predijust against this movie!  Give it a try. Its hard making a cheap scifi action movie and this did very well in terms of quality and style.  But to a fan its really not good enough. When you compare it to the manga and comics.this movie has FX action GuyverZoanoids and an ancient alien space ship. It has it all and is worth the watch but don't expect a flick like Predator!  But I would give this movie credit for being one of the best comic books into movie translation and the first one being the worst.I am surprised a sequel was even made after the failure of the cinema release for the first Guyver movie but I'm glad they did. This would had been perfect if it had the budget of the first movie but still had the story of the second. This is great for teens and manga guyver fans but there is still allot of room for improvments.7 out of 10".

The action scenes sucked and the evil zoanoid were passed off as gremlins or power ranger villans. The movie ended in a REALLY crappy fight scene. Guyver Dark Hero the second movie was surprisingly better however. Both Guyver and the zoanoids look a lot better in this movie the fight scence are actually pretty cool mostly because the zoanoids actually have mobility now. The plot was a bit darker not quite as dark as the anime but darker. The most surprising thing though was that the acting actually improved a bit. Now the lead is played by David Hayter who some of you might recall as the voice od Solid Snake. Anyway this was a good bit of fun that was just ready to be spun off into a regualar series.

He looks like a very young and generic 90's man. He looks like someone that would have appeared in the TV series 90210. This movie was directed by prop maker Steve Wang and the fights and stunts were done by a Japanese stunt team that used to do stunt work for the power rangers japan.So the fight sequences look a lot like a power rangers episode but imagine it to be more like a Rated R power rangers. And that concept alone is worth watching this movie. There is some over the top violence. But its not disturbing. And its a short film. As a matter of fact i miss action films like this. In my opinion this film has better fantasy kung fu fights than the Matrix.I feel i can recommend this to The Evil dead crowd. The film sequences are over the top.

I was however a little surprised at the beginning credits to see Starring David Hayter. Again some of the dialog was not so good but I feel it was a really well made movie.";

It's a lowbudget movie with some seriously bad acting David Hayter seems to have about 4 facial expressions in the movie. So why do I find it so appealing.Admittedly I bought this movie on the basis that it starred David Hayter.

Well it's just a fun movie. Though a lot of it is actually quite cheesy especially the dialogue there's nothing like a good old scifi movie with martial arts.People can't deny that some of the fighting in the movie is quite cool. However the DVD I had lost about 10  15 minutes from the original film so some of the better fight scenes and gore was removed.That's what probably did the worst for the movie. For a Bmovie it was great but since the DVD lost a huge amount I didn't get the full story... Nor did the story seem to make any sense. Despite that shortcoming enough was there to give you the basics.Conclusively the score may suggest the movie is only average and it is to some extent but really it's just a movie full of fun.".

Surely any Power Rangers criticism is more applicable to that first film with its campy dialogue and fight scenes sillylooking creature designs and overblown ending battle. While it hits a surprising number of plot points from the source material it's a bad movie.Guyver 2 still has some goofy Zoanoid designs mediocre acting and distorts the relative strength of human Guyver and Zoanoid to keep a human fighter from becoming scenery and to keep the Guyver from plowing through too many rubber suits the movie couldn't afford. But it takes itself more seriously and employs some Hong Kongstyle wire work and just a little CG to show you why the Guyver stands above the Zoanoids. This film too covers many major plot points from the manga comics taking some liberties to bring together elements of the very beginning and very end of the comic's U.S. release and provide a satisfying ending battle.Dark Hero makes just one direct reference to the preceding film that might justify a viewing. But if you followed the comics closely enough to be interested in the movies you'll get it anyway and can spare yourself some suffering. Guyver 2 is a much improved film with some solid cult film qualities and enough substance to bring in fans of the Japanese original as well as the folks who stumble into decent Bmovies channel surfing through evening cable.610".

	schema:reviewBody "For all intents and purposes Guyver Dark Hero is a fairly competent and oftthrilling adaptation of the popular Japanese source material created by Yoshiki Takaya back in 1985. It boasts plenty of action cool creature designs and blood by the bucketful. And as a followup to the generally disastrous 1991 release The Guyver Dark Hero is most definitely a substantial improvement eschewing the comedic stylings and slapstick humor that plagued that film and replacing it with darker imagery and a more violent tone. In my review of the first American film I noted that I almost viewed the franchise as being an adult version of properties like the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers a claim I'll stick to. And this movie delivers on that kitschy promise for the most part despite a clunky and sometimes unsatisfying storyline.It's been one year since Sean Barker David Hayter bonded with the alien Guyver unit and destroyed the vile Cronos Corporation. But Sean's personal life has suffered due to these events... His relationship with Mizki has come to an end and he is plagued by haunting dreams and the bloodlust that the Guyver brings to him as he uses it to fight crime. When he learns of a recent archaeological dig that has unearthed strange remains and cavepaintings appearing to depict the same symbols he sees in his sleep he sets off to discover the truth behind the Guyver unit along the way encountering a beautiful scientist named Cori Kathy Christopherson and learning that his Zoanoid enemies are still out there... waiting to strike back.What makes this film work in comparison to the previous effort is the dedication returning director Steve Wang has to craft a tale true to the darker and more adult tone of the original manga and its earlier anime adaptations. Wang clearly listened to the fanbase and its general dismissal of that 1991 original and decided to reward those who stuck around with a proper Guyver story. And thus the rating has been upped to a hard R the action is made far more brutal and hardhitting and the comedic overtones have been greatly reduced giving the entire experience a more serious flavor. While it is true that this sequel has a greatly reduced budget and was released directtovideo in 1994... these factors really don't have all that big an impact on the final product. It's wellmade with excellent fight choreography a wonderfully moody score and excellent effects work for the most part.I also felt the performances benefited greatly this time with the new cast. David Hayter famous for being the former lead voice actor in the Metal Gear Solid videogame franchise makes for a very cool and troubled brooding protagonist. Sure he's not the world's greatest onscreen actor but he gives Sean a nice sense of pathos and also knows how to kick some serious butt. What more could you ask for? Supporting roles by the likes of Christopherson are generally wellplayed. And villainous roles are all adequately cast including Bruno Patrick as a deliciously vile cretin of a baddie.All that being said... the story is nothing to write home about and it does drag the movie down a bit. I don't know if its because of the reduced budget or because they were afraid to try doing too much but the plot is just generic and pretty darned unsatisfying at the end of the day. We've seen stories like this told better a million times before. Sure you could argue that the story was never the main focus of the franchise but it was still vital. I used to own the entire twelvepart OVA series based on the manga and it did quite a bit with the setting and the characters. But this movie just feels like any 90's scifi action schlock flick. You know what's gonna happen. You know the twists and turns that are coming from a mile away. And there's no surprises at all.It all comes down to this. Guyver Dark Hero is not a great film. I don't even think you could make a compelling argument that it was even particularly good. But it is fun. It is entertaining. And it does nail the tone and the spirit of the original source material. If you're looking for the definitive adaptation of the characters and the story you won't get that here. But if you're just looking for a halfway decent time and a pretty entertaining little film to enjoy you could do far worse. The strong action darker tone and halfway decent performances definitely make this one I could recommend. Especially if you're a fan of the series. And so I give Guyver Dark Hero a very enjoyable but only slightly above average 6 out of 10. Great entertainment value. Soso film.".

Shakti Samantha's direction R.D. Burman's choreography of songs and majestically soothing cinematography by Gopi Krishna made Kati Patang a toast for the eyes and a sublime stimulant for the spirit of audience.

Rajesh Khanna plays true the man scorned by a love he has never seen and falls again for a maiden whom he isn't likely to get either. The songs alone channel the story through its pathway and the climax well  is not unlike so many other Hindi movies around. Prem Chopra a true Hindi villain and Bindu the budding vamp is just the right touch for any ole Hindi Classic.".

	schema:headline " Great Dialogue by Vrajendra Gaur Music and Performances in Kati Patang";
	schema:reviewBody "Kati Patang is a big hit from the 1970s and its success was purely on merit. Rajesh Khanna and Asha Parekh teamed for the first time in Kati Patang and the result was some powerful performances and great screen chemistry between the two. After Aradhana Shakti opted for Asha Parekh despite his regular Sharmila Tagore. Asha Parekh takes the place of her dead friend and starts living with her in laws in her friend's identity. She is a widow. Rajesh Khanna falls in love with Asha Parekh and Asha hesitates to reciprocate his love thinking as to what the society will think and say. She is framed for murder by Prem Chopra and Bindu and how Asha with Rajesh Khanna's help comes out of the frame up forms the climax of the story. She eventually marries Rajesh Khanna. Its a lovely film and the film engrosses the viewers for its entire length. The music is superb with all the songs being hits. The highpoint of the film is the dialogs by Vrajendra Gaur. The dialogs are hard hitting sensitive and heart warming. VRAJENDRA GAUR is no wonder one of the most gifted dialog writers of the Hindi film industry. His sensitivity came through in his dialogs and he penned dialogs for films like Sharmeelee Lal Paththar Anuraag The Great Gambler Dulhan Wohi Jo Piya Man Bhaye Geet Gaata Chal Teen Deviyaan etc.etc. I became his greatest fan after watching Kati Patang. The contribution of the versatile Gaur is very big in making Kati Patang a classic hit. Very few know that Shakti Samanta was Vrajendra Gaur's assistant in the only film directed by Gaur called Kasturi. Gaur passed on all the subsequent offers to Shakti and returned to his first love writing. He subsequently wrote most of the films made by Shakti. The dialog penned by Vrajendra Gaur in innumerable films will always be remembered as they make us value the true worth of great dialogs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rajesh Khanna and Asha Parekh as the lead romantic pair  are quite endearing in this combination of a little romance mystery villainy and cabaret numbers plus wonderful music with meaningful lyrics and this otherwise commercial movie  succeeds in engrossing you in it's plot line. Film's casting with Prem Chopra as a woman chaser cheating two timing villain Bindu as a vamp and a cabaret dancer with that famous number which includes a dialogue Tumhara Nam kya hain ya Madhu and Rajesh and Asha in their hey days is satisfactory. even Nassir Hussein as the fatherin law in love with his grandson and compassionate to his widowed daughterinlaw who is actually an imposterby the strange twist of destiny caused by an unfortunate train accident  delivers a sensitive performance . This movie is pleasant on the eyes too with it's cinematography and shooting of outside locations of a hill station covering beautiful lakes and greenery around the place where the story takes place. Asha is a good actress and her performance as a torn young woman between her love towards Rajesh and realization of the unfortunate role of a widow that she has to enact in a prestigious wealthy family is really touching. Rajesh  in his usual stylized mannerisms and some everlasting songs by kishore Kumar for him to enact on the screen is adorable. Dialogues are wellwritten and poignantly delivered . However if only we overlook the clichd situation that Rajesh was the one to whom Asha was supposed to be getting married and elopes for the love of Prem Chopra who is a bad man in the story as well as the train accident The fatherin law who hasn't seen the girl to whom his son was married before and Asha entrapped in a situation to abide by the oath that she would take care of that orphaned baby etc. and finally the truth dawning on her that it's Rajesh whom she had wronged unwittingly but loves him now deeply the movie is a pass. This movie made a fairly good business at the box and most of the songs are still fresh in the people's memory. it also indicates to the problem of young girls eloping from their homes and landing in trouble eventually. The idea of widow remarriage wasn't acceptable even then as one can observe from the attitudes of the older generation shown in this movie. Worth watching at least once !".

He had just gone to the house  mounted on a horse  only to know that the bride had run away  so he went back home  never bothered to look at her picture also! Call it decree of fate  Rajesh gets drawn to the widow Asha was pretending to be a widow remember and eventually they get married! Wow! Happy ending!Conclusion  Bollywood tried to make the Indian females understand that they may sleep around with just anyone who catches their fancy  coz. eventually they will get married to the Hero! The daft category of females are still trying the funda outand causing misery to themselves as well as the society!!So a woman can forget her 1st love after all  see Asha did forget all about Prem Chopra na....so chill!! esp. for the dumb girls who cling to a single love affair all their life and live is sheer misery!".

He had just gone to the house  mounted on a horse  only to know that the bride had run away  so he went back home  never bothered to look at her picture also! Call it decree of fate  Rajesh gets drawn to the widow Asha was pretending to be a widow remember and eventually they get married! Wow! Happy ending!Conclusion  Bollywood tried to make the Indian females understand that they may sleep around with just anyone who catches their fancy  coz. eventually they will get married to the Hero! The daft category of females are still trying the funda outand causing misery to themselves as well as the society!!So a woman can forget her 1st love after all  see Asha did forget all about Prem Chopra na....so chill!! esp. for the dumb girls who cling to a single love affair all their life and live is sheer misery!";

Moreover it is true that the Swiss Academy Awards are practically unknown outside of Switzerland.Although Dllebach Kari belongs to Frh's social dramas this movie is remarkably different from his movies from the 50ies and 60ies like Hinter den Sieben Gleisen or Es Dach berem Chopf It concentrates not on a family but on one single person whose role in life it was to make people laugh about his jokes before they were laughing at him. Dllebach was born with a socalled hairlip and was thus the target of derision and scorn both from his customers and from his colleagues. So he made a clown out of himself in order to cheat himself making himself believe that people laugh about his jokes rather than about his handicap. However as a colleague of mine once said Nobody can stay through his whole life on the shadowside of the street. This is the topic of the famous score of this movie written composed and sung by Mani Matter 19361972 who has about the same value in Swiss life like Johnny Cash has in the US. Mani Matter tells in his song that Dllebach Kari told his jokes so long until he could not invent new ones anymore  and then rather ended his life instead of setting himself out to the big laughter.

In fact she was so irritated by this theme that she went on strike to try to force the studio to give her different roles. But considering that the public loved the films and they were all very successful MGM wasn't about to mess with a triedandtrue formula.This film is at least a little different in that much of the time men were destroyed when they fell for Garbo in this film but she was never directly responsible for their downfall. She was more like the old Typhoid Mary charactersomeone who just seems to have bad things follow her where ever she goes! The problem with this is that no matter how sultry and alluring Ms. Garbo might have been no one is THAT seductive that man after man after man destroy themselves in order to try to get her! However the story does have a few new elements and the overall production values are exceptional. So if you view this film WITHOUT considering how derivative it is then it's an awfully good film.By the way the TCM DVD includes an alternative ending that was apparently used when the film was shown in rural settings. Instead of the marvelous original but sad ending that in my opinion is perfect there is an upbeat and sappy one that just doesn't ring true.".

It also has some good set pieces created by directors Fred Niblo andor Mauritz Stiller which liven up the story considerably. The supporting cast also features a couple of good performances and all of the strengths help to make up for a rather downbeat story.As The Temptress Garbo is certainly believable as a woman who attracts the attention of every man around. What makes it more interesting than most such scenarios is that both the script and Garbo's performance leave some ambiguity about what the character is really like inside and in any case she has a lot more depth than the male characters. The best supporting performances come from Lionel Barrymore and Marc McDermott as two of the many men who desire her.Several sequences are filmed very nicely. Fontenoy's dinner party is an effective display of the hollow lifestyle it depicts and there is some real danger and menace in the fight scene between Robledo and Manos Duras. The pace overall is uneven and it does have some slow stretches that add unnecessarily to the running time but the good parts make up for this. At least one DVD version includes a variant ending that changes the tone considerably so there must have been some uncertainty about how it should close.Garbo's talent and screen presence are both easy to see and in later features her characters would give her better opportunities to show them. She does a very good job here and makes her character much more interesting than it would have been with a lesser performer in the role. Overall it's a movie worth seeing for silent film fans with some real highlights that make up for the occasional shortcomings.".

Niblo definitely deserves more credit for the fine work he did bringing Ibaez's story which I admit I haven't read to the screen. Its opening tinted blue has a scene of revelry reminiscent of the ending of the French classic Children of Paradise. In that movie Baptiste is hampered by the crowd as he runs toward someone and in this movie Elena is hindered as she runs away from someone. Finally making it outside Elena enters into a scene that's so well choreographed and so evocative of a fragrant exhilarating spring night that I have played it again . . . and again . . . and again much as one would listen to a favorite song. And indeed the music certainly enhances the mood of the scene not just here but throughout the film.To my surprise even my son's teenage friends who had never seen a silent film said they found this movie interesting and did not want to watch something else. I guess it helps that there's plenty of action as well as beauty in this production along with a bit of levity. What more can you ask for? Wellwritten intertitles perhaps? Well you have them in the words chosen by Marian Ainslee who likes to punctuate with a heavy dose of dashes. You also get a wallop of a message delivered when you don't expect it and events that are hard to predict. OK so the villain's expressions are overdonethey're no worse than the broad gestures screen legend Douglas Fairbanks employed. And OK maybe the banquet scene could have been cut just a little. But the other dinner scenewhere Elena enters like a piece of Limoges among earthenware potsis so entertaining it seems to end too soon. Another part of the movie is quite touching I will always remember this there were tears in my husband's eyes when Elena doesn't say I love you.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE TEMPTRESS MetroGoldwynMayer 1926 personally directed by Fred Niblo from the novel by Vicente BlascoIbanez stars Swedish actress Greta Garbo in her second Hollywood production following her American debut in THE TORRENT 1926 and the first to place her name on top of the casting credits. As with her MGM debut Garbo plays a girl of Spanish origin this was the last to do so and like so many films that were to follow especially during the silent era and early talkies she would portray a woman usually unhappily married who satisfies her emotions with illicit affairs finding the one man she truly cares about and destroys those around her before reaching bottom herself committing suicide or both.

After removing their masks they fall in love under the stars. Later when he comes to visit his friend Marques De Torre Bianca Armand Kaliz Manuel is stunned to learn that his wife happens to be Elena. At the dinner party Marquis Fontenoy Marc MacDermott a middleaged banker permitted by Bianca to have Elena be his mistress in order for them to be financially secure distracts the guests by making a startling speech on how Elena the temptress has ruined his life and dropping dead at the table after taking his drink of poison. Disgusted by the ugly truth Manuel decides to forget Elena by leaving for the Argentine where he accepts a water dam building project. Just as Manuel is slowly forgetting Elena she arrives with her husband and by doing so causes frustration and destruction to both men and others as well with Manuel who feels she to be responsible for the murder of his friend and husband as well as the near destruction of his dam dynamited by his enemy finds he still cannot resist her.The supporting players include Lionel Barrymore as Canterac one of the construction workers who falls victim to Elena Robert Anderson as Pirovani the friend Canterac kills because of Elena and Virginia BrowneFaire as Celinda the pretty young girl who silently loves Manuel. Adding to sin and destruction is Roy D'Arcy as Manos Duros the bandit leader in a menacing performance as Manuel's arch enemy who after forcing his intentions on Elena is challenged by Manuel to a duel with the bandit's method being the use of whips. The bull whip duel is one of the high points in the story resulting to whip scars on the bare torsos covered with blood as well as Manos who fights dirty aiming for the eyes being quite graphic for its time.THE TEMPTRESS an important project that helped advanced the screen career of Greta Garbo at long last premiered January 24 2005 on Turner Classic Movies cable channel accompanied by a new score composed by Michael Picton. Scoring a silent movie is challenging as mentioned in the half hour special that preceded the movie and minutes into watching THE TEMPTRESS the result of Picton's work is satisfactory and rewarding. In spite the fact that host Bob Osborne announced THE TEMPTRESS as making its world television premiere it actually did play on television but many years ago. THE TEMPTRESS was one of the selected 13 silent films shown weekly on the public television series in commemoration of MGM's fifty years titled MoviesGreatMovies WNET Channel 13 in New York City from August to October of 1973 hosted by Richard Schickel movies accompanied by an an orchestral score and in the New Jersey area as part of the 1974 series Films of the Gatsby Era with same movies different hosts on WNJM Channel 50. THE TEMPTRESS which premiered in New York City August 13 1973 made its final TV run on WNET in May of 1978 as part of the double bill five week movie tribute to Garbo and Katharine Hepburn. Schickel as did Osborne talked about how Garbo's discoverer Mauritz Stiller started out as the film's director but due to complications during production was replaced by Fred Niblo. The information regarding THE TEMPTRESS remains the same with the exception of its time length. When shown in the 1970s the running time was about 114 minutes. TCM's print runs at 105. But regardless of its length possibly due to projection speed THE TEMPTRESS is a welcome addition to the TCM lineup and well worth viewing again after many years or the first time ever. While THE TEMPTRESS belongs to Antonio Moreno whose name is almost forgotten today it owes its success to the temptress herself Greta Garbo which is the sole reason for its rediscovery. ".

As with her MGM debut Garbo plays a girl of Spanish origin this was the last to do so and like so many films that were to follow especially during the silent era and early talkies she would portray a woman usually unhappily married who satisfies her emotions with illicit affairs finding the one man she truly cares about and destroys those around her before reaching bottom herself committing suicide or both.

Ibanez as a source proved beneficial for Valentino THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APPOCALYPSE but not for Garbo. For most of the film she just stands around and does what she is good at enticing men to make fools of themselves over her  and wouldn't you know it they then blame her!  Her weakling husband sells her to a banker who ruins himself for her and commits suicide.  The husband is shot by a bandit.  Two friends of the main character vie for her and one kills the other.  Our hero keeps vascillating he loves her but hates her for ruining men's lives.She like most women of her type lived as best they could  in a man's world a plaything she survived as a courtesan securing jewelry for her support.  Yes she is weak but she is not to blame.The second half of the film is set in the Argentine where our hero has gone to build a dam which the villain blows up but which our hero rebuilds.Garbo does have one stunning outfit  a slinky black thing edged in white ermine with an orchid pinned over her right breast.Garbo DOES get to act but only in the last sequence.  Back in Paris a successful architect Antonio Moreno encounters the fallen Garbo who drunkenly does not remember him I meet so many men.  It is of course a lie but one to make him forget her.   Mistaking a fellow drunk for Christ she gives him a ruby and wanders off into the sunset.  Garbo is quite fine in this sequence but it is the only thing of value in the film which is turgidly and boringly directed by her mentor Mauritz Stiller who was fired from the project part way through and Fred Niblo who completed it and got sole credit.The cinematography contains two interesting silhouette shots an amusing under the table sequence at a dinner party where men and women's legs and feet engage in some risque flirting  and the ubiquitous MGM long banquet table tracking shot  we'll see it again in ANNA KARENINA not to mention a number of other MGM films.This one plays on Turner Classic Movies occasionally and is worth catching for Garbo alone.  It has never been released commercially on video one of only three Garbo silents which have not  we wonder why.".

	schema:reviewBody "For Greta Garbo's second film under her new MGM contract the studio went back to the same source that they got for her first film with them Torrent. Vicente Blasco Ibanez offered up another of his novels for Garbo The Temptress. Greta's got a whole lot of the men panting after her in this one.Blasco Ibanez also gave us the slightly more familiar Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse and Blood And Sand which served Rudolph Valentino well during the silent era. Garbo's character of Elena has a lot of similarity with Dona Sol in Blood And Sand. It ends a lot worse for Elena than for Dona Sol.Garbo is married to Armand Kaliz who is not above peddling his wife's charms to get ahead. Right now she's got the wealthiest banker in Paris Marc McDermott in tow but he means nothing to here but a cash cow for the husband. Who she really likes after meeting him at a costume party is Antonio Moreno an engineer from Argentina who is looking for investors in a dam he wants to build.After McDermott commits suicide when he's facing ruin and names Garbo as the one responsible to escape until the notoriety dies down Garbo and Kaliz go to the Argentine Pampas and visit with Moreno. The local bully and bandit leader Roy D'Arcy takes one look at her and likes her and knows she's available in the right conditions. That sets up all the action for the remainder of the film.Garbo's performance in The Temptress certainly assured her of a long career which was only briefly interrupted by the coming of sound where MGM took superb care to see that their investment transitioned smoothly. She is seductive and alluring in The Temptress like she was never before or since even in her torrid film with John Gilbert Flesh And The Devil or in Mata Hari which calls for seductive and alluring like it calls for breathing.Moreno was one of the first players to be known as Latin Lovers and he was about ending his career in those roles and would be transitioning to character parts. Roy D'Arcy as the bandit chief registers the best after Garbo. He had that Snidely Whiplash thing down pat and the silent screen certainly called for those overacted gestures. His career would continue in sound but not as successfully. His duel with the whips with Moreno is as savage an encounter between hero and villain as you'll ever see on film.The Temptress after over 80 years holds up well. For Garbo fans everywhere.".

This movie is silent and large white subtitles are superimposed telling us a snippet of what is being said. But the actors are also very animated in their delivery of lines and watching their body language is also important. Most of the lines would be considered cheesy by today's standards.This was Greta Garbo's 8th movie. Filmed when she was only 20 her character is Elena and whom we figure out quickly is the Temptress of the title. In Paris she meets Robledo Antonio Moreno 38 an Argentine engineer they dance and he is smitten. He tells her she is the woman he has waited all his life for. She tells him that she has no other man. What she fails to mention is that she is married and has a rich lover Fontenoy already on the side.

That evening at a big dinner party wealthy Fontenoy exposes his affair with Elena tells everyone he is going broke and kills himself with poison in his drink. Elena and her husband become news. Robledo cannot understand how she could profess to love him when she already had a husband and a lover. He travels back to the Argentine to build a dam.Disgraced in Paris Elena and her husband travel also to the Argentine a pretty big country but happen to pull up right into the small village Robledo was in. A thug Manos Duras gives them trouble there is a fight Robledo prevails injured. The two men and Elena seek to live in harmony in the Argentine.An interesting movie for Greta Garbo. I had only seen her as a more mature woman and didn't really understand why she was considered one of the great beauties in the history of film. Now I know. As a 20 year old she was simply spectacular. That comes across even in this old black and white film shown on the TCM network. The story itself is overly melodramatic but that was what was required for the period it was made for.".

Superb.And some running shots with horses and a wagon are worthy of the best of John Ford.Then one particular action scene a duel is as exciting and surprisingly graphic especially for 1926 as one could hope for.Still overall the story is somewhat dull and it's told often dully.If it weren't for the chance to watch movie history including early Garbo and the action scenes and the often interesting direction and photography it might not be worth watching.But it is especially the new version at Turner Classic Movies with a new score by young Michael Picton. Maestro Picton might well turn out to be a new Elmer Bernstein who has  it pains me to say  passed on but who was one of the greatest composers of the last 100 years.".

Superb.And some running shots with horses and a wagon are worthy of the best of John Ford.Then one particular action scene a duel is as exciting and surprisingly graphic especially for 1926 as one could hope for.Still overall the story is somewhat dull and it's told often dully.If it weren't for the chance to watch movie history including early Garbo and the action scenes and the often interesting direction and photography it might not be worth watching.But it is especially the new version at Turner Classic Movies with a new score by young Michael Picton. Maestro Picton might well turn out to be a new Elmer Bernstein who has  it pains me to say  passed on but who was one of the greatest composers of the last 100 years.";

I'm not a Garbo fan and some of her films are really hard to enjoy by today's standards of filmmaking and acting but this one is watchable enough even though it drags occasionally.It's gorgeously photographed and Garbo is given the royal camera treatment. In fact she's treated royally by everyone except the man she loves who discovers too soon that in matters of love she has a strange code of conduct. Well worth viewing if you're a fan of Garbo's films. Otherwise you may not make it to the finale since it's rather overlong for such a simple story.Handsomely produced. Antoneo Moreno is interesting in the male lead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always thought when you see scenes of masquerade balls how silly it is that those little carnival masks that only cover the space round the eyes are implied to genuinely disguise the wearer and that whole plot turns have even been based on the premise. Of course it's a different case when the scene is in The Temptress and the wearer is Greta Garbo.The Temptress Garbo's first topbilled Hollywood role opens at a masquerade. A big deal is made of the moment in which she unmasks before Antonio Moreno. Now anyone who knows Garbo will have recognised her already but it is only when that small piece of felt is removed that we are stunned by the full force of her astonishing beauty. This tiny instant alone guaranteed her stardom.But Garbo was not just a pretty face. Far from it she was also one of the finest actresses of her generation and one of the first truly great naturalistic performers of the silent era. For someone who was famed for her introverted and solitary nature offscreen Garbo certainly knows how to kiss with authenticlooking passion. Throughout it is not simply her looks which captivate us it is her commanding screen presence. Her role in The Temptress is a perfect demonstration of her abilities simply because she is a fairly passive player in most scenes often in the background while others talk or fight over her. And yet with this limited scope she conveys so much realism and intensity.The Temptress was directed by Fred Niblo a veteran filmmaker who was even older than DW Griffith. Despite his age Niblo's work never looked oldfashioned and The Temptress displays his competent handling of the more fluid style of the latesilent period. He has a great sense of atmosphere and rhythm and gives each segment of the picture a consistent feel. The opening scenes in Paris are surreal and dreamlike with lots of slow dissolves in those days an effect done incamera so definitely the work of Niblo and not the postproduction team and softfocus. By carefully controlling background movement he makes the shots by turns nightmarish and heavenly. The later scenes in the Argentine are characterised by stark realism with a good standard of naturalism from the extras and lots of neat little shots that add nothing to the plot but plenty to the tone such as the dog snatching a corncob out of a boy's hands.Among Niblo's real feats of genius are the ways he introduces characters. Garbo gets no less than three startling entrances. First in the aforementioned unmasking scene Garbo removes her mask in an overtheshoulder shot so we see Moreno's reaction before we get to see her face for ourselves. Later when Moreno finds out she is actually his friend's wife she appears in the distance so we can't be certain it's her. Then as realisation dawns she is suddenly right before us in closeup. And later still when she arrives in Argentina our first glimpse is of her feet descending from the carriage  again a tentative teasing entrance  before slowly panning up to reveal her face. Another character treated to a neat introduction is the bandit Manos Duras played by Roy D'Arcy who appears first as a shadow on the door.This mention of Roy D'Arcy brings me onto my next point  it's not all about the Garbo or the Niblo. There are some pretty impressive performances all round. D'Arcy himself is one of the few slightly hammy actors in The Temptress but this is acceptable because we can believe that a character like Manos Duras would deliberately project this exaggerated persona. He gives the very unsettling impression of a man who tends to win not because he is particularly powerful but because he has no fear and is very much aware that he inspires fear in others. Antonio Moreno is one of many mediocre lead men of the silent era who went on to become an unheralded supporting player in the sound era. This is among the best of his lead performances although for a great example of his later work check him out as the old Mexican in The Searchers. Honourable mentions also go to Robert Anderson who plays Pirovani with great warmth and Lionel Barrymore who for once plays it with some subtlety.The only real trouble with The Temptress is its story being a misogynist melodrama based on a Vincente Blasco Ibanez novel. Ibanez seems to have been a popular plot source in the 1920s especially at Metro he was also the original author of Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Blood and Sand Mare Nostrum and Torrent but his appeal is somewhat hard to fathom these days. And from here on Garbo ended up getting typecast as the selfcentred golddigger over whom men shoot themselves and each other. At the very least though Garbo's beauty and allure makes her appearance as that kind of woman plausible. And while the chauvinism of the times presented such stories as retellings of the original sin myth with the beautiful woman ruining the world Garbo is able to give dignity to the character and paint her as a deeply tragic figure. With Garbo this temptress is a victim not a villain.".

The villain as portrayed by Roy D'Arcy is ridiculous he is ready to go to a carnival parade and does not remotely look menacing as probably Blasco Ibez described him on his book.Even with those flaws it is interesting to compare the story with the tangos that were composed in Argentina at the time.Garbo's character is tragic figure and the men who would either die or kill for her are quite as pathetic as many people described in tangos.With all of its flaws this film is worth watching and perfectly reflect many clichs that were frequent in the Argentina of that time. The music score specially composed for TCM by Michael Picton was very good although the results would have been much better adopting contemporary Argentinean folkloric music.The alternate ending featured in DVD obviously produced for Argentina unlike what Mark A.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie has flaws but one of them is not an old fashioned attitude toward women. The opening quote says God and man created woman. That is to say our perception of women is from men's point of view. But this film presents a beautiful woman from her own point of view and the film's. We see a woman not only bearing moral blame for the actions and choices of men but also being prevented from a fulfilling life by her beloved's obsession with his own desire. The most telling line Garbo has in the film begins something like They don't want me they want my body. And they don't care about my happiness. It is for their own. And indeed not one man in the film sees her as anything but a fulfillment of his own desire even the Moreno character capable as he is of great heroism and dedication. He remains a run of the mill guy when it comes to women. She has no existence as a personality for any of these men. In the end our hero is left to deal with his conscience as Garbo's character emerges as the only one in the drama with real substance. Look at Ibanez's biography and at his progressive sensibilies which both of the film's directors apparently shared.".

But the test of time shows something more optimistic and within the variety of opinions and MGM targets of the 1920s THE TEMPTRESS is overall not that bad as a movie... The CONTENT...Marked by spiritualreligious references at the beginning and at the end from Rabindranath Tagore the first nonEuropean Nobel laureate to Jesus Christ the Saviour of the world who died for love and manifests his presence in the people in need the content is visibly the product of MGM studio system and its methods goodness vs evil clash that uprights the hearts love that conquers hatred and reconciliation that overcomes vengeance. As it is quite a common theme for films of the time I would highlight more the technical aspects of the movie some of which appear to be more convincing and more appropriate in this relation. The TECHNICAL MERITS appear of course thanks to the people Garbo liked and worked with.The direction by Fred Niblo famous for his silent BEN HUR but also for a later Garbo film THE MYSTERIOUS LADY is a subtle work filled with stylish moments and delicate as well as thrilling handling of scenes. Although he replaced Stiller her sole tutor and companion whose style was quite remarkable but different from what they did and understood in Hollywood she must have felt pretty comfortable under Niblo's direction as she left him a touching note after the work had finished. The lighting by William Daniels a crucial name of all Hollywood Garbo films boasts of truly remarkable moments. The effect is no lesser than in greater films in particular when filming Garbo's face. Consider the scene at the mirror for instance...indeed most of what we see of Garbo and her acclaimed performance for the camera we owe to Daniels. He captured that essence of her sensitivity to light and shadow as portrait photographer Sinclair said Garbo 'feels' the light. And...production by Irving Thalberg perhaps he did not play that role as in later cooperation with Garbo but undeniably prompted the energy and unbelievable possibilities from the inside of the Swedish Sphynx. As a result Garbo's portrayal of intriguing Elena is worth appreciation.And here arises a tricky but a logical question So why isn't THE TEMPTRESS considered to be a significant GARBO SILENT FILM? First Garbo is the best vamp in FLESH AND THE DEVIL second her best leading man is John Gilbert one of the most famous pairing the screen has ever seen third the most 'exotic' and arousing locations are in WILD ORCHIDS fourth Garbo's most magical moments are in A WOMAN OF AFFAIRS fifth the lighting pearls are in THE MYSTERIOUS LADY particularly its 'candle sequence' sixth THE TEMPTRESS was not viewers' first fascination with Garbo because her Hollywood debut is not THE TEMPTRESS but THE TORRENT. So... this film has been bound for years to negligence nothing special for many. However it occurs to be undeserved and unfair...Antonio Moreno is not bad as her leading man...has his moments at least some of the supporting cast do fine jobs including Lionel Barrymore as Canterac who appears years later in a specific talkie with Garbo GRAND HOTEL some scenes can boast of brilliant camerawork just to mention the witty and visual banquet at Fontenoy's or the presentation of the Argentine many moments can boast of thrill including the Argentine fight between Robledo Antonio Moreno and the wicked Manos Duras. Except for many clichs noticeable in the film which certainly lower its value it is important to consider such atmospheric scenes like the masquerade.Although detested by the main STAR of the film by the leading lady who was unique and brilliant at multiple levels THE TEMPTRESS is not so bad. Garbo alone helps us get rid of some sophisticated expectations from the content. As a matter of fact more of her films do not boast of particularly clever content...yet EVERY Garbo film is worth seeing because of her tremendous presence on the screen the unforgettable magic and something really special which she offered the cinema of her time and the cinema of all periods. See this silent film AFTER you have seen hypersensual FLESH AND THE DEVIL subtle A WOMAN OF AFFAIRS refreshing THE SINGLE STANDARD innovative THE KISS stunning THE MYSTERIOUS LADY but allow yourself at least a single viewing of its beautifully restored DVD version.

	schema:headline " The Temptress is a standard silent drama with a riveting lead actress";
	schema:reviewBody "he Temptress 1926 is a standard little romantic melodrama the kind of silent film that you find on any silver screen in any town in 1926. It's packed with super stars  directed by Fred Niblo costarring Antonio Moreno Lionel Barrymore Roy D'Arcy  and it possesses one thing that your standard romantic melodrama of 1926 did not  Greta Garbo. To say that The Temptress only her second American film outing stars Greta Garbo is an understatement. This movie exists solely for Garbo to give us all the opportunity to indiscriminately stare at her for 106 minutes.The plot of The Temptress is a bit convoluted. Manuel Robeldo Antonio Moreno spies Elena Garbo at a Parisian masquerade ball and the two pass an idyllic night in a garden where they fall madly in love Hollywood style. So you can imagine Robeldo's surprise when he drops by the house of his pal Marques De Torre Bianca Armand Kaliz and meet's Bianca's wife  Elena! Next a seriously ticked off Robeldo attends a dinner party thrown by Parisian banker Fontenoy Marc MacDermott. It's a delightful affair until Fontenoy proclaims that he has been bankrupted and ruined by his terrible shevixen of a mistress  Elena!Now a super seriously ticked off Robeldo disgusted by Elena yet still secretly lustful blows town and returns to the Argentine where he works as a brilliant engineer on a megadam building project. But wouldn't ya know it  Elena trails him to the Argentine and sets about destroying every man in sight. Canterac Lionel Barrymore  Pirovani Robert Anderson bicker over her leading to a tragic shooting. Badman bandito Manos Duras wants her too and Robeldo has to beat him in a whip fight. When Manos returns to shoot Robeldo he shoots Bianca instead. Then Manos assuages his seriously damaged ego by blowing up the dam and flooding the village. So that's one suicide one whip fight two murders and a catastrophic dam failure laid at the feet of one temptress. Which brings me full circle to the point that Greta Garbo is The Temptress. You can drive a truck through the holes in this most unlikely plot but because the temptress in question is the ethereal and beautiful Greta Garbo it's still believable. As I was watching this story unfold I was running every actress of the day through my head trying to think who else could have pulled off this role and I came up empty. Cause the thing is and this is important Elena is pretty much a cipher in this movie. She doesn't really do anything. She just is. And no other actress I can think could be remotely plausible in provoking suicides murders and village floods just by showing upAs a title card in The Temptress informs us God makes men and women make fools. Being of the gender in question I happen to think men do a fine job of making fools of themselves  but I digress. Simply put Elena is beautiful and elegant and tragic. She's not a Theda Bara kind of vamp nor a Mary Pickford kind of innocent but rather some weird blend of the two. Her eyes may be mysterious pools in which men drown but as Ringo Starr said It's just me face. In the ultimate showdown between Elena and Robeldo she tells him that men desire her Not for my happiness but for theirs. Yes Elena is painfully aware of the destructive effect she has and so after Robeldo finally submits to his love for her she steals away in the night. Get it  she sacrifices her happiness for his. Elena and Robeldo do meet again many years later in the streets of Paris. Elena is broken shabby and homeless. She pretends to not know him and sacrifices yet again. In 1926 this ending was way too harsh for MGM studio execs. An alternate happier ending was supplied and theater owners were offered the choice of ending to screen depending on audience tastes. Turns out American cinemas mostly went for the upbeat end to the tale while European audiences were just fine with doom and gloom. Which pretty much confirms everything we know about the divergent developments of US and European cinema.In short The Temptress is a pretty okay movie but starring an amazing icon of silent and beyond cinema. Greta Garbo alone is worth the price of admission though Fred Niblo brings solid direction to the table too. There's little that's innovative in the presentation but the Fontenoy suicide party does feature a remarkable shot of the overlong party table that elegant demonstrates the excess and debauchery that broke the man. It's followed up by an equally remarkable examination of the seedy sexual underbelly of the party demonstrated by multiple examples of undertable footsy. As a matter of fact the Parisian scenes  the masquerade the dinner party  are far more visually arresting but far briefer as well than the Argentine sequences.".

The film boasts a brand new score written by Michael Picton of New York winner of TCM's fifth annual Young Film Composers competition.The film begins with Elena Garbo meeting and falling in love with Robledo Antonio Moreno at a masquerade ball in Paris. They spend the night together in a park declaring their love for one another he giving her a ring before departing. The next day Robledo calls on a friend the Marquis de Torre Bianca Armand Caliz. Evidently Robledo has been working in Argentina and had just returned to town. The Marquis introduces Robledo to his wife which to his surprise is Elena. He is disillusioned and upset. Wanting nothing more to do with her he leaves.Elena and the Marquis have been invited to a party thrown in her honor by a banker named Fontenoy Marc McDermott. Seated around a large dinner table Fontenoy at the head of the table with Elena on his right stands and proposes a toast. It will be his last as he launches into a diatribe against Elena labeling her a temptress blaming her for his financial ruin he drains his glass which he had previously filled with poison and collapses on the table.Back at their home the Marquis who had encouraged his wife's affair with Fontenoy informs Elena that he too is overwhelmed with debt. Distraught over the incident and the departure of Robledo she empties her jewel box giving all that she received from Fontenoy to the Marquis. Robledo arrives to comfort his friend and tell him that he is returning to Argentina. As he is leaving Elena tries to convince him that she really does loves him but he doesn't and departs.When Robledo returns to Argentina he receives a hardy reception from the whole town especially associates Canterac Lionel Barrymore  Pirovani Robert Anderson. We learn that these men have escaped their financial troubles and women back home by traveling to this remote country to spearhead the construction of a dam. Their efforts are being stalled by a local bandit Manos Duras Roy D'Arcy and his men.Low and behold the Marquis shows up to visit Robledo and he has brought Elena. He tells Robledo he had no choice since she financed the trip. Elena dresses formally for dinner and every other occasion showing up the local shoeless women and entrancing all the men. Manos who observed her arrival comes to Robledo's one evening to serenade Elena. Though up to this point Robledo had shown nothing but disdain for her he fights Manos to protect her honor. Even though they use whips with which Manos is a master Robledo wins. After which alone with Elena as she tends to his wounds Robledo denies that his actions were a sign that he loves her. And Manos still seething from his loss in the fight returns to shoot Robledo but kills the Marquis instead.Free from marriage Elena has distracted the men. Robledo's associates Canterac and Pirovani have even forgotten about their women back home. One night the town throws a party in her honor during which Canterac kills Pirovani with his sword over Elena. Manos who had not lost sight of the larger fight of stopping the foreigners from completing their project chooses that night to dynamite the dam.There are some pretty good special effects given the year of the film and some exciting action sequences as Robledo and the men try to repair the damage before it floods. However they are not successful and a tired nearly drowned Robledo returns to find Elena. Though at first he tries to kill her he finds that he cannot and with his resistance low he succumbs declaring that he is beaten and that he does love her. As he sleeps and though she had insisted to Robledo that she had never used the word love with anyone else she leaves him with a note telling him that she will not be his ruin.Six years later the dam is completed and the engineer Robledo is back in Paris being lauded for his success by a crowd of people his fiance on his arm. As they are climbing into a cab however Robledo sees a women in the crowd that he thinks is Elena. He follows her finding her in a cafe where he buys her a drink. He is surprised that she doesn't seem to remember him and soon leaves. Elena then has a vision that a man across the cafe is actually Jesus Christ halo and all. It is then revealed that she has kept Robledo's ring the one he had given her that first night they met. She gives to the man and the film ends with her walking away alone down the street.".

Apparently somebody made a movie about the first incident and it is this movie that infects a new building filled with badlydubbed Italian actors.The makeup effects are quite good and the demons pretty unsettling. I'd say this movie is on par with the original Demons largely because it is almost exactly the same movie. This is a pretty brutal movie. None of the humorous subtext that you'd find in the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels Scream or most other modern horror movies. Nope. Just a bunch of people desperately fighting to survive and not doing a very good job of it. They aren't all stupid either....they do try. Unfortunately the screenwriters arranged it so that all the windows are unbreakable and the electric doors unable to be opened.The movie also breaks some horror movie taboos as children were surprisingly made into victims.On a lighter note I would also say that this is the first horror movie I have ever seen barring AntichristSecond Coming filmsin which a  character goes into labor while fighting demons.An entertaining horror movie.....Never looked at my watch once.".

	schema:headline " Uneventful retread of the first film";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Lamberto Bava and producer Dario Argento quickly responded to the international success of DEMONS 1985 with this sequel. Abandoning the downbeat open ending of the original film this followup merely repeats the scenario rather than continuing it. Sadly the end result is a film that one would expect from sequelmoney hungry producers rather than the original film's creators.The biggest flaw with DEMONS 2 is the complete lack of logic. I know it sounds crazy to say that about a film featuring slime spewing demons but hear me out here. A television program featuring young kids searching for demons not the same film featured in the first one is merely on and then a demon jumps out of the TV. While you can see the filmmakers trying to replay the original design with a different medium they ultimately fail. The original despite its loony scenario at least presented a more reasonable explanation. The demon plague is spread by a movie theater customer being scratched by a mysterious mask and not by some demon merely popping out of the screen. Not only that but this sequel never thoroughly addresses what happened in the original film. The voice over on the television show hints that demons appeared in the world for a few days but no one in the film addresses it. It is as if the events from the first film never happened.The script also alters the demon mythos to cut plot corners. For example the demons now apparently spurt acidic blood shades of ALIEN that burns through the floors and conveniently kills the power in the apartment complex. If this lazy script writing weren't enough the entire situation is taken from David Cronenberg's superior SHIVERS aka THEY CAME FROM WITHIN.The filmmakers also make the huge mistake of teetering towards the laughable by including a demon child and demon dog which wins the award for least convincing transformation of the 1980s. It is truly embarrassing. These inclusions coupled with a phony pint sized demon straight out of a GREMLIN rip off really push the film into the bounds of ridiculousness. Sergio Stivaletti reprises his role as FX coordinator and provides the requisite demons transformation highlights such as teeth falling out and talons popping out under fingernails. The film also features the world phoniest barbell.A few familiar faces pop up from the first film. Pasqualino Salemme who was one of the punks in the first film pops up briefly as a security guard. And Bobby Rhodes memorable as Tony the Pimp in the original appears here as gym instructor Hank a different but equally managerial character. As with the first film he gets all of the film's best lines. Also of note is Coralina Cataldi Tassoni as the bratty birthday girl turned lead demon Sally. She maintains a steady energy despite being covered by layers of make up and slime. And in a bit of trivia the film also marks the theatrical debut of Argento's daughter Asia. No doubt this exposure to horror at an early age prepared her for working with Vin Diesel.".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Lamberto Bava and producer Dario Argento quickly responded to the international success of DEMONS 1985 with this sequel. Abandoning the downbeat open ending of the original film this followup merely repeats the scenario rather than continuing it. Sadly the end result is a film that one would expect from sequelmoney hungry producers rather than the original film's creators.The biggest flaw with DEMONS 2 is the complete lack of logic. I know it sounds crazy to say that about a film featuring slime spewing demons but hear me out here. A television program featuring young kids searching for demons not the same film featured in the first one is merely on and then a demon jumps out of the TV. While you can see the filmmakers trying to replay the original design with a different medium they ultimately fail. The original despite its loony scenario at least presented a more reasonable explanation. The demon plague is spread by a movie theater customer being scratched by a mysterious mask and not by some demon merely popping out of the screen. Not only that but this sequel never thoroughly addresses what happened in the original film. The voice over on the television show hints that demons appeared in the world for a few days but no one in the film addresses it. It is as if the events from the first film never happened.The script also alters the demon mythos to cut plot corners. For example the demons now apparently spurt acidic blood shades of ALIEN that burns through the floors and conveniently kills the power in the apartment complex. If this lazy script writing weren't enough the entire situation is taken from David Cronenberg's superior SHIVERS aka THEY CAME FROM WITHIN.The filmmakers also make the huge mistake of teetering towards the laughable by including a demon child and demon dog which wins the award for least convincing transformation of the 1980s. It is truly embarrassing. These inclusions coupled with a phony pint sized demon straight out of a GREMLIN rip off really push the film into the bounds of ridiculousness. Sergio Stivaletti reprises his role as FX coordinator and provides the requisite demons transformation highlights such as teeth falling out and talons popping out under fingernails. The film also features the world phoniest barbell.A few familiar faces pop up from the first film. Pasqualino Salemme who was one of the punks in the first film pops up briefly as a security guard. And Bobby Rhodes memorable as Tony the Pimp in the original appears here as gym instructor Hank a different but equally managerial character. As with the first film he gets all of the film's best lines. Also of note is Coralina Cataldi Tassoni as the bratty birthday girl turned lead demon Sally. She maintains a steady energy despite being covered by layers of make up and slime. And in a bit of trivia the film also marks the theatrical debut of Argento's daughter Asia. No doubt this exposure to horror at an early age prepared her for working with Vin Diesel.";

	schema:reviewBody "Followup to Demons I  an extremely violent and horrifying film that spawned several sequels and imitations  here the Nightmare Returns . While in original picture the scary events occur when selected at random  people on the street are invited to an advance screen of a new horror movie  as a group of people are trapped in a large movie theater in West Berlin and then a prostitute is bitten turning into a lethal demon  here in Demons 2 deeds happen in Hamburgo buildings . As a group of tenants and visitors are trapped in a 10story highrise apartment building infested with demons who proceed to hunt the dwindling humans down . There appears bloodthirsting demons chasing humans and a little boy demon who was played by an adult dwarf as well as another small demon  a Gremlinalike . Gruesome picture in enough budget plenty of chills  suspense  screams  lots of gore  blood and guts . This actually is a very terrifying and eerie flick  dealing with a demonic infection spreads people in a block of apartments . Meanwhile  a juvenile bunch finding a lifeless corpse of a demon and one of the young boys causes the resurrection . Later on  a party girl becomes a drooling  fanged demon . In a killing rage  she tears apart other in the flats that are infected by ravenous  clawed demons who proceed to kill and posse the humans onebyone transforming into bloody creatures who attack the remaining humans  thereby multiplying their numbers . When the party members attempt to getaway  they find themselves caught within .This exciting picture contains thrills  chills  graphic violence  actionfilled with fierce fights and loads of gore and guts . The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized . This is an effective and simple movie  it results to be a passable Italian horror  including functional special effects realized in traditional style  but also some plot elements are plain stupid . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely horrifying to the bizarre along with scary and amazing frames . The flesheating demons appearance deliver the goods  plenty of screams  shocks and tension . The picture displays shocking and wellcrafted transformation in charge of expert makeup artist Gianetto De Rossi . The makeup assistants create a truly horrible cannibal demons  zombiesalike . Pretty good special effects  the resurrection of the first demon was done by shooting a melting wax head in reverse and the first demon popping out of the television was done by having an actor wearing a mask press his face against a latex screen . Unknown cast  though there appears a famous little girl  Asia Argento's film debut . Bobby Rhodes who played Tony the pimp in Demons 1985 returns as a completely different character in this sequel and Lino Salemme also reappears this time as a security guard . Commercial musical score by Simon Boswell  full of hard rock and catching songs . Acceptable cinematography by GianLorenzo Battaglia and good production design  as the building used for the exteriors and interiors result to be modern constructions from Hamburgo  Germany . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Lamberto Bava  as he shows nice visual style  though being lower to former installment in which he cites this as his personal favorite of the flicks he has filmed . His father Mario Bava 19141980 was a legendary filmmaker  he entered the cinema as his father's personal assistant starting with Planet of horror 1965. Bit by bit he gained experience from his father who made him the assistant director for most of the rest of his films . He even cowrote the screenplay for Shock 1977 . Lamberto enjoyed his best commercial success to date with this Demons  produced by Dario Argento cowritten by Dardano Sacchetti and filmed in West Berlin Germany . This international hit smash allowed him to cowrite produce and direct this sequel Demons II 1986 that was also successful and turned out to be a certain improvement here and there on previous film  however being inferior followup . He also directed a remake of his father's Black Sunday 1960 which was titled La Maschera del Demonio or International title Demons 5 The Devil's Veil . He used the pseudonym of John Old Jr.  which was a tribute to his father Mario who often used the pseudonym John M. Old . Lamberto has directed films about all kind of genres such as  Blastfighter  A blade in the dark  Shark red on the ocean and Macabro that achieved critical fame in some quarters  however  today Bava Jr. only directs television movies  Fantaghiro and sequels  Caribbean pirates  among others . Demons 2  rating  Acceptable and passable atmospheric filmmaking from genre master Bava's son that achieved great acclaim among gore buffs . A must see for horror fans .".

	schema:reviewBody "Lamberto Bava's sequel to his cult classic Demons 1985 is one uproariously hokey horror movie but it's certainly entertaining. Those pesky demons return this time invading a high rise apartment building via a television and reek bloody havoc on the tenants. Bava's original Demons was a tongueincheek thrill ride but Demons 2 is uber horror cheesiness. I don't mean that in a negative way in this case because this is one entertaining sequel! You've got it all here folks  demon dogs demon kids hordes of demons attacking in mass. Naturally the makeup work is pretty good over the top and grisly as always. Plotwise there's some good thrills although the story is largely a rehash of the plot from Demons. The music of Simon Boswell is great and the addition of some retro rock songs by The Cult and The Smiths is a fun touch. The cast hangs in well. Look for appearances by Bobby Rhodes and Lino Salemme from the original Demons  they play different characters here though. Also look for a young Asia Argento Dario's daughter in a small role.All around a fun camp horror film best taken with no seriousness at all! out of ".

	onyx:emotionText "Lamberto Bava's sequel to his cult classic Demons 1985 is one uproariously hokey horror movie but it's certainly entertaining. Those pesky demons return this time invading a high rise apartment building via a television and reek bloody havoc on the tenants. Bava's original Demons was a tongueincheek thrill ride but Demons 2 is uber horror cheesiness. I don't mean that in a negative way in this case because this is one entertaining sequel! You've got it all here folks  demon dogs demon kids hordes of demons attacking in mass. Naturally the makeup work is pretty good over the top and grisly as always. Plotwise there's some good thrills although the story is largely a rehash of the plot from Demons. The music of Simon Boswell is great and the addition of some retro rock songs by The Cult and The Smiths is a fun touch. The cast hangs in well. Look for appearances by Bobby Rhodes and Lino Salemme from the original Demons  they play different characters here though. Also look for a young Asia Argento Dario's daughter in a small role.All around a fun camp horror film best taken with no seriousness at all! out of ";

	schema:reviewBody "Take the first DEMONS film relocate it in a highrise tower block and that's the basic premise of this little number. A few twists and turns are included to differentiate it from the original classic but otherwise it follows the same kind of pattern. Dario Argento and Lamberto Bava team up again from the first film and deliver exactly the same kind of badlydubbed formula that we know and love from DEMONS.The acting is average but this time around the actors playing the demons are hugely overacting  take for instance the main female demon who contorts her face and pulls lots of stupid expressions in a vain attempt to be scary. The film is a success due to the return presence of Bobby Rhodes from the first film this time as a bodybuilder instead of a pimp who has to fend off the demons. He has great lines of dialogue again for example Put that fire out  if not we'll suffocate!  You've got more muscles than brain! and the old favourite Get some weapons and defend yo' selves!.As well as Rhodes a lot of plot devices have been taken from DEMONS as well the teenagers in a speeding car are an example of this as well as the pounding soundtrack. Lots of people get bitten and scratched for gore fans. Once again we have plot inconsistencies to add to the fun why does the car speed throughout the film only to explode on arrival? In addition there isn't as much gore in this as in the first film. Instead we get demonic creatures  a demon dog and a baby demon which bursts out of a kid's chest thanks to SFX maestro Sergio Stivaletti but these aren't up to the original's standards they look rushed. Sure this isn't logical it isn't believable either but this is still a fun film to watch. If you're looking for quality though then the first film is the one to go for. The two would make a nice double bill as they follow on nicely but the first has the edge.".

Just boring  except for a brief pan across a naked woman face down on a tanning bed that lasts about 2 seconds while the camera settles on some guy in a sweat box with blood dripping on his head. I'm used to most Mediterranean men preferring themselves seasoned with misogynism but just one more demerit. I prefer females going through intense attacks of hormones.This might have been a good sendoff of Slasher movies but alas it's just another of its kind with little to recommend itself.For all of you who enjoyed this bomb bully and more power to you.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on some positive reviews listed here I decided to download Demons 2. The reviewers in favor of this movie say that the demon series can never be listed alongside truly great movies and its the cheese the gore and the little spurts of magic that only Argento can provide that makes the series so good. Well I agree. The first was definitely something special in that regard. The start of Demons 2 looked really promising but everything from about 30 minutes on was just plain awful. From the acid blood scene on. I mean this movie felt like it was about 3 hours long. All of a sudden all of the precious 80's cheese was gone and what remained was just bland filler.There were a lot of bad parts but I MUST speak about two of them. First the 30 minutes devoted to that squealing demon baby was mind numbingly lame. I don't even understand why they had the little demon kid transform in the first place. That kid looked freaky as hell! But just when he's about to do away with the pregnant girl he drops onto the kitchen floor and transforms into the LAMEST demon doll you're ever seen. Maybe if the damn thing did more than just squeal and smile it wouldn't have been so bad ... it couldn't even walkrun for Christ sake. It's main move was flying through the air in a standing position ... ala old school Godzilla films. About 15 minutes in I found myself desperately rooting for the girl to finish the thing off. It just kept coming back! Lol I guess somebody loved it.The second thing I have to point out is the ending ... jeez Louise. Lol I am completely numb by this point far past caring what happens ... and to who let alone WHY. The hero decides to repel down the building with his pregnant girlfriend in tow. Just when he hits the bottom the birthday girl comes swimming down the line after them. He stabs her with a pole and she dies. They then wander into a nearby TV station to seek shelter. Surprise! 2 minutes after he poles the demon chick she revives herself and comes stumbling into the TV station. A super lame turn of events but what's lamer? The fact that she did absolutely nothing but show us she was blind ? and then lay down and die. The end. The whole TV station scene seems weird and misplaced it's like it would make a nice middle for another movie all together.ANYONE who is saying this movie is even halfway comparable to the first Demons is either an idiot or someone who has never seen the first movie! No where close people!".

Either way the movie is a disappointing sequel but one which still manages to be quite entertaining due to its complete daftness.For reasons that defy logical explanation a demon emerges through a televisionset in a hightech tower block.

Sally eventually emerges from her room blows out the candles on her cake and then transforms into a hideous creature attacking her pals resulting in them becoming demons too.The new demons proceed to drip acidic 'goop' that eats through the floor onto wiring causing a shortcircuit in the building's security system meaning that escape from the highrise is impossible. The remaining occupants of the tower must fight for survival against the demonic monsters that now roam the building.Special effects man Sergio Stivaletti recreates his demon makeup from the first movie giving us bigfanged razorclawed veinyfaced slobbering monstrosities that are every bit as effective as before. Unfortunately he also gives us a naff 'demon dog' and a particularly bad 'baby' demon which elicited guffaws rather than screams from this reviewer.Also worthy of a few laughs is the loopy script which presents us with one bizarre scenario after another. Funniest scenes by far involve the group of survivors which includes a gang of bodybuilders and leotard wearing women who barricade themselves into the underground garage. They set fires to prevent the demons from entering which works for a while however the demons suddenly seem to develop acrobatic skills and fly over the top of the fire performing perfect somersaults as they go. The resourceful musclemen fight back using the handy axes and guns that seem to litter the basement car park.So whacked out is the narrative of DEMONS 2 it must have been cobbled together as the makers went along and by the end of the film you'll be probably be sitting slackjawed wondering what the hell Lamberto Bava was thinking making such a stupid film.".

Just as scary as the original and a little bit more exciting than the first this still suffers the same flaws the original indured. Bad dubbing characters whose IQ's are probably lower than two and some downright stupid story elements. 6 out of 10.";

A lot of what makes this one work is the same atmosphere that worked so well in the original. Of course most of the suspense is derived from the building itself a proved inescapable fortress that no one can get in or out of which is perfect for trapping everyone inside.

Once the demons are out and killing due to this early setup the pace picks up so considerably that three different plotlines go on at the same time and allows for walltowall action in here that is deftly executed. The attack on the party guests is an absolute blast with all sorts of stellar action as she rips them to pieces the encounter between the lone woman and her transformed dog in her apartment is one of the best examples as it's a series of small sequences that is quite fun and the massacre in the parking lot is a perfect example as it occurs within a large amount of time and allows for several great sequences starting with them appearing in the weight room and chasing them down into the garage where the full extent of the fun takes place. The other good part to this one is that like with all Italian films of this style the emphasis is on the gorgeous and gruesome makeup and there is no shortage of that here. The style allows the film to wallow in the effects making them an effective highlight whenever they are shown. The transformed demons look good complete with fanglined maws inhuman facial features long claws and those glowing eyes form one cool monster one that is perfectly suited to deliver a series of continued shocks. Throwing in the transformation sequence as one visibly erupts out of a person's body in addition to a shocking TV gag early on that looks marvelous in this day and age the effects here hold up nicely and give this one a lot to really hold itself up. Even without these elements there are a few minor flaws to be had here. It's biggest issue is that this is not exactly an original movie as it basically takes the exact same plot as the first one and puts it into a new building. There's still a demon outbreak that results from watching a movie about the creatures the disbelieving horde struggles to get a grasp on the creatures there's a group of punks on the outside traveling to the location with the creatures and they even smash through a barricade set up to stop them which were all plotpoints and ideas from the original. It's not that big of a deal but it is there and somewhat noticeable. Some of the effects might also be seen as cheesy but the main issue here is the rather overt familiarity to the original.Rated R Graphic Violence Language and childreninjeopardy.".

Sure the acting is completely over the top and laughable the movie doesn't make any attempts to explain why the events are happening there is really bad '80s rock music playing at all the wrong moments and the whole production screams cheesy B grade flick but if you care about any of this anyways what kind of horror fan are you?! This movie is just an 88 minute roller coaster ride of gore rock music and cool demons. What more could you ask for? It isn't very likely to scare you so much as make you laugh and there are some classic moments for the genre such as a blind guy getting his eyes scratched out by a demon a revolting pussbursting scene a crazily fun massacre near the end that never gets old to watch and one of the best climaxes to a horror movie ever where the lead male character severs demon limbs left and right with a sword on a dirt bike! You have to hand it to director Lamberto Bava. He may not ever be remembered as the genius his father was acclaimed Italian horror maestro Mario Bava but he managed to create one of the best horror flicks of the '80s and today. The film exudes with an almost Gothic atmosphere and the setting of the big movie theater could not be more perfect in creating a mood.A word of caution though this movie is a horror buff's wet dream and it's strongly advisable you be sure you like real horror movies before seeing this so you know what you're getting into. This ain't no Scream or The Grudge. This is a REAL horror movie. Fans of modern horror beware! You'll only end up thinking this was the worst piece of trash ever made.So horror fans sit back relax and enjoy the ride! You're in for one hell of a fun movie.".

At the time this movie came out Italian horror meisters Dario Argento and Lamberto Bava wanted nothing more than to have a hit in the American market. Dario had experienced a taste of that with his collaboration on Dawn of the Dead but never from a full Italian production. To appeal to American audiences they went with the soundtrack used here songs from Billy Idol Rick Springfield etc. and even used some American actors like Bobby Rhodes who plays the pimp in even comes back in Demons 2 as a different character.To add to the hype they released it to limited distribution not by choice I'm sure in the states unrated just as Day of the Dead had just been released in similar fashion. Back in the 80's it was real hard for an 11 year old to be allowed in to see an unrated movie even with a parent or someone posing as one as in my case!  nonetheless I got to see both of these  and although I was disturbed for weeks  I loved every second of Demons.Years later I have acquired it on a double DVD with Demons 2. I love the original in all its uncut glory! Knowing more about the production I get a kick out of the fact that the guy at the beginning giving out the theater tickets the guy with the mask was then aspiring filmmaker Michele Soavi who would just a couple of years later become an Argento protg with movies like Stagefright and his own classic Dellamorte Dellamore Cemetary Man. I also get a kick out of how many movies older than the original Demons claim to be Demons sequels and have even had name changes. Unfortunately for us fans there were only two real Demons movies made the third never saw fruition. Too bad  if a real one ever came out  I'm sure I'm not the only one who'd run out to see it.".

When a very annoying prostitute puts on a demonic mask on display in the lobby within fifteen minutes later she has pus bubbles exploding from her face and is attacking her other prostitute friends. One by one people are transformed as gory as any italian horror movie can get. The direction is actually really good and Lamberto Bava goes all out on colors and angles which horror italian director doesn'tand the soundtrack goes well with the eighties look. I also really had fun times with the 4 punks snorting coke outside the theatre but they really added nothing to the plot and at times just seem to be there to fill time without a doubt though the gore is the highlight of this flick. Throats getting ripped open scalps getting teared off puke and pus splatter continuouslya huge tongue sliding out one of the demons mouth demons getting hacked with a sword the most gruesome scene is definitely the blind man getting his empty eye sockets gouged out..HARSH. The characters are so hard to tell apart and we don't evn see some of the patrons faces. I don't remember any characters really except the coolest pimp Tony the sexy usherette the four punks and the GEORGE character mainly only cause i recognized him from OPERA but this movie obviously isn't meant for character development.So all in all I give Demons 12 out of  It's really cool but only worth watching for cool visuals soundtrack and gore.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lamberto Bava's Dmoni aka. Demons of 1985 is a gory stylish and very entertaining horror flick written by the master Dario Argento. I'm sure getting acknowledged in Horror cinema wasn't easy for director Lamberto Bava  being the son of Mario Bava beyond doubt one of the alltime greatest horror geniuses in motion picture history. Expectations must have certainly been high. But although Lamberto Bava does certainly not manage to reach his father's brilliance Demons is definitely worth watching.Cheryl Natasha Hovey is given free tickets for a sneak preview by a mysteriously dressed man at a Berlin subway station. Accompanied by a friend she goes to see the movie at the eerielooking 'Metropol' cinema. Before the film starts a woman scratches herself on a creepy silver mask in the waiting hall. The film which turns out to be a Horror flick tells the story of a prediction by Nostradamus connected with a demonic mask.The plot is not that original but the film is made in a very stylish manner with a good cinematography and great color play in the tradition of Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The gore is intense lots of slicing stabbing cutting and biting. The cast may not be phenomenal but Natasha Hovey delivers a good leading performance and there are a bunch of funny characters such as a black pimp named Tony played by Bobby Rhodes and the two hookers he is accompanied by as well as a strange blind guy and his wife and a very strange usherette. The main part of the score was composed by Claudio Simonetti of the great Progressive Rock band Goblin whose ingenious soundtracks have also complimented many of Dario Argento's movies.Being a huge fan of Dario Argento I must say that Dmoni does definitely not live up to most of the movies Argento directed himself. Nevertheless it is an extremely entertaining Horror flick that doesn't scant with blood and gore and especially the gory sequences are very stylishly made. If you expect the quality of Argento's or Mario Bava's masterpieces you will probably be disappointed. Just expect a very stylish gory and extremely entertaining Horror flick and your expectations will easily be fulfilled. Recommended. 710".

	schema:headline " A gory trash classic of Italian cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "To enjoy this film one must throw aside any preconceptions you may have about it. Ignore the fact that Argento produced it except for one claustrophobic tracking shot around a brick wall there is no evidence of Argento's presence and ignore the fact that the director is the son of Mario Bava the son of a man who helmed some of the best most stylish movies of the Italian Gothic era. DEMONS is an allout visceral assault on the senses packed with frenetic action all manner of slop and gore and not an ounce of realism anywhere.Thank god for the Italians and their willingness to push the boundaries of convention and good taste. These guys dwell on the violence enjoying every bit using every opportunity to disgust and offend the viewer. Throughout the film we're treated to eyeballs being torn out necks ripped asunder stabbings decapitations and for the piece de resistance a character getting his head impaled on a spike. What more could you possibly want? How about some amusing dubbing bad acting and hilarious dialogue? Check. The fun factor is lifted about a hundred times by the presence of Bobby Rhodes' pimp a heroic leader who spouts some of the most hilarious lines you'll ever have heard  all the more amusing as he was dubbed by some loudmouthed American. Action man Rhodes is the real star of the two DEMONS films although he only has a supporting role in them. Acting amid a cast of nondescript youngsters in DEMONS he plays Tony a pimp who has come to the cinema with his two prostitutes. When people start turning into demons Rhodes immediately takes control of the survivors.Personally I love films set in just one location and this one doesn't fail to create a claustrophobic feel as well as a spooky atmosphere. It's also frequently scary partly due to some effective slowmotion scenes of demons walking towards the camera backlit with shining blank eyes so good they used it for the video cover. The low budget is fairly obvious but gives the film a gritty dirty feel adding to the horror. If you're expecting this film to make sense then don't bother watching it. Minor characters frequently disappear and no more is heard of them some subplots are added in just to further the plot.The most obvious one of these is the arrival of a group of drugsnorting cokeheads in their car their presence merely allowing a demon to escape into the streets and make way for the shock ending. One of these guys is a dead ringer for Sylvestor Stallone and this pointless plot makes little sense or reason. A good example of this film's contrivances appears when a helicopter crashes through the roof towards the finale merely allowing for an escape route for our heroes. What gets me is that a lot of people criticise this for not being realistic but is the whole premise of people turning into drooling monsters realistic? I think not.The fast pacing means that there's plenty of opportunity for some quick sticky shocks. This gore isn't disturbing  it's highly unrealistic  but merely adds to the fun. Goo flies everywhere at every opportunity as the cinema goers get slaughtered. The pounding score adds to the manic feel. Good use is made of the filmwithinafilm factor as events are played out in parallel in front of the big screen a good example is when a knife rips through a tent in the filmwithinthefilm while at the same time a possessed victim rips through the screen material with her fingernails!. The makeup is actually very good really disgusting and disturbing because of this. The demons overact wildly but it works for me here and comes nowhere near as embarrassing as the over the top actress in DEMONS 2. A highlight of the film comes when a wonderfullyscary looking demon climbs out of some poor soul's back ! and runs off into the shadows. Would this have looked as good with CGI? I don't think so. It's animatronics and prosthetics all the way and they've never looked so good.DEMONS isn't an intelligent film but then again it doesn't claim to be so. The visceral excess sets it way above many other American dumb gorefests of the '80s and it has a unique quality which makes it very worthwhile. It's not a brilliant film but a greatly enjoyable one nonetheless. The sequel followed a year later but lacked both the imagination and the impact of this one seeing as it was just a rerun set in a tower block instead of a cinema.".

One of these guys is a dead ringer for Sylvestor Stallone and this pointless plot makes little sense or reason. A good example of this film's contrivances appears when a helicopter crashes through the roof towards the finale merely allowing for an escape route for our heroes. What gets me is that a lot of people criticise this for not being realistic but is the whole premise of people turning into drooling monsters realistic? I think not.The fast pacing means that there's plenty of opportunity for some quick sticky shocks. This gore isn't disturbing  it's highly unrealistic  but merely adds to the fun. Goo flies everywhere at every opportunity as the cinema goers get slaughtered. The pounding score adds to the manic feel. Good use is made of the filmwithinafilm factor as events are played out in parallel in front of the big screen a good example is when a knife rips through a tent in the filmwithinthefilm while at the same time a possessed victim rips through the screen material with her fingernails!. The makeup is actually very good really disgusting and disturbing because of this. The demons overact wildly but it works for me here and comes nowhere near as embarrassing as the over the top actress in DEMONS 2. A highlight of the film comes when a wonderfullyscary looking demon climbs out of some poor soul's back ! and runs off into the shadows. Would this have looked as good with CGI? I don't think so. It's animatronics and prosthetics all the way and they've never looked so good.DEMONS isn't an intelligent film but then again it doesn't claim to be so. The visceral excess sets it way above many other American dumb gorefests of the '80s and it has a unique quality which makes it very worthwhile. It's not a brilliant film but a greatly enjoyable one nonetheless. The sequel followed a year later but lacked both the imagination and the impact of this one seeing as it was just a rerun set in a tower block instead of a cinema.";

It was hilarious the demons were funny looking the picture was too dark and the acting was atrocious. Love the scene at the end where the guy is on the motorcycle swinging the sword at all the demons chopping them up and decapitating them. The nihilistic ending sees the remaining survivors escaping the theater only to discover the city overrun by demons.

I'll watch pretentious European arthouse cinema of the most stereotypical variety without even a hint of irony. I will regard Ingmar Bergman as a literal godfigure to worshiped in all of his glory. On the other hand I will spend fortyplus dollars on a bluray of Dario Argento's Phenomena and gush over the sheer lunacy of Bmovies. Demons or Demoni in its native Italy is everything a geek like me could want. Gratuitous gore and violence questionable dubbing explosions and a kickass eighties soundtrack. Cowritten and produced by Italian horror maestro Dario Argento Suspiria Deep Red Demons came from Argento's desire to create a purely commercial film after tasting such success with 1978's Dawn of the Dead. Thus Demons is a film with little in the way of a coherent plot or deep characterization. And yet somehow it manages to be wholly appealing at the same time. The plot which follows the spread of a zombielike form of demonic possession spreading through a Berlin movie theater exists solely to facilitate the numerous action and scare sequences. The score by Argento regular Claudio Simonetti of Goblin fame manages to be exciting creepy and perfectly suited to adrenalinesoaked visuals. This film is entertainment pure and simple. To anyone looking to get into Bmovies or Italian horror or better yet both I highly recommend this film as it's a very accessible entry point into both genres. Just sit back open a can of Coke shut your brain off and prepare to have the time of your life.".

It's not zombies it's not witches it's not aliens it's not superhuman killers but demons. Demons with a mysterious origin that is as obscure as how absurd this movie is. There are many things I really like about this movie the specialeffects the gore the absurdity the irony the coal black humor the music and the atmosphere. Firstly it has an absurd story. Almost as if psychotic people gather inside a cinema to watch a movie because they got invited. Among them a black woman cuts herself with a creepy and mysterious mask. Unknowing to her and the people around her the mask turns humans into murdering demons. When her transformation completed it didn't take long before there are a lot demons loose in the cinema. The people can't escape because the exits were walled with concrete with no logical explanation. That is absurd but the story isn't the most important here it is mostly a specialeffects movie. With the demons comes along a fest of practical specialeffects violence and gore. Secondly the specialeffects are still impressive also disgusting and that's the reason why practical specialeffects are still better than CGI.We see normal human teeth coming off replaced by what appears to be more like shark teeth. We also see human nails replaced with claws flesh being torn and lots of blood. All done with practical specialeffects. The specialeffects seemed quite demanding and hard to execute but it went so well I still find them convincing to this day. Thinking about it gives me a little nausea. But amidst the gore violence and absurdity of all the movie has sense of humor and irony. For example the people trapped inside the cinema blames the movie for what is happening. Yes that is illogical and funny but it has a strong reflection on reality with censors and people often blaming movies for promoting violence and making people violent. That is absurd. More of the humor bits is the blind man who went to the cinema oh the irony! How about the coke inside the Coca Cola can? Hilarious! The music is quite exotic adding to the absurdity of the movie. Also the atmosphere the atmosphere is so absurd the movie feels more like a nightmare. It is almost like a comic book. Which I like a lot. I love movies with atmosphere. Like I wrote earlier this is quite original. Unlike most movies you'll see today or of yesterday. I didn't realize that as a teenager but now I do. I actually like it more than I did as a teenager. This movie is pure cult movie gold. 910".

There's a frivolity joy and quasianarchy to Demons that was missing in a lot of Italian Horror since the overnight success of The Bird with the Crystal Plummage 15 years prior. That landmark in giallo ushered in a more adultthemed era within the Italian Horror industry with the majority of films in the 1970s having less to do with evil revenge greed or fate and more to do with psychological and sexual aberrations and trauma in particular of the Freudian kind. This is neither good nor bad and there are certainly exceptions Suspiria Zombie but even when Argento enters the world of the supernatural he finds it difficult to let go completely of the psychological tether going so far as to refer to the head witch of Suspiria Helena Markos being not just an embodiment of evil but mentally unhinged insane. Demons produced and cowritten by Argento is a return to not just a more pure form of Horror but also of entertainment.Demons is directed by Lamberto Bava the son of Mario who had spent the first 15 years of his time in the industry 19651980 being an assistant director and screenwriter for not just his father but for Argento and Ruggero Deodato Cannibal Holocaust Jungle Holocaust. Nothing L. Bava did up to Demons or after for that matter appeals to me very much. As is the case with Armando Crispino's Autopsy I love Demons for what it is as a whole  the parts that make it up don't warrant as much individual intellectual dissection as many of the other great Italian Horror films do. There's an interesting if not fascinating argument here that if one has a pristine script Argento Franco Ferrini Dardano Sacchetti and an excellent helmsmanproducer again Argento then perhaps a director of optimal powers isn't necessary to pull off a superior piece of work.The plot of Demons is a delightful one indeed and will appeal to the legion of Zombie Film fans out in the world although as with more contemporary films like 28 Days Later these aren't the living dead or even the 'infected'. Instead they are exactly as the title of the film states  demons.The film begins with a musicmajor university student Cheryl riding the Berlin subway. The opening credits roll as she and us take a gander at the other occupants of the subway car  this firmly places the film in the 1980s as the car is full of all the New Wave and punk rock denizens one comes to expect from a lot of Eurohorror at this time. Handed a free ticket for a new movie by a mute man in a metallic demon mask Cheryl convinces her friend Kathy to go with her. Once at the movie theatre named the Metrol which is full of patrons who also received mysterious tickets Cheryl and Kathy find some cute boys to sit with. In the lobby of the theatre I should mention is a sculpture that has hanging from it the same demon mask from before. One of the patrons a fierce Apollonia 6inspired hooker named Rosemary teases her pimp by putting the mask to her face to try and scare him. Unfortunately for her but fortunately for us the inside of the mask cuts her face and causes her to bleed. At this point anyone with even the slightest semblance of knowledge of Horror films and Italian Horror in particular see Black Sunday knows that Rosemary has just become patient zero for something truly abyssal.Within 10 minutes during which time the movie within the movie has already started a movie that involves a gaggle of teens coming across a decrepit ruin a ruin which has the same demon mask buried in a shallow pit Rosemary feels ill and has to excuse herself to the ladies room she has a meeting with Satan! Where the mask cut her face Rosemary now has a large pustule pregnant with demonic semen. Within moments it bursts forth and the now hellishly infected Rosemary carries the Devil's contagion inside her. Soon several more become infected via a scratch or bite from Rosemary and the theatre is eventually crawling with rabid demons. Meanwhile one of the characters in the movie playing on the Metrol screen has also cut himself on the mask and becomes infected with demon juice  the meta fiction runs wild in this film.By Demons' climax most of the patrons are Satan's converts save Cheryl and her boytoy including some truly crazy young punks who entered the theatre by the back way. Without giving away the ending completely let's just say that mankind's future doesn't look too bright in Demons.What sets this film apart is the quick pace the truly horrific and terrifying special effects including a particular demonbirth involving someone on all fours that still freaks me out to this day the legitimate scares the velocity of the demons themselves the phantasmagorical lighting and ambiance the heavy metal score Saxon and Accept being the highlights and one of my personal favorites in a horror film  the notion of apocalypse. In this way its influence is still with us to this day. But more than anything Demons is a truly wild wild ride and one of the most purely shocking films of its time.".

	schema:headline " Simple effective horror film should have had a bigger cult following";
	schema:reviewBody "Long before the TV show The Walking Dead and Ruben Fleischer's exhilarating Zombieland 2009 came this campy motion picture rooted in good ol' fashioned blood and gore. Filmed primarily in Berlin Germany and made by an Italian director Demons is a clear snapshot of what an 80's horror film is supposed to be. Although the idea for it is surprisingly original this puppy runs rampant with nostalgia from that era. Characters have the big hair the women really spritz it up for this one they tie their sweaters around their necks everyone has got that Kmart look going on and the grimness of cheesy synthesizer music is abundant in every frame added to that heavy metal tunes sometime appear in the movie's soundtrack. Most of the actors in Demons also come off as mean and shallow. They all however have perfect innocent faces for the look of a scary movie except for this one guy who's got a chrome dome and sideburns the size of Texas. Plus they are all quite amusing due to the virtual dubbing it sounded like dubbing in every spoken word of their dialogue. And let's not forget another trait for splatter films of the 1980's. Most of the cast in Demons accomplishes it in that they are virtually unknown and comprised of actors and actresses you'll never see or hear from again. Let me ask you a question have you ever heard of Urbano Barberini and Karl Zinny? Yeah me neither. The make up of this high jinks exercise in unabashed fun goes like this A woman on a subway has visions of a mysterious man who is facially scarred and wears a creepy mask. When she gets off the subway this same man follows her and gives her a ticket for a free movie showing at a theater in West Berlin. She then proceeds to invite her friend the two of them skip their high school classes not a good idea and they venture to the theater along with 40 or so other people these people were also randomly given tickets and summoned by the same creepy dude who doesn't utter one word. Once everyone is settled in the half empty building a random horror film is shown on screen a woman in the audience turns into a demon I can't tell you how you gotta watch for yourself and chaos ensues the rule is that if a possessed person bites or scratches you you become a demon as well. Everyone therefore is trapped in the theater for some strange reason I figured why don't they find out where the entrance is at which they came in and try to break it down oh well. I must say I was entertained and sort of taken aback by this flick. It harked back to my childhood where you could wake up flip on the cable box at 4am and see something like this playing on Showtime or Cinemax. Like I said earlier Demons has what I like to think of as a pretty original idea for a fright fest. But make no mistake about it it's still a runofthe mill exercise in horror fare. It does just what you want it to do nothing more and nothing less. And that's okay with me. Yeah its got elements from the George Romero movies and The Evil Dead 1981 minus the slight comedic vibe but Demons still manages to be effective because it does an adequate job of establishing the characters setting up the shocks and scares it takes a good 20 minutes before things get going and this is an 88 minute flick and not straying too far away from the focus of the story only during the 1 hour mark do things go off on a small tangent. Another treat is that this special effects behemoth marks the first time I've seen or heard the following tidbits in any movie of any genre Billy Idol's rock anthem White Wedding playing in the background two female characters who are deadpan lookalikes of the late Corey Haim and late rock superstar Rick James I'm not kidding folks another character wielding a samurai sword while on a motorcycle hacking zombies along the way and riding through a movie theater no less even another character who is blind and actually taking in the movie within a movie huh? and an interesting product placement for Coca Cola you'll know it when you see it. If you're into horror films and want to invade the time warp which is the mid 80's Demons will probably satisfy your thirst for terror. I mean who doesn't want to see the indelible sight of flesh eating ghouls walking down a corridor with their creepy ceiling shadows. Ah they sure don't make em' like this anymore and if they did now they'd be hard pressed to emulate the veritable time capsule that is this movie. Oh and I almost forgot about the ending. It makes it an even better film than it really is. I was caught off guard by it but I thought yeah this makes sense. So to end this review I'll say this if Demons ever makes it to the midnight movie circuit I'm not sure it hasn't then you should get a bunch of your friends together and check it out. You'll get to see a movie within a movie at a movie theater. Got it. Now get to it ASAP!".

	onyx:emotionText "Long before the TV show The Walking Dead and Ruben Fleischer's exhilarating Zombieland 2009 came this campy motion picture rooted in good ol' fashioned blood and gore. Filmed primarily in Berlin Germany and made by an Italian director Demons is a clear snapshot of what an 80's horror film is supposed to be. Although the idea for it is surprisingly original this puppy runs rampant with nostalgia from that era. Characters have the big hair the women really spritz it up for this one they tie their sweaters around their necks everyone has got that Kmart look going on and the grimness of cheesy synthesizer music is abundant in every frame added to that heavy metal tunes sometime appear in the movie's soundtrack. Most of the actors in Demons also come off as mean and shallow. They all however have perfect innocent faces for the look of a scary movie except for this one guy who's got a chrome dome and sideburns the size of Texas. Plus they are all quite amusing due to the virtual dubbing it sounded like dubbing in every spoken word of their dialogue. And let's not forget another trait for splatter films of the 1980's.

If you're looking for a serious horror movie and your typical Argento film you'll probably hate this one so watch it with an open mind and you'll enjoy it. There's some nice gore in it typical Argento and one thing that I loved in this film is the photography! The film is sort of Suspiriaish on a visual note that is. Suspiria is million times better the use of colors and the sets are just striking and there are lots of atmospheric beautiful to look at and yet terribly frightening classic moments such as the demons walking down the hallway sequence and coming from the son of Mario Bava and produced by Dario Argento I wouldn't be surprised if there were some great visuals. The cheesy 80's music by Claudio Simonetti is also fun to listen and helps to build the suspense. Overall despise the cheesiness Demons is a very fun film to watch with friends and remember don't take it seriously!".

It's not frightening or entertaining and the special effects do not withhold time well unlike i.e. the aforementioned Evil Dead. Additionally the storyline basically is a not too clever take on zombie flicks with a slight moviebecomingreality twist. One of those movies which show that Dario Argento was slowly losing his edge in the 80s albeit he is only culpable for scriptwriting to awful excuse for a movie.Somehow this gory pointless flick got a second outing and given it has no atmosphere or point I am audaciously surprised with the high marks this movie has.

The film revolves around Fenton who decides he can no longer hold the burden of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to hauntingly tell the story to FBI Agent Wesley Doyle played by Powers Boothe.I cannot think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their seat from start to finish and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop watching you wont be able to because of the sheer power of this movie.The directors have filmed this movie very well and they help to set the plot through the good scenery. The acting in this movie is great but if there is any drawback it is that some parts are very powerful and may disturb some people.Whilst the concept of this film is very dark the young children help to portray the idea through brilliant acting. This really is a spine tingly movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat throughout. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different.810".

	schema:headline " A Great Debut of Bill Paxton as Director in a Very Scary LowBudget Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle Powers Boothe in his FBI office. He claims to have information about a serial killer chased by FBI. When Agent Doyle arrives in the office he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother. Agent Doyle requests some evidence and the man tells the story of his life since his childhood. They were a simple family of three his widow father Meiks Bill Paxton his brother and himself. One night his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of God had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons. What happens next is one of the most scary movie I have ever seen. I watched this movie four months ago on VHS and yesterday I watched again now on DVD. Although being a lowbudget movie the screenplay is sharp with no flaw. The cast is outstanding but I would like to highlight the performance of Matt O'Leary as the young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager. The direction of Bill Paxton is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. A great debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this movie 'A Mo do Diabo' The Devil's Hand'. If at least it were 'The God's Hand' it might be acceptable. But calling this movie as 'the devil's hand' is indeed ridiculous. Brent Hanley the screenwriter did not deserve such a lack of respect from the Brazilian distributor. This film is highly recommended. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Mo do Diabo The Devil's Hand".

	schema:headline " Who is the bad guy? Spoilers!!!!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This entire review is a SPOILER! This is only for those who've seen Frailty! You've been warned! I either see Frailty as a genius movie or a badly botched effort. I know what Hanley the screenwriter wanted. If the movie had been made according to his wishes I would agree with the commentaries on the DVD and agree with the general premise as seen on the surface of the movie. However as it stands I do not see it that way at all. And there are subtle and not so subtle clues that Frailty was meant to be something altogether even more subversive than what is seen. Other reviewers have spotted the anomalies while others have gotten upset at the thought that Adam and Dad Meiks really were getting orders from God. I admit it... as a Christian the thought does upset me but not nearly enough to attack the producers and actors in writing or otherwise. And I must admit that Dad and Adam were receiving orders from a god... but which one? The God of the Bible? Or the God of the Earth? Either one could perform miracles... such as hiding Daddy Meiks' kidnappings fuzzing up the video monitor lousing up anyone's memory and leading Daddy and Adam Meiks to think they are seeing demonic acts in the minds of innocent people. The first three quarters of the movie works perfectly with nothing out of place except Dad's supposed visions. We at first see Dad Meiks as a madman a ruthless killer and maniacal child abuser. When I first watched I had the gut feeling that this was no tale of human insanity but this was the Real McCoy a supernatural thriller with vastly disturbing psychological undertones... and I was right. The clues given in the FBI building let any viewer know that some other power besides human capabilities is at work here. The fuzzing up of Adam's face in the video monitor might have been coincidence but it's reinforced by the fact that a trained observer also could not remember Adam's face.... plus there are Adam's visions revealed in a chilling line up of scenes from the times Daddy Meiks laid his bare hands on the captured 'demons'. Taken at face value we are clearly shown that Adam has taken over Dad Meiks' holy mission and is pursuing it with a flair Daddy Meiks never displayed. We see on the surface that Fenton Meiks was a demon planted by dark powers to bring an end to Dad's righteous mission. And yes Hanley did want Fenton to be the demon right from the beginning well before Frailty was made. Colombine reared its tragic head above the horizon of public awareness while Frailty was in production thus forcing some changes in the way the plot was presented. Adam was shown to be following God's orders and he was a righteous human being doing everything any good American should do fighting evil with all of his cunning and might and winning! The panning shot as the camera pulled away from Adam and his lovely wife pounded that fact home thus arousing the ire of many a Christian across this great land of ours....But Bill Paxton's commentary opens up a whole new boiling kettle of worms as does Brian Tyler's great score for the movie. I do think Bill Paxton has put together a different movie than the one that appears on the surface... and he gives clues in his commentary and there's a great big clue in the story itself. I will get to it soon...First how many people did a doubletake when Fenton asked Adam to bury him in the rose garden when Adam destroyed him? How many viewers felt as though the plot of a different movie had been pasted on? Matt O'Leary seemed to me to be as disbelieving in that twist as I was... way out of character for the character he had portrayed so excellently all through the movie. Did the kid forget how to act in just that one scene? Did Paxton forget how to direct? Was Fenton really the demon? Please remember that Fenton was the only character in the entire movie to display feelings of kindness and the actions of a thinking rational caring human being. Let's go over them to the best of my memory.... Daddy Meiks whatever his previous actions towards his kids might have been became a coldblooded killing machine. While protesting love for Fenton he tortured his elder son without remorse or the slightest hint of mercy. Adam as an adult is cold and calculating the very picture of smug selfrighteousness and hatred woven into a finely honed killing machine. Adam the child as acted so superbly by Jeremy Sumpter had all the human feelings of a radish as he bought Daddy Meiks' story without hesitation. Little Adam was ready to kill right from the start even willing to slaughter his fellow students with a made up list. Daddy Meiks showed his sanity by stopping little Adam in his tracks... or did he? Adam had the psychological makeup right from the start of a fanatic. Was Daddy's mild rebuke going to stop him? I have my doubts... The old sheriff was shown to be a very disagreeable man at least from Fenton's point of view. Let's see.... Powers Booth's character Agent Doyle. He was just as surly as the old sheriff. Maybe he really was a demon maybe he was just sick of the killings he had to investigate. Whatever the reason Doyle was not a pleasant man. We only get to see his mother in the photo on Doyle's desk and in the vision of her getting killed by her own son the very Agent Doyle in charge of investigating the God's Hand murders. The other agent whose name escapes me is a buttkissing toady showing not an ounce of brains whenever he is on screen. The 'demons' Daddy Meiks captures... whether or not they are truly demons they are hardly shown in their best light. Who does that leave in Frailty who might show humane feelings? Sheriff Adam Meiks' pretty wife in his office? To tell you the truth she creeped me out. As pretty as she was she made me glad I was not in the same state as she was. Happy never to have met her... So.... we are left with Fenton to see humanity of thought and action.... and he is the demon. Nice little message for those who see this movie. I saw that particular twist coming but wished it wouldn't. It was the easy way out and Frailty up until that point was too well done to deserve being trashed by that garbage pail of a twist. Or was it?We are shown that Doyle was a demon who mercilessly slaughtered his beloved mother. He even asks Adam how he knew. Case closed right?Wrong. The 'vision' Adam has shows a young Doyle knifing his mother to death.The photo on Doyle's desk which the camera pans so lovingly shows a much older Agent Doyle posing in the photograph. Huh? Was that a production mistake? Could be... but it was shown for so long. It would have been easy to show a young Doyle in that photo but they did not do so. Was that a clue as to the truth? As another reviewer points out Adam could be delusional. I have this question How could an older Doyle be posing with his mom if he was much younger when he killed her? If Fenton was a true demon why did he not kill his Dad before his Dad killed him? Daddy was trusting enough to sleep with Fenton in the house Otis was available or a sharp knife. Fenton was shown to be physically resilient and despite the power which protected Dad Fenton was able to kill the man quite handily... Demons were declared to be completely merciless but Fenton did not kill Adam in his sleep nor with the axe as he could have done. He need not have left the axe in Dad's chest please remember. Dad killed the old sheriff. Why? Because the angel had said someone would have to die if someone snitched about Dad's holy mission... But who would seek that vengeance? God claims the right of vengeance. Daddy Meiks took it upon himself to wreak vengeance for Fenton revealing the plan. I doubt if God would take kindly to that. It looked far away but the entrance to the cellar was very close by when Fenton and the old sheriff had their little conversation... which revealed the old man was exasperated beyond endurance with Fenton's 'lies'. Daddy Meiks had to have heard them. He knew God covered his tracks under worse circumstances than this Kidnapping an old man in broad daylight in a crowded parking lot comes to mind for starters. but he slaughtered the sheriff anyway. Supposedly the old man was a friend of his. Is this the actions of a man doing God's work? Like many socalled Christians Daddy is quite willing to blame Fenton for murdering the sheriff. The DEVIL made me do it! In other words Daddy Meiks would not take the blame for his own sins. There's a little more to think about. Daddy Meiks was told Fenton was a demon... and Dad touches Fenton's bare skin with his bare hands for what seems like a long time. Daddy proclaims his love for his son saying he loves Fenton and values him more than his own life. He then proceeds to torture Fenton to within an inch of the child's life in order to prove to the angel Fenton is NOT a demon. Finally Fenton admits to being wrong and Dad receives him back into the family with full honors... if Fenton will kill the next demon Daddy captures. Since Hanley himself claims demons are remorseless killers and very cunning why would Fenton put himself through this? Seems to me he would have agreed from the getgo and slaughtered Daddy as he did when Dad's guard was down. Why put himself through such an ordeal?Maybe Fenton really was the truly moral one? Adam gave Fenton water during the torture... on Daddy's orders. I strongly feel that Adam would have given Fenton nothing if his father said not to. Adam saves Fenton from Daddy's axe after the old sheriff is murdered. Was this not noble? Think about it... Why kill the fallguy? Paxton's commentary at the end of Frailty was very interesting... We are shown Adam's wife and she is pregnant. Paxton says See? There's another demon... and waits what seems to me to be a rather long time to correct himself saying demon hunter instead. Huh? And that long panning shot.... as the camera pulls away. Why if Adam and his wife are working for God does the DEMONIC opening music start in? It does not start after the credits begin rolling but well before it. And Paxton insisted that the opening themes be used. It is NOT godly music by any stretch of the imagination. Talk about subversive... Is Adam really a demon? Is he following Satan's orders thinking that the devil is GOD? Paxton says he sees the movie as Dad's tragedy... he was killed because of Fenton's cunning. With this in mind the movie plays really differently on a second viewing. However what if I am right? That Daddy Meiks was sincere cannot be doubted he really did think he was working for God and he truly loved Fenton as misguided as his actions were. And Fenton really was the kindly humane older brother... this would make it a double tragedy... Dad's and Fenton's. What about Adam? His is the heart and mind and soul of the born psychopath. Watch him as an adult... watch him as a child.Yes Daddy Meiks there really was a demon in your family. Guess who! And wouldn't the rightwing Christian community have LOVED such a message? My rating? If Fenton was the demon 5 out of 10... If Adam was... 9 out of 10. Take your pick!".

	schema:headline " In total disbelief... A movie with a dangerous agenda if I have ever seen one!";
	schema:reviewBody "!!! Total Spoilers!!! Read for your own good!!! This review contains spoilers and I sure as hell hope I will spoil things for anyone out there who is even contemplating viewing this piece of garbage! I have to say I was preparing to praise this movie and to give it a very high rating  until the last 10 minutes or so when the sheer nonsense the plot is based upon was finally revealed! In fact I feel utterly insulted by how stupid the makers of this movie and particularly the ones who wrote the storyscript expect the viewers to be! So although I was never planning on writing reviews on IMDb my fury at the hidden agenda this movie seems to have as well as at the fact that I will never be able to regain the one and a half hours of my life that have gone to waste simply compel me to compose this review as a warning to those who value their intelligence too much to be subjected to what I have gone through.Now at first during over 80 minutes the story seems to be about a man who enters the FBI headquarters claiming to be called Fenton Meiks. Now at the time the FBI are looking for a serial killer nicknamed God's Hands and Fenton says it is his brother Adam Meiks who is responsible for all those murders. Fenton relates his life story to Wesley Doyle the agent in charge and explains how his dad started claiming he had been repeatedly visited by angels and given a task to fulfill. The task mentioned involved killing certain people who were in fact not people but demons. What happened every time a persondemon was executed was that the father brought the victim to their home put his hand on that victim and was able to visualize all their wrongdoings and feel justified in killing them having previously obtained their names as part of a list given by the almighty. Adam was able to see the sins of each of those executed but not Fenton who kept saying his father was crazy and a murderer and tried to stop him. Also the father and Adam both believed that god would make them invisible when carrying out the abductions and would keep their murderskillings unpunished because they were in fact killing demons. Does it seem to you readers that it's a movie about how far religious fanaticism can lead a person and that there will be be a plottwist at the end? Well the socalled twist which I saw coming from a mile away is that the Fenton who is present at the FBI headquarters decides to take agent Doyle to the burial site where all God's Hands 's victims are found in shallow graves revealing himself to be in fact Adam who then READ IN AWE puts his hand on the FBI agent discovering the man had killed his own mother and was rightfully on his list of targets as specified by god !!! and murders the agent who is actually a demon! To make matters worse the camera that recorded the real Adam's presence at the FBI headquarters gets a blurred picture when he makes his entrance !!! and so Adam cannot be recognized as the Fenton who had been there! So he gets away with it because he has in fact killed the real Fenton and planted all the evidence there to frame him and get himself off the hook.So to clarify the main concept of the movie Adam and his dad have truly been chosen by god to kill people who are not in fact people but DEMONS! They ARE given the ability to touch a person and see their sins and ARE in fact protected and made invisible yet again you've guessed!by god! Fenton who tried to stop the murders and in doing so killed his own father was also a demon just like agent Doyle. So the message this movie delivers is there are people out there who get messages and protection from god and have the right to kill others who they consider to be demons! And who are we the rest of humanity to stand in their way and attempt to put a stop to their glorious holy crusade! I am positive that all the nutcases who have killed others after heeding god's call will be delighted to find out they were right all along! I would give this movie the 1 point10 points it deserves but since IMDb are known not to count any votes of 10 and 1 I'm giving it a 2. In truth giving a film a 0 rating should be made possible. In doubt? Fine. If you have any common sense watch Frailty  seeing is believing isn't it?".

	onyx:emotionText "!!! Total Spoilers!!! Read for your own good!!! This review contains spoilers and I sure as hell hope I will spoil things for anyone out there who is even contemplating viewing this piece of garbage! I have to say I was preparing to praise this movie and to give it a very high rating  until the last 10 minutes or so when the sheer nonsense the plot is based upon was finally revealed! In fact I feel utterly insulted by how stupid the makers of this movie and particularly the ones who wrote the storyscript expect the viewers to be! So although I was never planning on writing reviews on IMDb my fury at the hidden agenda this movie seems to have as well as at the fact that I will never be able to regain the one and a half hours of my life that have gone to waste simply compel me to compose this review as a warning to those who value their intelligence too much to be subjected to what I have gone through.Now at first during over 80 minutes the story seems to be about a man who enters the FBI headquarters claiming to be called Fenton Meiks. Now at the time the FBI are looking for a serial killer nicknamed God's Hands and Fenton says it is his brother Adam Meiks who is responsible for all those murders. Fenton relates his life story to Wesley Doyle the agent in charge and explains how his dad started claiming he had been repeatedly visited by angels and given a task to fulfill. The task mentioned involved killing certain people who were in fact not people but demons. What happened every time a persondemon was executed was that the father brought the victim to their home put his hand on that victim and was able to visualize all their wrongdoings and feel justified in killing them having previously obtained their names as part of a list given by the almighty. Adam was able to see the sins of each of those executed but not Fenton who kept saying his father was crazy and a murderer and tried to stop him. Also the father and Adam both believed that god would make them invisible when carrying out the abductions and would keep their murderskillings unpunished because they were in fact killing demons. Does it seem to you readers that it's a movie about how far religious fanaticism can lead a person and that there will be be a plottwist at the end? Well the socalled twist which I saw coming from a mile away is that the Fenton who is present at the FBI headquarters decides to take agent Doyle to the burial site where all God's Hands 's victims are found in shallow graves revealing himself to be in fact Adam who then READ IN AWE puts his hand on the FBI agent discovering the man had killed his own mother and was rightfully on his list of targets as specified by god !!! and murders the agent who is actually a demon! To make matters worse the camera that recorded the real Adam's presence at the FBI headquarters gets a blurred picture when he makes his entrance !!! and so Adam cannot be recognized as the Fenton who had been there! So he gets away with it because he has in fact killed the real Fenton and planted all the evidence there to frame him and get himself off the hook.So to clarify the main concept of the movie Adam and his dad have truly been chosen by god to kill people who are not in fact people but DEMONS!

As the horrifying events of this tale unfold we learn a lot about the father about his two sons and about their destinies. So goes the story forward...I watched it twice and I must say it was something I would like to watch again and again.I really appreciate all the efforts of the Director put forward to make this Precious Art which doesn't come often.

And i must say i think he does a good job both directing and acting here. Most of the cast perform well not least the young boys portraying the brothers in the flashbacks. Also Matthew McConaughey performs well as one of the grownup boys.What i think raises this film a little over the usual breed of clichd horror films are a couple things. First of all the plot twists here without saying too much actually surprised me somewhat. And from what i read in the IMDb forums some people STILL don't get it... Also the ideas feel rather fresh and the mood in the film is well maintained overall.So don't expect a miracle when you watch this it's not THE horror movie of the year. But it is solidly entertaining a just odd enough to make it stand out. I rate it 610.".

Paxton and his crew have concocted an often original deep thought inducing picture with more chills than gore which also works for the feel. Here McConaughey starts off in an FBI man's office and tells the story of of him his brother and his father back in 1979.  His father was a good father and loved him and his brother but one night dad Paxton gets visited by the angel of god or other and is commanded to destroy the demons that possess human beings.  He also brings along his two sons to assist him in his tasks of destruction much to the dismay of McConaughey's younger form played in one of the best recent kid performances by Matt O'Leary. What is revealed in this movie caused me to think deeper than I should've or should possibly.  This tale is almost in the vein of what happened with Andrea Yates and her drowning her kids parents will is brought upon the children by the hand of god's command the tasks once done by Abraham and such is mentioned as well.  It is difficult to classify Paxton's dad right away as a nut case cause he is shown to be sane through it and that adds the intrigue to his character and the nightmarish reality on his kids Adam and Fenton.  This is something you don't really see much in movies in general and a quick peek at the least is highly reccomended.  It's not a great achievement however it's enveloping style is undeniable. A".

	schema:headline " A well worked and original little thriller!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's true that there are more than enough thrillers about serial murder  and so it's always great when a film comes along and plays with this premise  and Frailty does that brilliantly! Bill Paxton is obviously best known for his acting work which includes filmstealing performances in films like Aliens and Near Dark and here he gets to work both in front of and behind the camera as we get a typical Paxtonstyle show stealing performance and he directs also. Obviously this isn't a film that will break any boundaries but Paxton takes his plot and spins an entertaining and exciting thrillride around it. The film opens with a man named Fenton Meiks arriving at a police station. He tells the agent in charge of the 'Gods Hand' case that he knows the identity of the killer that has been terrorising the local community. The film then moves into flashbacks as we find out that the man's father received a vision from God in which he was told to destroy demons. The film focuses on the father's two young boys one of whom believes his father's visions and one that doesn't...If you were to properly analyse the film's message you would no doubt come to the conclusion that there are many holes and ideas that don't really make a lot of sense. But this isn't important as Frailty does everything that you could ask of it. The religion theme is well done and the film provides an interesting perspective where God is concerned. The acting is excellent with Bill Paxton in a somewhat dumbed down but no less intriguing role than usual. The support cast includes Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe both of whom are well used. The real acting comes from child actors Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter who both manage to star in the film without becoming annoying. The film has many themes outside of the central religious one the most frightening of which is the corruption of youth. Paxton does a really good job of blending the boys' childhood story with some quite gruesome horror and while the film does have some failings where some of the central ideas are concerned it's not too important as Frailty is a well worked thriller that does what it says on the tin!".

The acting is excellent with Bill Paxton in a somewhat dumbed down but no less intriguing role than usual. The support cast includes Matthew McConaughey and Powers Boothe both of whom are well used. The real acting comes from child actors Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter who both manage to star in the film without becoming annoying. The film has many themes outside of the central religious one the most frightening of which is the corruption of youth. Paxton does a really good job of blending the boys' childhood story with some quite gruesome horror and while the film does have some failings where some of the central ideas are concerned it's not too important as Frailty is a well worked thriller that does what it says on the tin!";

He recounts his disturbed childhood detailing his father's belief that he himself and his brother were chosen by God to eradicate the demons on earth.This neoBiblical thriller features Bill Paxton as director and actor and garnered a great deal of critical attention in 2001 especially after being lauded by Stephen King. As Paxton's directorial debut Frailty is impressive. It is an unabashedly dark film rife with theological substance and mythological backing that we are initially made to question as human psychology gone awry is dad just a madman with an axe or is God really speaking to him? What does it have to do with faith at all? Because of this the film has the potential to be a bit divisive especially with its unquestionable conclusion but taken as spiritual creed or contemporary myth the film is enjoyable all the same.Phenomenal performances from thenchild actors Matt O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter really boost the film as both of them play the childhood brothers who are detrimental to the unfolding narrative. The bulk of the film rests on their shoulders with Matthew McConaughey providing the narrative frame and Powers Boothe as the disbelieving FBI agent. As I mentioned before the conclusion of the film is a divisive one but no matter what your theological standpoint Frailty is an eloquent and wellphotographed thriller that meshes Biblical overtones with the contemporary serial killer film to surprising results. Wellacted suspenseful and fascinating on all counts. 810.".

Frailty has and I consider it to be a dangerous one.1st of all the movie gives for more than three quarters the impression that it's all about a misled maybe psychotic father who utilizes his position of power to mislead his two children to serve his own irrational and monstrous belief. After we see him as a quite normal and caring dad he introduces them to a holy vision he had and later they see what's about the great plan of god with him  killing people who are demons.It seems to have been in order to let us share in the sad and painful life of two children which had the bad luck to grow up in a Christian fanatics' family with a most heavily psychotic father and some of us may agree that from what the rest of the world hears and sees about life in America it is not uncommon there to grow up like this.Even to show us a metaphor of how easy naive minds especially children can be brainwashed by others who are socially powerful or talented enough to persuade them of the most perverted and irrational ideas imaginable and what other label could be given to those demon fantasies from the darkest middle age and earlier than irrational the movie works very seriously for nearly one and a half hour even if there are some mild supernatural reminiscences which could declare everything as pure fantasy which it is but actually do not.Then in the last chapter  I hope so much for the creators that they only intended box office quotes and not Christian sympathy points  the real dangerous part the mysteryforrealpart begins. It is revealed that every psychotic and perverted belief of the father every cruel act he did to his son and his victims was righteous and good. Yes the movie also sanctions the unacceptable deeds of the psychopath and his traumatically indoctrinated offspring as THE WILL OF GOD. The young son's decision to kill his father we think he did it to stop the serial killing it exposes to be an act of a demon to save his demonic friends. He will grow up to a serial killer demon who seeks attention of his holy brother to be rightfully distroyed.Good twist but what an awful attitude is behind. The world is full of demons which deserve to be destroyed since when is the demon destroyed when the body is killed I ask all exorcists because of a single man's visions. And the more realistic ! twist where the movie would have the chance to change its direction in particular that it turns out dad's visions were a hoax from the devil and dad is one of the demons and the crimes of his victims false visions sent by the evil this twist is missing and I fear I know why  the Highest granted license to kill no joke intended.It would seem that I'm taking this too seriously. But this movie looks like a social drama for just too long too serious too well made. I must take it seriously at a certain point. Especially when it turns out to be a PROPAGANDA FILM for something a modern civilized human regardless of hisher religion should stand against. Literally demonizing other people is not only a sign of mental illness it is de facto a part of how politics are made since ever to get inconveniently people out of the way for ever. And I think we must stand against this not only by ignoring it but pointing at it and saying WRONG.You could say this is only a small budget horrormystery flick and it was no block buster take it easy. Only to the second I can agree with a little ease. But when I see that number of reviews 440 and ratings 27000 here my ease is already flown away.Would it not be so problematic I would have given 7 or even 8 stars for decent acting and directing instead of 1.".

Other than that this movie was just fine.Bill Paxton plays Dad. He's never given a first name but that is not a weakness of the film.

He has a vision one day which he says was sent from god telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons Fenton MeiksMatt OLeary and Adam Meiks Jeremy Sumpter must fine the demons and kill them. The demons look like normal people which they kill and this makes the viewer wonder if Dad has just lost his mind or is he really doing god's work. There are scenes that reflect both points which adds to the confusion and gives the film more suspense.The story is told in flashback by one of the sons who is now grown up Matthew McConaughey and is speaking with FBI agent Wesley Doyle Powers Booth who is very skeptical and rightfully so. After all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is.The film has many twists and Bill Paxton directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest. The acting is incredible. The two young leads and Paxton work great together looking like a normal family even though they are all involved in murder. Like I said there is the one implausibility involving Powers Booth's character but it really isn't a big thing. This was an extremely well made film involving faith and family.".

'Frailty' is the story of a family of serial killers who behave like a lowclass American family drawn crazy by the father's religious visions. However unsane and fantastic this seems we have heard worse in the news already. The film is worth watching though I confess it is not exactly my genre neither my preferred style. Bill Paxton plays the lead role and he also directs in what seems to be his first major movie. Directing is a little bit HBO style with a touch of XFiles. I hate story telling in the background and this movie has a lot of it. Having children involved in the making of such a dark movie is problematic but well this is what the story is about... The script is interesting enough to keep interest it has twists and surprises that compensate the conventional cinema making that dominates the movie. The final message is rather ambiguous and I am wondering if some viewers may take it as a kind of justification for serial killing on religious basis though this may not have been at all the intention.Not bad overall. 710 on my personal scale.".

He feels they only want to fight and play rugby and while he tries to be the same he feels he was never cut out to be a farmer or a rugby player. Instead he prefers to dream about an imaginary life in outer space. In this world a turnip paddock becomes a lunar landscape and a cow's tail a head of beautiful blonde hair which transforms him into Lana the heroine of his favorite TV show. With the arrival of Roy the class freak and Jamie the sexy young farm laborer Billy's world is changed forever.

This may not translate well to the world outside Central Otago New Zealand  but for a local there's a lot to recognise. A 'coming of age' film it is but it is also a lot more. It's a brave telling of the true childhood stories that we tend not to allow to see the light of adulthood. The actors achieve the perfect balance between the paradoxical naivety and knowingness characteristic of the early teenage years. They inspired me with the bravery of their sometimes misguided idealism and the story leads them to expose through their inevitable frustrations a lot of the senselessness of the restrictions of our narrow society. I loved the relative absence of developed adult roles. The children were not only the main protagonists but with the unwavering focus on their story their view became ours  no translation required. Those who would criticise the 'cheesy low budget spaceshow' scenes woven throughout the film must surely have forgotten the fantasies of their own childhood or perhaps they never needed to resort to fantasy to escape an alltoorestrictive daily reality. These sequences really were very funny in all of their overt symbolism.The bravery and incredible sincerity of the outcast character Roy played with unwavering emotional and physical conviction by Jay Collins struck a chord with me. The tragedy of his determination was almost too much to bear.I found the shifting of accent for the character Jamie played by Michael Dorman a little jarring. Somehow South Auckland Polynesian circa 2005 segued into Aussie Battler a few too many times for me to suspend disbelief.The filming in the stunning wilds of Central Otago captured the vast emptiness of the place beautifully. The characters owned the terrain there was nothing else there. The intense colour saturation reinforced the historical nature of the film It was set in the 70's. The drought and the constant threat of fire added beautifully to the undertone of tension. Something might go wrong.Stories like this need to be told over and over in all their variety and colour. I loved sitting in our local cinema surrounded by teenagers from the school at which I teach and seeing them enjoying and responding to the message to be themselves. New Zealand is perhaps coming of age too to see a feature film of this nature to fruition.Anyone with a curiosity for the culture of this isolated southern island would do well to catch this film. It adds a new chapter to the story of where we come from as told in the likes of The Piano Heavenly Creatures and Once Were Warriors. Fabulous.".

	schema:reviewBody "This comingout story of 12yearold Billy is set in rural New Zealand in 1975. Actually it's more of a Bildungsroman because it's no secret to anyone that Billy is gay. His family and friends accept him for who he is but he's having problems at school.We follow Billy as he shows us his home family and childhood friends mainly tomboy Lou and his school life where he is bullied and struggling with his dislike of rugby.We follow him as he experiences his first relationship with fellow pufter Roy and his first crush on older and completely unobtainable Jamie played by a sexy young Michael Dorman.50 Ways has an incredibly strong sense of time and place. I can't remember any movie that so successfully reconstructs the 1970s. The clothes the haircuts the town scenes the homes  it was all spot on. There was even a fondue dinner. Am I imagining it but did the cinematography somehow reproduce the quality and texture of photographs from the 1970s? Movie goers are also treated to almost two hours of beautiful New Zealand landscape.Main seems to have directed this movie using a group of rural New Zealand children. The line between fiction and documentary is a thin one. The child actors in this movie appeared only in this movie and almost nowhere else. How often do you see real children acting out a graphic gay comingofage movie? How did Main accomplish this? I think this would have been unthinkable in puritan America wouldn't it? For this reason alone the film is remarkable.The realism is astonishing. This is not a phony afterschool special school. These are not American movie children. These are children without guile and sophistication without internet without MTV. Main shows us children and school life as they really were with all its complexities difficulties and awkwardness. Sure the acting was occasionally amateurish or the dialogue a little forced but for the most part I felt like I was watching a real group of New Zealand children ca. 1975.Andrew Paterson Harriet Beattie and Jay Collins  I'd like you to thank you for playing in this movie. You did a great job. Your characters will remain with me for a long time.I found the film to be moving engrossing relevant. I thought the movie had good character development and a few interesting plot twists. The complex and problematic relationship between soft Billy and tough Lou was the core of the movie. We outgrow our childhood friends as we discover ourselves.Main doesn't sugar coat what it's like to grow up gay. It's a rich and full look at every aspect. Billy's hopeless and awkward crush on Jamie felt true. I felt really sorry for hapless Roy. Billy's difficulties with Roy and Jamie reflect core relationship issues that reverberate throughout every gay man's life. The struggle with rugby and what that represents is also familiar. Adults play a very minor role in this movie. Isn't that also accurate for gay teenagers? What I particularly liked was the way that Main explored how we come to terms with those dreaded words pufter faggot queer or whatever. What does that really mean? And Yes that is what I am. Dealing with those words is a big part of growing up.At times the director introduces some whimsy mostly based on the theme of Billy's imagined fantasies of a television show similar to Lost in Space. Billy identifies with Lana Lou identifies with Brad. It's difficult to know what to make of such a deliberate and inyourface use of cheese in a movie like this. I have to confess I was also into these shows when I was a kid. Or perhaps I have a high threshold for cheese. I think it's accurate to make a television show the centre of a boy's imagination in the 1970s.I see the movie has not got a strong score on IMDb. However I wouldn't let this dissuade you from seeing it. Gay movies tend to get inexplicably and undeservedly low scores. Worth seeing!".

	schema:reviewBody "Stewart Main's production is a comingofage story that bears little resemblance to other typical and predictable movies. 12 yearold Billy idly watches a TV show with his best friend a rather tomboyish girl who excels at boys sports and acts a bit manly. Inspired by what he sees on TV Billy wears a fake ponytail and pretends to be Lana the heroine of the scifi series while Lou the girl poses as the male hero. They subvert traditional gender affiliated roles as part of a game but they are also aware of a certain otherness a certain counterpart that can exist only in private.The figure of the double largely described in fantastic literature is usually developed when the main character fails to recognize his ownself and starts experiencing a feeling of alienation. The double can adopt several forms as for instance the form of the exact replica of the character like in Dostoyevsky's The double or on the contrary it can become the form of an absence of reflection in the mirror image a horrifying 'presence' as in Maupassant's Le Horla. Clearly Billy and his friend Lou find an ideal refugee in the form of fictional characters that supply that which they are lacking Billy is a boy that wishes to be a girl and Lou is a girl that wishes to be a boy.In this scenario two other characters will help develop the dynamic of the double. First of all is Roy the new kid in the school who soon becomes attracted to Billy. A most revealing moment takes place when Roy is picked on by kids that held him to the ground as a consequence of all this roughhousing the young boy exhibits an erection that soon makes the other lads lose interest in him. This moment is defined by the emergence of sexual excitation in Roy's penis an irruption of the drive of the real in his body such pulsations also exist in Billy who stays behind and accepts Roy's invitation to touch his stiffy.Do they experiment joy only through phallic exploration? The phallus has no image the absence of representation in the visual field signifies that in everything that is imaginary localization the phallus appears in the form of a lack. As the days go by Billy is not acquitted of guilt but nonetheless he decides to join his friend Roy in a shack wherein they mutually masturbate. But why does Billy seem uncomfortable after these sessions? Perhaps because if the phallus 'is characterized by a lack' then any image would only 'mask' that lack evoking something which is absent and in principle one can define that absence as something that pertains to our bodily existence in so far as what is missing in the virtual image is our real existence itself. In the same way Billy can never truly be Lana from the TV show he cannot envision his acts with Roy except in the darkness and secrecy of the shack. But what part of our anatomy permits the distinction between oneself and one's own image including the multitude of others with whom we tend to identify? It is this distinction that seems to get distorted and somewhat effaced in the phenomenon of the double.The second important character in the story is Jamie a guy in his twenties. As soon as he enters into the scene Billy seems to forget all about Roy. He now starts daydreaming about this guy this strange adult that could eventually pay some attention to him. But before Billy can get closer to Jamie he must first decide if he should adopt the male or the female position which is basically the same decision Lou has to make. As the relationship with Roy deteriorates new problems will arise. The double again could signal the coming of ominous events.".

	schema:reviewBody "On September 8 2005 at the Toronto International Film Festival TIFF I had the chance to see the world premiere of the film 50 Ways of Saying Fabulous. Based on the Novel by Graeme Aitken 50 Ways of Saying Fabulous is a comingofage film set in the '70s in rural Australia.It stars Andrew Paterson as Billy a chubby thirteen yearold kid who's interests are different from the regular kids in his school.While all the other kids are interested becoming rugby stars Billy dreams of becoming a character in a children's TV show quite similar to Lost in Space. Normally  this would lead to a lot of criticism from his classmates but Billy's best friend just happens to be Lou Harriet Beattie  his cousin and the best rugby player in the school.So Billy lives blissfully in his own little world fauxponytail and all until the arrival of puberty. Add to that a few new faces and a few unexpected twists and Billy's life will never be the same.Great effort was made to keep the look of Australia in the mid seventies. Everything from the clothing to the cars  looked authentic. Impressive  considering that this was not a big budget film. The Director Stewart Main has a love for his homeland and it shows  as Australia is filmed beautifully. In particular  the night scenes are reminiscent of the older days of filming and not the normal night  blue lighting we've become accustomed to seeing.At the screening the director said he wanted to make a film that would appeal to all audiences young and old. That brought about a very quick response from a member of the audience Not in America! This film deals with friendship homosexuality love and lust. While it's far from an explicit film its subject matter will prevent it from showing up any multiplex in America. In Canada on the other hand the film already has distribution rights. So unlike many TIFF films this one will be coming soon to a store near you.The film is not without it's problems. Although it has a healthy mix of imagination humour and charm the end lacks punch. And while it does try to rise above the genre it has an unattractive me too quality. It doesn't offer anything truly unique like the intensity of the movie Thirteen or the cattiness of Mean Girls.That doesn't mean I didn't like the film. The actors were all wonderful. The cinematography was great.It's not a film worth going to a theatre to see but it is a film worth seeing. A nice rental.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a classic example of why I hate what has happened to Canadian film.On the upside you have some talented andor notable actors Colm Feore Jennifer Tilly and some others I recognize only by face and still know only by face because the character names are irrelevant and the characters are throwaway so I can't even match them up on IMDb.This apparent makework project was funded in part by the Canadian Film or Video Tax Credit an Ontario film tax credit and Telefilm Canada. And yet it was not filmed on location in Canada  only the UK and Nevada. It wasn't even SET in Canada. Go figure. I don't know whether to praise them for actually filming on location for once in Nevada at least don't ask me what the UK stuff was for because it wasn't in the plot or curse them for funding what is essentially a foreign film with Canadian tax credits.The editor in this film needs to be called out for exceptionally bad editing. On the one hand the film would have been better as a short. It is about an hour too long for the story it tells given that there is absolutely no characterization. We see lots of shots of blurry traffic lights. Lots of mysterious medical stuff. Even the opening credits drag on and on and on such that you might actually miss the movie title. Then there's the endless repetitions on the order of 10 times each of the women individually getting embryos implanted the women individually looking at pictures of children the women individually reacting to news the women doing this the women doing that. WE GET IT ALREADY  IT!!! At the same time most of the shots in the film last for about 2 seconds. The longest one that I noticed was about 5 seconds. It's like watching a really bad music video with no music. Last the scenes were presented in what appeared to be a random order. Even what ultimately turned out to be flashbacks were not in order. It was very confusing for the group I watched it with.And can I just say that the sound was awful? What's with the random whooshing and gurgling effects? How does that add to anything at all? Were we at sea and I just didn't notice? I'm pretty sure Las Vegas is in a desert.The plot of course is completely absurd in several ways.1. Anyone who has ever had to give a urine sample in their life knows that when you give that sample surely just as when you give a sperm sample you are given a prelabeled container so there can be no mistake or even better you actually write your name yourself on the container. There is very little room for error unless you yourself make the error and that almost requires intent.2. For a clinic serving apparently only 10 or so couples why would there ever be 10 rooms in which to obtain samples and why would they all be occupied at the same time? Floor space costs money. Rooms cost money. They would have at most three rooms and the men would be scheduled some time apart to allow for cleanup in between.3. We are told several times that the children look not just like siblings but like twins or like they all have the same mother not just the same father. And yet this is not resolved. Surely someone would have wanted to know whose eggs were actually used given the screwups with the sperm. It would have made for a more interesting film if the women had turned out to in fact all be or mostly be involuntary surrogates.4. We're supposed to believe that all of these people and the gay men in particular because they obviously have no relation at all to the kids do not file suit and do not press charges against the doctor the assistant and the clinic? Are you kidding me? These people went to great lengths to have children biologically related to them. If they wanted to adopt there are many babies in the US and frankly from around the world Haiti anyone? that could be adopted. They did not want that. There was no indication during this film that they had changed their opinion about that once the children were born. Keep in mind that whoever sues first is going to get the cash leaving the rest without any way to recover and certainly without any inheritance from Dr. Dad the supersperm factory.So no I didn't like it.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is a classic example of why I hate what has happened to Canadian film.On the upside you have some talented andor notable actors Colm Feore Jennifer Tilly and some others I recognize only by face and still know only by face because the character names are irrelevant and the characters are throwaway so I can't even match them up on IMDb.This apparent makework project was funded in part by the Canadian Film or Video Tax Credit an Ontario film tax credit and Telefilm Canada. And yet it was not filmed on location in Canada  only the UK and Nevada. It wasn't even SET in Canada. Go figure. I don't know whether to praise them for actually filming on location for once in Nevada at least don't ask me what the UK stuff was for because it wasn't in the plot or curse them for funding what is essentially a foreign film with Canadian tax credits.The editor in this film needs to be called out for exceptionally bad editing. On the one hand the film would have been better as a short. It is about an hour too long for the story it tells given that there is absolutely no characterization. We see lots of shots of blurry traffic lights. Lots of mysterious medical stuff. Even the opening credits drag on and on and on such that you might actually miss the movie title. Then there's the endless repetitions on the order of 10 times each of the women individually getting embryos implanted the women individually looking at pictures of children the women individually reacting to news the women doing this the women doing that. WE GET IT ALREADY  IT!!! At the same time most of the shots in the film last for about 2 seconds. The longest one that I noticed was about 5 seconds. It's like watching a really bad music video with no music. Last the scenes were presented in what appeared to be a random order. Even what ultimately turned out to be flashbacks were not in order. It was very confusing for the group I watched it with.And can I just say that the sound was awful? What's with the random whooshing and gurgling effects? How does that add to anything at all? Were we at sea and I just didn't notice? I'm pretty sure Las Vegas is in a desert.The plot of course is completely absurd in several ways.1. Anyone who has ever had to give a urine sample in their life knows that when you give that sample surely just as when you give a sperm sample you are given a prelabeled container so there can be no mistake or even better you actually write your name yourself on the container. There is very little room for error unless you yourself make the error and that almost requires intent.2. For a clinic serving apparently only 10 or so couples why would there ever be 10 rooms in which to obtain samples and why would they all be occupied at the same time? Floor space costs money. Rooms cost money. They would have at most three rooms and the men would be scheduled some time apart to allow for cleanup in between.3. We are told several times that the children look not just like siblings but like twins or like they all have the same mother not just the same father. And yet this is not resolved. Surely someone would have wanted to know whose eggs were actually used given the screwups with the sperm. It would have made for a more interesting film if the women had turned out to in fact all be or mostly be involuntary surrogates.4. We're supposed to believe that all of these people and the gay men in particular because they obviously have no relation at all to the kids do not file suit and do not press charges against the doctor the assistant and the clinic? Are you kidding me? These people went to great lengths to have children biologically related to them. If they wanted to adopt there are many babies in the US and frankly from around the world Haiti anyone? that could be adopted. They did not want that. There was no indication during this film that they had changed their opinion about that once the children were born. Keep in mind that whoever sues first is going to get the cash leaving the rest without any way to recover and certainly without any inheritance from Dr. Dad the supersperm factory.So no I didn't like it.";

The Las Vegas setting feels like a silly place for a fertility clinic unless the satire of the story is trying to make concept of taking a gamble more conspicuous.

	schema:headline " Truly an example of a good war film";
	schema:reviewBody "Considering this is a film about the Yugoslav wars particularly the Croatian war for Independence made in a Balkan nation shortly after the war I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a typical war film focusing on demonizing the other side Serbs Bosniaks and rewriting the history books like Undeground or Pretty Village Pretty Flame. But instead the film does not vilify anyone nor create a victim complex. The film is focused on a group of Yugoslav soldiers who plan to join the effort of fighting for the country's Croatia Independence defecting from the Yugoslav army. Other Croats seem to view it their duty to uphold Yugoslav unity and stay. Without spoiling anything the viewpoints of both proIndependence Croats and proYugoslavia Croats is given a humane view. Betray your fellow soldiers or your fellow people? The film is neither anti nor pro Yugoslavia. Truly a breath of fresh air in terms of a war film. Carnage is into the focus but the complicated life decisions each character is making as the war unravels.".

It's horrible enough to hear the details of the TateLaBianca murders being recounted and to see the vicious empty look in the eyes of Charlie's girls as they brandish guns and spout their guru's philosophy...but that's not all this documentary has to offer. Indeed it poses a question of even greater importance than Manson's crimes what happened in the '60s? Why did it all end so badly? The soundtrack performed by former Family members Little Paul Watkins at one time Manson's righthand man and Brooks Poston consists of slow slightly cornysounding but haunting and utterly apt acoustic songs. Have you ever wondered what you were here for? Watkins solemnly intones during the opening theme. Have you ever wondered 'Is there more?' Later talking about his involvement with Manson Watkins says frankly I thought Charlie was Jesus. It is at this point that the sociological question which meanders its way through the film like a deep dark river becomes apparent what made these young people feel so lost and confused that they needed a Christfigure and what made them believe that Charles Manson was the messiah they sought? I'm afraid that we lost the last of our innocence and goodwill at the end of the '60s...and that if we do not examine how flower power peace symbols and the Monterey Pop Festival led to sleaze the Manson murders and Altamont in the space of just two short years we'll never get it back.".

At that time many members of the family were free and still sticking together and were amazingly willing to appear in this documentary.This documentary offers a fascinating window into their world at times frolicking childlike in the wilderness dancing singing laughing swimming riding horses ... but at other times looking at the camera brandishing large rifles shotguns and hunting knives talking about love and killing and of course Manson.Perhaps the most mesmerizing of them is Squeaky Fromme who a few years later would be sent to prison for trying to assassinate President Gerald Ford though all of them are fascinating. The producers are careful to point out the solid often highly educated backgrounds of these women.Also interviewed are a couple of men who fled the family around the time of the TateLa Bianca murders who talk about life inside the family. There are also interviews with past cellmates of the women who tell often harrowing stories of things the murderous women told them.Underlying the movie is the stark generational divide of those times. While the past and present members of the family are young expressive and with a loose casual look the appearance of the prosecutor who tried the case  and whose own account of the trial Helter Skelter also a movie is the main source of information on the case  appears in a threepiece suit an earnest tone of voice and melodramatic mannerisms.If you're wondering why the Manson phenomenon happened don't watch this hoping for an answer. And if you're looking for more information don't bother. But if you want to see the people involved hear them speak and find out how they thought by all means give it a watch.An excellent documentary largely forgotten nowadays alas.".

	schema:reviewBody "This documentary not only captures the deranged philosophy of the Manson family but it looks sleazy overall.  Much of the footage is grainy and unsteady adding to the brittle feel of the movie but the interviews with Manson's followers speak for themselves.  Makes for interesting viewing in conjunction with Gimmie Shelter which documented the clash of hippie culture and violent bikers at the Rolling Stones concert at Altamont Speedway.  Both of these events signalled the end of the flower power movement but these two movies seem to point out the danger that mindaltering drugs can pose to suggestible kids.  Indeed a lot of the interviews contained in Manson outline the essential role of marijuana and acid in the lifestyle of the family and the film clearly posits that Manson used drugs as well as sex to brainwash his followers.  What's most terrifying about this movie are the candid appearances of the Manson women staring wideeyed and generally behaving like automatons.  The time was clearly right for an evil individual such as Charles Manson to invade a supposedly peaceloving culture like the hippies stoned and generally aimless and orchestrate chaos and the altered state that these people were in clearly contributed to their own propensity for disillusion and mind control.  What comes off as mostly lacking is the depiction of Manson himself. Although the filmmakers give plenty of background on him the bizarre images of this man contained in the film do very little to give an accurate depiction of how he must have appeared to his followers.  I was haunted by the lingering question of what could possibly have motivated Charles Manson to orchestrate these heinous murders and even worse is to think that his wishes were carried out by kids who came from seemingly normal backgrounds.The use of splitscreen as well as the flower power soundtrack add to the quintessentially 70s feel of the movie but even through all the kitschy hippie images the shocking nature of the murders and the tragic phenomenon of Manson's cult remains.  It left me feeling dirty and disturbed after watching it.".

This film also has very creative cinematography making extensive use of threepanel screens and bold primary colors saturating the frames.

I had read Helter Skelter about 8 times and knew just about everything about the Manson case. I finally was able to see the twisted Family members being interviewed shown skinnydipping and sewing dancing around and having sex! Squeaky Fromme Sandy Good Nancy Pittman Capistrano Mary Brunner Clem Bruce Davis Charles Manson and plenty of witnesses are interviewed giving grotesquely fascinating details about life in the Family. This is just too good to miss any true crime buff or anyone who wants to be scared by something that REALLY happened see this. It will give you the shivers.

I had read Helter Skelter about 8 times and knew just about everything about the Manson case. I finally was able to see the twisted Family members being interviewed shown skinnydipping and sewing dancing around and having sex! Squeaky Fromme Sandy Good Nancy Pittman Capistrano Mary Brunner Clem Bruce Davis Charles Manson and plenty of witnesses are interviewed giving grotesquely fascinating details about life in the Family. This is just too good to miss any true crime buff or anyone who wants to be scared by something that REALLY happened see this. It will give you the shivers.

The family is what really makes this documentary stand apart as we get interviews with several family members as they discuss the power of Manson.The interviews with the family members were certainly the most fascinating thing because you can't help but wish that the police had just dropped a bunch of bombs on these freaks when they went to arrest Manson for the car theft. As were told the group was arrested for lesser charges because they were eventually charged with the murders that were committed.It was rather creepy watching these family members as they talk about their plans including killing Frank Sinatra.

I am not condoning any actions of Manson or any other...but the big time murderers and criminals wear the suit and ties and reside on wall street and in the halls of congress and our justice system in general. As for the filmit has wonderfulhaunting music of a time that mankind almost got it right. With a war for profit that has turned into a nightmarish quagmire and an evil leader like Bush at the helm...can more bloodshed and cults be far behind? This film is an excellent example of what happens when you have a very disenchanted population...and far worse times are ahead for us. We need to get back to the idealism and activism of the 60's before our country falls prey to a fascist dictatorship led by Bush. Wake up. This film is a wonderful time piece and a blueprint about what happens when the American dream turns into the American nightmare. It most definitely needs to be restored and rereleased for a generation that needs to understand what happens when people give up hope.".

Then I read that NOT A FRAME OF THIS FILM WAS FAKE!!! Basically you get to see actual footage of the Spahn Ranch as well as home movies and court footage featuring the real Manson family in their time. I don't know who shot the sequence of Squeaky Fromm holding a shotgun and warning snitches to watch their backs but it's so unbelievably stark you wouldn't believe it. This is an iconic excellent documentary about the Manson family murders that shows you in detail what exactly occurred during that terrible time and the raging social forces that led up to the family's shocking murders. This film deeply influenced Van Bebber's 'Charlie's Family' aka 'The Manson Family' which is another amazing interpretation of these events.".

This is the only film that captures the family at it's height. For those of you who say there was no family I use this term to encompass the entire group that worked with Manson. It is also a fantastic vision for why people and countries need to think on their own. These sheep who were lead to slaughter were led there because of their inability to think for themselves. Most of these people were women. We must remember that this case predates the modern feminist movement by five years. So it was more likely that certain women would be able to put under the influence of a manipulative genius...or a scummy little excon. Not that this couldn't happen today...except for certain sociological reasons it really actually couldn't.There is more to this case but the problem is a lot of the books on this case are badly written...so be it...my recommendations are Taming the Beast and Helter Skelter...also The Family has a ton of information but is quite simply one of the worst written books on earth.The Film gets a little lost and the end and begins to meander but one can attribute this to the druggy feel of this film rather then the fact that the filmmakers may have run out of things to say on this film.What also makes this film interesting is that most of the women do seem extremely intelligent Mary Brunner and Gypsy should be excluded. It is too bad that these filmmakers couldn't or wouldn't get interviews with the families of these women. This would have pushed this film towards perfection maybe even making it a perfect documentary.There are also a few mysteries that go along with this film. One is why is this not a really well known documentary? Another is Why have there never been a soundtrack released and why has this never been released on DVD officially? Also there is the murder of one of the filmmakers in the parking lot of an acting school that Sharon Tate had attended. Also there have never been any interviews of the filmmakers and there never seems to be any evidence of say the critical reviews of this film. We must remember this film was nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary so someone seems to have seen this film. I guess no one wanted to discuss it.If you are thinking of buying this film go for it...you wouldn't regret it... it will chill you to the bone and make you laugh because of it's narration...".

	schema:headline " Great work which raises important questions ... not for the masses";
	schema:reviewBody "This film deals with some outright delusional and mean people and anti social reality's.The music is played by Paul Watkin's and a friend friends name I don't know? and not Charles Manson. Pauls music is cool. It is not Charles Mansos's music as some unaware user posted. I think the film and the music are both fantastic!where can I get a copy of this soundtrack? I own much Manson music much of it recorded illegally and under stressful conditions to say the least. Manson's music not in this film is crazy but also Charles Manson's music is damn good. This film is not suitable for children obviously and I do not recommend it to glorify violence either. Yet I do recommend this film for the sake of free thought and expression. If you can open your mind enough to actually listen to CD's like Charles MansonCommemoration you may be pleasantly surprised. It is in this same spirit that I highly recommend this film. We need to keep it real people. Snoop Dog was on trial for murder yet he raps to the tune of millions. President Bush started a war which has needlessly killed thousands of innocent women children and men both American's and Iraqi's based upon false existence of WMD's and their imminent threat to our lives. See a pattern here the media creates drama and fear and in Manson they struck a goldmine which is still plundered today ala 2007. This nation that I love but I must admit also was founded upon the blood of innocent murdered brutalized and butchered Indian's and enslaved tortured raped and beaten African Americans. So come on down from that hi white tower the world is beautiful and everybody should just get along and be like welloff white people BS.. The point in my rant excuses extended is not to justify or explain away any of the savage violence these maniacs committed I don't care how many tabs of acid I dropped nobody could ever convince me to murder in cold blood or believe he was Jesus!... the point is to look at it from a new angle. If you have already made up your mind or had it made for you by the immoral media which floods our psyches with fear and garbage in this country then honest reflection will bear out that you needn't bother either. Watkins by the way went on to do many good works lecturing against substance abuse anti social tendencies and the threat of cults like the Manson family presented here. Watkins left the clan before all the killing started and he saw it coming. His interview segments and his music alone make this worth viewing again. I recommend it with liquor. Peace.".

Pauls music is cool. It is not Charles Mansos's music as some unaware user posted. I think the film and the music are both fantastic!where can I get a copy of this soundtrack? I own much Manson music much of it recorded illegally and under stressful conditions to say the least. Manson's music not in this film is crazy but also Charles Manson's music is damn good. This film is not suitable for children obviously and I do not recommend it to glorify violence either. Yet I do recommend this film for the sake of free thought and expression. If you can open your mind enough to actually listen to CD's like Charles MansonCommemoration you may be pleasantly surprised. It is in this same spirit that I highly recommend this film. We need to keep it real people. Snoop Dog was on trial for murder yet he raps to the tune of millions. President Bush started a war which has needlessly killed thousands of innocent women children and men both American's and Iraqi's based upon false existence of WMD's and their imminent threat to our lives. See a pattern here the media creates drama and fear and in Manson they struck a goldmine which is still plundered today ala 2007. This nation that I love but I must admit also was founded upon the blood of innocent murdered brutalized and butchered Indian's and enslaved tortured raped and beaten African Americans. So come on down from that hi white tower the world is beautiful and everybody should just get along and be like welloff white people BS.. The point in my rant excuses extended is not to justify or explain away any of the savage violence these maniacs committed I don't care how many tabs of acid I dropped nobody could ever convince me to murder in cold blood or believe he was Jesus!... the point is to look at it from a new angle. If you have already made up your mind or had it made for you by the immoral media which floods our psyches with fear and garbage in this country then honest reflection will bear out that you needn't bother either. Watkins by the way went on to do many good works lecturing against substance abuse anti social tendencies and the threat of cults like the Manson family presented here. Watkins left the clan before all the killing started and he saw it coming. His interview segments and his music alone make this worth viewing again. I recommend it with liquor. Peace.";

	schema:headline " Vincent Bugliosi's Wet Dream...Now With Extra Hype";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1969 a group of drugaddled hippies committed a string of murders in Los Angeles County the first to get their money back from a dope deal gone bad the rest as a pot inspired halfarsed ploy to smokescreen the police. A deputy district attorney named Vincent Bugliosi was desperate to make a name for himself. A marriage was made in headlines. Bugliosi knew the story at face value wasn't salacious enough to sell books so he began to fabricate an intricate yarn tying the whole mess to a career convict that these stoner dropouts had been following around. He dazzled the press with grandiose tales of a flowerpower Jesus figure who brainwashed cleancut middleclass kids with sex and LSD and ordered the enslaved to commit murders out of an apocalyptic racewar paranoia. Also involved in this wild fable were an English recording group called the Beatles who gave this Mescaline Messiah his visions through a whitejacketed double album featuring the song Helter Skelter. In the process Bugliosi turned a petty criminal named Charlie Manson into a creation of media mythology named Charles Manson Evil Incarnate.There are some good reasons for Manson enthusiasts to watch this movie there is extensive footage of the Spahn Ranch and the remaining stragglers from the socalled Manson Family. The interviews with Sandra Good and Danny Bonaducedoppelganger Lynette Squeaky Fromme are amusing as they feed into Bugliosi's madeforTV mythos of hippiesturned killers by mugging with various deadly weapons. But the ringmaster here is clearly Bugliosi and his spin on the events which is obvious from his shameless hamming for the camera from first introductory shot. And the obnoxious narrator sounds like a drunken Jack Webb inflecting overt judgement at every turn I get especially nauseous when he fawns about beautiful honeyblonde Sharon Tate or derisively snides that Manson's girls think everyone should have a father like Charlie. The interviews with the visibly high Paul Watkins are especially insipid as he leans on his everpresent flute trying to remember what Bugliosi orchestrated revisioning of family philosophy he's parroting.For anyone trying to suss out what actually happened that summer of 1969 look elsewhere. Anyone interested in seeing a contemporary slab of propaganda released for the sole purpose of exploiting Vincent Bugliosi's nascent wet dream this is for you.".

The most recent one being marijuana in a way of it having socalled medicinal properties.I think Manson tells us of how with any act of society in legalizing hallucinogenic drugs would come a great influence on the mindset of our youth and in such a way as is readily seen in this documentary. I also think the film tells us of how the family in it's attempt to mask any emotions pertaining to scary reality digresses down to a living hell by first having contact with the gateway drug marijuana and then proceeding on with more potent drug associations thereafter.The storyline is unbelievably real. A frightening account of youth having fun until everything homicidally slips out of their control.".
