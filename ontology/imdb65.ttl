Well I should say it does not look like a real slavery but more likely being in a prison. However the film focuses on the attempt of adaptation into life with flashbacks to the old imprisoned days . How could she be able to once again get used to her real life? Everyone feels guilty and a bit anxious about this thing happen. And Gaelle realize that will be not easy but she have to be strong and the only chance she has it's herself.While I try to summarize the story maybe you could understand that the scenario is not quite original. I've seen similar and better films especially in French cinema like Les Amants Crminelles of Franois Ozon. So what can be more valuable than the script is either characters or the director's ability to turn it into a good movie. For the characters although we have few of them we can feel only Gaelle who has a real character. Vincent or Gaelle's mother are just like someone who serve to story but without any identity. For director's ability I should say the editing of the movie is kind of failure. He mixed up the story so we go forward and backward into the time but still the movie has some problems of the scenes where action goes so quickly and you do not know how to relate them with the previous or next one. For instance the scene with Gaelle when she first comes to Vincent's cave one can think that she is another girl which makes Vincent even more psycho.

Armelle has waking dreams where she sees her lost lover still in her life. One of her two sisters convinces her to see a medium where she runs into a man that looks eerily like her lost boyfriend.The film is quite quiet and very visual and is divided into separate scenes each shot in one continuous take with a single camera. I wouldn't say this film was quite to my taste but visually the film is very interesting and I could appreciate the director's artistry. Berthomier gave a good and very natural performance especially considering this was her first film.Notes from the QA apologies for any mistranslation as an interpreter wasn't available for the first part of the session  The film has just been added to the New York Film Festival.Civeyrac was originally working on another film but ran out of money. He met Camille Berthomier and very quickly came up with the script for this film especially as he had been carrying the story inside him for a long time. Meeting Berthomier made it easy to write.Civeyrac wanted to film Berthomier showing her singing and dancing she wasn't an actress at the time they met but he found it a good experience to work with someone fresh and graceful.I asked why he decided to shoot each scene in one take with a single camera Civeyrac said that this fit the reality and mental state of the story and that the single take creates a tranquil tone. The movie is also about her past existing in the present and this style helps to mix the two in her reality.Someone asked about whether the film intentionally seemed to allude to the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. Civeyrac said that it wasn't intentional especially since he more directly addressed it in his last film Tristesse beau visage but that film did continue to inform his thinking. In fact another story from the 16th century gave him more ideas for this film.The songs sung by Armelle were written by Berthomier herself.Picking the music for the film was a long process he loaded a lot of music on his computer and played around with what worked and what didn't. The editing process took 6 weeks which is long considering there are really only 10 shots all of which are continuous.Civeyrac was happiest about the last piece of music in the film The Unanswered Question by Charles Ives. It sounds quite modern but was in fact written in 1906.The film was shot on highdefinition video and optically transferred to 35mm film.Civeyrac had very little money to shoot the film so he used whatever free locations he could find. Those locations dictated the blocking for the shots. Detailerehearsalsls were done offsite and then they went onlocation to shoot with a 151 take ratio about a day per section of the film.The choice of the continuous shots was made to find a fluidity in movement like a spiral which ultimately goes to the forest at the end of the movie.Civeyrac didn't want it to be obvious that each scene is a continuous shot as he didn't want it to be seen as a performance or contrived but rather more simple and alive. The shots were planned out in advance with lots of marks on the ground there was no improvisation despite the actors looking so loose and comfortable. This is Civeyrac's normal style.His shots are not preconceived during the writing process rather he waits until he has his locations and actors.".

Shown at the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center October 2 2005.Shot in wide aspect ratio with pale amber filters Civeyrac's new film is a myth or elegant fable whose subjects are three pretty girls and a pretty boy. The main character is Armelle Camille Berthomier chattering naked on a bed in the first image of the film in which there are just ten shots set off by chapter headings where we glimpse only the wellformed naked butt of her lover Reynaud Aurlien Wiik. Suddenly the room darkens a storm rumbles and Armelle can't understand why. In the next shot Reynaud has died in an accident and Armelle's two other darkhaired sisters Roxanne Margane Hainaux and Brnice Alice Dubuisson are trying to talk Armelle into accepting her lover's death. One accompanies her to see a medium whereupon a Reynaud lookalike Hippolyte also Aurlien Wiik appears. Armelle next has awoken from a coma apparently brought on by taking pills and now she may have acquired special powers  including the ability to draw Hippolyte away from another woman to kiss her instead. In the last shot Armelle alone again goes to Reynaud whom she hears calling her from inside a forest. This new film by Civeyrac is beautiful elegant and classically French evoking Cocteau more than Rohmer. But treating its heavy theme of suffering and loss in a manner that's equivocal even frivolous and being after all only sixtyfive minutes long this latest work by the littleknown director who teaches in a prestigious French film school feels tantalizing and incomplete.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is something quite uncanny about  travers la fort. If you take a look at Camille Berthomier in her role in this movie as protagonist Armelle and compare her to Juliette Grco as Aglaonice leader of the Bacchantes in Jean Cocteau's Orphe you can see a quite striking resemblance in terms of looks facial expression and eventually hairstyle. Also of interest is that both movies are neoclassical and contain supernatural mirror tricks.Armelle is one of three sisters Brnice and Roxane are the others who bring to mind references such as the witch sisters of Macbeth or the three Graces Fates or Gorgons of classical mythology. The Graces are hinted at the most with the classical triangular arrangement employed when the sisters visit a bar. Although both Brnice and Roxane have men we never see them and the only time the other two sisters are on screen they complete a circle with Armelle that noone else enters. It's all the more potent then that Armelle's obsession with her dead boyfriend is rupturing the extreme valency of this unit.The feel of the movie is what's important here the movie pays absolutely no lip service to zeitgeist minimalist sets with few extras a movie that stays indoors until the climax and every scene is shot continuously to create an organic feeling. Someone once said that every edit is like an abrupt awakening from a dream here Civeyrac keeps the movie as dreamlike as possible.A question that arises for me from watching the movie is the nature of a woman's love which seems here to relate very much to the feeding of vanity and egotism by flattery where a man's role is simply to be the mirror mirror on the wall. As Sophie Marceau intoned in Possession The only thing women have in common is menstruation but I have certainly met one or two women who fall into the Armelle mould. travers la fort is very loosely based on neoclassicist Jean Racine's 1677 play Phdre where a woman is also driven mad by love and an innocent male character called Hippolyte in play and film is used by the female protagonist. The unusually named sisters of Armelle are also sourced from Racine Roxane from the play Bazajet and Brnice eponymously.It's a short film just over an hour but manages to build up a ferocity of madness by the end that is quite overwhelming. I also am an absolute sucker for films that use John Cage music in this case Two for Violin and Sho played by the great Irvine Arditti and Mayumi Miyata but most fittingly Charles Ives' The Unanswered Question.".

The premise of a woman who's boyfriend passes but is still somehow in contact with him creates an intriguing platform from where the director does many things well.In particular the somewhat supernatural and eerie mood was set right off the start with suspenseful music clever shots that made good use of light and darkness and a screenplay that flowed from piece to piece.A technique that the director used was to label each section of the movie with a chapter title. My feeling was this was not necessary and the story could flow without it. Moreover what it did was highlight the focus of the next section thus acting almost as a 'spoiler' to what might happen next. Yet this would not be my biggest beef. For me the movie didn't feel like it finished. I didn't realize the movie finished and hence felt that funding for the money forced the movie to end prematurely. At 65 minutes or so this was a fairly short feature film.While there were some interesting moments and ideas in this movie the lack of an 'ending' left me feeling unsatisfied with this movie.".

She would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of Il Duce.There is one exception though.

Forget about 'Todo sobre mi madre' and 'La vita e bella' as they are surpassed by 'Una Giornata Particolare' by lightyears.  It never gets ambitious nor pretentious in trying to capture the 'crucial problems of the world' but instead is an extensive characterstudy that I consider 2 B 1 of the most important films ever made not especially for its influence on cinema but for society and for people as human beings after all we ARE human. Cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis Lucky Luciano Morte a Venezia L'Innocente created a sober but beautiful and effective masterpiece and proves that the best films don't have to be expensive.Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni made a few other films together but this has to be their best.

It may not be very accessible you have to patient but I think I got the point the first time I saw it.  The day portrayed is not special because of the parade that's going on but because of the attention and interest two completely different people CAN have for each other IF they are open enough.  See for yourself if there ultimately arises real friendship.Recommendations are 'Il Conformista' 1970 Bertolucci and 'Amarcord' 1974 Fellini which also portray some human behaviour in the shadow of upcoming fascism but in a more visual way.

	schema:reviewBody "A SPECIAL DAY Ettore Scola  ItalyCanada 1977.Every once in a while you come across a film that really touches a nerve. This one offers a very simple premise almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time. It's surprising Ettore Scola's Una giornate particulare is relatively unheralded even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it 'rubbish' and Leonard Maltin somewhat milder 'pleasant but trifling.' I disagree not only because this film is deeply moving but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist Italy than most films I've seen. The cinematography is distinctly unflashy even a bit bland and the storyline straightforward which might explain the film's relative unpopularity. Considering late '70s audiences weren't exactly spoiled with great Italian films it's even stranger this one didn't really catch on with the critics.The film begins with a tenminute collage of archive footage from Hitler's visit to Italy on may 8th 1938. Set against this background we first meet Antonietta Loren a lonely loveridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building. One day when her Beo escapes she meets her neighbour Gabriele Mastroianni who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies. He is wellmannered cultured and soon she is attracted to him. During the whole film we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard. Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings. After the opening scene the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist hypermodern at the time apartment block seemingly searching for our main characters whom we haven't met yet. Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type. Canadian born John Vernon plays Loren's husband but he is only on screen in the first and last scene. I figure his voice must have been dubbed since he's not of Italian descent and never lived there to my knowledge so I cannot imagine he speaks Italian. If his voice has been dubbed I didn't notice at all. On the contrary he's completely believable as an Italian even more than the rest of the cast. The story is simple but extremely effective the performances are outstanding the ending is just perfect and the framing doesn't come off as overly pretentious but works completely. Don't miss out on this one.Camera Obscura  910".

	onyx:emotionText "A SPECIAL DAY Ettore Scola  ItalyCanada 1977.Every once in a while you come across a film that really touches a nerve. This one offers a very simple premise almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time. It's surprising Ettore Scola's Una giornate particulare is relatively unheralded even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it 'rubbish' and Leonard Maltin somewhat milder 'pleasant but trifling.' I disagree not only because this film is deeply moving but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist Italy than most films I've seen. The cinematography is distinctly unflashy even a bit bland and the storyline straightforward which might explain the film's relative unpopularity.

	schema:reviewBody "'Una Giornata Particolare' is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar I thought I had seen it more than once. Now that I finally I have seen it I am very glad. This is one of the better Italian movies I know with one of the most wonderful performances by Marcello Mastroianni who stars in other masterpieces such as 'La Dolce Vita' and '8 12' both from the great Federico Fellini. Directed by Ettore Scola this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day the day Adolf Hitler visited Rome.Marcello Mastroianni plays Gabriele the neighbor of Antonietta Sophia Loren. She is a member of Mussolini's party pretty fanatic in her thoughts and he is a member no more. The reason for that I will not reveal. On the day every person from their building including her husband and children is out to see Hitler they are still in the building. Antonietta's bird escapes and flies to Gabriele's apartment and this is how the two meet. Right before Antonietta went to Gabriele he thought of killing himself again for reasons I will not reveal. How the story develops from here I will not reveal but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day not the fact that Hitler is in Rome.Like I said Mastroianni has a wonderful performance. You see he is a man who desperately wants someone around him although at first we don't know why. May be he likes Antonietta may be he is in love with her may be there are other reasons. Antonietta feels what we feel. What does this man want from her? She likes the attention anyway. We see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man. Loren plays the scenes very good as well. We understand her questions although we can't be sure what her intentions are. The moments where we find out both their secrets if that is what you can call it is a great moment. How the story develops from there is even more interesting but I don't want to spoil it for you. This is a movie you should see. Great performances and a beautiful cinematography and the message it gives us still stands today.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's debatable whether the meeting of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini in Rome in 1938 was a special day but it was a day that changed the lives of Gabriele Marcello Mastroianni and Antonietta Sophia Loren. After seeing her extended family off to the parade Antonietta a depressed housewife meets Gabriele a radio broadcaster reviled by his neighbours for being a known antifascist an unusual and unpopular position in those days. Although a fascist sympathiser Antonietta can't attend the parade because of her domestic duties Gabriele stays home because he feels lonely in a country that considers him a criminal just for being different. In fact he feels so lonely he's about to commit suicide when Antonietta knocks on his door to ask for a strange favour. And that sets off a story about two desolate people knowing and finding emotional support in each other.A Special Day is mainly about life under fascism but it takes the unusual route of not demonizing it directly through ponderous preachy sermons. In fact fascism is depicted as a normal activity in the movie and fascists as ordinary people with children spouses jobs aspirations etc rather than monsters. The real deviant is Gabriele an intellectual who refuses to get on with the program not for particularly idealistic principles but for personal reasons carefully revealed throughout the movie.Antonietta's life isn't any easier just because her household is a fascist. With a husband and six children to take care of she has given up her dreams and happiness to serve others. Barely literate she resents the fact that her husband is cheating on her with a schoolmistress. Although living in a house full of people her entire personality expresses as much loneliness and sadness as Gabriele's. Loren's performance is particularly remarkable for the way she tones down her legendary beauty to become a pale wearylooking sunkeneyed woman in her midforties. If there's any doubt that Loren was an excellent dramatic actress this movie is proof.As the day marches on they discuss what it means to be happy tolerance freedom and human dignity. Hope arises when Antonietta learns to respect Gabriele and his differences in spite of everything she was taught to believe in. The movie is stagy and wordy taking place mostly inside dingy rooms as they move from one apartment to another and back always having conversations in which they lay bare their deepest fears dreams sorrows and views about life. But Mastroianni and Loren are on hypnotic mode here and even if the screenplay weren't outstanding already their performances should hold any viewer's attention in thrall.Director Ettore Scola however is no slouch. The movie after several minutes of original footage showing Hitler arriving in Rome opens with a long take that lasts almost five minutes the camera slowly moves across the faade of a building complex enters Antonietta's apartment and follows her as she wakes up each one of her children and gets them ready for the parade. The movie was appropriately shot in a complex built in the thirties with iron bars running along windows giving it the look of prison bars and yellowish apartments oppressively facing each other as if no tenant is safe from the prying eyes of neighbours. Like a stage play it may be but the attention to atmosphere makes up for dazzling camerawork exercises.Inside Antonietta's apartment is riddled with fascist motifs portraits of Mussolini banners and flags and religious art. It's a sharp contrast to Gabriele's apartment which shows abstract or degenerate as it was called at the time art hanging on the walls and piles of books. Their personalities are clearly delineated without waste of words. The movie tells a lot through pictures. Fascist and Nazi symbols are almost omnipresent around them and Antonietta even has a caged bird that symbolises their condition.Although it's a talking heads movie dramatic silence and noise are as much a part of it. Radios blare their announcements and songs at dramatic intervals and the air is awash with the cheers of distant crowds bringing the historical meeting into the lives of the two protagonists. All this subtlety makes A Special Day an unusual political movie. Political cinema always runs the risk of wearing its beliefs on its sleeve certain that an important message is enough and that things like aesthetics just get on the way of whatever point the filmmaker is trying to make from his pulpit.A Special Day is an entertaining deeply humanist movie whose politics are organically entwined with the story of two people searching for a new purpose in their lives. Anyone who's ever been treated unfairly just because he's different or anyone who simply opposes intolerance on moral grounds or deplores the curtailment of civil liberties cannot fail to be moved by this special movie.".

	schema:headline " Two lonely people give each other a brief moment of joy";
	schema:reviewBody "A Special Day is directed by Ettore Scola has a screenplay by Scola and Ruggero Maccari is produced by Carlo Ponti and stars Marcello Mastroianni Sophia Loren and John Vernon.Italy in 1938. Adolf Hitler travels to Italy to meet with Mussolini. His visit is treated as something special and many people gather to see him. Antonietta Sophia Lorenstays home while her husband John Vernonand six children go out for the day to attend the festivities.The families pet bird escapes out the window and Antonietta sees it has landed on the ledge of a neighbours apartment window. She goes round to the apartment and her arrival saves the man who lives there from committing suicide. The man she meets is GabrieleMarcello Mastroianni he's a homosexual who has been fired from his job because he is classed as an undesirable. He helps her get the bird back and the two get talking. As the day goes on they keep getting together and talking and learning about one another.Both are lonely people with a deep inner sadness Gabriele cannot be himself in public for fear of being arrested or worse he cannot find any happiness. Antonietta is worn out her husband no longer loves her for herself and her own happiness has had to be put to one side so she can devote all of her time and energy to looking after her family. The pair of them try and give one another some joy and comfort each lets the other know that they are not alone and that their lives are far from meaningless.The film becomes even more poignant when it becomes clear that Antonietta is falling in love with Gabriele. There is no way he can return her feelings yet at the same time doesn't want to hurt her by telling her they can't have anything together.This is one of the saddest films I've ever seen these two people are so lonely and if Gabriele were a straight man they would have made a good couple and no doubt brought one another the happiness they both so desperately want sadly it's not to be.Marcello gives one of his best performances in this his eyes convey the pain of his character so well. In the scene where Antonietta tries to seduce him his face tells you everything you need to know he's not enjoying what she's doing and it's like he's mentally removed himself from the moment yet at the same time he doesn't try and stop her because he knows she want's this physical contact so much. He doesn't want to cause her more pain by pushing her away.Sophia also conveys her characters suffering and weariness through her expressions she looks every inch the worn out housewife there is no trace of the glamour we see in her other films. The scene where she confesses her growing attraction to him while they are collecting the washing in is so raw you feel her desire and you feel his awkwardness.Both actors inhabit their characters so well in this.I wish the film was longer so we could have more scenes between these two. Poignant and deeply moving A Special Day shows the importance of being valued for yourself and how important friendship is we need these things so we are not alone. For a brief moment on this day these two characters give each other some much needed joy and a special connection that neither will forget. The film ends sadly for two reasons one because of Gabriele's fate and secondly because we as the viewer know what these characters will face next. The Second World War lies just around the corner and these people will soon face horrors they didn't think possible and an entire way of life will change forever.".

Still the two of them formed a pair that surprised me from the beginning until the end showing in the way a friendship filled with love that develops during the entire day settled in the movie. The story takes some time to roll as the introduction of the characters is long but finally we are compensated with a wonderful tale about love and humanity.

	schema:headline " contention and swinging cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "This is remarkably well done a lesson in many aspects of film staging and economy of resources. Scola is someone i always come to face as a dear friend for the great moments he gave me as i discover every time the world he creates with his films. Here is one of his most genuine compositions quite complex in the way the things are placed to strike us as the simple thing in fact it is.The basic idea is contention. Few characters one single scenario a courtyard housing building probably built by fascists or at least it has that monumental look. The first sequence is essential we get lots of real footage and narrations of an historical day when Hitler visited Mussolini in Rome. We see military parades ceremonies the whole description this must last 5 or 6 minutes fully with documentary material. So we get a background useful on the social side more than the politic for what follows.Than we get our two characters alone and ready to meet. They are for sure typical characters the housewife brainwashed by fascism in its male chauvinistic thinking even though she suffers daily with that. Mastroianni is the free thinker homosexual and politically against fascism. The drama works out perfectly everything is really intense there are lots of things being told and specially being felt by us as we move along to the ending which has to be one of the saddest in film history not only for the inevitable conclusion that after the dreamy day all rests the same but for the way that is shown visually. So i tried to check the mechanisms . we always get the radio on the background. It is the voice of the authority the voice of the regime notice that Mastroianni's character is a radio voice who gets silenced for his sexual and political commitments. This always shows as a shadow to remind us of the initial footage the dark world there was than . we have the caretaker the crystallized result of ignorance associated to a manipulating regime well as in fact every regime is totalitarian or democratic. She is always reminding our couple where they live in the truth of the world she's the voice of manipulated ignorance these two points build and represent the oppression and cruelinhuman worldcontext.Than we have our heroes and the interaction between them. This is not explainable through words one has to check it. But the magic here yes there was true cinema magic here probably had to do with two things . the performances by Loren and Mastroianni which were to my view ideal in what concerns cinema acting they were as intense as i have seen only a few times and they were contained. Very few times i've watched something like this. We get faces slightly changing shy movements the choreography inside the apartments as they interact is really perfect.. the camera from this film i understood Ettore Scola is one of the best and dearest to my taste heirs of that sweet swinging camera that Hitchcock may have invented and that Godard Polanski dePalma and yes Scola came to caress. Check every movement. Check how the courtyard is explored how the voyeur look into each characters apartment is made and above all check how the camera moves inside the apartments. The movements have to do with the breathing and feelings of the characters in a way close maybe to what Lumet did in 12 angry man but this is even more meaningful to my view. This approach lives on bringing the acting to the camera. There is no separated mechanics. What the actor does and what the camera does are linked in such a way that one cannot tell who is more actor the actors or the camera.

	onyx:emotionText "This is remarkably well done a lesson in many aspects of film staging and economy of resources. Scola is someone i always come to face as a dear friend for the great moments he gave me as i discover every time the world he creates with his films. Here is one of his most genuine compositions quite complex in the way the things are placed to strike us as the simple thing in fact it is.The basic idea is contention. Few characters one single scenario a courtyard housing building probably built by fascists or at least it has that monumental look. The first sequence is essential we get lots of real footage and narrations of an historical day when Hitler visited Mussolini in Rome. We see military parades ceremonies the whole description this must last 5 or 6 minutes fully with documentary material. So we get a background useful on the social side more than the politic for what follows.Than we get our two characters alone and ready to meet. They are for sure typical characters the housewife brainwashed by fascism in its male chauvinistic thinking even though she suffers daily with that. Mastroianni is the free thinker homosexual and politically against fascism. The drama works out perfectly everything is really intense there are lots of things being told and specially being felt by us as we move along to the ending which has to be one of the saddest in film history not only for the inevitable conclusion that after the dreamy day all rests the same but for the way that is shown visually. So i tried to check the mechanisms . we always get the radio on the background. It is the voice of the authority the voice of the regime notice that Mastroianni's character is a radio voice who gets silenced for his sexual and political commitments. This always shows as a shadow to remind us of the initial footage the dark world there was than . we have the caretaker the crystallized result of ignorance associated to a manipulating regime well as in fact every regime is totalitarian or democratic. She is always reminding our couple where they live in the truth of the world she's the voice of manipulated ignorance these two points build and represent the oppression and cruelinhuman worldcontext.Than we have our heroes and the interaction between them. This is not explainable through words one has to check it. But the magic here yes there was true cinema magic here probably had to do with two things . the performances by Loren and Mastroianni which were to my view ideal in what concerns cinema acting they were as intense as i have seen only a few times and they were contained. Very few times i've watched something like this. We get faces slightly changing shy movements the choreography inside the apartments as they interact is really perfect.. the camera from this film i understood Ettore Scola is one of the best and dearest to my taste heirs of that sweet swinging camera that Hitchcock may have invented and that Godard Polanski dePalma and yes Scola came to caress. Check every movement. Check how the courtyard is explored how the voyeur look into each characters apartment is made and above all check how the camera moves inside the apartments. The movements have to do with the breathing and feelings of the characters in a way close maybe to what Lumet did in 12 angry man but this is even more meaningful to my view. This approach lives on bringing the acting to the camera. There is no separated mechanics. What the actor does and what the camera does are linked in such a way that one cannot tell who is more actor the actors or the camera. Godard tried something like this in the apartment scene of Le Mpris but here it is so much emotional and effective.... also worth mentioning the structural basis.

The nearconstant background noise of radio announcers burbling on and on about the glories of fascist Italy and Nazi Germany over martial music created a sonic claustrophobia that matched the visual sense of restriction in the apartment complex. I knew beforehand that Mastroianni was cast as a gay man I was not prepared for the delicacy and refinement he brought to his portrayal. And Loren's character was full of surpriseswe first see her as an exhausted exploited wife and mother. It's a shock to see her face light up when she recalls her encounter with Mussolini. Loren as a fascist! How these two connect in such a human simple way is breathtaking. Each is imprisoned in their own fashion at the end and yet there is a hint that each has found a fragile new sense of freedom. But Scola does not deny the tragedy of these characters' destinies. Very moving. I hope to see it in the original Italian some day.".

Thank god for TCM because I couldn't find this one anywhere else. I was so surprised about how direct the movie was in telling of Gabriele's homosexuality. He is just himself a very kind sensitive and classy man. Antonietta so rarely gets to examine anything outside of her family that their meeting is an adventure to her the most mundane things are events. I remembered that when I saw the movie the lack of vibrant colors made the movie less accessible today I got the point. Not a tearjerker instead a profound examination of a chance meeting and how it created a powerful impact which could never have been anticipated. A knockout but really a movie for people who enjoy thinking. There is relatively little story but listen closely and you will hear elements of 1930s Italian culture. One I can't see often. But I am grateful I took the time.".

	schema:reviewBody "While Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren may rate among the most visually appealing couples in cinematic history the sad and profound beauty that they create here is far far deeper than that of superficial appearance alone. Mastroianni is outstanding as Gabriele a completely alienated and repressed gay man at the height of fascism's grip on Italian society during World War II. Loren plays Antonietta an equally stifled housewife and mother of six who has been humiliated by her unfaithful and disrespectful husband. They live directly across from each other in a large apartment building in Rome and they meet by chance when all of their neighbors suddenly vanish in order to attend political rallies all over the city on Hitler's first visit to the Italian capital.Even as a tired frumpy housewife who had been drained of life itself Sophia radiates a quiet subdued beauty that could only flow from her and no one else. Even the routine mundane task of clearing off a kitchen table is captivating when Sophia Loren is doing it. What makes A Special Day so special is not only Sophia but Marcello in his Oscar nominated role and the superb direction by Ettore Scola. As the very intense human relationship between two lost souls continues to develop through the special day the mechanized military marches of Nazi Germany and the deafening roar of the adoring mobs in response to Hitler's public appearance assault the ears from the building caretaker's radio providing a stark contrast of two opposing but powerful forces in the world love and hate. As I listened to the steady harsh brutality of the German marches and the enthusiastic reaction by the Italian multitude I was even more perplexed by the alliance of these two nations Germany and Italy with cultural roots that seemed as far apart from one another as any two on the face of the earth. The unlikelihood of Gabriele's and Antonietta's unique friendship paled in comparison to the oddity of a pact between the likes of Italy and Germany an alliance that was an indisputable fact of history as difficult as that may be to believe.Although the film ends tragically the beauty and strength of Gabriele's and Antonietta's complex relationship triumphs in its own extraordinary way. Even in the darkness and the gloom I was somehow left with a glimmer of hope for the pathetic pitiful human race. I don't know exactly why.".

It has all the trappings of incredibly minimalist dialogue played out on a naked stage. Every bit of it is minimalist so that the drama of this heartbreaking story flows like a torrent from the mouths of two of the 20th century's finest actors. This is a film for those who appreciate the talent of directors Scola here present who are able to inscribe on a few frames of celluloid something of the immensity of the human condition in all its paradoxes. This is a film whose power lies very much in what is not said  Antonietta's miserable relationship with her fanatical husband Gabriele's deep love for his never seen never named lover living exiled in Sardinia.

It's a comedywestern that's not particularly funny or all that exciting. Frank and Dean breeze through this thing of course as only they can muggingjoking almost winking at each other 'ain't we too much' during their scenes together. I'm assuming Robert Aldrich the director was merely there to corral the extras since neither of the main stars attempts to take any direction. This is not to say they are entirely un watchable but even for this kind of thing both have done better. Ursula Andress and Anita Ekberg look spectacular in various revealing outfits and Charles Bronson seems to be the only actor taking the whole thing seriously. The 3 Stooges show up and do a shtick that livens things up after the movie seems to slow to a crawl. Character actors Victor Buonoprobably gives the best performanceJack ElamRichard Jaekel and a few other familiar faces round out the cast. The plot? Well who cares really you're watching this to see Frank and Dean do their thing and to some degree they do but really it's all somewhat snooze inducing. The film of course is very much of its era when the Rat Pack ruled and smoking drinking gambling and womanizing were casually portrayed without any apologies. I do actually enjoy these kind of movies and have built up a collection on DVD over the last while that reflects my nostalgia for that time. I just wish this one was better.".

However here that is almost totally lacking.  With the exception of the opening 15 minutes the film is almost totally devoid of fun.  The film opens with Jarrett and Thomas against each other in a simple robbery however it later meanders through cat and mouse games which don't work until it gets to the obvious conclusion which is so lazy that it even ends with Martin saying and oh yeah this is the end'.None of the action or dialogue is even remotely funny or fun.  The whole vehicle had the same kind of movement that Martin's steamer displays  heavy sluggish and relentlessly moving forward no matter what these things are not good qualities in a comedy western.  I really wanted to like the film but there was even too little of value for me.  The two leads are OK but really have nothing to work with at all they have one reasonable scene together at the start but from then they are just freewheeling along. Support from Charles Bronson Jack Elam Andrews Buono and the Three Stooges is all pretty wasted and no one is really given very much to work with at all.Overall this is an example of a poor film from the Rat Pack  lifeless self indulgent and lacking in fun or wit made solely on the basis of the two stars being famous and thus bringing an audience with them when the film plays.  A bit more wit and sparky dialogue in the script and the loss of some running time could have vastly improved what is really a pretty poor film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Check out the cast of this Western Dean Martin Frank Sinatra a young and STUNNING Ursula Andress and the Three Stooges. Sounds good right? Well no... Unfortunately it really isn't. Despite an eclectic cast and Ursula Andress' face 4 for Texas largely fails to entertain. This picture is just too boring and predictable to be worth much. Ursula Andress doesn't show up until the second half and her sex appeal is greatly underutilized. Similarly the Three Stooges only get 2min of screen time and it is easily the film's high point. For the majority of the movie you are stuck with a visibly drunk Dean Martin who is just going through the motions and generally not giving a damn. Frank Sinatra's performance is all right even if he is just playing himself but unfortunately he isn't captivating enough to be an effective leading man. The story is contrived and predictable but not terrible enough to crack jokes at. I didn't hate this movie but it was a tedious largely uneventful watch. This is the kind of picture where I kept waiting for good things to happen but nothing ever panned out. When the dust settled 4 for Texas was a disappointment. Aside from an occasional gawk at Ursula this was an entirely forgettable waste. Not recommended.".

Despite an eclectic cast and Ursula Andress' face 4 for Texas largely fails to entertain. This picture is just too boring and predictable to be worth much. Ursula Andress doesn't show up until the second half and her sex appeal is greatly underutilized. Similarly the Three Stooges only get 2min of screen time and it is easily the film's high point. For the majority of the movie you are stuck with a visibly drunk Dean Martin who is just going through the motions and generally not giving a damn.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has four stars Dean Martin Frank Sinatra Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress so I gave it four stars. Actually two stars are for Dean Martin's attempts to add humor. Anita and Ursula get one each but Frank Sinatra gets no stars.When the movie opens a group of bandits are attacking a stagecoach. Frank Sinatra is shooting the bandits from the top of the coach while Dean Martin is shooting them from out the window of the coach. Sinatra has a silly grin on his face as he shoots. There is no indication that he might die any moment or that he is actually killing human beings. He is smiling as if he is just playing a game. Dean Martin also looks totally relaxed and nonchalant but he is not grinning the way Sinatra is. There is no acting going on here. It is as if the director said to Sinatra Smile and shoot the gun. Anybody above the age of ten could have played the scene more realistically.I understand that Aldrich was upset with Sinatra. He said that Sinatra worked a total of 80 hours over a 38 day period. In other words he worked about two days a week for five or six hours a day over a seven week period. Nice work if you can get it. I wonder if Aldrich used the inappropriate footage in the opening scene as a way of getting revenge on Sinatra actually purposefully making him look like a bad actor.While the Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra both have about twenty minutes of scene time in the first half of the movie Sinatra only has a few quick scenes in the second half until he walks in at the end for the climatic fight scene. I'm also wondering if Aldrich cut down on Sinatra's scenes when he saw that Sinatra was just saying his lines and not acting.Anita Ekberg was paired with Sinatra but there was no chemistry there. She is only onscreen for about ten minutes. I suspect that Aldrich cut scenes with her and Sinatra when he saw that they weren't working.On the other hand Ursula Andress does connect with Martin and the scenes of him lusting over her may be sexist but they are practically the only amusing scenes in the film. Just as in the first James Bond movie Dr. No. she appears only after the film is half over. Unlike the James Bond movie she cannot save this film but she does relieve some of the tedium.Aldridge is a fantastic director under the right circumstances. Kiss Me Deadly Whatever Happened to Baby Jane and Emperor of the North Pole are my favorites. I suspect that he really wanted to create tension between Sinatra's and Martin's characters but Sinatra refused and only wanted the rivalry to be goodnatured kidding between pals. Apparently he sought to get Sinatra fired but failed. The result is a movie that moves at glacier speed and has few surprises unless you can call the pointless appearance of the Three Stooges a surprise.I think only Ursula Andress fans will enjoy this one. She wears some great dresses and appears quite self assured relaxed and sexy. If you are one just watch the second half. You won't miss anything.".

Even weirder the European sexpots Ursula Andress and Anita Ekberg are along for the ride...and a bumpy one at that considering how illcast the production seemed. And you KNOW it's got a bizarre choice of actors when the Three Stooges seem more appropriately cast! The only really appropriately cast guy was Charles Bronsonand he was pretty much wasted.The film begins with Zack Sinatra and Joe Martin happening on a stage coach that has been attacked. The passengers and crew are dead but the hidden gold is still there. Both men want it and Joe ends up with it after some interesting machinations. Much of the rest of the film consists of Joe and Zack trying to outsmart each otherall the while Zack's partners are planning on doublecrossing them.Sometimes instead of writing a review I wish I could simply write Read soandso's reviewthey said it as good or better than I could...plus they wrote it first. This is exactly the case with the review for 4 For Texas by Bob the Moo. Bob's analysis of the film is correct when he said it is '...lifeless self indulgent and lacking in fun or wit made solely on the basis of the two stars being famous and thus bringing an audience with them when the film plays'. This really sums it up very well! The film despite a quirky and clever start soon bogs down and all sense of fun soon diminishes. In fact so does any sense that either of the leads even cared! It was like they were just going through the pacesassuming the Rat Pack lovers would show up in the theaters in droves regardless. My assumption is that for the most part they were correct. The writing was amateurish and often made no sense especially the scenes where Martin and Andress meet the acting uninspired pacing listless and the film looked good but was very unsatisfyingmuch like the desserts you'd find at an all you can eat buffet. A cynical and forgettable film.".

Of course they don't get off Scot free because the driver and another passenger were killed. The stage is carrying 100000.00 of Sinatra's money which Martin eventually winds up with. And when he gets to Galveston he invests it in the posh gambling establishment Sinatra was hoping to open.You've got two other guys who are working their angles conniving banker Victor Buono and Charles Bronson. Their scenes together remind me a whole lot of This Gun for Hire with Laird Cregar and Alan Ladd as the businessman and the killer he hired. At least Buono though he'd have liked to had more sense than Cregar and wasn't about to pull a doublecross on Bronson.Of course Ekberg and Andress realize their men should be allies instead of enemies. But testosterone keeps getting in the way until the two women kind of force an alliance.4 for Texas is funny in many spots not as good as the ultimate Rat Pack film Ocean's 11. Of the two of them Dino has the better performance he's far funnier naturally which his former partner Jerry Lewis never tired of pointing out. And of course Dean gets to perform with the Three Stooges which is like working with three Jerrys.There's a small cameo inside the gambling ship with Arthur Godfrey. He was one of the biggest names in television back in the Fifties but anyone born after 1956 will not have the foggiest idea who that is or why we should be laughing there. Though 4 for Texas is fine maybe it would have been nice to have given Dino or Old Blue Eyes a song to sing. Even Ocean's 11 had both Dean and Sammy Davis Jr. singing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spaghetti western helmer Sergio Leone worshipped American director Robert Aldritch even though Leone's experience as Aldritch's secondunit director on the Biblical epic Sodom and Gomorrah 1962 proved shortlived. After he attained fame and fortune with his Dollars trilogy Leone said that he owed it all to Aldritch. The Italian maestro rhapsodized especially over an earlier Aldritch oater Vera Cruz 1954 with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster. The best part of Aldritch's Four For Texas is the opening gambit. This exciting but abortive stagecoach robbery foreshadows everything that the Spaghetti western later espoused as its formula and ideology.Matson Charles Bronson of The Dirty Dozen and his gang are in hot pursuit after a stagecoach carrying 100thousand dollars. Galveston entrepreneur Zack Thomas Frank Sinatra of Sergeants 3 lies sprawled atop the coach. He shoots at the bad guys with his Winchester repeating rifle while Joe Jarrett Dean Martin of Rio Bravo rides inside the vehicle. Joe pokes his head and gun arm out the window and racks up his share of kills. Our heroes dispatch at least six of Matson's gang before Matson calls a halt to the pursuit and withdraws to head back to town. One of Matson's cronies Dobie Jack Elam of Once Upon A Time in the West who appears in preSergio Leone style closeup briefly warns Matson that their boss treacherous Harvey Burden Victor Buono of The Silencers won't be happy that they failed. Without blinking an eye Matson guns down Dobie blasting him out of the saddle with one lethal shot. Meanwhile the stagecoach rider dies from a wound that he received from Matson's men and Zack has to stop a runaway stagecoach. He cannot and the vehicle rolls over with a crash. For the rest of the sequence Zack and Joe engage in a contest of oneupmanship the kind of games that Blonde and Tuco played in The Good The Bad and the Ugly. First Joe gets the drop on Zack who no longer has his rifle and takes the money. Second Zack retrieves an entirely different Winchester rifle that he found cached with the money. He waits until Joe has ridden far enough away so that he can open up on him with his Winchester without fear of retaliatory gunfire. When this occurs Joe realizes that he is at Zack's mercy. Joe's sixgun lacks the longer more accurate range of Zack's rifle. Zack forces Joe to fork over the fortune. Third Joe surprises Zack when he palms a derringer concealed inside his Stetson and appropriates the money for the second time. In the first instance Frank Sinatra behaves like a Spaghetti western antihero might as he ignites a cigar and patiently allows Dean Martin to out of range before he wields the Winchester. Sinatra even wears an outfit roughly similar to the togs that 'the Man With No Name' sported. This entire scene is better than anything else in this otherwise mediocre western. Four for Texas indulges in the two themes that characterized Italian westerns 1 a cynical disregard for human life and 2 an obsession with money that amounts to greed. The setting with its sharplychiseled mountain peaks rearing up majestically in the background and arid desert stretching for miles in every direction replicates the typical south of the border scenery in spaghetti westerns. Indeed for all practical purposes the opening scene in Four For Texas qualifies as the only scene with action lensed on location beyond the confines of the studio.Meanwhile gluttonous Harvey Burden acts like Zack's friend. What Zack doesn't know is that the President of the Galveston Savings  Trust Bank has Matson and his gang of cutthroats secretly on his payroll. Victor Buono's first scene in Galveston is wonderful. He explains to Walton's star Ellen Corby a widow with another elderly woman in a wheelchair with her that if he loaned them the money that they requested that eventually he might have to foreclose on them and earn a bad reputation in the process. At about that time Joe Jarrett shows up in town with the fortune in money sewn into his suit jacket and deposits it in Harvey's bank. Joe and Zack have the oddest friendship that evolves over time once they meet each other's girlfriends. Zack keeps fashion designer Elya Carlson the voluptuous Swedish beauty Anita Ekberg of La Dolce Vita as his main squeeze. Joe hooks up with scantily clad Maxine Richter Ursula Andress of Dr. No who owns a rundown riverboat that Joe helps her convert into a floating casino. Roughly speaking the time that elapses between Joe's arrival in Galveston until the climactic scene on the docks when Zack and he join forces is equivalent to the time it takes to refurbish Maxine's riverboat.Four For Texas conjures up few surprises to keep you guessing throughout its uneven 115 minutes. Zack and Joe play cat and mouse games but you know that Frank and Dean couldn't remain at loggerheads for long. The chief bad guy here is Charles Bronson and it takes both of them to whip him. Bronson's death scene on the paddle wheel of the riverboat looks cool. The relationship between Victor Buono and Charles Bronson conceals the only surprise. An unbelievable moment occurs in Galveston that refutes the opening scene where our heroes ruthlessly tried to eliminate the outlaws. Jarrett wings Matson in a restaurant as the evildoer is poised to bushwhack Zack. That Joe and Zack would let Matson live is difficult to swallow especially after their deadly shooting during the holdup attempt. The brawl on the docks at the end looks like poor crowd control but there is another surprise that comes out. However by this time Four For Texas has sacrificed any dramatic vigor as an interesting western. Unless you're a Rat Packer skip Four For Texas.".

	schema:headline " You must have the fastest horse in Texas!";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently read Rat Pack Confidential by Shawn Levy and it turns out to be a nice backdrop for the antics of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin in this picture. The book lists Anita Ekberg as one of the Chairman's real life conquests although Andress doesn't seem to have made his unofficial cast of thousands. Never one to let a good day's work interfere with having a good time I'm sure the picture had to make do with Sinatra's availability and not the other way around.As if to memorialize Frank and Dino's womanizing there's a line in the picture stated by Zack Thomas Sinatra in response to Joe Jarrett's Martin boastful claim of having twenty five kids as a reason for not marrying Max Richter Andress. It's the 'fastest horse' line summarized above and all the while I'm thinking that Sinatra wouldn't have minded having a race with Dino.The picture is a generally amusing if uneven one with the principal players backed up by a cool cast including Charles Bronson Victor Buono and Mike Mazurki. I would like to have seen more of Jack Elam in the story but he didn't make it past the opening sequence. Too bad. I have to wonder who's idea it was to bring the Three Stooges into the flick doing their slappy face gag it seemed like everyone wanted to take a crack at it. While they were on screen it looked like the rest of the cast went out of character to laugh at their routine but seeing these guys well past their prime seemed a bit embarrassing. But as they say it helps pay the bills.Ultimately the picture's not very memorable and if not for the stagecoach and horses from time to time it wouldn't even qualify as a Western. This was basically Frank and Dean knocking down some pocket money and for all we know their costars along the way.".

	onyx:emotionText "I recently read Rat Pack Confidential by Shawn Levy and it turns out to be a nice backdrop for the antics of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin in this picture. The book lists Anita Ekberg as one of the Chairman's real life conquests although Andress doesn't seem to have made his unofficial cast of thousands. Never one to let a good day's work interfere with having a good time I'm sure the picture had to make do with Sinatra's availability and not the other way around.As if to memorialize Frank and Dino's womanizing there's a line in the picture stated by Zack Thomas Sinatra in response to Joe Jarrett's Martin boastful claim of having twenty five kids as a reason for not marrying Max Richter Andress. It's the 'fastest horse' line summarized above and all the while I'm thinking that Sinatra wouldn't have minded having a race with Dino.The picture is a generally amusing if uneven one with the principal players backed up by a cool cast including Charles Bronson Victor Buono and Mike Mazurki. I would like to have seen more of Jack Elam in the story but he didn't make it past the opening sequence. Too bad.

In fact you could pretty much dismiss the plot and focus on the film's cool imagery and one of its stars Ursula Andress of whom there is what looks like a nude portrait that hangs behind the bar in Dino's riverboat establishment.

My favorite is the one where Dino tells the girl to not be crushed by others and lose her identity or she will just become another face in the crowd the theme of the movie. This scene takes the movie beyond your typical ugly duckling story and gives it much more depth. The protagonist was poorly casted. She gave a poor performance.

The girl that got pregnant is absolutely beautiful and stunning plus a gifted dancer but those words do not do her justice. I think the plot translates well plus there are the added aspects the original lacks. I think they could have done more to help her fit in the ugly duckling role. I cannot fully speak to their acting since I think I lose some of the subtleties since I have to have English subtitles. I do not think it is fair to compare Hollywood to Bollywood the styles are just too different  I for one like that watch Hollywood when I want that or Bollywood when that is what I am in the mood for.

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Majestyk is one of my favorite Charles Bronson action films. The plot which is a bit complex for an action film does not get in the way of any of the action. By the way Bronson whose real name was Buckinski must have been happy to play a person of Polish ancestry in this one I believe it is one of the few times he did.Bronson is Vincent Majestyk former army ranger who is now running a watermelon ranch. He's being squeezed by time because he needs to get his melons picked and to market in a matter of days and a local strong arm guy played by Paul Koslo tries to muscle him into hiring his crew.Big mistake for Koslo but not right then because he has sheriff Frank Maxwell arrest Bronson. While in jail Bronson also runs afoul of big time hit man Al Lettieri and when Lettieri finally escapes he's out to get him.Bronson's willing to live and let live but Lettieri crowds him and he's not given a choice. So he settles matters in the usual Bronson way.Lettieri was really coming into his own during the early Seventies with villainous roles in The Godfather The Getaway and McQ. A year later the cinema lost him a real tragedy because he was superb in any part he played.Two women figure prominently in the proceedings. Linda Cristal who is an organizer for the United Farm Workers who Bronson aids and she in turn becomes pretty valuable to him. The second is Lee Purcell who plays a more modern version of a gangster moll from the Thirties.Over 30 years since I first saw Mr. Majestyk in the theater and I still love the way Bronson turns from the hunted to the hunter.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mr. Majestyk is one of my favorite Charles Bronson action films. The plot which is a bit complex for an action film does not get in the way of any of the action. By the way Bronson whose real name was Buckinski must have been happy to play a person of Polish ancestry in this one I believe it is one of the few times he did.Bronson is Vincent Majestyk former army ranger who is now running a watermelon ranch. He's being squeezed by time because he needs to get his melons picked and to market in a matter of days and a local strong arm guy played by Paul Koslo tries to muscle him into hiring his crew.Big mistake for Koslo but not right then because he has sheriff Frank Maxwell arrest Bronson. While in jail Bronson also runs afoul of big time hit man Al Lettieri and when Lettieri finally escapes he's out to get him.Bronson's willing to live and let live but Lettieri crowds him and he's not given a choice. So he settles matters in the usual Bronson way.Lettieri was really coming into his own during the early Seventies with villainous roles in The Godfather The Getaway and McQ. A year later the cinema lost him a real tragedy because he was superb in any part he played.Two women figure prominently in the proceedings. Linda Cristal who is an organizer for the United Farm Workers who Bronson aids and she in turn becomes pretty valuable to him. The second is Lee Purcell who plays a more modern version of a gangster moll from the Thirties.Over 30 years since I first saw Mr. Majestyk in the theater and I still love the way Bronson turns from the hunted to the hunter.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Majestyk is inarguably one of Charles Bronson's most masterful action movie accomplishments not counting the westerns like Once Upon a Time in the West and The Magnificent Seven because he didn't play the central character in those and this is mainly thanks to the skillful writing of Elmore Leonard and the tight direction of Richard Fleischer. More than in the other contemporary Bronson action vehicles Mr. Majestyk benefices from a steadily paced and intelligent screenplay that fully revolves on Charles Bronson but at least never exaggeratedly idolizes him. Vince Majestyk is a modest and introvert Colorado melon farmer who only wants to bring in his harvest He ends up in jail after a conflict with a local small time crook but things get really serious when a wanted mafia hit man targets him for assassination. Mr. Majestyk wanted to deliver the escaped convict Frank Renda back to the police but his plan failed and now Renda is obsessed with killing Vince with his own hands. The plot isn't hyperconvoluted but it's definitely more ambitious than the average Death Wish sequel in which Charles blows away random street scum. The villainous characters in Mr. Majestyk are interesting personalities. Frank Renda brilliant performance from Al Lettieri is a genuinely menacing and relentless criminal whereas Bobby Kopas is just a sleazy and cowardly local marauder who thinks he's a big shot. The interactions between Vince and these gangsters confirm their personalities. He's not afraid of Renda but remains wary and respectful at all times whereas he continuously mocks and humiliates the racist wannabe cowboy Bobby Kopas. It is definitely the sharp and seasoned writing of Elmore Leonard what brings the film to a higher quality level. Mr. Majestyk certainly isn't a nonstop spitfire of action sequences but there are a couple of explosively violent moments that are unforgettable. The escape during the prison transportation for example as well as the Ford pickup chase and the climatic shootout. Great film highly recommended to all action cinema fanatics!".

But it isn't all cut and paste there is some really good story telling here and bravura performances by the man who plays the main criminal.  His hame escapes me but he was also the bad guy in The Getaway.  When things get hot and heavy he looks at Majestyk with grudging admiration and says You know something?  You move melon picker.  You don't say much...but you move!  True fact and so does this movie which is also the home of one of the two or three best car chases on film along with Bullitt although this time it isn't a Mustang but a good old Ford F150.

In this film Bronson plays Vince Majestyk a melon farmer who simply wants to bring in his crops on time. A local labor racketeer Bobby Kopas Paul Koslo tries to exert pressure on Majestyk to use Kopas' work crew instead of the migrant workers Majestyk has hired. Unfazed by Kopas' threats Majestyk knocks him down and drives him from the premises. As a result he is thrown in jail on an assault charge.Here he meets up with Frank Renda Al Lettieri a mob boss who is planning an escape. The escape attempt goes awry and Majestyk alternately humiliates and abuses Renda while using him as a bargaining chip for his own freedom. Renda later escapes and spares no effort in seeking revenge on Majestyk.The film moves nicely and never gets bogged down with unnecessary detail. This is a simple story about the little guy being wronged and the enjoyment lies in watching both Kopas and Renda underestimate the guy they're bullying. Bronson plays his role with his usual quiet toughness but it is Lettieri who stands out. His character is a vicious brute who makes it easy for us to root against him. Lettieri had several great roles The Godfather The Getaway McQ before his untimely death. Paul Koslo does his customary nice job in a character role while Linda Cristal plays Bronson's love interest in a lowkey dignified manner. Lee Purcell Renda's squeeze is strictly eye candy.Overall classic 70's action cinema and an enjoyable watch.".

They set out to kill Bronson whose chief concern is as he puts it I've gotta get those melons in. After a series of attacks Bronson fights back and a final shootout at a mountain cabin has predictable results.The photography is okay. The sound is sharp and tinny like a TV movie. There is no character development to speak of. You don't need a discriminant function analysis to tell the good guys who are thoroughly good from the bad guys who are thoroughly evil because they come from entirely different populations. None of the major characters change in any way except perhaps from being alive to being dead.The acting is about what you'd expect from this cast. Bronson is maybe a bit more jocular than in most of his movies. Sometimes he makes jokes or smiles and he seems to mean it. He gets to perform his Charles Bronson imitation  Heyyyy I don't know yewwwww. The mustache has become more outlandishly Bronsonoid than ever. Bronson grew up poor but managed to get used to being rich. He made lots of demands for limousines and whatnot on his later films. On this one there was an initial delay of a day or two in principal shooting and he complained loudly in front of the crew that what this picture needed was a European crew somewhat alienating his coworkers.Al Letierri is his usual big bulky brutish thuggish self. We're already familiar with the character from Pekinpah's The Getaway. His personality is clearly anal expletive. He fumes when an underling talks s to me. And to him everybody is an a. He cares about nothing but power and broads.Speaking of the latter Lee Purcell as his girlfriend has the delicacy of an antique Chinese porcelain doll except for her decidedly sensual lower lip which seems to droop in a perpetual pout. Linda Cristal is a different matter. As a semiEuropean Argentine beauty she was stunning 15 or 20 years earlier but now her features have acquired strength and character. You no longer want to photograph her airbrush her and use her in a perfume ad. It is now a face and figure to paint. She seems to glow on screen.If I had to choose a Charles Bronson movie to watch this would probably be the one. I don't know why. Maybe it's because Bronson seems to have a genuine occupation in this one. He's a melon farmer having trouble finding a crew to get his melons in on time. I helped out some friends picking melons in Utah for a while. My job was to receive the melons as they were handed to me and flip them up to a guy standing on a flatbed truck. After 20 minutes I couldn't tell whether I was alive or dead. Whatever melon pickers are being paid these days it is not enough. Where was I? Oh yes.I actually enjoy this flick. It was shot in Colorado where the air is clean enough to breathe and actually transparent except for a slight cerulean haze of terpines over the distant mountains. It's an attractive place strawcolored bunch grass punctuated by the dark green of scattered junipers. You can almost smell their pungency. The location is sunny warm and pleasant and invites hiking or at the very least thinking. You have to try kind of hard to keep your thoughts from turning to the suburban strip malls that will soon replace these areas.It's not without its flaws. The performance of Frank Maxwell as Lt. McAllen reminded me somewhat of a piece of driftwood. And Richard Fleischer the director had the bad judgment to allow Bronson to throw a stranger a wink under conditions in which winking is the last thing to come to mind. The script also gives Bronson a heroic military background Army Ranger POW silver star which is completely unnecessary. We know he's brave because he demonstrates it. And one of the most appealing characteristics of the script is that Bronson is NOT a heroic man by nature or by history. He's supposed to be just another lowmimetic guy like the rest of us trying to get his melons in.The movie is as straightforward and unpretentious as the novel that it's based on. Neither has a distinctive style. Neither smacks of art in any way. They just tell an interesting and exciting story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Majestyk isn't great art but then Charles Bronson hasn't often been in many movies Once Upon a Time in the West and possibly the Great Escape as exceptions that might even be considered fullon 'films'. He's a moviestar and on the Bside of the record so to speak of 1974's Death Wish was this little diddy where he plays of all things a melon farmer. But don't let that fool you into thinking this movie's a campy pushover. The first part of that might be true here and there as it's hard to avoid it being a little goofy seeing a guy like Bronson as a farmer. Elmore Leonard as screenwriter however elevates the material to being fun without being overly stupid. Richard Fleischer as director too keeps the material afloat above that dangerous level of being one of those more forgettable Bronson programmers of the 80s. This is a writer director and star all knowing what can be done with the material and it works for what it's worth. I loved seeing some of the action even if it early on is fairly brief albeit with an amazing shot of Bronson literally crashing out of the back window of a car and there's always a fresh way in terms of attitude with him. Mr. Majestyk is if nothing else a showcase for Bronson and his 'quiet but don'tfwithme' take on his character. He's believable because of a very simple character establishment a war hero already served time divorced just wanting to do his work right? Wrong. He gets put in jail for getting in a scuffle with a cowboy a funny scene allaround gets put into a rock and a hard place with a mob boss Al Lettieri who is obsessed with rubbing him out for almost taking him back to jail. Soon once the melons get involved it becomes a manoamano movie. Some of the acting is less than great specifically from Linda Cristal as the Migrant lady whom Bronson's Majestyk falls for. But all the way the sense of tongueincheek never becomes too much as a mob movie crossed with vigilante drama could get. It's just enough to garner some big dumb grins and mostly it's very professionally shot and scored in a very 70s style too. It's a tough better than average 'guy' actiongenre movie and definitely one of the Bronson vehicles I'd recommend.".

	schema:reviewBody "With the release of Death Wish on July 24 1974 the career of Charles Bronson was reenergized granting him almost superstar status after over 20 years in the business. This tale of vigilante vengeance set on the mean streets of NYC proved so popular with the public that it led to no fewer than four sequels with everdiminishing returns both financial and artistic. Just one week before Death Wish's release however another vengeance tale starring Bronson hit the big screens and that filmMr. Majestykthough certainly less popular seminal and influential was perhaps even more exciting and well done. In the July 17th picture Bronson stars as Vince Majestyk a former Vietnam vet who had received the Silver Star and current watermelon farmer in the fictitious town of Edna Colorado. When we first encounter him it is harvest time and Majestyk's overriding concern is employing Mexican laborers at 1.40 an hour to harvest his 160acre spread. Trouble soon looms however when Majestyk is put in the slammer after a runin with a smalltime protectionracket thug. While in jail Majestyk encounters Frank Renda a Mob hitman played with growling savagery by Al Lettieri who many may recall as Sollozzo in 1972's The Godfather. And while being transferred by bus to another location the men are embroiled in a violent attempt by the Mob to free the hitman the attempt fails and when Majestyk tries to turn Renda in himself he arouses the perpetual wrath of the gunman. Both are ultimately freed but now Majestyk's hopes of bringing his crop in become increasingly problematic as both Renda and his goons target both Majestyk and his helpers as well as his spread for vengeance....Besides the attack on the prison bus just mentioned Mr. Majestyk features several other extremely welldone action sequences and violent moments. Highlights include the nasty encounter that Majestyk's foreman Larry Mendoza Alejandro Rey not to be confused with Fernando Rey! has with Renda's goons the slaying of a cop in a roadside Portosan and the film's entire final 20 minutes during which Majestyk and his gal pal Mexican farm laborer Nancy Chavez the beautiful Linda Cristal elude Renda and his thugs during an offroad chase Majestyk's pickup truck must be the sturdiest such vehicle ever shown on film! leading to a catandmouse shootout at the hitman's rented lodge. Bronson is simply wonderful in the film and makes us root for this decent man a vet exconvict through no fault of his own a divorce with a 7yearold daughter a hard worker an employer who treats his hires very fairly a good citizen who turns down a 25000 bribe from a gangster throughout. His fine performance is matched by all the supporting players in the film especially by Lettieri who is truly menacing as the frothing hitman hot for revenge. The film's script by Elmore Leonard based on his own novel of that same year is both winning and witty and the beautiful countryside of Colorado has been nicely captured by DOP Richard H. Kline. Director Richard Fleischer has brought this picture in with a very sure hand and that really should come as no surprise. Fleischer had previously excelled in any number of film genres directing film noirs Armored Car Robbery and The Narrow Margin two of the best noirs ever scifi 20000 Leagues Under the Sea Fantastic Voyage Soylent Green horror flicks See No Evil 10 Rillington Place and historical blockbusters The Vikings Barabbas Tora! Tora! Tora! and here demonstrates how very adept he could be at the modernday action thriller. But the bulk of this film's success must surely reside on Bronson's sturdy shoulders. Though pushing 53 here he yet proved to be a terrific action performer in this picture. Being shortly preceded by The Valachi Papers and The Mechanic and soon to be followed by not only Death Wish but Breakheart Pass and Hard Times as well it is easy to see that Bronson during the mid'70s was on some kind of a genuine renaissance roll. And Mr. Majestyk is one of the best of that bunch....".

Did anybody watching want to be in that trailer? You could feel the tension. As big an action star as Charles Bronson is you won't think he is capable of beating Al. But of course he bests Al continuously throughout the movie in hero like fashion.The character of Mr Majestyk is that of an everyman really.He has the low goal of simply earning a living and harvesting a crop of melons.When he is challenged by hoodlums and police he shines like a diamond but low key. Ford F150s have been a big seller going all the way back to 1974. When you see this movie you will know where the love affair with the F150 started.The movie contains a wonderful little chase scene and the vehicle takes a beating. Big pluses Charles is great Al is great the F150 is greatgood title sequence and music. Oh and the ending.....shall we say it is like a point of business..... taken care of....NEXT!".

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately the IMDb allows only comments up to 1000 words and I was so much taken in by MR. MAJESTYK that my comment got longer so please go to my entry in the message board if you want to read the whole review! I have always considered Charles BRONSON to be the epitome of a man the icon of manlike behavior who reigns together with Steve McQueen and Dean Martin supreme on the throne of king of cool. If you check all male heroes in cinema's history you will  in my humble opinion  not find any other actor who embodies the ideals of manlike behavior better than Charles BRONSON not from the time when silent films were made up to today. Many have tried nobody succeeded.I know I am oldfashioned but in my opinion there is a set of behaviors how real men handle things they don't whine they don't wince they don't give up they don't offer the other cheek they don't act like cowards. Real men mind their own business they do what has to be done they stand up and fight when necessary they offer protection say what's right and act to their beliefs in short they WALK TALL. MR. MAJESTYK is a prime example in this action subgenre defined in 1973 by Phil Karlson's masterpiece WALKING TALL starring Joe Don Baker.And walking tall but without a big stick just his bare hands is exactly what Charles BRONSON does in this superb actionmilestone. Real men do not bully others but when they are bullied they don't walk away. They try to calm down once or twice but in case this does not help ... well ... then the one who bullied should wish he would have thought twice before.Charles BRONSON is Vince MAJESTYK and he minds his own business all he wants to do is pick his watermelons or have them picked by able hands. He's a watermelon farmer out to have his harvest in. Nothing else is of importance. But unfortunately they won't let him. That's a mistake something they should not have tried.Already the opening scene defines the character of Vince Majestyk. After striking opening titles we see THE MAN getting gasoline while a bunch of Mexican's are looking for a toilet. The owner of the gasoline station won't let them dirty Mex in his toilet so  without uttering too many words  Vince helps them and gets them the key. No violence in this scene because it ain't necessary. He hires them for picking his melons.Unfortunately Paul Koslo has other plans he wants to convince Mr. Majestyk to take his unqualified pickers because they do it for less 1 buck 20 an hour. Mr. Majestyk tries to explain to him that he picks his own workers but Koslo won't listen. The next scene could well be titled Mr. Majestyk resolves a labordispute and he does it well and efficiently. Another superb scene in this wonderful flick.That brings him to jail shortly where he meets a local mobster and killer superbly played by AL LETTIERI whom movie buffs will remember very well from Peckinpah's THE GETAWAY. Mr. MAJESTYK 1974 is Lettier's last wellknown movie before he died untimely in 1975 of a heart attack I have no doubt he would have played many more great roles wouldn't he have died that early. Frank Randa and Vince Majestyk don't get along together that well and Lettieri threatens Bronson to kill him which is one of the most memorable scenes in actioncinema After Randa has uttered his deaththreat and THE MAN has asked him calmly and when is this big event gonna take place? BRONSON sighs and concludes seems like there's no use trying to get on your good side ... stands up all calmly and smacks Randa once and so hard in the face that Randa falls from the chair and  while walking away  Bronson suggests hey why don't you call the cops? whilst Randa's men are helping their boss back on the chair. My God what a short efficient and wonderful scene !!! Charles BRONSON does not do this happily or smiling he just does what has to be done. Better to open the fight than to be hit better to show the enemy that he won't run away that this won't be an easy win if at all that he will WALK TALL.These three scenes moreless define the movie. I don't need to go on telling the storyline because of course it is clear what will happen. One thing leads to another ... whilst we are enjoying one of veterandirector Richard Fleischers most memorable efforts.Fleischer who left us 3 years after Charles BRONSON 2003 took his seat in heaven is often unjustified regarded as a minor actiondirector but has in fact given us a string of great movies in the late 60ies and first half of the 70ies EVERY ! movie from THE BOSTON STRANGLER 1968 up to MANDINGO 1975 is definitely worth seeing and his earlier and later works are not that bad either altough of changing quality. When directing Mr. Majestyk Richard Fleischer was on the height of his directorial abilities and I can't see any scene in Mr. Majestyk which does not fit it's subject this is a lean and efficient actionmovie directed by a veteran director at the height of his abilities with a striking absolutely perfectly chosen cast acting just on spot and this includes everybody zenlike superstar Charles Bronson and the whole other cast and crew....ATTENTION ! This comment here is NOT COMPLETE because the IMDb allows only 1000 words and I wrote more so please go to my entry in the message board if you liked to read my few cents to get the whole review and to be able to comment on it!

One thing leads to another ... whilst we are enjoying one of veterandirector Richard Fleischers most memorable efforts.Fleischer who left us 3 years after Charles BRONSON 2003 took his seat in heaven is often unjustified regarded as a minor actiondirector but has in fact given us a string of great movies in the late 60ies and first half of the 70ies EVERY ! movie from THE BOSTON STRANGLER 1968 up to MANDINGO 1975 is definitely worth seeing and his earlier and later works are not that bad either altough of changing quality. When directing Mr. Majestyk Richard Fleischer was on the height of his directorial abilities and I can't see any scene in Mr. Majestyk which does not fit it's subject this is a lean and efficient actionmovie directed by a veteran director at the height of his abilities with a striking absolutely perfectly chosen cast acting just on spot and this includes everybody zenlike superstar Charles Bronson and the whole other cast and crew....ATTENTION ! This comment here is NOT COMPLETE because the IMDb allows only 1000 words and I wrote more so please go to my entry in the message board if you liked to read my few cents to get the whole review and to be able to comment on it!

He was told you will do these movies with this starlet or that starlet sing this bad music with ducks or cows in the background play the race car driver the speed boat driver the motorcycle racer or you won't work at all.The truly sad thing is that if this part of Elvis' talent had been cultivated if his musical career had been kept separate from a dramatic acting career perhaps his life would have traveled a very different road. It is a horrible thing to know that you have talent  to want to be able to use that talent but be forced to waste it.

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers...Two years in the Army and a lightweight familyoriented musical  GI Blues  intervened before Elvis again got to show his natural acting talent in Flaming Star  a film originally slated for Marlon Brando. Elvis acquitted himself well in the role of Pacer Burton half Caucasian and half Kiowa in 1878 Texas.  Pacer is a young man trapped between two cultures and races in a situation in which either of two available choices spelled tragedy.  The same is true of the other members of his family including an older white brother Steve Forrest and his parents Dolores Del Rio and John McIntire  all perfect in their roles.  This is really a film about hate and just as much about love loyalty and family.  It's also probably a morethanoblique commentary on the state of race relations within the US at the time during the rise of the Civil Rights movement. Apartheidmongers in South Africa banned this film because Elvis played a 'colored' person.  On the other hand Elvis was inducted into the Los Angeles Indian Tribal Council for his positive portrayal of Pacer Burton.Elvis is thoroughly convincing as the 'half breed' Pacer and the film showcases his considerable nonverbal communication skills.  He convincingly portrays a very conflicted character the same was true to some extent of King Creole and runs the full gamut of emotion through the film. Pacer's basically a bit of a hothead but he's also possessed of a fairly chilling cool and both aspects of the character are played well by Elvis who himself shared the same dichotomy.  The scene in which Pacer and Clint his 100white brother scuffle is pretty intense.Elvis could appear quite menacing and in this film he is pure menace at several instances.  He'd have made a great bad guy in a movie and I really do believe that he could have acquitted himself well in Marlon Brando's role in Apocalypse Now had it been shot circa 1974 particularly if circumstances had conspired to have Elvis make more films like Flaming Star than Clambake during the '60s.  Is this the best scripted Elvis Presley film?  Well most'd point to King Creole and this film is so unElvis that it's really NOT an 'Elvis Presley film.'  It's a powerful film with a strong and intelligent point to make that also ensures that it is not just another horseopera in which Elvis happens to have a key role. Also the film does not focus exclusively on him and his costars are essential to the film and all turn in excellent performances.  Still I think that it's perhaps in this film that he turned in his best acting performance.The rest of the supporting cast does a morethancompetent job and among their number are Barbara Eden Richard Jaeckel and Rodolfo Acosta. Interestingly LQ Jones  who plays the clueless redneck who says that Mrs Burton's cooking was indistinguishable from any white mother's  showed up again in Elvis' 1968 Stay Away Joe the other movie in which Elvis played a native American Jones later played ThreeFinger Jack in The Mask Of Zorro.The film was directed by Don Siegel who'd earlier been behind Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and who later went on to do the Dirty Harry films among many others.   It's a pretty violent piece especially for one shot in 1960.  The Kiowa attack near the film's start is quite graphic for the time and the implied violence within and around that scene is even more disturbing.  Flaming Star includes axes to the head spears in the thigh arrows in various parts of the anatomy and fatal knife attacks as well as shootings and assorted fisticuffs.  Elvis wades into the violence with relish particularly during his oneman war against the Kiowa warriors toward the film's end.  The thrashing that he administers to two unsavory trappers is also realistic and pretty savage beginning with a rifle butt snapped into one trapper's chin.  Elvis five months after his blackbelt grading must have loved the physicality of his role.  He's in good shape for it too.Flaming Star and Fox's followup the contemporary drama Wild In The Country basically didn't make as much money as GI Blues.  That fact determined what was pretty much the formula for most of the '60s.  It's a pity because Elvis' career path during the '60s could have taken an entirely different path  appearances in highquality movies including the odd musicallyoriented one and occasional  bigevent concert performances at home and abroad.  What might have been...The ending never fails to sadden me immensely.  As in his debut film this film ends with the death of Elvis' character.  I guess the obvious thing is that Pacer's off to die and in a way being a man between peoples he's got no other place to go.  It says something about Elvis' characterization of Pacer I think that we'd even care.  The same is true of the deaths of Pacer's mother and father.  More to the point though I always think of Elvis seeing his own Flaming Star of Death 17 years later.  For that matter 10 out of 10 people die as do 10 out of 10 pets and we all face our own mortality and that of our loved ones.  I must admit that figuratively Elvis has yet to die  as I write he's in an amazing third week at 1 on the UK singles charts with 1 rankings in several other countries courtesy of a remixed relatively obscure 1968 movie song. I went to high school and university with a kid Robert Trueman good friend of my best friend who died rapidly of leukemia  ironically enough a few years before he'd told me that he wasn't really into Elvis but that he loved the song Flaming Star.  It's indeed a great song but one forever touched by an additional aura of sadness the result of Robert's passing too soon.".

For that matter 10 out of 10 people die as do 10 out of 10 pets and we all face our own mortality and that of our loved ones.  I must admit that figuratively Elvis has yet to die  as I write he's in an amazing third week at 1 on the UK singles charts with 1 rankings in several other countries courtesy of a remixed relatively obscure 1968 movie song. I went to high school and university with a kid Robert Trueman good friend of my best friend who died rapidly of leukemia  ironically enough a few years before he'd told me that he wasn't really into Elvis but that he loved the song Flaming Star.  It's indeed a great song but one forever touched by an additional aura of sadness the result of Robert's passing too soon.";

I'm assuming Sinatra would've played Clint while Brando played Pacer.While some might find the movie to be too depressing I say it calls for it. A movie like this with a story like this can't have a happy ending. So if you're expecting the usual Presley picture with singing and all look somewhere else. If you want a movie with a great script and many memorable lines and scenes see Flaming Star. If you are a fan of Elvis see this movie for sure. Elvis shows what a natural actor he is in this movie. He also proves that he could star in a serious movie with a serious role.If you are looking for a movie with action look no further. Flaming Star has plenty of action. If you just want to see a good Western see Flaming Star. Once you start watching Flaming Star you won't be able to stop. The movie had me watching up until the powerful ending. Everyone did their job well when they made this movie. Steve Forrest was great as Clint Pacer's brother. Dolores del Rio was great as Neddy Pacer's mother. John McIntire was great as Sam Burton Pacer's father. Even the other supporting actors were great. Everyone was great. The actor that portrayed Buffalo Horn Rudolph Acosta was very memorable. Elvis was of course great as Pacer. When you start watching the movie in the beginning it seems like the movie isn't really about Pacer. But later on in the movie when he has to make a choice of whether he will fight with the white man his father's people or the Kiowas his mother's people the movie gets very interesting. Elvis is put in many situations in the movie when he has to fight for his family and for his life. Pacer becomes the film's hero once the fighting starts. The whole movie is very powerful and unforgettable so don't miss this one. You are in for a pleasant surprise. Elvis Presley fans will be pleased. Even people that aren't really fans of Elvis will be pleased. See this great movie and you won't be disappointed.".

In fact the whole cast with the possible exception of Barbara Eden have never been better. Delores Del Rio plays Pacer's Mother with a wonderful and believable dignity. I do not know the Kiowas but I do know the Blackfoot and Ms Del Rio could well be Blackfoot lady. Let us imagine this movie without Elvis a very well written welldirected racially sensitive surprising solid Western tragedy introduced in a counterpoint by a party with songs. If Flaming Star had starred Paul Newman or Marlon Brando it would be revered with such films as The Magnificent Seven and The Wild Bunch. I highly recommend this thinkingman's sad Western.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is definitely one of the best film Elvis Presley ever starred in he delivered a great dramatic performance in a superb action story. No doubt about it in Flaming Star Presley is an ACTOR. And a damned good one too. He only sings two songs and they are presented right at the beginning so the film can then get down to business.I've seen all of Elvis's movies but Flaming Star is the one film whereby his talent as an actor in a dramatic role comes forth highly convincing on the screen. John McIntyre and Delores Del Rio superbly cast as parents of two brothers who through racial conflict pull apart then rejoin to save the life of the other. A classic western with Steve Forrest at his best and Barbara Eden in a role you can't easily forget. Too many great actors to mention here. And they all do a good job including one of my favorites LQ Jones.Directed by Don Siegel who directed Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry and you have one fine film. If you're looking for an Elvis musical with the rock star persona in full blast go for Jailhouse Rock. If you want a fun Elvis movie with good music go for the charming Via Las Vegas. If you want to see a plain great film with Elvis Presley showing his potential as a serious actor  go for FLAMING STAR. You won't regret it.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is definitely one of the best film Elvis Presley ever starred in he delivered a great dramatic performance in a superb action story. No doubt about it in Flaming Star Presley is an ACTOR. And a damned good one too. He only sings two songs and they are presented right at the beginning so the film can then get down to business.I've seen all of Elvis's movies but Flaming Star is the one film whereby his talent as an actor in a dramatic role comes forth highly convincing on the screen. John McIntyre and Delores Del Rio superbly cast as parents of two brothers who through racial conflict pull apart then rejoin to save the life of the other. A classic western with Steve Forrest at his best and Barbara Eden in a role you can't easily forget. Too many great actors to mention here. And they all do a good job including one of my favorites LQ Jones.Directed by Don Siegel who directed Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry and you have one fine film. If you're looking for an Elvis musical with the rock star persona in full blast go for Jailhouse Rock. If you want a fun Elvis movie with good music go for the charming Via Las Vegas. If you want to see a plain great film with Elvis Presley showing his potential as a serious actor  go for FLAMING STAR. You won't regret it.";

	schema:reviewBody "I am almost an Elvis Presley contemporary. He was born 10 years before I was but I remember when his music hit the charts and he was the hottest singer for a while. His hip movements were banned on the old Ed Sullivan TV show so they showed him only from the waist up. But Elvis started acting during the same time period and made quite a number of movies including this one Flaming Star. The title is a reference to what the Native Americans in this story referred to when they thought they were about to die they would see the flaming star.Typical of the western movies of this period they featured conflict and gunfights. Here the Pa had a son with his white wife after she died he had a second son with his Native American wife. This second son called Pacer is played by Elvis Presley.The tribe from where his Mom originated have a new chief and he is bent on fighting to reclaim and save their original lands now being taken and farmed by the white invaders. Pacer is asked to fight with them but that would make him go against his own family and friends.I doubt that Elvis ever had any acting lessons he really is a natural. He does a fine job in all his roles including this one. Not a particular interesting movie in total but it is fun to see a young Elvis and a young Barbara Eden.Handsome Steve Forrest is good as Pacer's white brother Clint Dolores del Rio is good as his Native American mother Neddy and veteran John McIntire is good as his 'Pa'.Saw this one on the Movies! channel.".

Barbara Steele was supposed to have played the female lead but proved unsatisfactory during a screen test the principal filmmakers reportedly didnt want her from the outset because she was taller than Elvis and also since in their view she couldnt act but the Chairman of Fox was clearly rooting for her behind the scenes! and she was eventually replaced by Barbara Eden. Frankly I feel that Steele would have been miscast anyway in this secondary role and thankfully the direct result of her missing out on this film was her iconic performance in Mario Bavas Italian horror classic BLACK Sunday 1960 and a subsequent career as the reigning Scream Queen of Italian Gothic horror films!The title tune naturally sung by Elvis himself is very good the Flaming Star being the Indian sign for impending death and Presley was originally supposed to sing 10 songs throughout the film but given its unusually somber tone wiser heads prevailed and these were reduced to just two which were then disposed of within the very first reel! Unsurprisingly perhaps the end result of all this was that FLAMING STAR underperformed at the box office and Presley would basically never again be allowed to stray from the triedandtrue formula or develop his burgeoning thespian skills in dramatic pictures.Anyway to get to the films plot proper Presleys family comprises white folk John McIntire and Steve Forrest Dana Andrews brother and an Indian mother movingly played by Dolores Del Rio. Rodolfo Acosta appears as the aggressive new Kiowa chief who wants Presley to join him in his fight against the white man while on the other hand the whites also ask Forrest to choose sides. Eventually this leads to much confrontation also familial and bloodshed  culminating in Elvis showdown with his tribe which actually occurs offscreen and the films surprisingly downbeat ending is all the more effective because of it. Incidentally that same year saw another Western in which a family is despised by the townspeople because of their mixed blood  John Hustons THE UNFORGIVEN which I should be rewatching soon in honor of the 20th anniversary of its directors passing...".

Always overlooked by the general public because Elvis is in it this is one of the best westerns of the 1960s. Directed by legendary auteur director Don Siegel this film has the action and tension of his best films as well as dramatically beautiful landscapes.I would kill to see this on the BIG screen. Based on a book by western writer Clair Huffaker  War Wagon Posse from Hell The Last Warrior who with the legendary Nunally Johnson  Prisoner of Shark Island Jesse James Grapes of Wrath Dirty Dozen have written a small action western with a statement on racism. A white man with Indian wife and their two sons  one white and one half breed must try to avoid choosing sides during an Indian uprising. Interestingly most films about racism deal with the causes of racism however this film deals with the consequences of racism. Also many of the other films of the time unlike this film  reduced racism down to nasty individuals rather than societal forces. There are no sides taken although the Indians come off as more noble and intelligent that the white man. It won a number of awards when it came out from Indian groups for its depiction of Indians The story of a family's disintegration and descent into violence by external forces beyond it's control  is truly moving. There are great performances and bits of beauty in John McIntire's and Dolores Del Rio's performances. Elvis is great also as the half breed son full of anger.  Only 2 songs in the film  one over the credits  and one at the start in a party scene. A Bit of trivia  other actors slated for the role at one time or another include James Dean and Marlon Brando. Also I've read somewhere that the film had an underground street cult in the late 1960s with Black Urban youths in the US ! A great film.".

Which side does the household identify with and support? That's the question provocative for its era in this early 1960's Western from director Don Siegel.The story's characters are mostly stereotyped especially the Indians who lack individuality. They are the story's antagonistic force consistent with racial bias of previous decades. Further that they speak English instead of their native language supports their status as twodimensional cartoon figures hardly more than movable set pieces.On the other hand the film's dialogue at least provides the Indians with a motivational rationale for their hostility. At one point in the film their chief Buffalo Horn tells Pacer the halfbreed Whose land is this? Who has lived here since the beginning of time? They the Whites come against us forever cutting deeper and deeper into our land forever pushing. That's a big improvement in dialogue from earlier Westerns.Filmed unfortunately in Cinema Scope the visuals have an annoying letterbox projection. But the lonesome Texas landscape is beautiful and when combined with the sound of a howling wind creates an evocative melancholy mood. The use of camera filters is obvious in this film. And I could sometimes not tell if a scene was supposed to be day or night.Casting and acting are acceptable. For a professional singer Elvis gives a fine performance.The flaming star title refers to a personal vision at the onset of death as described in the title song which is quite beautiful and haunting. But the film's nondescript score is super annoying especially toward the end when it overwhelms the plot action.The film has a Hollywood look and feel that screams studio production. Yet the story of a family caught in the middle of racial conflict with attendant thematic implications and the script's intelligent dialogue deserve respect from viewers. Further some of the visuals are captivating. And my overall assessment of this film is mildly positive.".

He holds this film together well with Elvis as a half white half Kiowa young man who must decide where his allegiance lies when the Indians have finally had enough of the whites. Addresses well the issues of prejudice in an era when that was mostly taboo. A couple of chilling moments and a gritty performance by the always competent John McIntyre as Elvis' father. Barbara Eden is subdued as the love interest and Delores Del Rio is simply wonderful as his long suffering mother. The skirmishes are well handled and the ending is not trite but realistic.

Flaming Star is a great western in its own right  no need to classify it as an Elvis Western. In fact after watching this film one feels saddened that Elvis didn't get given more scripts of this quality. Flaming star has an interesting story line about a mixedblood son of the family having to choose between his 'white' and 'Indian' families when conflict erupts. The action scenes are very exciting. The compulsory Elvis song adds rather than detracts from the rest of the film. Given the conflict in the modern world the film has many resonances for situations where misunderstandings and greed lead to implacable violence and tragedy. Elvis is superb in the main role. I have seen it several times and always end up with tears streaming down my face! Recommended.".

Given the conflict in the modern world the film has many resonances for situations where misunderstandings and greed lead to implacable violence and tragedy. Elvis is superb in the main role. I have seen it several times and always end up with tears streaming down my face! Recommended.";

	schema:headline " Awful psychological thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Killing Room starts as four ordinary volunteers who have signed up to be part of a psychological research experiment  lead into a small white room the four strangers have never met each other before  that each get on with filling in a questionnaire. A Dr. Phillips Peter Stormare enters the room  give a little speech about the purpose of the study  then suddenly takes out a gun  shoots one of the volunteers through the head killing her. Panic sweeps the room  Dr. Phillip's leaves the door is locked behind him leaving the three remaining volunteers trapped inside with a dead body. All part of an extreme experiment to test how far a person can be pushed casualties were inevitable but what is the ultimate purpose of the experiment  who does Dr. Phillip's work for?Directed by Jonathan Liebesman this psychological thriller apparently had the working title Manbreak  tires to be clever  even a little topical by using emotive issues  themes that are reported all to regularly in the world's media while it tries to be shocking  clever it isn't  I have to say I thought it was pretty crap. For the first 80 odd minutes of this 90 odd minute film there's little to talk about four people in a very bland white room one gets killed with the majority of the rest of the time just spent on them talking with scenes of Dr. Phillip's  his scientist mates we know they are scientist's because they wear long white laboratory coats even though there's no laboratories anywhere to be seen watching them  as a counter balance to their coldness fresh young recruit Emily Reilly doesn't like what she see's this goes on  on for what seems like hours. At least in a film like Saw there traps  puzzles while here in The Killing Room there is nothing  it's incredibly dull  repetitive to watch. Then there's the final 10 minutes oh God the final 10 minutes. It turns out that the nasty US Government are running this strange experiment to find the next wave of homegrown suicide bombers or civilian weapons as the men in suits  long white laboratory coats call them. What on Earth makes the them think putting people though this will suddenly turn them into suicide bombers? It's a reach stretch to say that because someone is willing to sacrifice themselves in a very controlled situation that they will then happily commit suicide for you  kill potentially thousands of innocent people in the process. Aren't suicide bombers fanatics  extremist's that would be willing to die for their cause? The twist just doesn't work  the idea of using the subject of suicide bombers as a cheap twist is in bad taste The Killing Room is a film with a twist that tries to have a point  meaning but comes across as not having a damned clue. The character's are as lifeless  basic as you can imagine it's hard to root for any of the volunteers  the scientist's hey they do wear those laboratory coats so they are scientist's come across as very cold  inhuman. I suppose the 'now for phase 2' ending leaves things open for a sequel I shudder the very thought.Event though 90 of The Killing Room is set in a single plain white run of the mill room director Liebesman still manages to make this thing look ugly with a constantly twitching camera fast edits  deliberately out of focus extreme closeup foregrounds obscuring the character's. There's a bit of blood splatter but no real violence or gore worth mentioning. An extremely repetitive bland  dull film with a ridiculous twist that didn't work The Killing Room is also lacking in tension  suspense as my major emotion while watching it was boredom. Also I don't know if it was just my copy but a lot of the dialogue sounded muffled as the three volunteers whispered to each other in increasingly panicked tones I actually found it quite hard to understand what was being said on many occasions.Filmed in late 2007 The Killing Room wasn't released anywhere until 2009  it's easy to see why there were no takers for over a year not a very good film  not a particularly easy sell as nothing really happens in it. It would certainly be hard to cut a decent trailer for it that made it look exciting. The acting is alright  rather surprisingly Nick Cannon is actually the husband of pop superstar diva Mariah Carey. Timothy Hutton once won an Oscar while Peter Stormare is better than this.The Killing Room is a terrible psychological thriller that tries to be clever  shocking  emotive it fails.

	onyx:emotionText "The Killing Room starts as four ordinary volunteers who have signed up to be part of a psychological research experiment  lead into a small white room the four strangers have never met each other before  that each get on with filling in a questionnaire. A Dr. Phillips Peter Stormare enters the room  give a little speech about the purpose of the study  then suddenly takes out a gun  shoots one of the volunteers through the head killing her. Panic sweeps the room  Dr. Phillip's leaves the door is locked behind him leaving the three remaining volunteers trapped inside with a dead body. All part of an extreme experiment to test how far a person can be pushed casualties were inevitable but what is the ultimate purpose of the experiment  who does Dr. Phillip's work for?Directed by Jonathan Liebesman this psychological thriller apparently had the working title Manbreak  tires to be clever  even a little topical by using emotive issues  themes that are reported all to regularly in the world's media while it tries to be shocking  clever it isn't  I have to say I thought it was pretty crap. For the first 80 odd minutes of this 90 odd minute film there's little to talk about four people in a very bland white room one gets killed with the majority of the rest of the time just spent on them talking with scenes of Dr. Phillip's  his scientist mates we know they are scientist's because they wear long white laboratory coats even though there's no laboratories anywhere to be seen watching them  as a counter balance to their coldness fresh young recruit Emily Reilly doesn't like what she see's this goes on  on for what seems like hours. At least in a film like Saw there traps  puzzles while here in The Killing Room there is nothing  it's incredibly dull  repetitive to watch. Then there's the final 10 minutes oh God the final 10 minutes. It turns out that the nasty US Government are running this strange experiment to find the next wave of homegrown suicide bombers or civilian weapons as the men in suits  long white laboratory coats call them. What on Earth makes the them think putting people though this will suddenly turn them into suicide bombers? It's a reach stretch to say that because someone is willing to sacrifice themselves in a very controlled situation that they will then happily commit suicide for you  kill potentially thousands of innocent people in the process. Aren't suicide bombers fanatics  extremist's that would be willing to die for their cause? The twist just doesn't work  the idea of using the subject of suicide bombers as a cheap twist is in bad taste The Killing Room is a film with a twist that tries to have a point  meaning but comes across as not having a damned clue. The character's are as lifeless  basic as you can imagine it's hard to root for any of the volunteers  the scientist's hey they do wear those laboratory coats so they are scientist's come across as very cold  inhuman. I suppose the 'now for phase 2' ending leaves things open for a sequel I shudder the very thought.Event though 90 of The Killing Room is set in a single plain white run of the mill room director Liebesman still manages to make this thing look ugly with a constantly twitching camera fast edits  deliberately out of focus extreme closeup foregrounds obscuring the character's. There's a bit of blood splatter but no real violence or gore worth mentioning. An extremely repetitive bland  dull film with a ridiculous twist that didn't work The Killing Room is also lacking in tension  suspense as my major emotion while watching it was boredom. Also I don't know if it was just my copy but a lot of the dialogue sounded muffled as the three volunteers whispered to each other in increasingly panicked tones I actually found it quite hard to understand what was being said on many occasions.Filmed in late 2007 The Killing Room wasn't released anywhere until 2009  it's easy to see why there were no takers for over a year not a very good film  not a particularly easy sell as nothing really happens in it. It would certainly be hard to cut a decent trailer for it that made it look exciting. The acting is alright  rather surprisingly Nick Cannon is actually the husband of pop superstar diva Mariah Carey. Timothy Hutton once won an Oscar while Peter Stormare is better than this.The Killing Room is a terrible psychological thriller that tries to be clever  shocking  emotive it fails.

The film starts out with a lot of promise  after the irony behind the traps in the Saw franchise the ingenuity bar has been set reasonably high already. Factor in the cult success of Cube and this film is branching into a cornered market. But then again that really is the problem apart from 1 of 2 cheap jumps there is barely any glint of originality in either the script performances or concept. The director has done OK with limited material yet even overlooking the often mumbled dialogue really why they whisper so much is utterly baffling and the frequently massive jumps to conclusions that seem to be spontaneously materialising out of thin air there is still nothing here to shout about. As other reviews point out the walkie talkie commentary gets annoying quickly but thats not the biggest of the many flaws. Without the gore of Saw we need good three dimensional relatable characters whereas The Killing Room presents us with cardboard victims on the assumption that for some unknown reason we will guess who's going to survive and indeed care. It's painfully obvious from the start who's going to win what interested me was how the doctor would react to the unfolding events. Well that plot line goes nowhere interesting  so that was a wasted mental effort on my part. The only positive from this film is that it's all over very quickly. There's a totally predictable twist ending and a wider social commentary element that falls flatter than Kansas.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's been a host of films with the plot of people trapped in a room regarding human lab rats run through a series of experiments until one survivor remains. Movies instantly coming to mind include Saw Cube and House of 9. Really The Killing Room is no different except in this movie we get an understanding as to who is behind the experiments. Four civilians are selected to fill out forms for a little money to answer some questions and act as guinea pigs for what they believe are relatively harmless experiments..what they can not possibly expect is that they are in for a horrifying experience trapped in a room with no truly available exits. Sure there are escape attempts but as we see on the outside preventative measures have already been established to stop them. The lab rats include Timmothy Hutton Nick Cannon Shea WhighamSplinter and Clea Duvall..gnarly eclectic cast although one of them is killed right away to prove a point with the remaining trio trying to figure out their situation and how to resolve it. Questions and a gun are sent into the plain white room with a bullet proof window..the window is there for a purpose I will explain in a momentthrough a slot in a locked door.

While we discover as the movie continues just why these terrible acts are taking place by Americans to Americans in such a coldblooded fashion that it sours your stomach and the fact that those committing such deeds have an agenda which differs from those of other films of it's ilk like House of 9 or Cube there are also striking similarities which I feel will leave many a viewer feeling rather hohum over the whole deal. The ending and the inner turmoil developing as tensions and fear arise is very akin to those examples I have mentioned. Good cast salvage the plot especially Chlo Sevigny because like those trapped inside their own cell she's battling a lot of personal emotions as well. Does she attempt to help them or will Ms. Reilly join this covert operation a secret project the government keeps silent for a purpose of engaging the enemy in a whole unique way fighting fire with fire. Since Splinter has become an indie hit many horror fans have discovered Shea Whigham and I imagine they will be just as impressed with him here maybe even more so. Hutton's presence here adds some major name power to the cast which I imagine will have those who haven't heard about this movie tuning in to see what it's all about.

	onyx:emotionText "There's been a host of films with the plot of people trapped in a room regarding human lab rats run through a series of experiments until one survivor remains. Movies instantly coming to mind include Saw Cube and House of 9. Really The Killing Room is no different except in this movie we get an understanding as to who is behind the experiments. Four civilians are selected to fill out forms for a little money to answer some questions and act as guinea pigs for what they believe are relatively harmless experiments..what they can not possibly expect is that they are in for a horrifying experience trapped in a room with no truly available exits. Sure there are escape attempts but as we see on the outside preventative measures have already been established to stop them. The lab rats include Timmothy Hutton Nick Cannon Shea WhighamSplinter and Clea Duvall..gnarly eclectic cast although one of them is killed right away to prove a point with the remaining trio trying to figure out their situation and how to resolve it. Questions and a gun are sent into the plain white room with a bullet proof window..the window is there for a purpose I will explain in a momentthrough a slot in a locked door.

There are some quibbles you can take with the experiment. But that's OK as they could just be wrong about what they are trying to do and how they do it. The real world MK experiments didn't lead to the results they'd hoped they would either. So I think it's fine if certain viewers would say That's a bogus experiment.

	schema:reviewBody "I was intrigued very early in the film when it was revealed that the proceeding would have some relation to the clandestine MKULTRA program ran by the Office of Scientific Research for the U.S. government in the 1950s and 60s. Ostensibly the MKULTRA program had to do with intense chemical and psychological experimentation done on U.S. citizens in order to discover how the mind and consciencesubconscience state could be manipulated. Speculation with regard to mind control ran rampant in the mid 1970s when the MKULTRA program was made public after investigations by the Church Committee. Most MKULTRA files were destroyed in the early 1970s Some have come to light under FOIA requests. No one knows if the program is still active or not.That frightening conspiracy is revealed to be early on the driving force behind Killing Room. Top notched profiler and all around psychoanalyst badass Ms. Rielly portrayed convincingly by Chlo Sevigny opens the film by meeting with the head of an unnamed organization for an onthejob interview. She has been mysteriously highly recommended for a place in the unnamed organization for her unique skills. Apparently she is near clairvoyant in her observatory psydeductive abilities  so much so that it is impossible for a person to ever lie to her. She is apparently the psychological equivalent to Sherlock Holmes. That introduction sounded interesting to me but I hope you don't really like the idea and perhaps hope for something to come of it. Her superhuman skill set is not mentioned again nor ever comes into play for the duration of the movie. A handful of times she is asked for her observations and gives satisfactory textbook answers.Ms. Reilly is asked to watch a drama unfold on tape and give her reactions. The tape shows the occupants of a room being subjected to intense psychological testing. Omnipresent twoway radio chatter give the proceedings a military feel. During this time we learn a very little background of the organization that the test is taking place in what is called A Killing Room and the relationship to the MKULTRA program. Later the action moves to real time as the next step of Ms. Reilly's try out.The room is occupied by four U.S. citizens which very vaguely represent the scope of society. A white female portrayed by the criminally underused Clea DuVall HBO's Carnivale a neurotic white male a black male and a calm white male excon We have a potential leader squawks the twoway when he enters the scene for the first time..The first kill I assume that is not a spoiler given the title of the movie is sudden brutal and takes the viewer completely by surprise. It made me sit up and mentally rub my hands together. Unfortunately the film fails to capitalize on the sudden burst of momentum.The rest of the movie is a relatively arid affair that rarely surprises never builds tension and ultimately falls on its face. A minor Reveal 23 of the way through comes too late and lacks continuity or sense outside the realm of farreaching. The intended emotional impact of that Reveal is therefore nonexistent. The menace of the MKULTRA program is forgotten. The reason that the excon was identified as a leader type becomes perfunctory. The final card up the sleeve of the film is the moral dilemma faced by Ms. Rielly. This payoff is actually aborted in what might as well have been alternate ending number one on the DVD  a hackneyed daydream whatif sequence that the viewer neither cares about nor believes would succeed. Sevigny did her eyetwitching best to sell the quandary but the build up just wasn't there. The bleakness of the film guaranteed from the start that there was only one way to go for the finale.The final twist in the last scene was no surprise and by that time the viewer doesn't care. It does end with the obvious beginning for a number of archetypal direct to DVD releases.www.popbunker.net popbunker".

	schema:headline " Reminiscent of the Milgram experiment";
	schema:reviewBody "The film is a taut effective psychological thriller and character study. It's not entirely novel but it's well done and could possibly be set on a stage as a play. The set is not elaborate taking place almost entirely in a white locked room and the pacing relies on dialogue and Deus ex Machina as well as what Hitchcock called MacGuffins e.g. the gun the clock the questions on notes etc. These types of plot devices are common in thrillers and they're used to decent effect here. I will agree somewhat with people who found a lot of the dialogue to be very quiet almost mumbled particularly when the crew were communicating over the radio. I had the volume up and could hear it but I believe it was done for a reason and has the effect of subtly adding tension if you can hear it and it's likely done for a reason by the researchers. Indeed everything that happens in the film can be considered part of the experiment. Or perhaps not ...I see that many people who are reviewing this film believe the premise of the experiment to be implausible. There was an infamous psychological experiment dealing with authority conducted in the early 1960s at Yale that escalated quickly but almost predictably into a Lord of the Flies type situation and had to be halted. It's known as the Milgram experiment and I'd add a link but it's against the guidelines so do a search if you're not familiar. Also search for MKULTRA a very real CIA program that ostensibly was shut down in the mid1970s after a Congressional investigation uncovered a small amount of evidence of what was going on some of which involved psychological experiments on unknowing subjects including a surreptitious LSD dosing of a CIA agent which lead to his suicide. The remaining papers that weren't destroyed before the investigation revealed an environment ripe for the kind of abusive experimentation shown in the movie.The thing is the people running MKULTRA really didn't know all that much about a lot of what they were studying and they had virtually no real oversight and too much latitude so even though not well intentioned lots of their experiments went nowhere. They tried many different truth serums to no avail as well as studying purported UFOs and paranormal experiments interviewing and testing experts in the field mostly dealing with the possibility of mind control of some sort. The film The Men Who Stare At Goats is a much less serious stab at the subject of MKULTRA. There are also plenty of conspiracy theories floating around about it including the idea that it was never truly shut down but the facts as we know them are pretty crazy with thousands of pages of evidence of a CIArun covert psychological program gone off the rails  at least with Milgram they knew they had to draw a line somewhere but not really for MKULTRA.You really don't need to make anything up but what the film does with MKULTRA does make for an interesting premise. It's not that different from some of what they used to do so it's plausible to anyone who knows the history or plausible enough. You don't need complete realism just the elements for good drama and a competent cast and they're all here. It might not appeal to fans of the modern gory morality plays like Saw as it's not a big budget film and is morally ambiguous. It's not as good as Hitchcock's oneroom thrillers such as Rope but what is? It's far better than most horror films made today relying on slowly building tension which never truly abates and the ability of the actors to make it real. Worked for me.".

There are also plenty of conspiracy theories floating around about it including the idea that it was never truly shut down but the facts as we know them are pretty crazy with thousands of pages of evidence of a CIArun covert psychological program gone off the rails  at least with Milgram they knew they had to draw a line somewhere but not really for MKULTRA.You really don't need to make anything up but what the film does with MKULTRA does make for an interesting premise. It's not that different from some of what they used to do so it's plausible to anyone who knows the history or plausible enough. You don't need complete realism just the elements for good drama and a competent cast and they're all here. It might not appeal to fans of the modern gory morality plays like Saw as it's not a big budget film and is morally ambiguous. It's not as good as Hitchcock's oneroom thrillers such as Rope but what is? It's far better than most horror films made today relying on slowly building tension which never truly abates and the ability of the actors to make it real. Worked for me.";

What is scary is that some extremist would think this would be a perfect way to recruit subjects. I am sorry about being so vague but I don't want to give the movie away.This movie makes one think how would one act if placed in a similar situation. It makes one think am I strong enough and smart enough to get out of the situation in 1 piece. Again very good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "You may have heard of experiments conducted over the years done in a control group or maybe not where people are put in a room and men in white coats look on and listen through glass walls or other such rooms and watch as in quotes things happen between or to the people. One such project the MK Ultra in the 1970's had people in a control group taking drugs and observing their actions. What we learn in the Killing Room based on these experiments is that the program has been 'refined' over the years into what it is now an experiment in testing who will be the last man standing in one room and that one man will be more than likely willing to follow any command chiefly to die for his country. And as it turns out here the people running the experiment know who is really the top contender within a minute of their being in the room.The film of The Killing Room is a series of really tense scenes that have characters in a room figuring out what to do juxtaposed with people up in an observation room one of them Chloe Sevigny plays a newcomer who may join the organization  if she has the right stuff for it. Not every moment is clingtoyourchair suspenseful but rather it's director Jonathan Liebesman giving the audience a slowburn the clock keeps ticking from two hours down to none for the three people in the room to answer a question it starts as four but one is shot in the head just to start things off and depending on who answers it right one may or may not die. In the meantime we see Dr. Philipps Stormare and his new possible underling Sevigny watch in clinical detail how everything unfolds punctuated by sounds of voiceover from the other technicians and doctors observing and watching the actions.The pace is never lacking specially since it's a short feature length movie and it works best as a psychological horror piece around what characters will do next. This includes Sevigny's Reilly who one suspects will be the one that the film will become about. It does in part since we watch and wonder if she'll break away from the insane experiment or stick with it and become as bloodless as Storemare. But really the best scenes are in that white room and the details of the characters as they try and figure out their situation from moment to moment. Things like the blood that they spread on the wall so as to read the names of former people in the room the questions and the answers that the men have to figure out and stick their answers to or not the nonpattern of the numbers counting down without consistency.And the performances meet up to the standards needed it's not a Saw movie full of horrid melodrama and twists and Timothy Hutton and surprisingly Nick Cannon meet up to what is required of them and then some. We do care about what will happen to them even as they're under such duress that they come apart at the seams. The horror is in anticipation imagining what could happen next which is almost impossible to figure. If Liebesman has a great control over this he has less control over other things that aren't quite as excellent such as a music composition that is overlaid in some scenes some of this should just be silent and be more affecting or just too much in others. And by the very end you will feel so drained that you'll wonder what exactly was the point of it  it doesn't have anything very entertaining but that's the point. The Killing Room leaves you pondering the inhumanity of people who stop at nothing to get their end goals. Who should die isn't as crucial as Who decides who lives and who doesn't. At this the film is worth a look.".

Yet within the brothel she resides she builds a temple of love and care for those two people that come to see her. Nandu and Anand are members of society yet only ostensibly yearning for the compassion that their families fail to provide them and in search they come to Pushpa whose abundance of love and human sympathy far overshadows her disreputable social standing. They alone see her inner beauty while society maligns her yet as the director points cannot provide the qualities of love happiness and tranquility for members like Nandu and Anand. Pushpa's relationship with Anand is certainly one of the most beautiful you will see. Theirs is a purely platonic relationship which succeeds where the social union of marriage  for both  fails.As they continue to meet their bond grows and beyond their own socially certified families they create a little family of true love depth and care. They receive from each other the love they so desire  motherly love for Nandu a true companion for Anand and a child and husband for Pushpa  though their relationship with each other has no social legitimacy. Samanta succeeds in creating a cynical presentation of society as one that compels people to stay within the confines of its social institution of family yet cannot provide for the very emotional and spiritual ingredients that constitute it. Add the fact that it is society after all that created the brothel where unquenched desires can be fulfilled and what you have is a representation that makes Pushpa's relationship with Nandu and Anand all the more 'holy'.This film tackled a theme that was very much taboo in Indian Cinema and succeeds in presenting a mature yet never overthetop nor didactic story that ultimately every Indian household can identify with. The music is an absolute delight and adds to the melancholic yet redemptive nature of the relationship between the three protagonists. Setting presentation is class with nothing done to hide the vividly grotesque nature of the red light district and the people that patronise it. It has its fair share of stereotypical characters who function very much as symbols of the unscrupulous cunning nature of society. Yes you get doses of the typical Hindi film melodrama but its very much reserved to a modicum. Where it succeeds is in teaching you about human relationships and that it is love togetherness and understanding that makes family and not a social ceremony or some legal document. This is a film for all generations who appreciate human relationships and its power to transcend social boundaries.".

	schema:reviewBody "A village girl Pushpa is turned away by her inlaws and her own family. A friend sells her to a brothel where she is frequented by Anand. Anand is married but he finds peace with Pushpa. As the fate has it Pushpa's relative Sharma moves in the same locality as Pushpa. She tries to find some love from the family but is too contaminated for a 'respected' society now. The film is broadly about how every humanbeing long for 'love' and still how rare it is to be loved. This movie is divine. I have no other word for it. It's a fantastic combination of concept story line execution and acting. I see this film in the same league as 'Ram Teri Ganga Maili' because the woes of the protagonist are the same still it is completely different. RTGM is more a sociopolitical statement while this film works at a very personal level. Pushpa and her longing for love is just too heart breaking. Everyone she loves disappear at some point or the other. In her later years she takes care of her dying husband. The paradox of the situation is very interesting because through out the film you see young Pushpa as a prostitute. The way Shakti Samantha has handled the death of her husband scene is brilliant. She goes to the river with a very clean and expressionless face she uses a small rock and just gets rid of the bangles. Nandu is the high point of the film. Pushpa cannot have a family and so she tries to find a son in Nandu who is illtreated by his step mom. Pushpa shares the pain of longing for a son with Anand who is supposed to be her lover but obviously they can't marry and have children. The character of Anand is also brilliant as he is not just a neutral character.Rajesh Khanna is brilliant in this film but it's a Sharmila Tagore film. She has given an Oscar performance. Rajesh Khanna has also given an Oscar performance. Must mention the name of the genius because of who this film is sure to go down in the history of Indian Cinema. Mr. Rahul Deb Burman. AmarPrem is unarguably the best Indian soundtrack ever recorded. Kishore Kumar in his prime opening credits by SD Burman and poignant poetry by Anand Bakshi. I feel like writing about 'THE' KK but that would be jazz. Of course we all know how much we miss him everyday. Shakti Samantha has created a masterpiece. A must watch. 1010.".

	schema:headline " A heartwarming picture";
	schema:reviewBody "Heartwarming is a word which would best describe Shakti Samanta's Amar Prem. The film is about love humanity compassion and how all these terms are condemned by the cruel society of those times. This is the story of Pushpa a young woman who runs away from her husband's house after the latter marries again and starts abusing her. She is later brought to a brothel in Calcutta by her villageuncle. There she starts singing while all the passersby walk and get enchanted by her voice. That's her new job and there she meets Mr Anand a young bitter and unhappily married man whose wife does not even care about. Another man from the same village she comes from named Sharma resides close to Pushpa's house. There she meets the little boy Nandu Sharma's son from his first deceased wife who is maltreated by his stepmother while his father is at work. A great relationship grows between Pushapa and Anand and even a greater motherson relationship grows between Pushapa and Nandu. But the cruel society won't leave it at that.Amar Prem is a melodramatic movie but it is a beautiful and sincere melodrama not a clichd one. The relationships in this movie are superbly portrayed my favourite relationship being the one between Pushapa and Nandu. Samanta uses symbolism to illustrate the story. The film is good in writing dialogues music and acting. RD Burman's music never disappoints. Where acting goes this is Sharmila Tagore's movie and she kind of reprises her role in Aradhana that of a selfless and caring woman who epitomises Indian feminine beauty. She is indeed beautiful and convincing throughout the movie. Rajesh Khanna is excellent as Anand and does particularly well in the film's final sequences. The child actor who plays Nandu is wonderful. Vinod Mehra does very well as the older Nandu. Amar Prem is a worthy film. It is both moving and enjoyable and should be a real cinematic treat for lovers of classic Hindi cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first and the real superstar of Bollywood has passed away. Rajesh Khanna took his last breath in Aashirwaad his residence today 18.07.2012. Fondly known as Kaka Rajesh Khanna commanded an era in Bollywood a short but unforgettable era during 19691971. Just three years ! Yes but the magic they created lasted forever. It is still there and makes us plunge into nostalgia time and again. Amar Prem immortal love is based on a Bengali story  Nishipadma penned by Bibhuti Bhushan Bandhyopadhyay. It's is the story of Pushpa Sharmila Tagore who gets expelled from her Sasuraal inlaw's home and has to struggle a lot in her life. Finally she has to take up the profession of a woman who sings privately at her home to entertain the gloomy visitors. She is not a prostitute but this profession is seen by the socalled clean society as a dirty profession only and the women who take to it are seen in a degraded way. The place where Pushpa resides and professes is actually a Kotha not a brothel. She sells her melodious voice to enable the aggrieved to find solace through that and does not sell her sexual favours as a woman. However the judgmental society is not ready to differentiate between the two.Among the visitors to Pushpa's Kotha there's a tenderhearted businessman  Anand Babu Rajesh Khanna who is an alcoholic due to the lack of peace in his family life. He and Pushpa comes pretty close in the platonic way. There appears one more source of happiness and enthusiasm in Pushpa's dry life in the form of a little boy Nandu who is the son of her neighbour Sujit Kumar and always remains distressed through the bad behaviour of his stepmother Bindu. He does not stop visiting Pushpa despite being prohibited from his home for that because he is getting motherly love from that lonely woman.Anand Babu's family's coming to know of his visits to Pushpa and Nandu's family's leaving the place snatch these small joys too from Pushpa and she falls lonely again. However years later she happens to come across both Anand Babu and adult Nandu Vinod Mehra and her loneliness and agony ends at least in the dusk time of her life when Nandu takes her to his home as his mother.The character of Pushpa is the soul of the movie and the spectator's journey through the entire movie runs alongside her only. Anand Babu's character is not essential for the main story but the thing is that it only infuses the colours of life into the dry narrative. It's through him only that the significance of platonic relationships is underscored emphatically in the movie. Pushpa's agony is felt only in part through herself. Partly it's conveyed through the character of Anand Babu and that's the beauty of this movie and the relationship between the lead pair. Such relationships cannot be named or explained through words. They can be understood properly only when somebody is able to feel them.The Bengali society of the period of the story and the status of women has been dealt with quite realistically in the story. And that's why the movie also contains quite impressive and moving sequences. However Shakti Saamanta could not do complete justice to the classic story. This movie could have been much better had more attention been paid to screenplay and direction. However the day has been saved by performances and music. Let me discuss its music first which contains lyrics penned by Anand Bakshi and tunes composed by R.D. Burman. It contains two memorable songs of Lata Mangeshkar  1. Raina Beeti Jaaye Shyam Na Aaye which is based on Raaga Todi and 2. Bada Natkhat Hai Re Krishna Kanhaiya which is touching song filled with motherly love. However the music of this movie is better known for three invaluable gems in the voice of Kishore Kumar  1. Ye Kya Hua Kaise Hua Kab Hua Kyun Hua Jab Hua Tab Hua Ho Chhodo Ye Na Socho 2. Chingaari Koi Bhadake To Saawan Usse Bujhaaye 3. Kuchh To Log Kahenge Logon Ka Kaam Hai Kehna. Performances are also great. The supporting cast has done well the child artist playing the role of young Nandu has delivered a heartconquering performance and Vinod Mehra as adult Nandu is also up to the mark in his cameo. However it's the lead pair which has taken this movie to the heights greater than it actually deserves. The character of Pushpa is the heart and soul of the story and Sharmila Tagore has delivered one of the best performances of her career in this movie. Her onscreen chemistry with Rajesh Khanna was amazing and that's why she made one of the most popular onscreen pairs with him.Rajesh Khanna is at his mannerismic best in this movie. His trademark jerk of the neck peculiar dialoguedelivery smile style everything is present here in the most loud way. And perhaps this was the peak of the success of his gimmicks which could go down only later. Anyway in this movie he is just lovable and it's easy to understand why he was so popular. No other actor can be imagined in the unforgettable character of Anand Babu.This movie is a treat to watch for lovers of golden oldies. Kaka is no more but Anand Babu will live forever. People have said a lot about Kaka's failure in later years but I repeat for the departed soul  Kuchh To Log Kahenge Logon Ka Kaam Hai Kehna ...".

Eventually the song was shot in a studio set. Such was the popularity Rajesh commanded.In spite of his super stardom as is his wont he did not think twice about accepting this role knowing fully well that this film centers around the heroine. The beauty is he comes out unscathed. He looks handsome in his Bengali dhoti  underplays superbly. The end scenes specially show kaka at his best.Definitely a film which comes in the top 3 of kaka's films  eternally loved by Rajesh khanna fans.Watch it over  over again.

Have you heard the song doli me Bithay Ke Kanhar.........? I bet you will forget the songs of recent times.... both son and father namely RD Burman and SD burman and the excellent sharmila Tagore will make you cry in the song............. Well you will take a long time to recover from the movie after watching it .... but if you don't watch it interestingly you will not like it much.... It is very artistic and touchy in its flavour....... It is bound to make you emotional in a very different way. Shakti Da has this great capability of making you cry by his character's plight and on the top of that the music matches the atmosphere of the movie bit by bit.... RD Burman was at his best in this movie.... the songs are incorporated in the movie to carry the viewer into the mind of the character.the lyrics are marvellous. Rajesh Khanna is unstoppable. Don't have words to express how he acted in the movie. As for Sharmila Tagore she was the same as rajesh khanna.. the second half of the movie is quite touching..... Look at the way the song BADA NATKAHT HAI is used in the background when Vinod Mehra returns to search pushpa.. I recommend this movie to all who haven't seen what Indian directors are capable of. watch it to know it.............".

	schema:headline " Amar Prem Review";
	schema:reviewBody "Amar Prem is a film directed by Shakti Samanta which is itself a remake of a Bengali film Nishi Padma. This film stars Sharmila Tagore Rajesh Khanna Om Prakash Bindu Vinod Mehra and a host of other actors. This film is considered as one of a classics till today. It was also famous for the RajeshSharmila pair up. At first seeing the title I thought it was a romantic film seeing the name 'Amar Prem' meaning eternal love. But I didn't know that love could be depicted in this way a s shown in the film. And I had a great time watching this film.Plot Pushpa is thrown into the world of prostitution after being thrown out of home by her mother and husband. There she finds happiness in Anand Babu one of her customers and Nandu one of the children recently shifted to the neighborhood.Story and Direction Like they say 'Old is Gold'. This film clearly justifies the statement. When I first heard the film I just knew very little about it. But whoever saw this film has sung praises about it. So I decided let me give it a shot. And. O My God I was impressed with each and every thing in the film. I thought at first that this was a Rajesh Khanna film. But no it is the story of Pushpa. At the time when heroes dominated the cinema world a story having a female protagonist was very rare. Every aspect is very nicely shown. From Anand Babu's frustration about his marriage to people seeing prostitutes as someone not fitting in a normal society. Also there is a scene where some mud from the prostitute's house is mixed with the clay by which Lord Durga's murti is made according to the maker it is considered auspicious. So beautifully the contrasting views of 2 different sects of the society. Also the relations between Nandu and her stepmother and Pushpa is shown with reality. The climax was also justified in every way.Performances Sharmila was very good as Pushpa. She emoted the scenes in a very nice way. Rajesh Khanna who dons a more supporting character in this film was also great. Om Prakash does a really good comic act for the amount of time he is in the film. Bindu was also good as the evil step mother. Vinod Mehra appearing in the final scenes of the film also left an impact.Music R D Burman creates some very good music in the film. All of the song are hummable and remembered all through the centuries. My favorites would be 'Raina Beet Jaye' and 'Chingaari Jo Bhadke'.Favorite Scene Every scene where Anand says 'Pushpa I hate tears' is my awww moment. There are 3 scenes in the entire film where the dialogue was said. Also the climax where Anand stands up for Pushpa was great.Final Verdict Amar Prem satisfied me in every way. when I finished the film I understood why this classic is still revered. I couldn't fault this film in any way. Any person who loves Indian films this film is a must watch.I give it a full score of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have seen Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis you will certainly recognize that same entertaining formula based on the interaction of weird funny characters and amusing situations which certainly do not appear as new but always get to please the viewer. The two main characters the schizoid Belgian customofficer who hates all French people and does not welcome the unification of Europe and the more quiet and easygoing French one interpreted by the good Dany Boon who believes in integration and tolerance give rise to amusing sketches but also the other minor clumsy characters help create a comic atmosphere. Original indeed is the idea to set the funny story in the context of Europe's unification which one would think more suitable for more serious and thoughtprovoking stories although some reflection upon the consequences of the elimination of borders is not neglected. I saw this movie in the Italian dubbed version which was good indeed although I think these movies often played on the mispronunciation of words and the mocking of accents should be seen in the original version in order to get the real linguistic funny quality but of course you should master the French language very well.".

The two main characters the schizoid Belgian customofficer who hates all French people and does not welcome the unification of Europe and the more quiet and easygoing French one interpreted by the good Dany Boon who believes in integration and tolerance give rise to amusing sketches but also the other minor clumsy characters help create a comic atmosphere. Original indeed is the idea to set the funny story in the context of Europe's unification which one would think more suitable for more serious and thoughtprovoking stories although some reflection upon the consequences of the elimination of borders is not neglected. I saw this movie in the Italian dubbed version which was good indeed although I think these movies often played on the mispronunciation of words and the mocking of accents should be seen in the original version in order to get the real linguistic funny quality but of course you should master the French language very well.";

	schema:reviewBody "Given the commercial and critical success of director Dany Boon's earlier film Welcome to the Sticks it is peculiar that his next project Nothing to Declare endured a straighttoDVD release in France. This is despite its superb sense of humour engaging interplay between characters and generally fun lighthearted feel. The story set in 1993 centres on the racist triggerhappy Belgian Ruben Benoit Poelvoorde who is paired up against his will with Frenchman Mathias Boon in their effort to police the FrancoBelgian border. Compounding the strenuous partnership is the fact that Mathias is secretly dating overprotective Ruben's sister Julie Bernard. Also intertwined in the story is the oafish Jacques and trying wife Irene who turn to smuggling contraband between the borders to make ends meet as well as the world's most incompetent drug ring and their shorttempered boss.Right off the bat it's clear that Boon has a talent for ensemble directing. Although he and Poelvoorde share the lead each fringe character enjoys ample screen time to tell their story and draw audience engagement while all potential loose ends are appropriately tied up without leaving any individual's fate hanging in the balance.Humour is consistent throughout Nothing to Declare. Following a slow start the film employs varying instances of physical visual and verbal comedy the latter of which is accentuated by the consistently tense tight interplay between certain pairs of characters. The arguable highlight occurs as the criminals attempt to disguise their van as an ambulance for the purpose of drug smuggling but honourable mentions must also go to Ruben's crude xenophobic dad and the 'pimpingout' of Mathias's patrol car.Boon casually addresses the fine line between patriotism and racism with this film but like all good comedies it permits pure entertainment to take priority without falling into the trap of becoming too preachy political or divisive.There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsisiprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication I'd also love to hear from you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well it's a very original francophone movie about the European construction. As I have already said if we are an Union of 27 states it's still difficult to share our cultures and to know what happens outside our national frontiers. For one time this comedy has the intelligence of digging this experience and try to capture the impact of the European ideal in the daily life. Choosing little borders towns and an endangered occupation like customs officers is excellent because all the story is already there. In addition i got strong ties with this setting If it has been Italy or Spain I wouldn't have been as interested as with Belgium simply because Benelux is my third home for me as I lived there nearly for one year. In the same way Polvorde was a personal pick because with Romain Duris and Michael Youn it's the only francophone actor that I like. Boon and his cute pick for girlfriend are worthy of good mention. Finally as it happens during the best time of the year Christmas time I really plunged into the movie. The production is very lavish with a beautiful cinematography and it has indeed funny moments. Unfortunately if the national antagonism is the real motor at the beginning the machine becomes soon a drug trafficking case and loses a lot of its appeal. It's expected as the movie answers quickly how light the concept of nation can be as the Belgium officer said countries are foremost a shared past thus something that can't really bound together the living people. Next the European union isn't really chosen by its citizens but comes from political elite. The only thing that still bothers me is why does the only song to be featured in this francophone production and that appears in a climax is an English one?".

However they ruined this opportunity by including scenes of drugs violence and even nudity with plenty of swearing! A bizarre decision to exclude such an audience!

The angle used to oppose those two characters may look a bit basic but that's what makes the spectator believing the story. The movie is pretty good for the beginning till the end and the full cast is great. Franois Damiens had his little craziness for our own pleasure. Poelvoorde is the main character and is the one that makes this movie above average and trust me that Benoit pulls this waayy above average he makes it great ! If you like comedy and want to have your 2 hours of relaxation this movie will delight you. Another good move from director Dani Boon. Enjoy !".

That movie was about cultural differences between middleclass Frenchmen and the Ch'tis the French who live in the far northeast corner of France what was once the Nord Pas de Calais and is now trying to come up with a new name for itself. That movie plays on cultural stereotypes true but it is often very funny.This one is less funny frankly though not without laughs.This time the clash is between the French and the Belgians. More specifically it is the story of a family of rabidly antiFrench Belgians and the problems they cause for one of their own who has had the misfortune to fall in love with a Frenchman Boon. The jokes are usually pretty obvious but the characters are generally likable  with the exception of the Belgian border patrol guard who is just too extreme.You won't be bored but I can't imagine you'd come back for seconds.".

That movie was about cultural differences between middleclass Frenchmen and the Ch'tis the French who live in the far northeast corner of France what was once the Nord Pas de Calais and is now trying to come up with a new name for itself. That movie plays on cultural stereotypes true but it is often very funny.This one is less funny frankly though not without laughs.This time the clash is between the French and the Belgians. More specifically it is the story of a family of rabidly antiFrench Belgians and the problems they cause for one of their own who has had the misfortune to fall in love with a Frenchman Boon. The jokes are usually pretty obvious but the characters are generally likable  with the exception of the Belgian border patrol guard who is just too extreme.You won't be bored but I can't imagine you'd come back for seconds.";

This is also partially true for this penultimate film we have here but this only refers to music drama and romance. The heart and should of these films have always been the classroom pranks and looking at the almost complete absence of classroom scenes here I would almost go so far and say this film has little to do with the series anymore. Heintje already showed up in films 2 and 4 both with peter Alexander and he is in here too again but without Alexander this time. And it shows certainly that he is not the greatest actor unfortunately as he is as much of a lead as Hansi Kraus not the greatest actor himself in here. But what is possibly the worst about this film is the crime plot. This one felt so uninteresting and out of place. It's perfectly fine if they wanted to try a new direction maybe to avoid getting repetitive but with what they went here its was a major disappointment. The cast is still pretty solid even if you miss some of the big very famous names from previous films. Winnetou fans will be delighted to see Ralf Wolter in here. However for me personally this was the first film where I was genuinely disappointed with the story and plot which is especially sad as I like Schndler's Knrz a lot and he has lots of screen time in here. But he has no convincing story either. I give it a thumbsdown. Watch something else instead.".

Unless of course you want to hand me your 30 page dissertation on why Doc Brown's time machine is an impossibility. If you're not one of those sad lonely people you'll find this movie quite a lot of fun. Not an epic masterpiece but a lot of fun.If i had to voice one problem is that they need to stop giving anaglyph glasses. it kind of hurts your eyes after a while. They have good 3d glasses don't they? they give them out in Florida for Terminator and the Muppet show so why don't they include those? that would definitely make the movie better in my opinion.Other than my hurting eyes though this movie was a nice break from monotonous depressing dark plot based films.With a fun premise tongue in cheek humor and decent 3D effects Journey to the center of the earth gets 7 glowing birds out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "First off let me say that I'm VERY glad I saw this movie in 3D. If I hadn't I might have walked out. The instant strength of this film that comes to mind is the great use of the 3D technology. It has plenty of surprises and it doesn't over do it at all. HOWEVER this does not excuse the blatant cheesiness stupid typical one liners from Brendan Fraser nor the underutilization of such a fantastic concept.The story isn't really based on the book by Jules Verne it's more based on a group's adventure that uses the book as a guide. It's certainly a fantasy adventure that kids will enjoy but adults may find themselves getting restless by the time the third act reaches us. I also have very strong complaints about the predictability of the film which was so bad that I could predict what the characters would say in addition to what was about to happen on screen. That's bad. It's a classic case of flashy visuals horrid plot execution. It's a wasted concept that could have been a lot better had the filmmaking branched out from the narrow scope it obviously uses. In fact I could see this exact premise working PERFECTLY in a Guillermo Del Toro or Tim Burton type horror film.We really only got three characters in the movie and less than ten speaking parts so a lot rides on our three leads. First our headliner and box office draw Brendan Fraser. He may not be the best actor and he may say some pretty stupid one liners that get old after the 800th time but he still has the same charm that makes him likable in the Mummy films. I really think that this film is further proof that Josh Hutcherson is THE best young American actor. He's blossomed into a great young actor after a stunning turn in Bridge to Terabithia in addition to great shows in Zathura and Little Manhattan. I've never seen a kid especially a boy as the girls tend to be better performers at ages 1016 show so much emotional range not only in this movie but throughout his already prolific career he's 15 and has 24 acting projects in his career. He's one to watch for a very long time. Our third lead is Icelandic actress Anita Briem. She neither added or took away anything from the film though I suppose that can be blamed on the script as she is not well developed. Seth Meyers yes THAT Seth Meyers provides some laughs at the beginning and end of the film.I felt that the chemistry between performers was very good and was one thing that kept me interested. I came to care for all three of them and they worked well together. Fraser and Hutcherson in particular worked well as uncle and nephew. While I was disappointed in the narrow scope of the film's vision what was contained within said scope was well done and entertaining. The 3D really made it better. Without the 3D this film is nothing but a mere Cclass fantasy adventure that will bore anyone above age 10. However the chemistry of the actors and the 3D save it from somewhat disaster and make the film a bit enjoyable. It's worth the price of admission to a 3D theater for sure but I advise you to bring a younger person with you who knows maybe you'll feed off their energy. To put it simple every kid under 10 or 11 will love it then watch it again in 10 years and go what was I thinking?.WITH 3D 510 WITHOUT 3D 310".

	onyx:emotionText "First off let me say that I'm VERY glad I saw this movie in 3D. If I hadn't I might have walked out. The instant strength of this film that comes to mind is the great use of the 3D technology. It has plenty of surprises and it doesn't over do it at all. HOWEVER this does not excuse the blatant cheesiness stupid typical one liners from Brendan Fraser nor the underutilization of such a fantastic concept.The story isn't really based on the book by Jules Verne it's more based on a group's adventure that uses the book as a guide. It's certainly a fantasy adventure that kids will enjoy but adults may find themselves getting restless by the time the third act reaches us. I also have very strong complaints about the predictability of the film which was so bad that I could predict what the characters would say in addition to what was about to happen on screen. That's bad. It's a classic case of flashy visuals horrid plot execution. It's a wasted concept that could have been a lot better had the filmmaking branched out from the narrow scope it obviously uses.

	schema:reviewBody "Plain and simple this is a kids' movie. If you're an adult and you saw the previews with some genuinelyscary looking scenes and thought Wow this looks cool  be warned. Some of it is cool but most of it isn't.Most of it is Brendan Franser doing his George Of the Jungle routing of yelling and screaming either trying to find this teen kid or in terror as he falling for being chased by something. In fact the last half hour of this film will give you headache with all the yelling by all three major parties.I didn't realize this film was out in 3D. I saw it on a regular DVD and the specialeffects in 2D obviously looked so cheesy. Some of these scenes looked like they were right out of the Tarzan movies of the 1930s with the obvious screen in the background and the actors on a stage in front of it. So see this 3D if possible otherwise expect it took look pretty bad.Teen girls in the audience will like Josh Hutcherson Sean a handsome young kid who looks ad sounds good until he gets excited and his voice cracks. Ah the joys of puberty. Meanwhile teen boys will get an eyeful with Anita Briem Hannah a very attractive new face. Actually Anita has a lot of credibility in this role playing a character living in Iceland who in real life was born and raised in Iceland before moving to England at the age of 16.As for the story it's a remake of the famous Jules Verne story about discovering a whole new world without people in the center of the earth complete with amazing birds and frightening animals and fish. Despite the dumbness of the dialog the first hour was watchable. As with many adventure stories though it gets totally carried in the final third of the film.In all the movie is fairly entertaining to the degree that adults wouldn't be bored if they took their kids. It's not really offensive except for one stupid playonwords which is totally unnecessary. Other than that this is a very clean film safe for kids of most age. There are parts however that are way too scary for the real young ones.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw the trailer for Journey to the Centre of the Earth last Christmas when I watched The Nightmare Before Christmas in 3d. I also remember clearly thinking what a load of rubbish it looked like. It appeared to be a gigantic gimmick cashing in on the latest 3d technology. The various TV spots and images I saw of the movie in the past few months has done absolutely nothing to dispel this notion. However this past week something happened I didn't really expect the critics were giving it quite decent reviews most praising it as ridiculously good fun. I was still sceptical but also in some way intrigued perhaps the trailers were just poorly done. So I went to see the movie today of course in 3d more on that later and was absolutely amazed at how entertaining the movie really is. While the movie does feel like a gimmick at times do we really need that yoyo scene the movie also does seem quite well made. The performances too were good for a movie that really could just have been a cash in Brendan Fraser is surprisingly likable and good in the movie and Josh Hutcherson continues to deliver performances that all Hollywood kids should be delivering as good as. But most importantly its so much fun the action sequences looks incredible in 3d and the landscapes of the actual Centre of the Earth do look beautiful. This is a 3d movie and make no mistakes by thinking it is worth watching in 2d it really isn't. The movie is a kids movie and so we get an all too happy ending but there is a brief moment of darkness before the end and that too makes the movie all the better for adults.So onto the performances. Brendan Fraser as I have said delivers a decent performance here. He seemed to have disappeared in recent years but with both this and The Mummy 3 arriving in cinemas this year I am sure we might be seeing some more of him over the next few years. While he does have to deal with a lot of clichd lines in the movie he does also ooze charisma and seems a genuinely nice bloke. He also does a great double act alongside Josh Hutcherson as his nephew. Hutcherson really is an Alister in the making in my opinion while his performance here doesn't match what he did Bridge to Terabithia he still makes a potentially average brat into a likable characters with genuine motivations. His characters transformation neither feels forced nor corny and one moment with Fraser in front of a sunset is one of the many highlights of the movie. Anita Briem is also surprisingly good as the Best mountain climber in the world. Once again this could be a run of the mill plot device character yet she makes it a much more interesting one. The script gives her some good moments and she does have considerable chemistry with Fraser.But of course the main attraction of the movie has to be its effects and of course the 3d. The early part of the movie does feature the most gimmicks of the 3d we get the yoyo scene the spitting scene etc. While they get the kids excited they're not the most exciting things to watch in the world and certainly don't make a good movie. Its when the trio go up to a mountain the 3d really does work. Not only does the scenery look beautiful but it feels alive as it pops out of the screen at you. Nightmare Before Christmas didn't do the 3d too well but Centre of the Earth really does it brilliantly. A mine cart chase is the cinematic equivalent of a roller coaster ride and really does get the adrenaline pumping. The much promised TRex sequence does not disappoint and a surprisingly tense magnetic rock sequence don't ask looks all the better for the 3d. The script is also much better than it really should be in fact it actually works better than your average blockbuster to be honest. But as I keep saying do not waste your money on the 2d version. I understand why they're releasing it in 2d the producers do need their money back but it really will not be the same thing. Having seen Beowulf in 3d and 2d I know how much a disappointment the 2d version can be after seeing the beauty of the 3d.Overall Journey to the Centre of the Earth may very well be the biggest surprise of the summer and quite possibly the year. While it won't win awards it does entertaining and the hundreds of kids who were in my screen today seemed just as impressed and entertained as I was. Also the promise of a potential sequel at the end of the movie didn't horrify me in fact I'm ashamed to admit I'd quite happily watch another one if its delivered with the same quality.".

At least the 1950's version retained some veneer of plausibility. These people even survived fiery explosions without a blister found each other over scores of miles using a compass and all in one and a half days? Yeah I had fun watching it but later on you realize it may just have been the stupidest film you've ever seen! At least the script didn't call for the actors to take each other seriously but this also robbed the film of any suspense whatsoever. Kind of like in a Spielberg film  you just know the kid's not going to get hurt no matter what. This film needed a villain or two because you just knew none of these three morons were going to get hurt. Just a 3D vehicle for the sake of 3D stunts.".

I'm not gonna spoil the ending but I'm probably not gonna be able to... Now I do have to say that I wasn't bored during the movie it was acted out well enough and it had its thrilling moments. But those things wouldn't be enough to recommend it for though. My main concern was that some scenes were just too obviously made to make the movie adventurous. like a 'rollercoasterride' in a mine. The only thing I would recommend it for would be the RealD. It's a huge difference with the regular IMAX3D. The image is crystal clear and it all looks very realistic and it seemed like some shots were especially made for the 3Deffect which really made me jump sometimes. So if you're interested in new techniques go see it in 3D it's an interesting experience. The movie itself is just not really worth your money. It's a regular adventuremovie with good SFX but nothing original or special in it.".

	schema:reviewBody "While Journey to the Center of the Earth will readily appeal to its target audience of youngsters and the easily impressed its ridiculous story won't earn the respect of any longtime Jules Verne fans. The jokes alternate between rather amusing and blatantly failed but the creative implementation of 3D effects pleasantly surprise balancing out the whole Journey into a much more palatable affair.Everyone knows you can't travel to the center of the Earth. Everyone except for publicly criticized science professor Trevor Anderson Brendan Fraser who journeys to the mythical world within a world to unravel the mystery surrounding the disappearance of this brother. Accompanying him is his nephew Sean Josh Hutcherson and their pretty mountain guide Hannah Anita Briem who will join in his fantastic adventures in a lost land of terrifying creatures and prehistoric danger.Glowing hummingbirds magnetic floating rocks and giant carnivorous plants may sound pretty silly and that's because they are. However when such creations are thrown into a 3D movie they become spectacular moments of visual brilliance. Except perhaps the floating rocks. But Journey does well in its main reason for existence and generates an ample amount of creative uses for its medium. From things jumping out of the screen to more things jumping out of the screen Journey wastes no opportunity to throw every manner of object or deadly creature at its audience resulting in an abundance of visual stimulation and a noticeable absence on solid storytelling. At least the former was expected.The true Verneian will be dismayed to learn that little remains familiar between this latest adventure to the Earth's core and the original novel. And while it may be unfair to compare it to the book or even the 1959 film director Eric Brevig's vision often feels like an excuse to use a famous title rather than a sincere adaptation. Goofy comedy replaces earnest though farfetched explanations and the unfriendly locale thrives on stereotypical monstrosities designed specifically for dimensional effects. Odd musical bouts aside the '59 version utilizes a human antagonist for an extra layer of depth on a film already submerged deep within the Earth's crust and a race for discovery accompanies the challenge of survival. This new Journey substitutes in a young boy for a young man a bumbling scientist for a genius professor and an animated avian for an Icelandic handyman but at least the female protagonist remains this time in the form of a mountain guide. Unfortunately all elements of drama and romance take a backseat to the outlandish action and phosphorescent birds.If curiosity or the kids gets the better of you and you must take this Journey make sure you see it in 3D. Otherwise once the story rapidly tires the only thing you'll be able to fall back on is the headrest of your theater chair.The Massie Twins".

From things jumping out of the screen to more things jumping out of the screen Journey wastes no opportunity to throw every manner of object or deadly creature at its audience resulting in an abundance of visual stimulation and a noticeable absence on solid storytelling. At least the former was expected.The true Verneian will be dismayed to learn that little remains familiar between this latest adventure to the Earth's core and the original novel. And while it may be unfair to compare it to the book or even the 1959 film director Eric Brevig's vision often feels like an excuse to use a famous title rather than a sincere adaptation. Goofy comedy replaces earnest though farfetched explanations and the unfriendly locale thrives on stereotypical monstrosities designed specifically for dimensional effects. Odd musical bouts aside the '59 version utilizes a human antagonist for an extra layer of depth on a film already submerged deep within the Earth's crust and a race for discovery accompanies the challenge of survival. This new Journey substitutes in a young boy for a young man a bumbling scientist for a genius professor and an animated avian for an Icelandic handyman but at least the female protagonist remains this time in the form of a mountain guide. Unfortunately all elements of drama and romance take a backseat to the outlandish action and phosphorescent birds.If curiosity or the kids gets the better of you and you must take this Journey make sure you see it in 3D. Otherwise once the story rapidly tires the only thing you'll be able to fall back on is the headrest of your theater chair.The Massie Twins";

Could it be a 3D movie that would finally exploit the format without going for the cheap poke something into your face tricks? Sadly Not this time.From the first scene it was obvious that the cheese was still there  Trilobyte Antennae sticking out of the screen  Toothpaste spit splattered on the screen  and it kept up throughout the movie. I guess its fun for the preteens in the audience I heard a lot of giggles and Eeeeew's behind me but It left me wanting a real movie that used 3D instead of yet another 3D trickfest.There was potential in the plot line but at least for me it was lost in the 3D trickery. Its too bad Chart didn't stay on as Director and make a true 3D adventure. I never quite got to the point of caring about any of the characters and after about an hour found myself bored.If you are looking for a fun movie that you can take your kids to munch on popcorn and have a few laughs its not a bad option but there are much better movies in the genre that have come out this summer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't go and see 'Journey' if you're expecting either a solid interpretation of the Jules Verne novel or a thrilling summer blockbuster. 'Journey' is light hearted fun but as a piece of light hearted fun it excels.The story centres no pun intended around publicly abhorred professor Trevor Anderson Brendan Fraser whose lab in New York faces closure just as things are getting exciting cough cough with his research into volcanic something or other a project derived from his obsession with the unexplained disappearance of his late brother. To further complicate things Trevor gets landed with his smart alec techy nephew Sean Josh Hutcherson and thus premieres a generic 'odd couple' relationship as the stuffy academic trades words and yoyos with his postmod companion.Anyway as soon as this gets underway Trevor finds an excuse to jet off to Iceland where for one reason or another he descends two hundred feet into a volcano and after one big 3D disaster leads to another he finds himself big shock at the centre of the earth wherein he Sean and annoying Icelandic guide Hannah some unknown Icelandic actress making her unconvincing debut encounter all manner of 3D perils and wonders including carnivorous plants troublesome fish massive great geyser thingies and the impending doom threatened by an up and coming volcanic thermal heating up whereby everything gets roasted...oh and a dinosaur...he's cool D.The good stuff? The storyline is a lot more cut to the chase than I've made it sound the 3D effects are cracking and despite being landed with the name 'Trevor' Brendan Fraser makes for a great lead. I've always been a casual fan of his since seeing the Mummy as a child and whilst this role isn't much of a challenge for the erstwhile Fraser he commands the screen when he's present and is thoroughly entertaining throughout. The kid who plays Sean is decent support as well. There are some truly great visuals and although the mine cart chase disappoints the raft ride does not it's a visual feast and a great action piece that would be perfect if not for the 'we're on a fishing trip' line thrown in by Hutcherson.The bad stuff? Hannah Asgeirsson is cringeworthy as the love interest guide figure a character it is impossible to like or even find interesting. The storyline is pretty predictable and in terms of story and set pieces 'Journey' doesn't really offer anything that hasn't been done before and often better. A couple of the jokes fall flat and the 3D glasses are pretty annoying although probably not nearly as bad as the film would be in 2D I can only assume it loses much of its merit.So 'Journey' is never going to compete with previous genre flicks such as Jurassic Park but it never really sets out to which is the salvation of the film everything is done with a casual wink to the audience we're all in on the joke that the film is a bit naff. Whilst you're in the cinema it's great fun but on reflection 'Journey' is little more than a memory jog of better films. Go for the 3D cinema experience but don't bother with the DVD because the more you watch this it's probably going to become more and more tired.Ultimately Journey to the centre of the earth is a solid family film that thankfully never tries to be anything more. Good summer fun and the finest effects you'll see this summer.".

Things like the cart chase are obviously just thrown in to show off the 3D also a rip off of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom same with the yo yo plus other things and the whole movie is just one big gimmick without any substance whatsoever. the T Rex looked good in some shots bad in others along with the underground rocks scenery etc.This should never have been just a kids movie considering it's based on a classic book it's not even a good kids movie and I bet it would have made a lot more money gained much much more respect and had lasting appeal if it had been made like Peter Jacksons brilliant version of King Kong. As it is it might well just be throwaway garbage that won't have lasting appeal. This could have been a real classic of the cinema if they had followed Verne's story a lot more closely had it in the same time period as the book and used Vernes characters and I'm suspicious and question any professional criticreviewer who says this is good. Both Michael D. Weiss and Jennifer Flackett should be ashamed of themselves for writing such garbage along with the rest of the film makers especially as they've pinched the title from a great book.So to sum up......another in the long list of Americanised abominations of great books by Hollywood another recent one like i've already mentioned was Spielbergs War of the Worlds which was a complete travesty of Hg Wells masterpiece book. If you're brain dead or a 3 year old child then you might just enjoy this but to think they've cashed in on Jules Verne's title and then ignored everything he wrote is an absolute disgrace.".

The rollercoaster ride in the mine is probably the high point of 3D effects if you can see it in that dimension but it's equally thrilling on a big flat screen TV.The only real asset the film has aside from a script that is full of some good byplay between Fraser and Hutcherson is the fact that the center of the film is Brendan Fraser who has lost none of his appeal as an action hero.

Where of course peril and wonderment await in equal measure. As adventure films go it's entertaining stuff as the intrepid trio run dive jump and fight their way through the hazards of a hot land that's getting hotter by the hour. The kicker in the story here is that they are saying Verne's novel is true giving birth to a collective of people known as Vernians who believe this to be so. Therefore for plot drive the book is used as a sort of tourist guide to aid them in their attempts to escape from the Centre of the Earth. Cool or what? The production design is excellent marking the film out as being very visually appealing while a number of the set pieces are genuinely entertaining and suspenseful. It moves along at a good clip too and the three actors carrying the film engage firmly on the good side of good especially Fraser who can do the heroic kooky act with ease.It's far from being a truly great film but the makers have at least tried to put their own stamp on the story making it a sort of modern day sequel to the wonderful novel. But even with that in mind narratively speaking it's very predictable for the most part but speeding along as a family friendly adventure the film never once outstays its welcome. Of worth as well is that Briem's character Hannah sgeirsson is not a token female put in simply to look hot and give Fraser the push to prove his masculinity. sgeirsson is tough intelligent and resourceful working on a par with Fraser's Professor Anderson this also sets up a running joke involving the two of them as to who saves each others lives the most times! In 2D some of the impact of certain scenes is invariably lost though we can easily imagine what the 3D sight of Fraser unleashing a mouthful of toothpaste and water on us is like! But as it is it's a film that is unlikely to garner much love from scifi buffs and haters of popcorn pleasures but kids will love it as will the adults who don't mind letting their guard down once in a while for a bit of good clean family friendly fun. 610".

Then film rolls on with out any sensible plot and with number and boring dialogues and even absurd geological ideas. Still it's a Hollywod production but even a small children know that boiling water must burns and so does lava. Any physical reasonable laws are awfully denied by scenes and then you start to think that whole story does not make any sense at all. Film refers to Indiana Jones and perhaps some other great adventure movies done in 80s but it only copies it badly with some lame blue screen effects. In addition you watch an unexpected love affection plot with poorly dialogues and acting. Perhaps only good thing about that film is a few CGI scenes but that is just a narrow part of a film.This film for sure will entertain children between age of 59 but no one else. Please save you precious time and use it watch Indiana Jones series again instead of this one.".

And it's not a planned expedition from the Icelandic volcano into the earth's bowels the travelers sort of stumble into things.Brendan Fraser is a scientist who's brother went missing eleven years ago searching for the fabled land underneath that Verne talks about in his novel. He and Anita Briem's father were Vernists apparently folks out there who believe that what Verne wrote about has some basis in fact. At the same time he's contemplating a trip to Iceland his sisterinlaw dumps his late brother's kid on him who's all of thirteen. Josh Holloway brings his father's copy of the Verne novel with all kinds of notations which lead them to Briem who just happens to be a guide and who takes them up the side of the volcano Verne wrote about.But as I said the three of them sort of stumble into the path to the center of the earth and then the next hour or so is like an Indiana Jones film with some Jurassic Park tossed in. Best scene is one where Holloway gets separated from the others and in eluding a very large TRex gets some TRex drool on his person.A lot of what was in the first film is here though not necessarily in that order. One piece of silliness from the first film was the pet goose that the Mason expedition carried along and the nasty end it met is eliminated. The notion that the Verne novels were not speculative fiction but actual fact is an interesting one. But try and apply that to 20000 Leagues Under The Sea or From the Earth to the Moon and you might run into trouble.The special effects are nice but I'd hate to say it this one is a good film but strictly for the kiddie trade.".

The story started out very well in the first few minutes but later it becomes too obvious with some dumb and silly moments throughout the film. The character depth was lacking at times and the ending felt pretty rushed. The fourth flaw that is even worst is it's clichd script.With those flaws aside everything turned out great. The scenery is very imaginative the costume designs are perfect and the music from Andrew Lockington is excellent. The acting is pretty decent. Nothing great but nothing awful. Brendan Fraser did excellent as the leading role Josh Hutcherson did very good as his nephew and Anita Briem did great as the scientist. The dialog is OK but nothing special but the strongest aspect is the visuals for it's sheer excellence in detailing the look of what it's like in the center of the earth.

	schema:reviewBody "RealD 3D is coming and this film is the first live action movie that showcases the technology. Many more such films are on their way fortunately.This film is really great for young children. They were the ones in the audience that were having the most fun gasping out loud at the 3D effects and clapping after the show was over.For everyone else though it has some problems. The 3D special effects and underground set designs are great but the story and characters are aimed at kids not the parents and their kids just the kids.The story is basically about a professor that goes searching for his missing brother at a volcanic site in Iceland. Accompanied by a female mountain guide and his young nephew they accidentally become entrapped in a cave. When they start looking for a way out they end up falling deep under the ground and discover an underground realm ... and the story progresses from there.As reasonably straightforward as the story sounds there is no way to describe how full of plot holes and unrealistic depictions of reality are present. These are a problem in almost every scene. Perhaps the most memorable one is when the young nephew gets a cell phone call from his mom while he is at the center of the Earth. That's really great cell service sign me up.While Brenden Frasier can be fun to watch his character here is just not interesting. He's more a kid's version of an adult than a real one. In fact the best acting seems to come from the kid Josh Hutcherson. However his character is about as predictable and clichd as the other two. If you're a young kid in the audience this doesn't matter.The only thing this movie has going for it comes from the production end. Many of the special effects are like a ride at Disneyland. The very effective use of 3D in lots of fun scenes is terrific  the rollercoasterlike mining cars scene the hovering magnetic rock scene and more were all great. Also the beautiful set designs of just about everything in the underground world was fantastic to look at.So if you you're a very young child you have it made  this is like a ride at Disneyland. For everyone else ... it really is like Disneyland. Expect to get on the Dumbo ride if you don't think too hard it can be a little fun.".

And seriously the 3D is the ONLY REASON to go. Although I was rather shocked to find that the theater I went to had bumped up the ticket price to see the film in 3D Why? I was astounded to see such a sharp clear picture with real depth. Not all of the inyourface effects worked but I did find myself ducking once early on but it was MILES away from JAWS 3D and the like from the last 3D renaissance in the 80s.The movie itself was lame and I can't imagine anyone bothering to see it in 2D...and enjoying it. Utterly dumbeddown for kids I'm thinking this was aimed at the Spy Kids 3D  Shark Boy  Lava Girl crowd...I SAW Spy Kids 3D and barely survived the crap... As much as I love 3D I could not bear the thought of another Spy Kids experience so I PASSED on the Shark Boy thing... it had the look and feel of one of those Amusement Park simulator rides like the old Back To the Future ride at Universal Studios...with a stretched out running time.It takes an amazingly long time at least it seemed like it for the adventure to even begin. When it does start one highly implausible event after another ensuesand I'm sorry I just can not suspend my disbelief THAT much.But for what it was mindless 3D entertainment it sufficed. It's sole saving grace was the 3D. I'm looking forward to the glut of 3D movies in the coming year. I just hope they are better than Journey To The Center of the Earth".

And seriously the 3D is the ONLY REASON to go. Although I was rather shocked to find that the theater I went to had bumped up the ticket price to see the film in 3D Why? I was astounded to see such a sharp clear picture with real depth. Not all of the inyourface effects worked but I did find myself ducking once early on but it was MILES away from JAWS 3D and the like from the last 3D renaissance in the 80s.The movie itself was lame and I can't imagine anyone bothering to see it in 2D...and enjoying it. Utterly dumbeddown for kids I'm thinking this was aimed at the Spy Kids 3D  Shark Boy  Lava Girl crowd...I SAW Spy Kids 3D and barely survived the crap... As much as I love 3D I could not bear the thought of another Spy Kids experience so I PASSED on the Shark Boy thing... it had the look and feel of one of those Amusement Park simulator rides like the old Back To the Future ride at Universal Studios...with a stretched out running time.It takes an amazingly long time at least it seemed like it for the adventure to even begin. When it does start one highly implausible event after another ensuesand I'm sorry I just can not suspend my disbelief THAT much.But for what it was mindless 3D entertainment it sufficed. It's sole saving grace was the 3D. I'm looking forward to the glut of 3D movies in the coming year. I just hope they are better than Journey To The Center of the Earth";

We met Jerry Newport at ASA 2 years ago my son Josh aged 11 has Asperger's Syndrome and wanted so much to see the story of him and Mary. As an aside I wish you could have heard the conversation between Jerry and Michael John Carley on the various Beethoven movements...it was the most amazing impromptu music theory talk I have ever heard.At any rate Mozart and the Whale was in limited release and so we waited for the DVD to be out. Finally it is!! And we watched it last night. We were not disappointed. It was wonderful. There was so much truth in it. We saw the range of autism in the group that Donald formed. Then there was the quirkiness of the various people. But it showed the love and caring that can form among any person no matter what the diagnosis. We loved Izzy's laugh...that HA! We know kids with Asperger's who can't modulate their sounds and sound way loud in their approach to life.I also loved the sequences about his living style. This is so much like my son....the stacks of stuff...the collections....the freaking out when his stuff is moved around....this is all real folks. And it is portrayed with a sensitivity and humor that can't help but to make you smile andor laugh....not at Donald and Izzy but with the cherishing of the moments that parents feel when they experience the familiarity of the moments.But to me the big question was what would Josh my son think of how Asperger's was depicted. Now remember he met Jerry and really thinks he is COOL. Josh said see mom that means that I can meet someone and get married too so don't worry anymore. This movie gives me hope that a life of independence and companionship is possible for Josh.Yes we adore Jerry Newport. He knows a lot...he shares some of it with us in this film. Do yourself a favor...get this DVD and let's hope that Sundance will show the world that Mozart and the Whale is a film that needs to be shown.".

It is beautiful and has multiple meanings.Only thing is it may portray people with Aspergers as being out of control nuts or retards which is not the way they really are.

The part of Donald Morton was't too bad as his overall presentation facial expressions eye contact high anxiety etc seemed close to realistic. Isabelle was just not real to me. The look in her eyes was that of a neurotypical person with a wide range of emotions revealed in them. She had some scenes wherein she behaved similar to someone with Asperger's or Autism but without her overall behavior being accurate it was a let down. She is a good actress but she needed to do more homework for this role.The support group scenes were some of the most disappointing of the movie. There are many highly functional individuals who attend AS support groups in the real world however even the most functional do not exhibit the type of empathy that this group did. Trust me real Aspies would have had little to no interest in the love life of these two group members. It is not believable to me that Donald could have formed this group. Perhaps the real Jerry Newport could have. Donald does not demonstrate enough leadership or functional independence and his anxiety is debilitating. There are Aspies who have leadership qualities but they are usually very rigid and opinionated thinkers who also have a type of personality that other people with Asperger's Syndrome who are less out spoken gather around. That level of rigidconcrete thinking is just not depicted in this movie nor is the reality of the tempers that often go along with it.I wish there was more focus on the useful and functional aspects of Asperger's Syndrome. Why didn't they show us more of what Donald did in his work? How were his mathematical abilities benefiting him in the real world? Isabelle was gifted in music and art. Reveal more of her passion for this. Let people see more of an inside view of Autism rather just playing around with the quirkiness in ways that were sometimes irreverent.I now fear that thousands or perhaps millions more people know even less about Autism and Asperger's Syndrome than they did before! Yes I have read the glowing reviews and I am extremely disappointed in them. I have lived around Autism from every possible perspective that you can imagine. Trust me what you will see in this movie is Hollywood and not the real world.".

Radha Mitchell manages to nighflawlessly convey the sheer frustration I feel daily. Sheila Kelley's performance though a small part of the picture went far in making the support group scenes believable and John Carroll Lynch's lostbutdenyingit performance made a fabulous foil for Hartnett.As for plot I'm a bit of a sucker for a romance anyway so I can't help but have enjoyed this. Seeing these two characters try so hard to work around their autism to connect at some level was occasionally hard to watch. Every mistake they made set me at the edge of my seat and when Isabelle's psychiatrist asks Donald to never contact her again I shouted No! at the screen. And when they finally let the audience know that after all that supreme effort they do manage to make that connection the relief and joy was undeniable.Why this movie is having a hard time getting released I do not know.".

I've read some comments debating the authenticity of the characters and how they portray AS and autistic individuals but the only comments that have mattered to me were those of Jerry Newport whose story this movie was inspired by.

Instead it seems to be showing us a portrait of people with uncontrolled aspects of the disorder so grossly exaggerated to the point that these people look like a bunch of freaks rather than people trying to live with their disorder. That's too bad because this movie really had an opportunity to reach a lot of people.I know Aperger's Syndrome because I have it. Yes there are some characteristics of the disorder that need to be recognized and toned down. Some of them can be irritating and a turnoff to people. Sometimes the tendencies are unusual intense interest in certain topics not recognizing when to leave things alone failing to read body language taking things too literally and not noticing things or subjects that people aren't interested in. Okay. Not everyone with it is a person who irritates the heck out of people without Asperger's. I wonder how many of us socalled aspies will find this movie to be insulting or even infuriating.None of the support group scenes in this story work. There is very little discussion about the problems and social difficulties that people with Asperger's have. No talk about behavior modification or improving the lives of the people involved. It looks more like a hangout for social rejects rather than a support group. For crying out loud why wouldn't anyone with Asperger's be insulted by a movie like this? The love story is never really developed but simply rushed into. We see a physical attraction between these two characters but no chemistry. There is no real dialog about anything except their disorder and nothing to convince us that their attraction is any more than physical. Frankly Josh Hartnett and Radha Mitchell give these two characters better performances than they really deserve. Ron Bass did a wonderful job of writing the screenplay Rain Man. Did he realize that people with Asperger's are much higher functioning? It didn't seem that way in this movie. So two people with an impediment can fall in love so what?".

He's landed some good performances in his earliest roles The Virgin Suicides O but once the teenagers adopted him as the next big celebrity crush he got swallowed in the hype that led to Pearl Harbor. This destroyed any credibility he might have as an actor and he has spent the rest of the decade trying to prove himself as a serious actor and to get rid of the hearth throb image.He completely succeeds in this goal with Mozart and the Whale. He plays Donald a young man with Asperger's syndrome so well you forget it's him. The performance is rough unpolished and honest and while it might not be technically perfect it's evident Hartnett was very inspired and motivated. It is a very good performance and anybody who doubts his acting abilities should watch this film before making a judgment. The only problem is not many people saw this film. And it is a shame.Radha Mitchell plays Isabelle a young woman with Asperger's and the film follows the two protagonists fall in love. Mitchell is also good in her role but is less sympathetic that is until you realize what it seems like annoying shallow girl is actually the display of her Asperger's syndrome.The film itself however is full of the problems. It tries to be a romantic comedy about an unusual couple but it doesn't work that way. Rumor says something went wrong in the production and due to some executive meddling the film failed to be a drama it was meant to be. Allegedly this made Josh Hartnett mad and he chose not to promote the film which is a shame because it's probably his best performance to date.Sometimes it feels like a genuine story about people with Asperger's meeting falling in love and having a relationship it is based on true people and events but at the moments it is reduced to the common denominator. You simply can't do that with a theme like this this one doesn't work as a romantic comedy with quirky protagonists. It also feels like good 30 minutes of it is missing it's rushed especially in the last third.Still even simplified and Hollywoodised this film is a good watch. But it's mainly because of the main cast particularly Hartnett. He finds his voice like never before and manages to make us believe he's an individual with Asperger's living his life falling in love and trying to resolve everyday problems.At the end the film is disappointing but the best scenes deserve to be watched over and over again. Essentially this film is a missed potential with some great acting.".

Portraying this type of mental illness on screen is particularly challenging since it requires some distancing from the actors trying hard to stay true to the often alienating medical condition.Written by Ron Bass who wrote the similarly themed Rain Man back in 1988 and directed by Norwegian filmmaker Petter Nss this simple film focuses on the burgeoning love story between Donald and Isabelle two young attractive people afflicted with Asperger's syndrome. Donald runs a selfhelp group afflicted with autism and Isabelle joins the group upon the insistence of her therapist. The bulk of the film deals with their often frustrating attempts to communicate and work toward a more permanent relationship while at the same time supporting the needs of the group to curb their affectations and live satisfying lives. If this sounds like the classic trappings of a Lifetime TVmovie it pretty much reflects that oeuvre with its video camera quality and barebones production values. In fact except for the clever Halloween setup which explains the film's title the plot turns have a fairly predictable flavor and Nss displays little flair in making the emotional impact more resonant.Fortunately the leads do well by their difficult roles especially when each displays their savant wizardry Donald's mathematical skills and Isabelle's concurrent artistic and musical gifts. At first Radha Mitchell seems to be playing a variation of the darker half of Melinda and Melinda as Isabelle but she ultimately manages to convey the troubling soul beneath the faade of her flashy bohemian. As the helplessly reticent Donald Josh Hartnett is surprisingly affecting most of the time though there are moments when he gets burdened by his character's mannered passivity. Several familiar faces show up in the supporting cast including Sheila Kelley and a belligerent John Carroll Lynch as two of the group members and Gary Cole as Donald's patient boss. All do good work but the movie has such a shapeless haphazard feel that the inevitable ending feels rushed and truncated. The only significant extra of the 2006 DVD is Bass' thoughtful if overly effusive commentary track.".

	schema:reviewBody "About sixteen months ago after suffering literally decades of the kind of abuse that if conducted against a normie would see criminal charges filed I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. I pronounce it AspURGEer because the manner in this film is insulting and while neither is actually correct any Aspie with an appreciation for the images sounds invoke when spoken aloud will back me up on how the other way reads. But that is one of the lesser evils in this insulting film. I was asked a few months ago if I had seen it after spending a lot of time on boards presenting the case that autism is not the crippling doomsday scenario depicted in the past. I forget who it was that asked but I have to tell them this film has nothing in common with the reality of Asperger's Syndrome. The 2000 production of XMen and its first sequel have more in common with the reality of Asperger's Syndrome. Take that as ye will. It strikes me as very ironic that in today's equalityobsessed world we are forbidden from creating negative stereotypes of the black the Jewish the Chinese or the Maori but it's perfectly okay to create a strawman of the Aspie that has about as much basis in reality as an episode of The XFiles.Note that this comment will have much less of the structural flow than my usual because not since a certain episode of Law  Order Normies On Parade has a piece of visual entertainment enraged me so. They say that film and television echoes the attitude of the society it is made in and if that is true then America has not progressed one inch beyond the 1950s. Josh Hartnett portrays an Aspie that resembles nobody I have ever heard of in spite of the transparently false claim that this film is based on actual events. Here no Aspie is capable of completing a job maintaining their own household or carrying a conversation despite the fact that history is replete with Aspies that are responsible for many of the things we take for granted. Every time you use a device with a microprocessor in it thank an Aspie. I doubt that Einstein or Gates would consider this film terribly accurate either.I gave this film the most dreaded rating in my scaling system a two out of ten because it is right in the middle of no man's land. It is not good enough to be entertaining and it is not bad enough to be good. In the five hundred or so films I have seen this year it holds pride of place as being the first to make me feel as physically ill to watch it as does any iteration of Law  Order. Judging from reviews on Variety.com and such it also means that there will now be less socially relevant and factual films about characters with Asperger's Syndrome because the unknowing morons in the Hollywood system are convincing the world that Ronald Bass and Petter Nss made one. So a big thank you to them for making my life that little bit more difficult like I really needed that. Thank you very much.Oh and I have a question for the three people who decided my comment was unhelpful probably because of wounded egos over this film. Now that a Texan university has created a prenatal test which will be used in a war of prevention against me and my kind what do you have to say to those who feel Asperger's Syndrome and romantic comedy do not go together?".

	schema:reviewBody "As a person who has Aspergers I can say that this movie is one of the more positive films about Autism that I have seen. It shows that people with Aspergers are able to be in relationships hold down jobs drive cars etc. It is a huge step up since Rainman which was the movie that introduced Autism to the public. As an Aspie I could relate to a lot of the things that the characters were going through. But the film was ultimately flawed in the end. First off the symthoms of Aspergers syndrome are not that obvious and there are no visual indicators that the person has this disorder. That was not the case in the movie. The characters seemed neurotic and more High functioning Autsic then Aspergers. You can live with someone with Aspergers for 20 years and not know that any thing is wrong with the person. Second a lot of things were overdramatized. For instance in the scene where Donald and Isabelle are at the fair and Isabelle reacts to a disturbing noise she over does the reaction. In real life the most that can happen when a person with AS is exposed to a noise that they don't like is that it hurts their ears and they have to leave the room. We don't have full blown melt downs like she did in the film. Also people with Aspergers don't shout things in the middle of restaurants or act rudely towards people like Isabelle did when she and Donald went out for a date. I guess that I should have expected these problems when I went to see the movie because it is written by Ron Bass the same guy who wrote Rainman. I wish the people who had written the screenplay and made the film had actually taken the time to read about AS instead of using every stereotypical Autisc thing in the book when they made the film. But in the end it is an improvement from Rainman. I recommend reading the Mozart and the Whale book as an alternative.".

	schema:reviewBody "We are told this is a fictional story inspired by real people and real events. Asperger's autism is the diagnosis. Many with this affliction can get along just fine in the world hold down jobs even be an example to others but certain characteristics make it hard for them to function normally around others and especially enter into positive love relationships.Josh Hartnett is Donald Morton and in the opening minutes we find out 1 he is perhaps on his last cab gig having lost all the others and 2 he assembles and facilitates a group of others with social disorders and helps them cope.

I was initially put off the idea of the movie as i am a big fan of the graphic novel and there was an awful lot of hype around this film on its release. this proved to be my loss as i have only seen the film on the small screen. however i now have the 2 disc special edition DVD and watched it 3 times in succession the day i bought it and must have watched it at least 100 times since. my own personal opinion is that a movie should suspend disbelief capture the imagination which this does in spades. it is truly a film that you can lose a couple of hours watching and at the end feel like you have spent a worthwhile couple of hours. would recommend this to anybody.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Crow is an excellent tragic film made even more tragic by the real life tragedies surrounding the film Brandon Lee's death during filming and the fact that the story is a result of James O'Barr's personal loss of his fiance. Based on a very dark comic book the film has the same dark feel. The movie does deviate from the comic book in some points but in general is fairly faithful. If you can get it I would recommend the DVD Collector's set with the 2 DVD version of The Crow just to see the interview with James O'Barr is worth the price.The story is a basically about revenge from beyond the grave and how true love is forever. The movie has a good but fairly basic plot excellent action sequences and very good casting. Brandon Lee gives a good performance not excellent but good as does Ernie Hudson. The supporting villains are excellent in their villainy and you do feel better when they get it in the end. But the real star of this film is the mood and the feel. It feels gritty bleak and depressing but surprisingly uplifting at the end. Alex Proyas did an excellent job of transferring this feeling from the book onto celluloid. All in all one of the best comic book to film translations I have ever seen.You do not have to be familiar with the comic book to thoroughly enjoy this film like you do with some other comic book adaptations.Rating  4.5 out of 5".

	schema:headline " Melancholically beautiful comic book fantasy";
	schema:reviewBody "Comic book movies have always fascinated me. I don't whether it's their visual style the special effects the performances of the actors as compared to the comic itself or the interpretation of the graphic novel's storyline by the filmmakers that interests me the most but I've always been enthralled by a bleak story that places a tragic hero in the midst of a towering city whose choices and actions determine the fate of himself and those around him. Often a comic book can provide the bare essentials for an excellent story but more often the filmmakers or producers scrap the idea of a storyline and aim primarily for the explotation of special effects. In the case of The Crow this is not true this is the only film that has ever captured the true essence of the comic book it's based on expanded upon its virtues and added its own style to complement the base storyline of the film.On October 30th a night that has come to be known as Devil's Night in reference to the hundreds of fires set by dangerous gangs Eric Draven Brandon Lee and Shelly Webster Sofia Shinas are brutally attacked in their downtown apartment. Shelly is raped by the gang and Eric is thrown out of a fivestory window dying almost instantly. They leave behind a close friend and youngersister figure Sarah Rochelle Davis endless rainy nights in the city and infinite sorrow on those who knew them.Their deaths left a score unsettled and as a result an ancient legend becomes reality as a mystical crow descends from the Heavens who normally carries souls to the land of the dead brings Eric Draven's soul back to life so he can exact revenge on the men who killed him and his fiance. He dresses himself in torn black clothing boots and paints his face like a sad clown. He is invincible for he is already dead and sets out on a quest for retribution seeking out each one of his murderers one by one. He is helped along the way by two people Sarah and Officer Albrecht Ernie Hudson who stayed with Shelly until she died against an army of arsonist gangsters led by the mysteriously incestuous Top Dollar Michael Wincott who is the orchestrator of Devil's Night and inspires his troops with quotes and dialogue from Dante's Inferno and Paradise Lost. With the crow leading the way Eric Draven sets out to redeem his soul and regain his justice in a city that has never stopped raining since his death.From its opening shot right to its final seconds The Crow is a depressingly gripping film. A truly fantastic and faithful adaptation of James O'Barr's comic book series this film draws its inspiration from both the comic book and earlier films such as Fritz Lang's Metropolis. The story is set against the backdrop of a broken city ruled by an underground society of arsonists where the police can do nothing to stop them and the children run wild in the streets. The buildings tower high over the urban streets overlooking a sad foundation without law justice or order  you know everything about this world with one shot. The production design and cinematography combines to create an atmosphere in a society without hope accentuated only further by a MiddleEast inspired score by Graeme Revell and choicy tunes by Nine Inch Nails The Cure Stone Temple Pilots and My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult.Director Alex Proyas claims he has never seen a sequel to his film on the basis that no one could do justice to the main character like Brandon Lee... I agree with him. Lee's performance as the vengeful soul is one of the greatest I have ever seen on film. He exhibits confidence cunning and menace while at the same time communicating just enough pain and depression to stay true to his character. You know what he's capable of and at the same time his emotional weaknesses. If I can think of any flaw to this film I would mention the incestuous relationship between Funboy and his sister. It was not a subplot thankfully but it didn't seem necessary in a film that was already disturbing enough.Made with passion performed with intensity designed with precision and influence The Crow is an unheralded masterpiece of the 20th Century. It is heartbreaking to think that this film almost dodged release  if that had happened no one would ever have known the degree of Brandon Lee's acting capabilities. The man had a fiery presence and was articulate and powerful with his delivery  indeed with one great film he has become a martyr for the exposition of this character. 4 12 stars on a five star scale.".

	onyx:emotionText "Comic book movies have always fascinated me. I don't whether it's their visual style the special effects the performances of the actors as compared to the comic itself or the interpretation of the graphic novel's storyline by the filmmakers that interests me the most but I've always been enthralled by a bleak story that places a tragic hero in the midst of a towering city whose choices and actions determine the fate of himself and those around him. Often a comic book can provide the bare essentials for an excellent story but more often the filmmakers or producers scrap the idea of a storyline and aim primarily for the explotation of special effects. In the case of The Crow this is not true this is the only film that has ever captured the true essence of the comic book it's based on expanded upon its virtues and added its own style to complement the base storyline of the film.On October 30th a night that has come to be known as Devil's Night in reference to the hundreds of fires set by dangerous gangs Eric Draven Brandon Lee and Shelly Webster Sofia Shinas are brutally attacked in their downtown apartment. Shelly is raped by the gang and Eric is thrown out of a fivestory window dying almost instantly. They leave behind a close friend and youngersister figure Sarah Rochelle Davis endless rainy nights in the city and infinite sorrow on those who knew them.Their deaths left a score unsettled and as a result an ancient legend becomes reality as a mystical crow descends from the Heavens who normally carries souls to the land of the dead brings Eric Draven's soul back to life so he can exact revenge on the men who killed him and his fiance. He dresses himself in torn black clothing boots and paints his face like a sad clown. He is invincible for he is already dead and sets out on a quest for retribution seeking out each one of his murderers one by one. He is helped along the way by two people Sarah and Officer Albrecht Ernie Hudson who stayed with Shelly until she died against an army of arsonist gangsters led by the mysteriously incestuous Top Dollar Michael Wincott who is the orchestrator of Devil's Night and inspires his troops with quotes and dialogue from Dante's Inferno and Paradise Lost.

Stone Temple Pilots Nine Inch Nailson the soundtrack had a certain mood to their music that fit the movie's aura. As for the score Graeme Revell put together perhaps one of the best scores of the 1990's. With his combination of modern musical instruments and foreign instruments and his tasteful and original use of synthesizers he will always be one of the most talented composers. The plot of this film is so universal. it can be used on so many other levels or in so many other stories.

The plot plays out exactly as you would expect for a nineties revenge flik except rather than Harry Tasker kicking ass and taking names we observe Edward Scissorhands on drugs slaughtering all opposition. Its a good laugh if you want a harmless revenge film with little more than the necessary amount of substance than the dry script requires or you may enjoy it if you are aged between 1217 and haven't found your niche in life yet. Rest assured teens The Crow will answer none of your questions but will only fill you with new ones such as Wouldn't it have been nice if poor Eric Draven had only stayed dead?".

	schema:reviewBody "I've read through through some of these reviews and I'm sorry but I have to disagree with quite a lot of them. I think the film is amazing intelligent and emotive and does justice to Toni Morrison's incredible novel one of the best I have ever read. However I can understand why some people are confused I think the film is easier to grasp if you read the book. To clarify some of the confusion  Sethe Oprah intends to kill her children before taking her own life to protect them all from the suffering that awaits them at Sweet Home the plantation. However she only succeeds in killing her baby daughter Beloved before she is caught.

	onyx:emotionText "I've read through through some of these reviews and I'm sorry but I have to disagree with quite a lot of them. I think the film is amazing intelligent and emotive and does justice to Toni Morrison's incredible novel one of the best I have ever read. However I can understand why some people are confused I think the film is easier to grasp if you read the book. To clarify some of the confusion  Sethe Oprah intends to kill her children before taking her own life to protect them all from the suffering that awaits them at Sweet Home the plantation. However she only succeeds in killing her baby daughter Beloved before she is caught.  Sethe is imprisoned for killing her daughter but is later released due to the efforts of abolitionists including Baby Sugg's landlord.  Beloved dies as a young infant and despite the fact that she returns in the body of a young woman the age she would have been had she lived she retains the emotional and social maturity of a baby hence the freaky baby wailing noises that Thandie Newton makes.

She once said in an interview that she wrote the book to be disorienting in some ways to reenact the feeling of the slave diaspora.I thought the book heartwrenching at times gutwrenching and vivid. The character of Paul D never made much sense seeming like a man waiting for something to happen but Sethe burned off the page.  What I remember most is Baby Suggs' speech at the rock which the film has divided into three segments.I projected Beloved for the college theater and I have to say it was long and arduous especially if you haven't read the novel.  There is no SENSE to the PAIN that goes on with these characters in Braveheart and Titanic we have a certain tragic pleasure in mass death or torture that we can't receive from Beloved.  I read a lot of comments talking about the ghost in Beloved but the ghost is more of a catalyst for looking into the characters than the star of the film.I admired the time put in most.  It just seemed like Demme and Tak Fujimoto and the lighting designer as well gave the actors the time they needed to act and sink into things unlike traditional MTVediting some scenes were comprised of only one shot usually tracking as Paul D and Sethe in the cornfield. The score was brilliant Portman really found a grace in stillness and the trembling African voice and the flute.  It was bare but riveting at the same time.People have said that the film went for too much shock value.  That's possible did we need the closeup of the dead child at the breast?  No. But then again when we read it in the book don't we think of it?  Don't we for a split second see that image in our heads?  I for one thought of much more graphic things when Morrison discussed Paul D and Beloved's night in the shed.  The camera and the actors treat the world of Beloved and the audience with respect.  Winfrey does seem more like someone who loves Sethe's character than Sethe herself but she did it for me.  The sadness the strength emptiness she did it and Lisa Gay Hamilton as the young Sethe was riveting with her time in the film.  The look in her eyes when Schoolteacher says Animal is amazing.Danny Glover always does a good job but he didn't really amaze me.  For me you know what you're getting with Glover nice guy troubled soul easygoing with fits of rage every now and then.  It's what he likes to play and he does it well here but no surprises.  The surprises are Winfrey and Kimberly Elise especially in those crucial minutes when she decides to leave home the fear and determination on her face.  She somehow becomes more sexual by the end of the film when she sees Paul D.  Thandie Newton is incredibly freaky and disgusting as Beloved with the exception of that ONE long gaze she gives Danny Glover that night seduction perfect symmetry. And Beah Richards as Baby Suggs I wanted her to be my mother.  She broke my heart with her religion This is the prize.  This is the prize.  The preaching scenes are INCREDIBLE in this film especially since Tak Fujimoto chooses a circular tracking shot that allows them to do it all at once.There isn't much redemption at the end.  Sethe is drained and miserable. Paul D is on his own but still not totally free. I think Roger Ebert's comment put it best the happy ending of Beloved is that the ordeal is OVER. There is no sense to the pain but one hopes at the end that there can be healing.I loved this film.  I loved the fact that it's not hammering any one message home but you can take things about motherhood race brutality the dangers of love and commitment freedom and chains out with you it's all there.  And it is as beautiful as it is wrenching.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I logged onto IMDb and came to the Beloved page after finishing watching the film I was extremely surprised at the average 5.4 user rating that this film had. 5.4 are you kidding me? I went in seeing this film without ever reading or having any knowledge of the awardwinning novel that the film is apparently very tightly based upon. Even without that this film was amazing. The movie begins with a woman named Sethe Oprah Winfrey a former slave living in 1800s Cincinatti where an unseen presence is tearing apart her house throwing things against the walls and injuring her dog. Her two sons ultimately run away terrified of the house and her youngest daughter Denver is forced to stay. Cut to eight years later a friend of Sethe's Paul D. Danny Glover reenters her life and moves in with Sethe. We got a ghost here Denver tells him and Paul D. mentions feeling an evil presence in her house but Sethe tells him it's only sadness. Then later on a mysterious young woman who calls herself Beloved is found standing in the front yard of the house. She can barely speak can't move and is almost like an infant in the body of a teenager. But who is she where did she come from and why is she there? Sethe's dark past holds the secret to Beloved's identity which is revealed later on in the film.Beloved isn't a horror film and I wasn't expecting one either. Granted there are a few disturbing scenes and a handful of rather scary moments but this film is a drama more than anything and really focuses more on it's characters. The story itself is an interesting one at that and after seeing this I'm tempted to go read the novel which I hear the film is adapted to very closely. Everything in the film seems to be put together very nicely and unlike many people who claim to not be able to follow the story I followed it very easily. There are some harsh themes that are a consistent part of the plot mainly Sethe's horrible past as an abused slave and there are some scenes that are truly hard to watch. While the supernatural element is a main theme in the movie this isn't your average ghost story. It's not horrific or inyourface it's a much lighter and touching. I don't want to go too indepth into the plot because there are things that I could easily spoil and wouldn't want to  see the film for yourself. Character development is rampant in the film and each of the characters mature in a different way throughout the course of the movie and makes for some very interesting viewing as each of them grow in different ways.Performances are amazing from everyone involved. I'd never seen Oprah Winfrey act I'd just seen her television talkshow a few times but she proves in this film that she can and very well too. Danny Glover also gives a very nice performance but it's overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Thandie Newton plays Beloved and plays it perfectly  her character is mysterious and obscure and she does it well. Kimberly Elise plays Sethe's daughter Denver and plays the character excellently. I can't say anything bad about the acting in any aspects  to sum it up as a whole the acting here is just flatout amazing. Along with the wonderful acting the directing is great also. Academy Award winner Jonathan Demme who also directed the award winning crimesuspense masterpiece The Silence of the Lambs handles the story well and keeps things consistently absorbing and ultimately haunting. Very nice cinematography is present too and there are tons of symbolic images throughout the film that are placed nicely in the mix along with a lot of shots of nature and wildlife.Overall Beloved is an amazing movie and the people who are rating this as a '110' must have not seen very many movies because this film is so far from a '1' that it's not even funny. Don't let the average user rating scare you off from this film because it really deserves much better than that. I guess this is one of those love it or hate it movies but I thought it was an unforgettable movie. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found it difficult to understand the movie and some of the dialogue but it mattered little.  I wish I'd read the bookperhaps I will but I don't think so.  A film must stand by itself or it is not a film.Beloved has long passages of greatness.  First it contains one of the best and most fascinating performances I've seen in years given by Thandie Newton.  She spent most of Gridlock'd in a coma unfortunately and that's the most notable role she's had until this one.  Her first speaking if you'll call it that line is gripping frightening and amusing and she plays a mental defective in a manner which I've never seen before.  She has the loudest rudest character and many actresses would be put off by some of the things she must do throughout the film.  However our attention is also held by her quiet moments as well as a few shots where the camera is content to gaze tranquilly into her beautiful eyes.That camera is conducted with the supreme artistry of one of my favorite photographers Tak Fujimoto who was with director Jonathan Demme since the late '70s.  Fujimoto is in love with earth and flesh tones here but he also shoots his actors' eyes as if they were a part of the human body we'd never really noticed before and wanted to give them the attention they deserved.

Both come from notable directors are based on famous novels used huge budgets and were very long.  Both films disappointed many many people.

	onyx:emotionText "I found it difficult to understand the movie and some of the dialogue but it mattered little.  I wish I'd read the bookperhaps I will but I don't think so.  A film must stand by itself or it is not a film.Beloved has long passages of greatness.  First it contains one of the best and most fascinating performances I've seen in years given by Thandie Newton.  She spent most of Gridlock'd in a coma unfortunately and that's the most notable role she's had until this one.  Her first speaking if you'll call it that line is gripping frightening and amusing and she plays a mental defective in a manner which I've never seen before.  She has the loudest rudest character and many actresses would be put off by some of the things she must do throughout the film.  However our attention is also held by her quiet moments as well as a few shots where the camera is content to gaze tranquilly into her beautiful eyes.That camera is conducted with the supreme artistry of one of my favorite photographers Tak Fujimoto who was with director Jonathan Demme since the late '70s.  Fujimoto is in love with earth and flesh tones here but he also shoots his actors' eyes as if they were a part of the human body we'd never really noticed before and wanted to give them the attention they deserved.

I've never read the book and for fear that it is anything like the movie I never will!! Everyone who obviously didn't see the film praised it and Oprah with promises of Academy awards  I cringed at the very thought. To the Academy's credit they only allowed a nomination to this film for costume design clearly a statement that No they did not forget about Oprah or Beloved. So consider this if you pause in the video and contemplate  how bad could it be...I will never be able to erase the image of a naked pregnant woman standing spreadeagle on a front porch screaming at a group of women not to mention this person is supposed to be Oprah's dead baby back from the grave as a teenager who grunts and can't make a complete sentence but can convince a man to have sex with her while she drools.

Not only is this movie slow boring stupid and a waste of time as one theater goer stated loudly on the way out That is one weird a movie! I've never read the book and for fear that it is anything like the movie I never will!! Everyone who obviously didn't see the film praised it and Oprah with promises of Academy awards  I cringed at the very thought. To the Academy's credit they only allowed a nomination to this film for costume design clearly a statement that No they did not forget about Oprah or Beloved. So consider this if you pause in the video and contemplate  how bad could it be...I will never be able to erase the image of a naked pregnant woman standing spreadeagle on a front porch screaming at a group of women not to mention this person is supposed to be Oprah's dead baby back from the grave as a teenager who grunts and can't make a complete sentence but can convince a man to have sex with her while she drools. Someone save us I think we've reached a new low in films!!";

C'mon who's gonna have the guts to step up to the plate and pan the movie that stars and is produced by the most powerful woman in showbiz?

With some imagination and maybe a couple of tequilas I could still see how that might be true. But the movie has to stand on its own folks! Director Jonathan Demme's excellent Silence of the Lambs sure did. This one however falls flat the plot just wanders along from episode to confusing episode with frequent and annoying use of extended fadeouts.Worse despite all the horrifying things that happen to them the movie's characters don't generate much sympathy. Why? Because while there's a strong sense of inner tumult and lots of Exorciststyle physical turmoil flying tables and glowing red lights  gimme a break!!! there's no sense of any real inner conflict. The characters just react  to the inhumanity of the white slaveowners or to the frequent supernatural outbursts. There's no evidence in their actions that there's anything they've had to weigh or be confused by. The things that have happened to Sethe Oprah are revealed in flashback form so unfortunately there's not much chance for you as viewer to get involved in them  it's stuff that's already happened and you're just being filled in in shorthand form prefab context.Another major problem this thing is WAY too long. The movie meanders for another 45 minutes to an hour after what is clearly the climactic scene and for what??? It just kind of winds down in some very expected ways.".

In other words immediately before young John's groundbreaking success of The Sufferings Of Young Werther. Goethe befriends social dropout Jerusalem struggles with his staunch superior Kestner and eventually falls in love with charming ingnue Charlotte Buff only to lose her to the betterestablished Kestner. Around the same time Jerusalem commits suicide after an unhappy love affair with a married woman. Goethe processes his troublesome experiences by writing his first pageturner.To my mind this movie succeeds in bringing Goethe closer to the modern reader  it only fails on one count utter historical veracity. It's not a documentary folks. Goethe failed his doctorate but possibly not through laziness what exactly Goethe passed his time with in Wetzlar is unclear but he probably didn't work as a legal clerk Kestner was therefore not his superior and Jerusalem didn't shoot himself in front of Goethe. There I said it.Personally I thought two points of the movie were icky I didn't buy that Charlotte and Goethe would have bumped uglies immediately after their first kiss and especially not in the middle of the falling rain and I thought the scene when a despondent Goethe arrives in Frankfurt only to find out that Charlotte secretly had his novel published and that it turned out to be a smash hit bestseller yadda yadda yadda was extremely cheesy.Where the movie excels is to take us into a time that was by modern standards very damp dark and filthy but also wildly romantic.".

Since many years I have three heroes and all three of them have a name starting with G Goethe Gandhi and Gaudi. so I never miss a book or a movie telling their stories but sometimes I miss the movies in the theater as they are not main stream. That was the case with the Goethe movie and I happened to find it in my local library. My first reaction to the movie was not so positive. I felt like these film makers were turning the German geniuses into some kind of crazy persons I especially felt that way with Amadeus and also Beethoven.. And the first scenes of this movie worried me that they were trying to do the same thing to Goethe. There is this entry monologue in Faust when he talks about having studied so much and learned nothing. Ah! Now I've done Philosophy I've finished Law and Medicine And sadly even Theology Taken fierce pains from end to end. Now here I am a fool for sure! No wiser than I was beforeI always saw Goethe as Faust a welleducated but disillusioned man seeking for the meaning of life not a desperate lovesick youngster.. But when the movie continued I started to like it . Eighteenth century Germany is captured quite convincingly the costumes the sets and the landscape are beautiful and the acting persuasive. It transported me into a fantasy trying to imagine how Goethe lived as a young man. I had visited his house in Weimar after the wall fell and some of the places in Italy he favored which helped me to understand him better.. I deeply resent the English translation of the movie title this movie has nothing in common with Shakespeare in love and is much more realistic. I will certainly buy the DVD to add to my collection of favorite movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Playwright poet and author Johann Goethe is one of the most famous German writers. This lavish production is part biopic part colourful historical drama and part romance but it makes for an entertaining and bawdy romp along the same vein as Tom Jones Shakespeare In Love etc. The film mainly concentrates on the youthful Goethe's life before he successfully published his first novel at the age of 22 which made him the toast of Europe. When we first meet Goethe Alexander Fehling he is an aspiring poet. But after several rejections from publishers who feel that his work is uninspiring Goethe follows his disapproving father's advice and heads to the small town of Wetzlar where he gains employment as a law clerk working for the officious Ketsner Moritz Bleibtreu. He shares a room with a fellow law student the boisterous and socially uncouth Wilhelm Volker Bruch. He also falls in love with the beautiful Charlotte Miriam Stein. But Charlotte's father is struggling financially and arranges for Charlotte to marry Kestner. Goethe and Kestner become rivals which eventually leads to Goethe being imprisoned. His misadventures and the doomed romance provides the material for Goethe's first novel The Sorrows Of Young Werther. Fehling who had a small role in Inglorious Basterds brings a rakish charm with energy and charisma to his performance as the irreverent hard drinking 17th century slacker Goethe. Bleibtreu is suitably cold as the rather dull Kestner. Stein is feisty and sassy as Charlotte. Director Phillip Stozl the grueling mountaineering drama North Face etc directs the material with a light touch. He makes great use of locations to enhance the film's atmosphere. The production design is excellent and the film's setting reek of authenticity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe the great German poet and playwright was indeed too young as the story begins. He is a terrible law student in the Frankfurt of the 18th century. Failing to pass the bar exam he makes a bad impression on the panel that are conducting the oral dissertation. His father furious with young Johann decides he must go to another place that will prove not to be as distracting. So young Goethe is dispatched to Wetzlar an unsophisticated spot quite a contrast with the city he left behind.At the law firm where Goethe goes to work he meets another colleague Wilhelm who is a kindred spirit who sees in the new arrival a friend. It is Wilhelm who introduces Johann to the local society. Johann falls hard fro the opinionated Lotte the oldest daughter of an impoverished man. She is the oldest of seven siblings living outside the city. Johann and Wilhelm decide to pay her a visit in which young Goethe falls deeply in love with the charming young woman.Unknown to Johann Lotte's father sees the opportunity when the occasion arises to accept a marriage proposal for his daughter when Johann's superior at the law firm sets his eyes on Lotte. The fact causes the young man such distress that drives him to write his sufferings into a manuscript he dedicates to his beloved Lotte the woman he cannot have. Lotte reading what Johann wrote in his despair decides it is worth publishing the memoirs something that surprises Johann on his return to Frankfurt where the book is a best seller.Directed by Philipp Stolzl the film does not break new ground. It is a glossy account of a period in the life of the young artist whose work is revered as one of the best writers of the German language. The film is light as written for the screen by the director with Christoff Muller and Alexander Dydyna. A young Goethe as depicted in the story was quite a charmer in his dealings with the love he felt for a woman that was not meant to be his. It also conveys the fact that in spite of what his father wanted for him Johann's mind was better suited for literature than a law career.Alexander Fehling has the good looks demanded for the role of Goethe. Miriam Stein fares much better with her Lotte an accomplished portrait of the young woman who must help her family that needed her sacrifice. Moritz Bleibtreu is an accomplished actor seen here as Albert Kestner the man that won Lotte because of his wealth and social standing rather than by getting her love. Volker Bruch is seen as Wilhelm.Our only objection we had in watching the film was the poorly colored subtitles in the version that was shown recently at the Landmark Sunshine that made us strain our eyes to follow the translation.".

Moritz Bleibtreu may be the biggest star in the cast but the lead is played by Alexander Fehling a breakthrough performance for him. Other than these two there are more actors in here that are known in Germany such as Klauner Hbchen Bruch and Milberg. My favorite performance however comes from Miriam Stein I think the only major female character and given she has not played in a film of that dimension before it was delightful to see how good she was especially in the emotional parts.This 5yearold film can certainly be classified as a period piece and there is the usual story of love vs. reason for Stein's character. Love would be Goethe reason is Kestner. This film is as wild as Goethe himself and he and his buddy occasionally reminded me of the two hobbits from Lord of the Rings. It was great fun to watch them. The film becomes more serious as it goes on but I never felt it was a tragic watch even with Goethe not getting the girl he wants. Stlzl also solved this with creativity as the film to me somehow had to end on a high note. And he used Goethe's success as a writer for this. So everybody was somehow happy. Still it's always difficult to watch for me and see how love was not the crucial factor in relationships back then. Totally unimaginable today.This was the second time I watched this movie and was at least as good as the first time. Stlzl is slowly moving into Germany's filmmaking elite for me. I did no like Nordwand but that had mostly to do with the subject of the film. I loved The Physician and now I also like Goethe!. A pretty talented director and I am certainly curious about his next works. Until then I recommend Goethe!. Good performances a nice story and also real characters obviously definitely make this one worth the watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having read all the other reviews on this site I notice that most people either completely hate the film or completely love it. I take the middle ground. I greatly enjoyed the visual elements both with regard to the goodlooking leads and the stylish camera work. I enjoy a film where I can pick out performers from other films and this one offered a few. I recognized Jason Isaacs Captain Hook in the recent Peter Pan film for one. That being said I was disappointed that Sean Bean's part was so small. However I was glad Marianne Faithful's role was only a small cameo. It is painful to me to see her looking so haggard. I also enjoyed the pulsating soundtrack and believe that with an inferior effort the film would be even less appealing.As others have pointed out there's not much of a plot but beyond that it was difficult to sympathize with the characters  other than the police! The law officers in this film were not portrayed as sadistic or even unlikable. Frustrated yes. The protagonists had no redeeming characteristics other than youth good looks and energy. The film seems to present the viewpoint that the police deserved the treatment they received from the thugs. To me the film produces a nihilistic 'who gives a damn' about anything attitude. It made me think about anarchy after the system is demolished with what will it be replaced?I'm probably waxing too philosophical about a movie that never even aspired to such musings. The producers probably just wanted to give a youthful audience the smash 'em up 'wham bam thank you ma'am' form of entertainment many seem to want. Witness The Fast and the Furious and Vin Diesel's XXX among others. I like a bit of action too but I prefer to care about someone or something along the line.Nevertheless I maintain that I have seen worse films. I confess to an admiration of British films and actors that causes me to overlook aspects of a movie that I don't like in order to focus on what I consider to be redeeming features. For example I found Sean Pertwee's character in this film interesting even if the character is what we Americans like to call a scumbag. The bottom line to me is that the positives  including the soundtrack visual elements and interesting cast  outweigh the negatives. I bought the film at what you British call a jumble sale for 2.00 American money so I'm not out a lot of loot in any case. I will keep the film alongside Love Honour and Obey another secondhand bargain I found along the way. It too has redeeming features.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shopping is set in a shabby dark crumbling postindustrial UK city in the early 90s. Blast furnaces and abandoned factories line the roads battered old Ford Escorts Sierras Capris and early 90s BMWs are everywhere. The plot centres around a grim inner city estate of dilapidated tower blocks and deals with the aspirations of some of its residents.Jude Law plays selfdestructive Billy McKenzie a 19 year old nihilistic man who despises his society and hates his life. His older girlfriend Jo played by Sadie Frost is tired of the scene Billy is involved with car theft joy riding and ram raiding but cannot drag him out of it. Sean Pertwee gives a good performance as another petty criminal Tommy whose interests have grown to include shifting stolen goods drugs organised crime and generally more aspirational ideals.After being released from his first threemonth tenure in prison Billy immediately seeks out his old mates and gets back into his old ways. Tommy initially tries to make an ally of him with stories of organisation and easy money but Billy is only interested in getting respect from the estate and destruction and adrenaline and soon makes himself an enemy of Tommy and his crew with ultimately tragic consequences.Whilst the screenplay and direction are excellent the film is totally let down by its script. Many of the character's exclamations and reposes are less than natural some are downright baffling and some leave you cringing in your seat. It's not consistently bad there are also genuinely heart wrenching moments and some excellent quotes but you will also find yourself burying your head in your hands at other points and thinking nobody says that!. Billy's two mostly annoying mates are stereotypes of stereotypes and there's also some representations of dark and dingy illegal raves that are... well preposterous.But when all's said and done despite the cheesy moments in the script it's a good movie. The story all the action aside is really about Billy's seething selfhate and unwillingness to love and be loved. The cars the ramraiding the police Tommy the estate... it's all just a backdrop to the story of the slow and tragic destruction of an depressed young man caught in a world he has learned only to hate.".

This isn't helped by the fact that the script never aspires beyond this basic aim and characters that are never developed beyond the most basic of motivations. The idea that some foreign viewers would watch this and take it to be a realistic portrayal of modern Britain in rather hilarious to me but in fairness films are under no pressure to be real. This still leaves a fairly simply story with some very poor dialogue and not much material to work with.Anderson's direction is solid enough in terms of style though  which is really where his strengths continue to lie but as a result he seems to have a limited interest in depth and his input as writer is to blame for the problems with the material.

Law is skinny and bland and doesn't do anything other than looking like he is having a teenage strop for the majority of the film. Frost isn't much better and it is left to Pertwee to easily steal the film as a memorable if simple tough guy. James is OK while small roles from Bean Faithful Pryce and Walker make the film feel crowded with famous faces  not that any of them add much value outside of this.Overall this is a stylish film but one that now looks dated and rather empty. Without the controversy not much is left and the story and characters are too simple to engage most viewers I would suggest.

Certainly if you want to ban it on the grounds of quality control no one would miss it much  but as for encouraging anything it'd only encourage people not to go to the cinema to watch anymore films by Channel 4 The film starts with tough tearaway joyrider Billy played by Jude Law in his first starring role being released from his prison cell .

Billy is actually much more sympathetic than his role suggests compared to the criminals of today anyway. He's a loser adrenalin junkie true but there's something pure almost artistic about his love of the chase and addiction to capturing and destroying high powered automobiles.He doesn't attack people and he isn't in it to make money  he just loves shopping! By which I mean ramraiding high class shopping malls and stealing odd bits of crap. Billy isn't antisocial he loves his father who has given up on him and has a great platonic love for his girl whom he doesn't shag but prefers to stay best friends with. All in all a very sympathetic character that just couldn't exist today. Bit silly but then I think you had to be around in the 90s to really appreciate what this film's about  there was that time when nobody had any money and car thieves had the edge on the cops and all their crimes only involved cars and shops anyway and who cares about some stupid machine? It reminds me a lot of Crash  the JG Ballard novel and the latenineties film  in that it has that Ballardian acknowlegement that we all secretly want the bomb to drop we want the bad guy to win and that's what's so great about Shopping. Considering that he's a posh kid Jude Law's performance is stellar.So if you like the 80s and 90s like the industrial asthetic love to see cars destroyed hate or have hated authority watch this film.

Not to be mean or disagree I think every positive and negative point here was legitimate. That is one reason why this movie is so good its misunderstood on a scale from one to ten stars that buys 5 for me. The other 5 stars that makes it a ten in my book? I actually LIVED like this for about 5 years when i was a teenager.It's my guess that none of the reviewers here? Ever have lived the extreme adrenaline junkie sometimes criminal life of wanton chaos and destruction. A teen aged life of insanity of skateboards music destroying things just to destroy them carjacking showing up a rival gang drugs jail graffiti ram raiding running with a gang the attitude. So therefore they cannot truly relate and pan the movie which is unfair. I mean perhaps some of them have who knows? But I noticed an underlying lack of actual identification with Billy from the people here speaking and that I feel is a discredit to the director. To speak ill of something when you cannot identify and relate to the protagonist is a bit underhanded. But its okay. The movie is obviously supposed to evoke an either positive fascination or a negative judgment from the viewer I would posit that makes it a classic. I lived in the Midwest and when I was a teenager I did EVERYTHING Billy does in this movie. Got away with almost all of it like Billy but caught finally one day running from the cops super high at 4 am they out ran me... Billy would be one of my best friends if he was real and so would Jo. I NEVER see people in movies I identify with! It's usually the films about renegades that I identify with the characters and those tend to be very rare? So brownie points to Andersen for hitting the niche so well. Whoever picked the soundtrack actually knows what they're doing and that is very very very rare. Most cheesy action movies just play what everyone wants to hear this movie actually had identity when it came to the music akin to Clockwork Orange. This would be one of the 5 soundtracks from the 90's id actually buy. Not a single song in this movie would've been on the radio and i LOVED that. It wasn't fake poppy alternative and metal like most action movies there was actual electronic music which is so rare. There's a scene towards the end when Billy and Jo jack a red BMW and the song could've been straight off a progressive trance internet station. Kudos for that. Speaking of Jo i saw someone ragging on this movie because Billy turns Jo down? Yes it's a loser thing to do but I was in love with my best friend for 10 years and we never did sleep with each other. Ever slept with your best friend? I have. It's a terrible idea unless you want to make her your wife. Billy had too much work to do to alienate her which is generally what happens when you sleep with your best friend. I found the single kiss adorable and very reserved which is actually subtly dry and awesome they always just kiss kiss bang bang in movies its refreshing to see some actual focus. Jude Law pulls it off you can tell Billy is written to be way more into living his life than worrying about romance and some young men actually do live that way. I don't  but some do  The punk scene growing up around here was a lot like that. This was simply not a love story guys its way more akin to something like Akira. Jo's female presence is DIRELY needed in the respect that their are some kick tail WOMEN out there as well. And not all of those renegade women are just the protagonist's lover. Brownie points as well for making an action movie female in a strong role. I respected her a lot more for accepting his brushoff getting angry and leaving. Most women would pursue it and make a mess of things romance can really screw up the dynamic I used to run with some of the most crazy women in my city and I can speak firsthand. Men and women CAN just be best friends and partners without the romance it's a common misconception. This movie illustrates it beautifully. In closing I'd like to list the 4 movies i watched today to give you an idea of how this movie fits with it's genre of action I haven't watched any movies in a couple of weeks and got in a specific mood.... First was SFW second was Over the Edge third was Shopping fourth was A Clockwork Orange. I like them all equally and give them all ten stars for fitting a very very tight niche of underground appreciators. Teenage rebellion movies for the win!!!!!!! Shopping fits in JUST FINE. I obviously can't live a life of chaos like this anymore? The costs were too high so it's great to watch a sentimental movie every once in awhile and be like those were the days be like YUP i did that AHAHAHAHA! Instead of going and actually doing it.  A trip down memory lane as it were.PS The anti conformity anti authority anarchistic nature of this movie is to be commended you just don't see open rebellion movies anymore. The sad ending fits in right with the pathos and the message crime doesn't pay. Death happens and so does karma.".

	schema:headline " Let's go hopping!";
	schema:reviewBody "1994's Shopping stylized as hopping is a movie that I first came across during the latenight cable hours as an impressionable 10 or 11yearold growing up in the mid1990s. Of course due to the fact that I was such an impressionable young child growing up at that time my parents were keen to keep me away from Shopping a film with a futuristic industrialheavy aesthetic that appeared to glamorize auto theft ramraiding and unsavory Adrenalinaddicted thrillseeking young car thieves. And not so surprisingly this helped the film to generate a controversy in the United Kingdom for supposedly glamorizing criminal antisocial behavior.Shopping is mostly remembered for being a noteworthy early film credit for its two leads as well as being the directorial debut of a then29yearold Brit named Paul Anderson who now goes by Paul W.S. Anderson to avoid confusion with American filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. Paul Anderson would later gain worldwide recognition just one year later for his American film debut Mortal Kombat 1995 which is a film I love to death and to this day I still consider it to be the greatest film adaptation of a video game.Shopping is a stylish yet promising debut for Anderson whose career has since been a wildly mixed bag of occasional high points Mortal Kombat Event Horizon Resident Evil and several missteps Soldier AVP Alien vs. Predator and virtually every Resident Evil sequel he's directed pretty much.Shopping nonetheless showcases what would later become Anderson trademarks excellent set design and cinematography fastpaced direction and a walltowall soundtrack with an industrialtechno vibe to it Orbital's Halycon  On  On which is featured in the film several times appears to be a personal favorite of Anderson's since the song was also played near the end of his later Mortal Kombat. Shopping is set sometime in the nottoodistant future in London and centers around the socalled sport of shopping  stealing highpriced cars and then ramming them through department store windows looting them and then evading the police.Billy Jude Law is probably the most notorious of these young early 20something ramraiding punks. He along with his casual love interest the video gameloving Jo Sadie Frost Law's future reallife wife hit the streets and stores after he gets released from prison at the beginning of the film after doing three months for auto theft. Although it doesn't take long for Billy to fall back into old habits once released his shopping sprees are becoming more and more ambitious and reckless as his targets become bigger and bigger. As the stakes rise and his notoriety grows it catches the attention of his old rival Tommy Sean Pertwee an Anderson regular for whom the sport of shopping is a business since Tommy makes money selling off the goods he steals. For Billy it's nothing more than an Adrenalin rush that he claims is better than any drug and is to a degree for him at least an artform. So it inevitably sets the two of them down a path toward a headon collision.Shopping is a stylish and ambitious debut feature from Paul Anderson that established many of his trademarks  most notably his love for industrial music and this film revels in its striking industrialfuturistic ambiance  but also shows his weaknesses namely weak characterization spotty writing and story. His nonwritten directorial works Mortal Kombat Event Horizon and even the hokey Soldier were better showcases for Anderon's strengths as a director because he didn't have screenwriting credits attached to these pictures but instead worked because of his stylish fastpaced direction. Here Jude Law and Sadie Frost give stellar and enthusiastic performances in roles for which they were young and relatively unknown to American audiences at the time and have since become more widely known.Watching Shopping for the first time since I was a child it's an impressive debut from Paul W.S. Anderson in spite of his flaws of which there are many and is something that can happen with any early effort from any director.610".

Not that his movies are horrible either some of them are quite enjoyable but they just fail to make an impact in any way.All that this story is about are a bunch of rebellious teens being lazy and act as if the police are the biggest scum and villains on the Earth while they are the ones breaking about ever law and causing mayhem by stealing and wrecking stuff. It could had been a good or at least interesting story if it tried to make a statement about anything but the movie never does. At least I didn't get anything out of the story at all.It also doesn't exactly make any of the characters likable or compelling ones to watch and follow throughout this movie despite that they are being played by some big name actors. Not that they were being big at the time yet. The movie features a still very young Jude Law and Sadie Frost and a supporting cast that among other consist out of Sean Bean Jonathan Pryce and Jason Isaacs. Most of the characters however also make a pretty redundant impression. It tries to be a simple movie with a simple story but yet in throws in all these many pointless characters.It's not the worst movie you'll ever see but it's such a pointless and redundant movie to watch that there is no reason why you really should ever watch it in the first place.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Ordinary and flawed crime film that fumbles towards its conclusion before giving us what we expect.";
	schema:reviewBody "The trouble with most films like these is the predictability of them. While studies have been made on the noir genre and the American gangster genre featuring the rise of the antihero and the eventual demise of said role they really just open up the reader's mind to the possible predictability of any film that falls into these genres. Way back in the classical Hollywood age it was impossible to show any antihero or murderer actually get away with killing someone because it would glorify their actions in the sense they became successful because of it. Shopping falls into the crime genre but is a contemporary British effort although it revolves around criminal activity and that specific activity is carjacking and ramraiding. It treads close to glorifying it before delivering an ending few would predict incorrectly.So if after the first thirty minutes we cannot see which way this film is heading then it's quite clear we're not familiar with the genre. It takes a brave director to pull off an effective crime film and have the lead antihero get away with it all in the end but Paul W. S. Anderson is not that individual. In Shopping recently released convict Billy Law defies his superegos and goes out on a binge of crime and law breaking with girlfriend Jo Frost they steal cars avoid the police and smash shop windows with the film generally avoiding a clear cut plot until much later when it suddenly realises it needs one to see it through to its conclusion.Principally Anderson is cutting his teeth with this film and there is no way he is going to ignore the law that dictates what should happen to criminal antiheroes. The only thing with this is if you're going to go down that familiar route at least make it a fun ride along the way. Shopping does not make it an enjoyable ride but rather refrains from story telling until absolutely necessary. Billy the film's lead does not have a specific goal and whenever this is the case the film will not have a clear cut narrative. I'm all for films to expand from the monotony of formula and typical stories but for a film to open with two kids racing through a tunnel yelling at the top of their voice as the police chase them and then not really go on from there is just disappointing.Along with the lack of a goal Billy does not have anything at stake bar a rearrest from policeman Conway Pryce but that's never going to happen because if it did Billy would be locked up for another month or so and the film would end or become a prison drama something equally unlikely. The film takes place in an odd place a dystopian England that could be mistaken for the then near future a world in which people of a specific culture meet in packs showing off their latest 'steal' much like cavemen huddling around displaying their latest kill. But these people are more like Hell's Angels only with automobiles instead of motorcycles. The grim buildings and bizarre white lighting during the night scenes complete an odd setting feeling like something straight out of Blade Runner.More on the foils for Billy initially Conway stands between Billy and his 'goal' his goal being to go out commit crime drive really fast and..........acquire a kettle. I find the antagonism with Conway quite sad because he is really just trying to help this young individual stick to the straight and narrow. Billy can only refuse the aid. Then the film realises it needs a plot to track through to the final third and changes its principal antagonism to a character named Tommy Pertwee. Tommy is the closest thing you get in the film resembling a gangster a sort of hardnut caricature with a jacket and a shaved head. He answers to Venning Bean a man who he is indebted to and whose debt will become more complicated when Billy interferes.So the film all boils down to one massive heist at a retail shop named 'Alaska'. Before we get there we get some blatant product placement as characters state all the benefits of owning a BMW the fact that Budweiser is the 'king of beers' and Billy goes out of his way to emphasise Ellesse kettles. There are some daft scenes early on when a police chopper makes itself known alerting everyone to run away before the police arrive and other pursuing police cars seems to disappear when an ambush scene at some garages arrives. But you cannot fault the film for effort and a rather impressive opening scene sees Jo cast away the young woman clichs she should embody when she chucks cassette tapes of current pop music out the back of a stolen car  she will not be a part of that culture as we will learn she's 'in' with the car obsessed Hell's Angelstype crowd.While Shopping never falls below that level that makes it a genuinely bad film it isn't anything spectacular. Whilst deeply flawed it is interesting to see a low budget lowkey British film trying to shoot car chases and attempting to make some sort of crime saga. But the story is left wanting and the film revolves around absolutely nothing for most of the time. While this isn't a bad thing it takes a skilled director to deliver that approach and while the intentions were there director Anderson falls just short.".

	onyx:emotionText "The trouble with most films like these is the predictability of them. While studies have been made on the noir genre and the American gangster genre featuring the rise of the antihero and the eventual demise of said role they really just open up the reader's mind to the possible predictability of any film that falls into these genres. Way back in the classical Hollywood age it was impossible to show any antihero or murderer actually get away with killing someone because it would glorify their actions in the sense they became successful because of it. Shopping falls into the crime genre but is a contemporary British effort although it revolves around criminal activity and that specific activity is carjacking and ramraiding. It treads close to glorifying it before delivering an ending few would predict incorrectly.So if after the first thirty minutes we cannot see which way this film is heading then it's quite clear we're not familiar with the genre. It takes a brave director to pull off an effective crime film and have the lead antihero get away with it all in the end but Paul W. S. Anderson is not that individual. In Shopping recently released convict Billy Law defies his superegos and goes out on a binge of crime and law breaking with girlfriend Jo Frost they steal cars avoid the police and smash shop windows with the film generally avoiding a clear cut plot until much later when it suddenly realises it needs one to see it through to its conclusion.Principally Anderson is cutting his teeth with this film and there is no way he is going to ignore the law that dictates what should happen to criminal antiheroes. The only thing with this is if you're going to go down that familiar route at least make it a fun ride along the way. Shopping does not make it an enjoyable ride but rather refrains from story telling until absolutely necessary. Billy the film's lead does not have a specific goal and whenever this is the case the film will not have a clear cut narrative. I'm all for films to expand from the monotony of formula and typical stories but for a film to open with two kids racing through a tunnel yelling at the top of their voice as the police chase them and then not really go on from there is just disappointing.Along with the lack of a goal Billy does not have anything at stake bar a rearrest from policeman Conway Pryce but that's never going to happen because if it did Billy would be locked up for another month or so and the film would end or become a prison drama something equally unlikely. The film takes place in an odd place a dystopian England that could be mistaken for the then near future a world in which people of a specific culture meet in packs showing off their latest 'steal' much like cavemen huddling around displaying their latest kill. But these people are more like Hell's Angels only with automobiles instead of motorcycles. The grim buildings and bizarre white lighting during the night scenes complete an odd setting feeling like something straight out of Blade Runner.More on the foils for Billy initially Conway stands between Billy and his 'goal' his goal being to go out commit crime drive really fast and..........acquire a kettle. I find the antagonism with Conway quite sad because he is really just trying to help this young individual stick to the straight and narrow. Billy can only refuse the aid. Then the film realises it needs a plot to track through to the final third and changes its principal antagonism to a character named Tommy Pertwee. Tommy is the closest thing you get in the film resembling a gangster a sort of hardnut caricature with a jacket and a shaved head. He answers to Venning Bean a man who he is indebted to and whose debt will become more complicated when Billy interferes.So the film all boils down to one massive heist at a retail shop named 'Alaska'. Before we get there we get some blatant product placement as characters state all the benefits of owning a BMW the fact that Budweiser is the 'king of beers' and Billy goes out of his way to emphasise Ellesse kettles. There are some daft scenes early on when a police chopper makes itself known alerting everyone to run away before the police arrive and other pursuing police cars seems to disappear when an ambush scene at some garages arrives. But you cannot fault the film for effort and a rather impressive opening scene sees Jo cast away the young woman clichs she should embody when she chucks cassette tapes of current pop music out the back of a stolen car  she will not be a part of that culture as we will learn she's 'in' with the car obsessed Hell's Angelstype crowd.While Shopping never falls below that level that makes it a genuinely bad film it isn't anything spectacular.

Shopping is so far wide of the mark in terms of any youth culture ever to have existed the acting is average and the plot dull. Having first seen and hated the film during its original cinema release I recently watched it again on a UK digital film channel to see if my opinion was still the same. It hasn't changed. Jude Law is a fine actor but seems to enjoy picking a few bad films from time to time. Sean Pertwee's choice of role is consistently poor  he and Shopping go hand in hand. That's not to say I think Mr.Pertwee is a poor actor but I cannot think of many films I've seen him in that has been worth watching I.D. Event Horizon Blue Juice  I rest my case. The film does have one singular redeeming quality the title track by Sabres of Paradise is superb. I suggest you buy the soundtrack and skip the film.".

At one point Sadie licks the face of a mannequin and hints at something more genuine however the next police pursuing a car scene leading the police into an urban ambush is back to unintended satire.

Sean Pertwee is a laughable oik from his first presence sat on the banisters watching the low lifes play in his criminal arcade emporium seriously he was playing a rogue who ran a games shop for teenagers  but being in a disused run down place was supposed to make it a bit gritty. Slapping a car roof to show his annoyance at the naughty children Frost and Law getting into bother with the busies is about the level of such a misguided film although he gets into even more of a bad temper when he hits a pipe against other pipes half way through the 'movie'.

I do give a thumbs up to the makeup on the main scary dude to bad they wasted it on this movie. I had heard it was being compared to Nightmare On Elm Street but I didn't see much of a connection. Nightmare On Elm Street was a well thoughtout fully connected movie...Incubus was disjointed at times and Reid's character was empty.

The characters were so poorly acted and their motivations so completely irrational that I was hoping this was a short film and they'd all die quickly. And the plot! Swiss cheese has less holes. Here's what I hated the most. I apologize the list is so short... Why did the entire gang enter through the roof? Why wouldn't 1 or 2 of them descend through the vent then try the front door to let their friends in? Why did they assume they wouldn't be able to open them from the inside? When Jay and Josh are both looking for each in the hallways screaming each other's names why don't they answer? Jay couldn't have gone more than a few hundred feet before Josh went after her. Lucky break finding that key in the scientist's mouth. If Josh couldn't tell what was in her mouth why did he insist on digging in there? In the basement when Josh is trying to find the breaker switch Holly senses there is someone down there with them. Oh don't worry about that Josh just find the breaker. The lights are sooo much more important than your life. When the gang discovers the Incubus Josh immediately recognizes him as a child killer. How? This takes place years later after his conviction and his faked death so the government could experiment on him. How could anyone make that connection? Hey we're really scared because of the dead bodies everywhere and the psycho killer locked in the basement. I know why don't we split up while Peter's trying to open the vent? When Peter discovers the airvent with the vertical shaft to lead to the roof everyone's happy. In the very next scene the characters are shown going upstairs. Wouldn't the vent be easier to access on a higher floor and make it less of a climb to the roof? No one was around when Peter fell asleep and became host to the Incubus. How could Jay Bug and Holly reach their conclusion that Peter was possessed during his sleep? Jay had no basis to warn Bug not to fall asleep because the same thing would happen to him. Oh no Peter's gone crazy. Where can we feel safe? I know in the glass room with the creepy coma guy. Quick everyone inside. Jay spends 5 minutes reading a random file about the Incubus and suddenly has ALL the answers. Oh yeah she's a medical student. They must cover inhumane experiments involving child psychopaths and REM sleep in first year. Ditto with the first VHS tape she finds. Lucky pick Jay. Oh my brother's dead and I'm devastated. The only thing that will help me now is telling Holly about my out of body experiences as a kid which has nothing to do with the plot other than a cheap attempt to explain what could be happening. Jay is a medical student? When was this ever revealed in the movie? And of all the people to play one Tara Reid? Come on... The Incubus was very articulate considering he had no tongue and my so incredibly agile even though he was in a sitting position for years. Thank god his muscles didn't atrophy. Oh no the psycho Incubus is free can talk and walk around without handicap. I better waste time tying this vice to a rope and just hope it somehow hooks onto something on the roof. How did the rope get long enough to do this? It snapped when Peter was using it leaving it short which is why they were trapped in the first place. Jay kills the Incubus in seconds with rope that's not even wrapped around his neck. She just pins it down over his neck on both sides and he suffocates in seconds. Why did the police officer immediately arrest Jay at the end of the movie without seeing if she needed medical attention? Or asking her to explain what happened? And why did Jay just put her hands behind her back so complacently? Tara you're acting this isn't real life.".

Oh there was a maniac locked in the basement and now the door is open let's go check there again ? Or when the other girl in the group locks herself and wait until the killer get's really close to open the door and let the other ones come inside how smart is that ? And when Tara is trying to escape in the end why in the name of god didn't they tried that before ? There are so many other plot holes like these.Probably the bestoftheworst scene is in a flashback where we can check a little more of the killer's life. And another hole he have no tongue but is enable to even sing !!! at the end.Seriously even worst then the holes are the acting of the cast the dialog and the ending terrible. There's even one character that disappears in the beginning and appears again in the end just to deliver the worst line in the whole film.So..i must say that Tara Reid is the best thing about this now you can imagine how the rest is like.".

Genuine scares good plot line etc.Sad to say Incubus has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING valuable about it.So the film starts with some odd fight between two scientists in some rundown bunker. I suppose this is intended to grab the viewer and make them wonder what's going on. Not really.Then we come to our brave crew of young adults who will of course stumble upon some great horror. They suffer a car accident note you don't actually see the accident just the car flipped over on it's side and a guardrail all twisted up. Instantly you find that the dialog is terrible and the acting isn't much better.So our brave party trek off across Montana to find the nearest town or something and decide to cut through some woods when they stumble upon some mysterious compound complete with automatic lights but for some reason the fence is quite easily kickedin. Now at this point in the film you ask yourself why these people are so intent on getting inside the building I guess it was supposed to be really cold outside and they needed shelter...despite the fact that it looked like it was the middle of summer and they all had camping equipment. Anyway they climb up onto the roof and repel down a massive air shaft...first they send down Tara Reid...all alone and let her wander around while the others just stand around. Then they all decide to go down and look for Tara Reid except for one girl with a foreign accent who decides to leave and not tell anyone...Well our foolish band of heroes explore their prison after the rope gets cut on the air shaft and they find bodies and most surprisingly a guy in a comastate with all sorts of wires attached to him.Tara Reid suddenly because very interested in this guy for some reason even after her brother gets killed by the last of the deranged scientists. Fast forward a bit the scientist kills himself and one of the guys is now deranged and he attacks them. Tara on her brief examination of the data figures out that they are conducting experiments on this guy and that he's actually a killer who was supposed to be executed. Tara then talks about how the government CIA NSA DIA etc were all conducting experiments but those were shut down in 1995 but for some reason this one continued...deep in the Montana woods where lost campers could stumble upon a supersecret operation....hmmmSo anyway Tara figures out that the serial killer is getting into people's bodies when they sleep and this is where the movie gets its name. Sadly an Incubus did not this and instead would have sex with women to create more incubi. But I guess it sounded cool and they needed something to make people want to watch this film. The group then decides to somehow trap the killer by having one of them fall asleep. Idiots. Obviously the person who falls asleep then tries to kill them and they are forced to kill her. Hilarious...what did they think was going to happen.At this point you're wondering why they don't just kill the serial killer and the one guy tries though he only pulls out some tubes...rather than simply stab him or break his neck or something. And we all know what happens next he comes alive and with only Tara Reid left there's a chase scene and she outsmarts him and then kills him by making him fall down the air shaft and then she strangles him. Tara then falls asleep and has a dream of the killer pleasuring her and then eating her ha ha. She wakes up to find police and she is taken outside. We find that the girl who left in the beginning apparently found the police and of course the last scene we see Tara Reid with the killer eyes....The film leaves you with a profound sense of...regret. Bad acting horrible dialog a plot line that makes no sense and so many holes that it's almost like this was written by a budding drama student in about an hour. Not even Tara Reid's ultratight shirt can save this film. Normally for mediocre horror films I would tell you to go ahead and rent it on netflix or something...no save your time.".

I'm somewhere in the middle. It's not good but it's hardly the worst horror movie ever. Let's deal with the bad things first. For startersthe title is wrong. An incubus is a demon that comes to you in your nightmares. That's NOT what this is about. SPOILER!!!! It's about a madman who uses his thoughts to take over your body when you fall asleep and force you to kill. That's about possessionnot a demon. END SPOILER!!! The cast has no personalities and are pretty interchangeable. The plot is pretty run of the mill too with that stupid it's not over ending. On the plus side it's pretty wellmade the acting actually isn't bad top billed Tara Reid is good the cast are all attractive especially Russell Carter as Josh and there's some explicit bloody gore. For the record there's no nudity in this one at all.Soall in alla pretty good horror film with some decent gore and a capable cast. I was never bored which isn't something I can't say for most recent horror films. I give it a 6.".

I'm somewhere in the middle. It's not good but it's hardly the worst horror movie ever. Let's deal with the bad things first. For startersthe title is wrong. An incubus is a demon that comes to you in your nightmares. That's NOT what this is about. SPOILER!!!! It's about a madman who uses his thoughts to take over your body when you fall asleep and force you to kill. That's about possessionnot a demon. END SPOILER!!! The cast has no personalities and are pretty interchangeable. The plot is pretty run of the mill too with that stupid it's not over ending. On the plus side it's pretty wellmade the acting actually isn't bad top billed Tara Reid is good the cast are all attractive especially Russell Carter as Josh and there's some explicit bloody gore. For the record there's no nudity in this one at all.Soall in alla pretty good horror film with some decent gore and a capable cast. I was never bored which isn't something I can't say for most recent horror films. I give it a 6.";

As far as the gore goes it's pretty dry and mostly off camera with the exception of a few scenes. I thought the rest of the cast did a decent job and Mihai Stanescu in particular did an admirable job as The Sleeper. All in all it had some moderate suspense and creepiness going for it. Stanescu was the best part and with a little more gore and a stronger female lead this could have been much more. Not to be confused with The William Shatner film Incubus.".

One of the better ones is the overall look of the house and its thrilling atmosphere from the rather creepy and eerie location used. Since most of the time is spent in the hallways of the underground facility this one gets really creepy in the first half with its usuallydarkened state the rash of discoveries and long winding design that generates some big tense moments in here. The early discoveries are the best as them relying on flashlights exploring the facility leading to a couple of tense passages within the film as they head down the darkened areas. From the grim discoveries left lying around in bloody pools to the scenes where they're going through the laboratory with all the equipment on display there's enough here to make it feel really creepy. As well there's also a really great story to keep this one feeling strong with all the strange medical experiment lying around the facility their limited knowledge of what's going on and the mystery gradually becoming clearer the longer they're in danger about the study going on with him which is rather intriguing all backed up with a couple of dead bodies and a fantastic revelation sequence this one has a pretty strong backstory. There's also a rather disturbing backstory that involves tongues which scores points for both being bloody as well as being genuinely disturbing and scores the film's biggest shock scene. The last big part here that works is the gore which comes from some rather tense stalking scenes here from their first encounter in the tunnel to the big confrontation inside his protective cell. These here are what hold the film up as this didn't have a lot of flaws but they were pretty big. The first is that there's a great deal of selected stupidity in here that doesn't always work. Frankly choosing to go into an uncharted house in the dark is a really unwise move as is the film's tendency to have them remain instead of trying to get out as once it's established that something is wrong the focus shifts away from trying to escape and becomes more about trying to understand the situation. That makes no sense as the situation grows to concern the others about the situation in what quickly grows tiring the fact that nearly everything in here from topsecret military experiments to how to operate the machinery and much much more in here's explained by one of the characters despite there being no knowledgeable instances before where there's evidence of that. As well there are also some pacing issues which really keeps the kills all the backhalf of the film rather than spaced out more evenly. Along with the film's somewhat convoluted story which can get a little overexplained at times there's not much else wrong here.Rated R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.".

There are plentiful errors in the storyline too such as characters who randomly disappear only to suddenly show up later and realism is virtually nil. The acting is quite poor particularly from the singleexpressioned Tara Reid although I have to admit that Akemnji Ndifernyan does his best with the role he's given and at least he doesn't die first. The gore effects are cheap and schlocky and there's zero here to distinguish it from all the rest of the decade's trash so it's a film destined for the bin and nowhere else.".

In fact the film's mythology is seriously lacking in detail with all the exposition being given by the young cast in such a way that it fails to make any sense.

Some of the bloody makeup on the characters changes from shot to shot makeup effects wizard Gary J. Tunnicliffe seems to have had a real difficulty in keeping the continuity going as well as having several victims  indeed the Sleeper himself speak with no problems despite having bitten their tongues off. Also notable is the scene where one of the cast tries to kill the Sleeper by removing the tubes keeping him alive from his body only for one of the tubes 'magically' reconnecting to him in a subsequent shot.The acting is for the most part execrably shrill. There is a running joke among certain horror fan circles on how Tara Reid's breast implants are a waste of money  indeed the only thing worse than having those things is having her horrendous acting skills being displayed here. The rest of the cast have similar problems with their acting skills. The only person who gives a worthwhile performance is Mihai Stanescu who plays the Sleeper spending most of his screen time asleep in a chair. When he does wake up he proves to be even creepier awake than he was in a coma.Another thing I found weird with the film was the use of Romanian actors  locations despite the film being set in the USA. Of course Anya Camilleri the director tries to make it work by having those actors have limited screen time so as not to let any of the viewers catch on unless they sit through the closing credits like I do. Not a terrible film but still a waste of time.".

This movie is a little different than many war movies in that it doesn't really strive for suspense or excitement even though there are plenty of action scenes.

The story was good and so were most of the SFX. Plus a reason of its own to give the film a star it introduced MechaGodzilla one of my favorite monsters! The story wasn't a rehash of the others and they actually brought back some of the best Toho actors Akihiko Hirata and Hiroshi Koizumi! The music was all right for the most part with its jazzy feel to it. The aliens are a bit of a disappointment being monkeys but they didn't ruin it like the cockroaches in Godzilla vs. Gigan. This is the first film since Godzilla vs. Hedorah a whole three years !! for SFX director Teruyoshi Nakano to actually display something presentable and all of MechaG's rampage scenes are carried out nicely. But the doppelganger's chest ray looked too simple compared to his eye beams which looked incredible. To the monsters....Angiurus returns now able to leap at his foes like Baragon in Frankenstien Conquers the World a bit odd but cool. His fight with MechaG is very physical ripping Anguirus' jaws apart and all. MechaG was incredibly cool looking and all his weapons are brought to life fantastically. I'm glad he returns in Terror of MechaGodzilla. King Seeser is actually a decent monster but I hate the fact that that braud had to sing for over a minute to awaken him! It was the Mothra song coming back to haunt us all. Godzilla is still the suit from Godzilla vs. Megalon. The final battle was spectacular and fun goes to bloody levels never before seen in a Gfilm and the Monster King takes quite a beating. In this film Godzilla also doesn't do any goofy moves or that many human tactics. Of course besides that scene where he missed his mechanical twin with his heat ray and seemed to snap his fingers in anger. The human characters all give good performances and a few espionage scenes but the aliens' aluminum foil base wasn't that impressive.I really enjoyed this movie and really think it's one of the better at a time when Godzilla films were really going downhill. The sequel surpasses this film but the end of the original series I guess was inevitable at this point.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1974 Gojira tai Mekagojira is a very nice break from the garbage that was 1973's Gojira tai Megaro Godzilla Against Megalon. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla was made to commemorate Godzilla's 20th anniversary. Toho hired veteran composer Masaru Sato for the music Teruyoshi Nakano was brought back for special effects and Jun Fukuda returned to direct. After Godzilla vs. Megalon Fukuda does a 180 and gives us an exciting original wellpaced film. The special effects are among the best of the Showa series. While some of the Black Hole Aliens scenes leave some to be desired the monster scenes are well doneand greatly improved over Godzilla vs. Megalon. The battles between Godzilla and Mechagodzilla are fastpaced and brutal. Mechagodzilla is a very original foe for Godzilla and probably his deadliest. Godzilla himself is the Megarogoji from 1973 but Toho gave him a mean look. King Seesar is an interesting monster and has a small cult following but many look down upon him due to him getting pummeled by Mechagodzilla.There are flaws though. Character development leaves some to be desired but this can be forgiven by the film's fast pace. Also some special effects shots like Mechagodzilla's chest lightning look ridiculous.Here's an interesting fact for those who don't already know During Godzilla's fight with Fake Godzilla you may notice that Fake Godzilla seems rather goofy with a chubbier jaw and his hands resemble Mechagodzilla's missile finger. This is because Toho used a promotional Godzilla suit instead of making a second Megarogoji suit which they couldn't afford. The Fake Godzilla suit was also used for water scenes because water causes a lot of wear and tear on Godzilla suits.Overall Gojira tai Mekagojira is a fastpaced fun exciting film to watch. Possibly the best of the seventy's and it's leaps and bounds above Godzilla vs. Megalon. However if you're expecting anything like the original Gojira or the Golden Age look elsewhere. But if you're the kind who enjoys fastpaced action this is your kind of film.Score710".

Why is Godzilla attacking his friend? a confused scientist asks before discovering moments later that the strange metal from Okinawa isn't just titanium  its space titanium. Titanium. From Space.So what does this all mean? Are they random coincidences? Or have alien gorillas who wear human suits and originating from the 9th planet in the Black Hole Galaxy come up with a plan to conquer Earth using a MechaGodzilla? You have one guess.Well now its up to Godzilla and King Caesar the not so legendary protector of Okinawa who has yet to reappear in any kaiju movie... to battle MechaGodzilla while the human characters thwart the Aliens plans. Speaking of humans our future is in the hands of some scientists and an Interpol agent. Yes Interpol investigates alien invasions now.Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla sets new standards in absurdity in Godzilla movies. It really is that silly. I'm not saying that its bad  on the contrary I thought the movie was great fun and I think the aliens' real plan was to makes us all laugh ourselves to death. The dubbing is truly bad that explains a lot of the cheesefactor and most of the movie is laughable. Any Godzilla fan should check it out as should anyone looking for cheap cheesy laughs.510".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS JUST IN CASEDefinitely the best made between the original movie and Godzilla 1984 both of which are superior to this one.Of course it leaves a few things unexplained. For instance if you're going to make a giant robot fighting machine why shape it like Godzilla in the first place? Not to put the Big Guy down but he doesn't exactly have the most streamlined or efficient body design. The aliens' reason disguise it as Godzilla to confuse people seems a little thin to me. What's the advantage to them in letting people think Godzilla's on the rampage instead of just going allout and attacking without a disguise?Secondly this was one of the series that used the regrettable 'install Godzilla in a piece of scenery' schtick instead of just having him come roaring up out of the sea. I was willing to forgive this in King Kong vs. Godzilla since discovering Godzilla in an iceberg was proper continuity from the end of Godzilla Raids Again. Finding Godzilla buried and sleeping under a mountain was a pretty farfetched premise in Godzilla vs Ebirah. But even that was more believable than having Godzilla emerge from a warehouse!That having been said the good parts outnumber the bad. The soundtrack with it's rocking StanKentonesque bigband theme for MechaGodzilla is a great updating from the Ifukube scores which were just being reused time after time in most Godzilla movies. The song Ms. Moonface sings to awaken King Caesar is forgettable but not so awful that it's hard to endure. It's preferable to the Minitwits' Mothra linedance song that we heard so many times.King Caesar in his only performance he was even cut from the flashback scenes in the sequel to this film proves a worthy ally for Godzilla. He may not be an allpowerful titan but there's no quit in him. Basing a monster design on a temple guardian dog was a far better idea in my opinion than making a monster out of a roach. Mechagodzilla's design is equally good though I question the necessity of putting a Supermanlike 'M' on his chest plate and you can easily see the grating in his neck where the suit actor's eyes are.The movie contains the requisite accidental goofiness like the 'prophecy' which is repeated about a dozen different ways and the Professor's solidmetal pipe which must weigh about five pounds. This is a Godzilla flick though. It's entertainment not art.".

	schema:headline " Mechagodzilla is my favorite Godzilla opponent!";
	schema:reviewBody "Of the Showa era Godzilla films the best was the first film as it was done very well and had very disturbing scenes when one watched the uncut Japanese version. However my favorite Godzilla film to watch in the Showa era is this particular film. It features my favorite Godzilla enemy in Mechagodzilla and has an awesome fight at the end. I also like the Mechagodzilla film done during the Hensei era and though I think this Mechagodzilla incarnation is cooler that one was still the better film and my favorite of the Hensei era films. Mechagodzilla would return during the millennial Godzilla series in two movies but I was not as happy with them. The first one was really good but I think they missed the mark on the second. It was a two part thing and they clearly showed Mechagodzilla call Kiryu in those films as being superior and more than a match for Godzilla and for reasons unknown they add Mothra to the mix also fighting against Godzilla who was completely overwhelmed during the second film. Here Mechagodzilla is a product of aliens while in all other incarnations it is a weapon designed by man to defeat Godzilla. This Mechagodzilla though to me had the best arsenal of weapons including really cool finger missiles! The story has some people at a ceremony when the young lady performing it suddenly has a vision of a monster destroying the world. Granted her vision clearly shows Gidorah shots from previous movies. Well turns out that there is something to this prophecy as soon Godzilla emerges and begins causing havoc! He decimates his old monster friend Anguiris and makes his way to a port where he comes face to face with another Godzilla! Are there two Godzillas? No the one causing mayhem is a cyborg version of Godzilla called Mechagodzilla. Godzilla seems killed by this creation and the humans must try and figure out how to resurrect a monster known as King Ceasar to try and combat this metal monstrosity! Thankfully for King Ceasar a certain monster may come back in a foul mood and ready to avenge his earlier loss! This Showa era Godzilla film seemed to move away a bit from the silliness of the previous couple of Godzilla films. There was no child present there was blood spewing and a lot of other things that made this entry darker than the previous film Godzilla vs Megalon. This film and the next would help the Showa era end on a strong note and these two films are favorites of mine as I do not like the overly kiddie movies like Megalon but on the other hand I prefer Godzilla to be the hero as I like pulling for Godzilla to win and that does not happen all too often when he is bad Godzilla.So all in all a really good Godzilla film from the Showa era. It has things within in it that other films in the era do not and I like the characters in this one too. I was actually interested in what the humans were doing as they were done well enough I was not just waiting for the scenes with the monsters. The villains were good too though I do find it incredibly lame that they could not fix their own creation but instead had to use and Earthling to do the job. Still a pretty fun Godzilla flick and the next to last movie of an era.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first godzilla movie I ever saw when I was about five years old so naturally I have a lot of nostalgia for this flick. It introduced me to the wonderful world of godzilla movies. I personally think this was an awesome movie. It has four monsters three awesome monster battles an ancient prophecy James Bond esc elements and a killer soundtrack. This is a real return to form for Godzilla after the dismal Godzilla vs Gigan and Godzilla vs Megalon I actually liked Godzilla vs Hedorah and I enjoyed the final battle in Gigan but overall GvG was pretty awful.I love the designs of the monsters. The godzilla suit from Megalon was reused but it was dramatically improved with an altered head which had an angry frown and smaller sharper teeth which made the suit look a lot more viscous not like the previous head which made big G look way too cutesy. The Anguirus suit from Destroy All Monsters was reused which I have no problem with because the suit looks damn awesome. King Caesar is an awesome monster though considering he was so integral to the prophecy in the movie he didn't really do much when he was actually awakened other than get his ass royally handed to him by Mechagodzilla. And now we move on to Godzilla's foe for this movie his mechanical twin Mechagodzilla. Mechagodzilla just looks incredible. The thing looks damn evil what with those glaring orange eyes. It sounds evil too with that screeching roar it makes.The movie has brilliant build up. After their first confrontation ends in a tie with godzilla seemingly dead godzilla and mechagodzilla leave to recover. After that point the movie builds up to an epic climax and it does not disappoint. Godzilla and caesar fight mechagodzilla in one of the most action packed monster fights ever seen. I highly recommend this movie to any godzilla fan anyone who's new to the series or anyone who just likes old B movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1970s aren't particularly known for having the best Godzilla movies but when Godzilla was good he was very good and this is one of those cases. In fact Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla is highly regarded by fans if the franchise for this reason it's pure cheese and completely bizarre but it actually also has drama that works bet you thought you'd never heard anyone describe any of the Godzilla films from the 70s in that fashion and a good plot too. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that this was Godzilla's 20th anniversary and so they decided to cut the bullshit and show him as a destructive force while still keeping him an antihero. Not that anyone in particular goes to see Godzilla for anything other than a man in a rubber suit whaling on nothing's but while this film offers that it has a good story and even some very interesting plot twists that keep the story all spiced up. It's also short and set at 84 minutes and it rarely fumbles.As the title itself gives away Godzilla faces off against... Godzilla. That's two Godzillas for the price of one but this is a gigantic cyborg Godzilla and you wouldn't expect the thing to work so well but the execution is so tight and well done. In fact it's revealed over the course of the film that Mechagodzilla is controlled by aliens from an external source. The basis for Mechagodzilla is that he appears when a black mountain rises and when a red moon sets two more monsters appear to destroy him. When he first appears you're immediately greeted with a surprise as you think he's Godzilla then he begins brutally beating Angurius who is usually his ally. When actual Godzilla shows up is when we see him turn into a cyborg. The fights are especially well done and the last fight is just absolutely brutal. It's great to see the brutality returned to Godzilla after years of him being reduced to a camp typePlot and character wise it succeeds too. You can actually care for the characters even if you're not here for the characters. There's a subplot involving a statue which also succeeds due to the intrigue. A classic moment appears on a scene on a ferry where it's revealed one of the workers is an undercover alien which is a very effective and shocking plot twist. It also results in a very impressive chase and action sequence which cant be said for a lot of scenes set on a ferryBut ultimately the most memorable moment of the movie happens when the Azumi priestess goes to the island where King Caesar Godzilla's ally in this movie rests and sings an ultra catchy yet haunting hymn to wake him up. It's an actual full three minute song and her vocal range is on full display making every minute of it believable. The fight that ensues afterward is awesome too. While a lot of the 1970s Godzillas are rather forgettable and at times bad at least this film actually succeeds in being enjoyable primarily because it's well written has enough of Godzilla to go around and even the non Godzilla scenes are effective much like the new Godzilla. An absolute recommend in every sense.".

Several subsequent battles then take place which nearly leave the city in ruins.

It was always my all time favorite along with King Kong vs. Godzilla. There is a lot of talking but I suppose it is necessary to set up the storyline. And once it gets to the action scenes it becomes quite worth it. Seeing Godzilla fight Mechagodzilla is truly an entertaining watch. All the battles in this movie are totally epic and the addition of the King Seesar monster makes it truly a unique and satisfying experience. There is also a catchy poplike musical number and lots of cool alien transformation sequences. This is a musthave for every Godzilla fan and for what it is gets a 10 out of 10!".

The best of the bad Godzillas are just flatout absurd the plots a series of unlikely excuses to wipe out business districts and waterfronts. The original Gojira is not really a Godzilla movie if you know what I mean. That's an attempt at a real story with themes and characters.This one has a more glamorous look than many Toho movies. By this I mean that there are several sets not built to be destroyed and even a few pretty locations. The photography is a little bit interesting. Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla makes a further gesture toward sophistication when it declines to feature any cute fat children.Don't fear though. This is still a movie so inexplicable as to feature an Okinawan monster named after a Roman emperor. So pandering that its ancient demons are awakened by modern pop songs. And so friggin' stupid that the aliens give their address as 3rd planet of the black hole outer space. Like many Gameras and Godzillas of the 60s and 70s it also shows the superficial influence of Kurosawa and Peckinpah as both monsters and space aliens spurt highpressure blood. Unfortunately this movie features less property damage than perhaps any other Godzilla effort. There are only two or three fights and they're not very long and they take place mostly in the countryside worst there is not a single remotecontrol tank deployed to deal with the 500 foot terrorists stomping the mainland. Boy do I miss those rocket planes on wires. This movie makes its least inspired choice when it injures Mechagodzilla just prior to his big job inspiring his space monkey boss to say Damn it we'll have to postpone our attack on Tokyo. Not words you want to hear in a Godzilla movie. Unless you're Japanese.Fortunately for the rest of us this film spawned Terror of Mechagodzilla a quantum leap forward in ludicrous hokum. An immensely more satisfying piece of crap the sequel is a return to form in which Tokyo is properly laid to slightly overdue waste.".

The priestess also predicts that two other monsters will come and try to save the world. This prophecy theme is used to gear towards another alieninvasion plot but gets a little intriguing when the main characters go to explore and investigate to see if the prophecy will come true. And putting in an Interpol agent into the mix gives the movie a little more excitement.Not a lot of city destruction here and that King Seesar doesn't really deserve to be called powerful monster! He really didn't do a whole lot especially since he is an important element to the story people took a big risk to try to obtain the statue that awakens him. Godzilla did more of the work. But a nice Godzilla entry nonetheless and it was nice to see some actors from the Godzilla movies of the 1960s. Mechagodzilla looks spectacular  full of weaponry and gear. Masaru Sato's score is catchy and fun and Teruyoshi Nakano did a much better job on the special effects. No stock footage was used unlike Godzilla vs. Gigan and Godzilla vs. Megalon which Nakano also did the special effects for. This movie also marks the last appearance of Anguirus.Overall one of the better Godzilla movies of the 1970s. This movie deserves a special note as it was the very first Godzilla film my brother saw. He's also a huge Godzilla fan.Grade B".

	schema:headline " Godzilla against his Mechanical Double";
	schema:reviewBody "After the making of Godzilla's Revenge Godzilla vs Gigan and Godzilla vs Megalon it appeared that the Godzilla Films were in a downward spiral in the late sixties and early seventies. But when Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla was made another great Godzilla film resulted.An old Japanese profit reveals that when the sun rises the wrong way or something that a monster will come to destroy the Earth. A professor guy has someone break into his house to try and steal a statue that he owns that resembles the god like Monster King Caesar. Later some humans find Space Titanium near a mountain. When the sun rises wrong Godzilla appears attacks Anguirus brutally and then goes on a rampage of Japan. Then another GOdzilla appears. One of the Godzillas is revealed to really be a cyborg made of Space Titanium. A Mechagodzilla. Mechagodzilla gets rid of his disguise and takes down Godzilla with an array of weaponry. But Mechagodzilla has problems with his head and has to return to the base where the Simians that are controlling him are located. The simians capture a professor and force him to repair Mechagodzilla. Another prophecy reveals that one day two monsters will come to save the Earth. Using the statue of King Caesar people open up a Mountain and the monster King Caesar comes out to battle Mechagodzilla but loses badly. However Godzilla reappears it is now evident that Godzilla and King Caesar are the two monsters that will save the Earth from Mechagodzilla.This is easily one of the best Godzilla Films. The whole idea of Godzilla fighting his Mechanical double is a great idea. Godzilla looks good in this film not the best costume or the worst. BUt it definitely looks better than the one that had been used in four straight films starting with Destroy All Monsters and going up till Godzilla vs Gigan. Godzilla is pretty much a good guy but he more or less is just trying to save the planet he lives on. He does not leave monster island just to come and save humanity like he does in Godzilla vs Megalon and Godzilla vs Gigan.Mechagodzilla is one of Godzilla's greatest foes. Probably second to only King Ghidorah. Mechagodzilla is extremely powerful and has an immense supply of weaponry. Rainbow ray in his eyes flamethrower in his mouth missiles in his fingers cutting ray in his chest and he can fly around like a rocket. Also one thing I never got was when Mechagodzilla is disguised as Godzilla he shoots a yellow laser out of his mouth but then he never uses it again when he gets rid of his disguise. Also Mechagodzilla is a great hand to hand combat fighter in this film and really beats up King Caesar using karate like moves.King Caesar is in this film for his first appearance. He is a sort of hairy Japanese dragon type dog monster. He is OK not that cool.Anguirus makes a brief appearance and battles Mechagodzilla when he is disguised as Godzilla. This is one of the most one sided brutal fights in Godzilla history. It does not go well at all for Anguirus.The monster fight scenes are good in this film. YOu really get to see how powerful Mechagodzilla is and seemingly nothing can stop him.One complaint though. After Mechagodzilla is damaged and has to be repaired you really have to wait a while until you see another monster part. This may be the longest gap of time you have to wait between monster parts in Godzilla history. But it is worth the wait.The SImians are a great group of villains from another planet. One of the best along with the Xians. Also acting in general is great. An interesting thing is that the actor who played the professor in this film was also the guy who created the Oxygen Destroyer in Godzilla King of the MOnsters.One more thing the music is awesome. This is one of the best Godzilla Films. Mechagodzilla is a great villain and one of the best monsters from the Godzilla series. Lots of great monster action. This is one that I highly recommend.".

	onyx:emotionText "After the making of Godzilla's Revenge Godzilla vs Gigan and Godzilla vs Megalon it appeared that the Godzilla Films were in a downward spiral in the late sixties and early seventies. But when Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla was made another great Godzilla film resulted.An old Japanese profit reveals that when the sun rises the wrong way or something that a monster will come to destroy the Earth. A professor guy has someone break into his house to try and steal a statue that he owns that resembles the god like Monster King Caesar. Later some humans find Space Titanium near a mountain. When the sun rises wrong Godzilla appears attacks Anguirus brutally and then goes on a rampage of Japan. Then another GOdzilla appears. One of the Godzillas is revealed to really be a cyborg made of Space Titanium. A Mechagodzilla. Mechagodzilla gets rid of his disguise and takes down Godzilla with an array of weaponry. But Mechagodzilla has problems with his head and has to return to the base where the Simians that are controlling him are located. The simians capture a professor and force him to repair Mechagodzilla. Another prophecy reveals that one day two monsters will come to save the Earth. Using the statue of King Caesar people open up a Mountain and the monster King Caesar comes out to battle Mechagodzilla but loses badly. However Godzilla reappears it is now evident that Godzilla and King Caesar are the two monsters that will save the Earth from Mechagodzilla.This is easily one of the best Godzilla Films. The whole idea of Godzilla fighting his Mechanical double is a great idea. Godzilla looks good in this film not the best costume or the worst. BUt it definitely looks better than the one that had been used in four straight films starting with Destroy All Monsters and going up till Godzilla vs Gigan. Godzilla is pretty much a good guy but he more or less is just trying to save the planet he lives on. He does not leave monster island just to come and save humanity like he does in Godzilla vs Megalon and Godzilla vs Gigan.Mechagodzilla is one of Godzilla's greatest foes. Probably second to only King Ghidorah. Mechagodzilla is extremely powerful and has an immense supply of weaponry. Rainbow ray in his eyes flamethrower in his mouth missiles in his fingers cutting ray in his chest and he can fly around like a rocket. Also one thing I never got was when Mechagodzilla is disguised as Godzilla he shoots a yellow laser out of his mouth but then he never uses it again when he gets rid of his disguise. Also Mechagodzilla is a great hand to hand combat fighter in this film and really beats up King Caesar using karate like moves.King Caesar is in this film for his first appearance. He is a sort of hairy Japanese dragon type dog monster. He is OK not that cool.Anguirus makes a brief appearance and battles Mechagodzilla when he is disguised as Godzilla. This is one of the most one sided brutal fights in Godzilla history. It does not go well at all for Anguirus.The monster fight scenes are good in this film. YOu really get to see how powerful Mechagodzilla is and seemingly nothing can stop him.One complaint though. After Mechagodzilla is damaged and has to be repaired you really have to wait a while until you see another monster part. This may be the longest gap of time you have to wait between monster parts in Godzilla history. But it is worth the wait.The SImians are a great group of villains from another planet.

	schema:headline " One of Godzilla's greatest movies.";
	schema:reviewBody "Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla or Godzilla vs The Cosmic Monster despite what many fans of Godzilla say this is one of his greatest films. The movie revolves around 2 main themes one centering on an ancient prophecy that says a monster will appear to destroy the world and that 2 others will come to save it. This will all lead up to the introduction of a new monster King Caesar not one of Toho's best. But as always the other story is that of aliens that want to take over the earth and have now constructed the ultimate weapon to do it...Mechagodzilla.One by one the prophecies come true and the cast finds out that ape faced Space aliens from the 3rd planet from the black hole are behind the whole thing. Mechagodzilla rampages through Japan beating Anguirus and then confronting Godzilla in what's become one of Godzilla's most famous scenes of them trading there own ray weapons culminating in a huge explosion. Godzilla appears to lose but Mechagodzilla is revealed under his fake skin. Eventually the Heroes along with some interpol agents James bond types recover the statue of King Caesar and awaken him to do battle with Mechagodzilla. Caesar gets thrashed but is saved by a newly revived Godzilla with magnetic powers and in a titanic and bloody fight destroys Mechagodzilla. Godzilla goes back to monster island Caesar goes back to sleep and the aliens base is destroyed before they return in the next film. In Godzilla's 2nd to last outing in the 70's Mechagodzilla is introduced and becomes one of Godzilla's strongest enemies and best created characters ever. This is by far a superior movie than the lackluster and badly made 93' version. Although the story is a bit of the same Alien invasion thing it really makes very little difference. Its very entertaining and more on the serious side rather then what he had been years before watching out for his kid and jumping around like and idiot. King Caesar is a bit of a let down. The lion guardian of Okinawa is built up throughout the movie but in the end fails to really bring anything new to the table. Not to say that I hate Caesar but he's not the greatest. Anguirus is also brought out for his last appearance to this day but unfortunately does not do well in the movie. Jun Fukuda directed this one along with a handful of other Godzilla movies that have been widely hammered by Godzilla Fans. Fukuda does an excellent job with the amount of money that Toho was willing to give the Godzilla franchise at the time. All of the fight seen were well done and for the most part did not look to cheesee. With regards to the special effects Teruyoshi Nakano also did a fine job on the budget and for the time. This is by far the best Godzilla suit of the Showa series that would also be used in the sequel to this. A bit stupid would have to be the ape faced aliens. I'm sure you will get a few laughs from them. Be warned though this is probably the bloodiest of the Godzilla films to be made which also added to the more serious view of the movie rather then it being for kids. Although the actors to me usually take a back seat to the monsters in these films I was always impressed with the cast in this. The secret agent type stuff that goes on is a bit funny considering they couldn't have made Agent Nanbara stand out anymore if they tried. I have been watching this movie probably since 1985 and have never grown tired of it and still think its one of his greatest films. Overall as a huge Godzilla fan I have to give this a 1010.".

Don't get me wrong I love the original 1954 classic as well as The Return of Godzilla 1984 but this is still the best. The reason Mechagodzilla makes his first appearance and though we have had at least five different versions of Mechagodzilla this design is still the best.A woman has a prophecy that when a black cloud appears a huge monster will arrive to destroy the world however when the sun sets two monsters will appear to fight the evil monster and save the world. Meanwhile Godzilla appears from the mountain and goes on a rampage and absolutely hammers poor Anguirus in a brutal and bloody fight. From there Godzilla wreaks havoc on the power plant and it is from here we understand that this Godzilla is not what he seems. Sure enough the real Godzilla appears and fights with the imposter who then transforms to Mechagodzilla controlled by aliens from outer space.Both Godzilla and Mechagodzilla shoot their beams at each other and basically knock each other out big time. Godzilla is thought to be dead because of the heavy blood loss while Mechagodzilla's mechanics are damaged and needs to be fixed. I won't carry on if you haven't seen it but rest assured the finale is brilliant.As mentioned this is my favourite of all Godzilla movies not only is it action packed the human side story is engaging and the aliens which we later find out are apes are menacing. Also Mechagodzilla to me is easily Godzilla's most powerful foe sorry King Ghidorah and the finale will have you covering your eyes in horror as you will think that Godzilla will meet his end.If you enjoy this I recommend you watch the sequel Terror of Mechagodzilla.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll be fair and say that after the dismal Godzilla vs. Megalon 1973 longtime series director Jun Fukuda's Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla 1974 was a welcome returntoform for the thenfledgling Godzilla series of films of the Showa Era. For the longest time Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla in my opinion I believed was one of the best films of the Showa series and I still believe that.In this film the Simians apelike aliens from a distant galaxy similar to ours have their eyes set on Earth's destruction. To accomplish this task they've built the cyborg monster Mechagodzilla. Of course much like the Terminator cyborg Mechagodzilla appears wearing a rubber disguise of the real Godzilla. Soon enough the real Godzilla does appear and unmasks his robotic doppelganger revealing the creature in all its shiny space titanium glory.Mechagodzilla is unique amongst Toho kaiju monsters because it is the only monster in any incarnation of the character to ever actually come close to actually killing the great King of the Monsters. Yes that's right. Godzilla actually comes pretty close to biting the big one in no due part to his heavily armed heavily armored mechanical twin nemesis Lord knows Godzilla does bleed enough during his final confrontation with Mechagodzilla to warrant a young one to cover their eyes in horror at Our Monster Hero bleeding profusely during battle with an enemy that may just send him to his maker. I don't believe any other monster has ever come close to accomplishing this task not even the monster Destoroyah from 1995's Godzilla vs. Destoroyah. But Godzilla does have some help here mostly in the form of longtime ally Anguirus who throws the humans onto the evil aliens' plot and series newcomer King Caesar a monstergod of Okinawan origin that is an awkward combination of a dog and a lion.A lot of people will comment about the special effects here which are flawed indeed due to Toho's welldocumented financial troubles in the early 1970s. But that doesn't stop the fact that Godzilla vs. Mechagodziila does have some of the best pyrotechnic effects of any film from the Showa series. I'm talking about when Godzilla and Mechagodzilla first fight at the oil refinery to Godzilla's shocking return to Monster Island where he recharges after said fight and the final threeway showdown between Godzilla Mechagodzilla and King Caesar in Okinawa.Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla is still one of my favorites though despite its flaws. It features a key supporting role from the late great longtime Godzilla actor Akihiko Hirata as Professor Miyajimi he first appeared as the tortured Dr. Serizawa in the original 1954 Godzilla who is kidnapped and forced by the aliens to help repair Mechagodzilla after the monster's head controls are damaged during its initial confrontation with Godzilla. There's also a lot of James Bondlike intrigue thrown into the plot amongst various other elements from American spy movies which were incredibly popular at the time and allow the film to flow at an incredibly rapid pace. This movie also has one of the most beautiful and exotic scores by Masaru Satoh of any film from the Showa series largely because it makes good use of the alternating mainland JapanOkinawan locations in the story.Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla was followed by a direct sequel titled Terror of Mechagodzilla one year later in 1975 which would mark the end of the first generation of Godzilla pictures before Godzilla 1985 1984 marked the rebirth of the King of the Monsters for the Heisei series of films and he was once again returned to his roots as a fearsome rampaging menace.610".

Her biological parents were young architects who had been disappeared for criticizing the political regime of the time. The judge directs her to live with her biological grandmother and new family.

Played with an extraordinary gravity by the luminous Barbara Lombardo the young girl meets others like herself and arrives at shocking truths which it would be wrong to reveal here. Given the documentary aspects of the film it addresses an ongoing unresolved situation where thousands of young adults born during this tumultuous period of Argentine history continue to search for their birth parents it goes beyond being just a political thriller.

	schema:reviewBody "A political film in the higher sense of the term it made me put into question many beliefs I had on my country. Isn't this one of the highest functions of Art!? What I liked most is that although it obviously has an agenda I don't think they fall for defending a political thesis at all costs. Such a common mistake of Argentine cinema on the desaparecidos... It's not without defects thou. A bit black and white stereotyped characters. Let me elaborate the left wingers seem to have no defects AT ALL they're full of love and high principles. And the rednecks are unlawful liers violent hypocritical and even ...ugly! They could also take bribes to have all vices... I mean yes characters could be more nuanced but given the low average of reality in most other films of the genre I think this one deserves accolades. Some humour in any way would have helped I guess. Just a personal opinion. Is there any worse thing than what happens here? I can't think of more than one murder in all its forms. I think even rape is less bad! Before turning this into a moral philosophy let me point at the scenes I liked most 1 When Sofa and her expressive Spanish friend have this important talk about life surrounded by soccer. Now as before quenching everything that matters. The paralelism is challenger indeed! 2 Having Ives's The unanswered question as a musical score when... I can't say more! 3 Final scene aerial take Handel? 4 The shower scene between the two now women naked in more than one sense 5 The brawl between the Quadris and Sofia. An one moment Pablo starts treating Sofia as a stranger almost an enemy. Suddenly her dear daughter Cristina is dead even before he hits her. maybe a bit predictable I guess 6 you may laugh The nightmare. It made me realize true horror is not what Hollywood sells us it's opening a door into the unknown in her grandma's or aunt's house and finding a glimpse of a life frozen in time her dead mother's. The film luckily avoids many pitfalls. Has only one very unbelievable moment when a nun's teen escapes from Tribunales from the same savvy cops who reduce the also hard boiled Pablo Quadri. Tribunales' zone is very WELL FILMED feels absolutely real to somebody like me who's hanged around there very often. Retiro the trains both schools... It's a very Argentine film! By the way found it great how she downgraded economically from her rather posh house in the suburbs to her grandma's dark old house  derelict Citroen! The contrast between the nun's school which is not luxurious but looks like when compared to the truly depressing state school! I was surprised about the performances! Have to say I didn't expect much from this film for a I don't like Argentine cinema b the subject is normally a sign of a tsunami of clichs c didn't have much faith in Lombardero. When I saw Hugo Arana I feared the worst  I had to gulp my prejudices they both acted surprisingly subduedly without overemphasis. I had my lesson they taught it to me. I would have liked to know what was being played during the film I loved the usage of classical music throughout the film not in just a couple of broken scenes. My kudos to the director of whom I knew nothing and who thanks IMDb! has been a sound editor in mainstream American cinema! Well I hope he continues to surprise us!".

	schema:headline " The Continuing Mystery of Argentina's 'Desaparecidos'";
	schema:reviewBody "CAUTIVA 'Captive' is a very effective film by young writerdirector Gaston Biraben who has taken to task the impact of Argentina's 'Dirty War' of the late 1970s and succeeds in making a very personal story out of the horror of the 'desaparecidos' tragedy that stole from Argentina some of its brightest minds  and 'reassigned' the children of these 'disappeared ones' who were born in the prisons to political friends of the dictatorship. While the concept is gruesome as history and as content Biraben manages to recreate that terrifying period of time in terms of the present. This retrospective study makes a huge impact.Cristina Quadri the deeply impressive Brbara Lombardo lives with her parents in Buenos Aires attending a Catholic girls' school seemingly a happy young teenager. One regular day she is called to the principal's office and told she must visit a judge a frightening concept for a young girl who is forced to go without informing her parents. The judge informs her that she is not 'Cristina Quadri' but instead 'Sofa Lombardi' the daughter of a couple who 'disappeared' in 1978 as political prisoners. A recent blood test CristinaSofia thought was a followup for a postop check was actually a test to match her blood with that of the newly discovered true parents' family. Cristina stunned by her lack of true identity confronts her 'adopted parents' and struggles with the officials who insist she be returned to her blood relatives. Cristina becomes close to another 'adopted' girl and the two explore their roots finding that they were born in prisons and then given to police officials to be placed in homes. The transition from adopted to blood family is the path the film explores despite the comforts of present life the girls must know their origins to fully realize their identities.The cast is uniformly strong the concept of the film works well as Biraben snaps us back and forth between the World Cup Soccer Game in Buenos Aires in 1978 that contrasts so gravely with the concurrent underground disappearance of the intellects of the country and the performance by Lombardo holds the credibility of the story well. There is a fine music score by Jos Luis Castieira de Dios that combines a suite for cello and piano with elements from Mozart's Requiem very effectively. This film has been awarded many prizes since its appearance in 2003 the prizes are justly deserved. Highly recommended viewing. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Cautiva 2005Set in a period about ten years before its release but dealing with issues of the Argentine dictatorship and disappearances from the late 1970s this is a remarkably realistic and important look at one girl's astonishing involvement with the worst of it.And if it sometimes is terribly linear in its storytelling following this girl's realizations one after another and her emotional burden as it grows and grows the movie is still so convincing and sad and filled with national Argentine guilt it is totally riveting. Anyone interested in the horrors of Latin American dictatorships left and right wing and in the victims and survivors this is a mustsee.Anyone else just interested in the plight of a single sixteen year old girl in a whirlwind of suspicions and lies and a few seemingly tender sympathizers and see her cope and rise above and maybe in fact find a small amount of truth for herself this is also really rewarding. You might find parallels in similar South American films such as Machuca but there is also a weird resemblance to many touching holocaust films that center on the plight of children whose identities get changed and whose histories are disrupted. Not to mention the tragedy of parents killed by cruel governments.The filming here is really good but never something you'd notice except one brief dream scene. What you will notice is the gravity and depth of the lead girl's performance. Barbara Lombardo was only 14 for filming unlike a lot of movies where older girls play younger parts and she alone makes the movie poignant and serious.Oddly this is officially a 2005 movie with its original Spanish title and yet it gets listed here as Captive with a 2004 date. There is a lot left unsaid here but in a way that's sufficient. It makes you want more.".

You might find parallels in similar South American films such as Machuca but there is also a weird resemblance to many touching holocaust films that center on the plight of children whose identities get changed and whose histories are disrupted. Not to mention the tragedy of parents killed by cruel governments.The filming here is really good but never something you'd notice except one brief dream scene. What you will notice is the gravity and depth of the lead girl's performance. Barbara Lombardo was only 14 for filming unlike a lot of movies where older girls play younger parts and she alone makes the movie poignant and serious.Oddly this is officially a 2005 movie with its original Spanish title and yet it gets listed here as Captive with a 2004 date. There is a lot left unsaid here but in a way that's sufficient. It makes you want more.";

Christina attends a Catholic school and enjoys all of the privileges of an upper middle class existence until one day she is called from class to meet a federal judge who informs her that as a result of DNA testing it has been determined that her real name is Sofia Lombardi and those who raised her from birth are not her real parents. There are several elements in this film that raise it above the typical entry in the young person searching for their real parents genre. For one thing ChristinaSofia's plight is not the result of such things as mistaken identities at birth adoption or insemination by way of a sperm bank but rather a willful act of what amounts to a governmentapproved kidnapping. For another thing Sofia's parents did not die in some accident or suffer some early natural death but rather were killed as dissidents during the dictatorial rule in the 197683 era.The bulk of the film deals with Sofia's coming to terms with her real identity and her search for the grim details of her parents' fate. She is spurred on in her investigative endeavors by her friend Anglica who is in a similar situation. That aspect of the film plays out as a detective story. I wish we could have gotten to know Sofia's real family better than we do so as to better understand her ultimate decision to accept them.Brbara Lombardo as ChristinaSofia is well cast. She has the ability to communicate emotion through facial expression but is also able to rise to the occasion when venting her frustration and anger in a verbal attack on her wouldbe parents. The entire cast is good but I was particularly impressed with Mercedes Funes who plays Anglica. Funes expertly captures the sadness and defiance of a young woman who has been forced to deal with unpleasant realities and demands to know the truth.There is little doubt about director Gaston Biraben's political intent to expose the malignity and corruption of a repressive regime and it is a testament to his art as a filmmaker and the power of filmmaking in general that he accomplishes his goal by focusing on the personal rather than the historical. As an nonArgentinian this movie encouraged me to do some research and I came away from it with historical knowledge I would otherwise not have hadyou cannot say that about many films.".

A recent rewatching on DVD really served to bring home for me what makes this film so special.The whole thing is quite good but it really hits you when Howard goes off to celebrate with the Indians leaving Dobbs and Curtin to care for his gold and burros. The ensuing scenes of their spiraling mistrust and tension are absolutely spellbindingthe kind of thing that makes you lean forward in your seat just to get your eyes a little closer to the raw humanity unfolding in front of you. Their paranoia the way you can SEE scenarios of betrayal dancing in their eyes Dobbs' burgeoning madnessthese are the moments that make this film one for the ages.At its best film noir which this most certainly isWestern surroundings or no makes the viewer complicit in the evil depicted on screen. We find ourselves scheming and plotting in our heads along with the unsavory characters we are watchingwe start to feel the same temptations and desires that they do.

	onyx:emotionText "This film made a huge impression on me when I first saw it at the age of 15 or 16. A recent rewatching on DVD really served to bring home for me what makes this film so special.The whole thing is quite good but it really hits you when Howard goes off to celebrate with the Indians leaving Dobbs and Curtin to care for his gold and burros. The ensuing scenes of their spiraling mistrust and tension are absolutely spellbindingthe kind of thing that makes you lean forward in your seat just to get your eyes a little closer to the raw humanity unfolding in front of you. Their paranoia the way you can SEE scenarios of betrayal dancing in their eyes Dobbs' burgeoning madnessthese are the moments that make this film one for the ages.At its best film noir which this most certainly isWestern surroundings or no makes the viewer complicit in the evil depicted on screen. We find ourselves scheming and plotting in our heads along with the unsavory characters we are watchingwe start to feel the same temptations and desires that they do. Treasure of the Sierra Madre accomplishes this bond with the audience as well as any film you are likely to see.A magnificent filmone of the few great screen tragedies.";

It must have been a difficult task for him directing his own father in the movie. After all Walter Huston was a major star on his own right. Both father and son made a great contribution John behind the camera Walter in front of it.Basically the story is about men that have drifted into Mexico to escape jail or in search of riches as it was the case of the men that fate brings together in a Tampico shelter. Dobbs Howard and Curtin start out as partners searching for gold in the Sierra Madre. They find it but as luck will have it none of them will live to be rich from what they find in that remote place.In the most ironic of film endings this one will be a classic. After the trio finds gold greed sets in. Friendship turns sour and the three friends become enemies. When the bandits finally catch up with an exhausted Dobbs trying to go north they beat him up and discover some sacks full of sand....Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs is excellent. Of course Walter Huston made the best out of Howard the clever old man who has seen a lot in his life. He is the only one that discovers a happiness living the simple life among the friendly Mexicans that welcome him into their community. Finally Tim Holt as Curtin is perfectly cast as an honest man who has gone into the adventure without any expectations.The final sequence of Howard and the peasants riding their horses into the 'yellow dust' is amazing as it it incredible. In retrospect it seems to be telling us that sometimes dreams of becoming rich the easy way will not be sustained but honest work will be more rewarding.".

His knowledge of mining and the lifestyle it demands and forces upon those who partake is so thorough that Bogart and Holt seem like school kids in awe of a new hero. Of course we know that his son John did much research in preparation for writing the screenplay but we are nevertheless plunged into a sure belief that this old miner must surely have been there age upon age mine upon mine and has therefore a thousand tales to tell.When in the course of the story Walter is taken away somewhat without choice to work the magic of a healer for a Mexican village we are again convinced that he is a medical doctor hiding out as a prospector. This is the acting craft in full bloom. Walter becomes whatever is called for in the story. However if one views his other films the effect is the same. He is one of Hollywood's most under rated actors of all time. Those who have not seen this film have a joyous experience awaiting them. Great story great screenplay great acting.

The plot of the film is what happens to them when they find the gold they seek.The Treaure of the Sierra Madre is a film years ahead of its time for the stark realism it portrays. These are not classic movie heroes. I could see this film easily being remade today by some of our contemporary stars like Robert DeNiro Al Pacino Russell Crowe.It also has probably the most brutal bar fight ever put on film. Before going prospecting Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs and Tim Holt as Curtin go out on a construction job for Barton MacLane who stiffs them when it comes time to pay up. They catch up with him at a Tampico dive and administer a terrible beating to MacLane. This is not some western saloon fight this is probably one of the most realistic bar brawls ever filmed. I like to compare this film to The Oxbow Incident. In both cases stress and a crisis bring out the true characters in people. Tim Holt is a lot like Henry Fonda's character and Bogart would have definitely been found in the ranks of the lynchers.Bogart as Dobbs is probably someone who in civilized society is no better than what he can get away with. His descent into uncontrollable paranoia is frightening on the screen one of his best performances.Tim Holt who most of the time was content to star in B westerns for RKO shows what a capable player he is. In the flophouse scene look for an unbilled appearance by his father Jack Holt.Walter Huston capped a long career on the screen with the Best Supporting Actor Award for this film which also was the Best Picture of 1948. And son John Huston won his only Oscar for Best Director making Oscar night a banner occasion for the Huston family. Huston's character of Howard you can see playing sidekick in many a Hollywood western. That would be a superficial impression. Howard turns out to be a wise old man.The ending of what happens to the men and their acquired treasure in the Sierra Made mountains is something else. In a location far from civilization and far from law it's shown that the Almighty does have a wicked sense of humor.".

My eyes never strayed from the screen I couldn't take the risk of missing one second of this  tremendous adventuredrama film. Bogart played the character Fred C. Dobbs' so convincingly it doesn't surprise me though he was at his career peak. It was  like his portrayal of Lt. Comdr. Philip Francis Queeg'  in The Caine Mutiny'  surely no one would disagree he carried the part to it's limit. The B  W format gave an added depth and the direction by John Huston as usual was nothing more then what I would expect from an accredited director like him. I was amused to see a very young Robert Blake in the role of the boy selling lottery tickets and the brief appearance of Bruce Bennett as James Cody'. whom starred with Bogie in Sahara' several years prior. Another reliable support actor was  Alfonso Bedoya as Gold Hat' my fondest memory of any of his acting roles must be The Big Country' in 1958.Walter Huston stood out with his performance this was the first time I've had the privilege to watch him in a film role. His portrayal was astounding..and the script he had to work with was a treat to hear.Another funny point I want to point out I don't know why I kept comparing Tim Holt to John Derek. In some of the scenes his appearance and voice were so similar to Derek's it was uncanny. I'm probably the only one who thinks this but I can't dismiss the similarities to me anyway.The plot was an interesting one one that slowly draws you in until you can't stop watching.

The dialogue has little German touches in it. Traven surely lived in modest circumstances in Mexico the details and dynamics of rundown hotels being far too accurate to have been made up in a comfortable armchair.But it's not really important. Huston and his cast and crew have turned the novel into a movie that is as good as anything likely to show up on the screen. It's an astounding achievement. I can't even begin to list the moments that stamp themselves indelibly into one's memory but I will mention one just en passant so to speak. After killing his partner and friend Bogart lies down next to a fire and tries to go to sleep. He talks to himself dismissively about conscience and how it only bothers you if you let it and the fake sulfurous fire blazes up higher and higher between the actor and the camera until he seems to be consumed by the flame.Alfonso Bedoya. He made a few other movies but nothing resembling this one. What lines he is given! Aww come on. Throw that old iron over here.There's a good business for Jew. And the unforgettable batcheswhich doesn't need repeating.It is surely one of Huston's best films. A lesser director could have ruined the novel's plot. But Huston adds his own touches. Cody is killed shot through the neck and the old man reads a letter from his wife retrieved from Cody's pocket. But  he doesn't know how to read big words!So Curtin takes the letter and reads it. It's not just a directorial flash in the pan because the scene resonates at the end of the movie when Curtin rides off to meet Cody's wife in the blossomblooming peach orchard. What I mean is that the letterreading scene is there for a larger purpose than simply adding to our appreciation of the characters at that particular moment. The fight with Pat in the cantina. Absolutely nothing happens the way it had always happened in previous movies. Huston stages it in a way that an artist would think of. In all movies before this one fights involved 1 a general melee in which no one wins or loses or 2 one clip on the jaw and the guy is unconscious. Here MacCormack the heavy done very nicely by Barton Maclaine abruptly bashes one guy over the head with a bottle of booze and socks the other one. Both victims crumple. But somebody grabs Pat's legs as he walks towards the door. More blows. Bodies slump to the floor and they have a hell of a time getting back up on their feet. More blows. Pat is finally beaten to the floor and he's not unconscious. Okay. Enough fellas. I'm beat. I can't see. Bogart and Tim Holt take only the money that is owing to them and Curtin Holt comes up with Let's beat it before the law arrives. Before the law arrives. That's straight out of Traven's novel and is one of the reasons people believe he wasn't that familiar with the English language. Not that it doesn't fit  but the use of arrives is just a tad formal.I could go on listing one scene after another that is simply outstanding. I watched this repeatedly with my ten year old kid Josh who finally memorized almost every word of the script. I showed it in classes in psychology at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina as an almost flawless depiction of an ego defense mechanism called projection. The Marines loved it. I loved it. My kid loved it. John Simon loved it. Rush Limbaugh loved it. Martha Stewart loved it. Rachel Maddow loved it. Napoleon Bonaparte loved it. Moses loved it. Lenin loved it. St. Peter when not attending the pearly gates watches it on cable TV. No commercials. Everybody loves it  and for good reasons.".

Cody is killed shot through the neck and the old man reads a letter from his wife retrieved from Cody's pocket. But  he doesn't know how to read big words!So Curtin takes the letter and reads it. It's not just a directorial flash in the pan because the scene resonates at the end of the movie when Curtin rides off to meet Cody's wife in the blossomblooming peach orchard. What I mean is that the letterreading scene is there for a larger purpose than simply adding to our appreciation of the characters at that particular moment. The fight with Pat in the cantina. Absolutely nothing happens the way it had always happened in previous movies. Huston stages it in a way that an artist would think of. In all movies before this one fights involved 1 a general melee in which no one wins or loses or 2 one clip on the jaw and the guy is unconscious. Here MacCormack the heavy done very nicely by Barton Maclaine abruptly bashes one guy over the head with a bottle of booze and socks the other one. Both victims crumple. But somebody grabs Pat's legs as he walks towards the door. More blows. Bodies slump to the floor and they have a hell of a time getting back up on their feet. More blows. Pat is finally beaten to the floor and he's not unconscious. Okay. Enough fellas. I'm beat. I can't see. Bogart and Tim Holt take only the money that is owing to them and Curtin Holt comes up with Let's beat it before the law arrives. Before the law arrives. That's straight out of Traven's novel and is one of the reasons people believe he wasn't that familiar with the English language. Not that it doesn't fit  but the use of arrives is just a tad formal.I could go on listing one scene after another that is simply outstanding. I watched this repeatedly with my ten year old kid Josh who finally memorized almost every word of the script. I showed it in classes in psychology at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina as an almost flawless depiction of an ego defense mechanism called projection. The Marines loved it. I loved it. My kid loved it. John Simon loved it. Rush Limbaugh loved it. Martha Stewart loved it. Rachel Maddow loved it. Napoleon Bonaparte loved it. Moses loved it. Lenin loved it. St. Peter when not attending the pearly gates watches it on cable TV. No commercials. Everybody loves it  and for good reasons.";

The trio make a PAC to share and share alike all the treasure they find. However only Howard is aware of what the possession of Gold can do to a man. To find the treasure they need the mountain some hard work a little luck. To bring it home will require something only one of them possesses. The film is a Classic and is due to the combined talents of all the stars and the director. If you look closely you'll see Robert Blake Barreta and John Huston in brief roles. ".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those great old movies that is worth a repeat viewing every now and again in a person's life. Sure much of the acting and dialog have gotten corny and dated over the years and I agree with one of the previous commenters who said that Bogart's acting seems very forced  like he's obviously just reading lines from script. Be that as it may the story that is told here is every bit as important and thought provoking as something from the Bible. Throughout the film there is a spoton wisdom about man and his endless quest for wealth in this case gold. I always come away from this movie feeling secure in my belief that in life you just can't have it all and all that glitters is not gold i.e. there are things in life more important than money.Since this movie was largely about lost fortunes literally dust in the wind if you think about the end sequence it must have made quite an impression on audiences back in the forties when it was released. I'm sure more than a few viewers back then still had painful memories of catastrophic losses caused by the 1929 stock market crash and the ensuing Depression of the 1930's. Also many people lost a lot in the war years that followed and which predated this movie by just a few years.That's why I think this movie qualifies for repeat viewings because just think how appropriate this wisdom is for our current generation of people just consider the losses from say the stock market crash of 2000 the events of September 11th and of course we just witnessed the horrific losses caused by the Asian tsunami... the cycle repeats. Fortunes come and go gold is often times nothing but dust in the wind but life goes on and so man must go on. That's what this movie says to me whenever I see it.".

	schema:headline " Extraordinary and marvelously performed film about a grizzled hustler decides to join with other prospectors to find gold";
	schema:reviewBody "Magnificent rendition of B. Traven's story of ambition and human nature at its worst and dealing with an unlikely trio of ambitious prospectors . As Fred Dobbs Humphrey Bogart and Bob Curtin Tim Holt  two Americans searching for work in Mexico convince an old prospector Walter Huston to help them mine for gold in the Sierra Madre Mountains . Through a lot of troubles they eventually succeed in finding gold but greedy outlaws Alfonso Bedoya  and most especially craziness lead to disaster . As they sold their souls for the treasure of the Sierra Madre . It's an intelligent semiwestern that scrutinizes the greed and paranoia that afflicts a misfit group  including their enormous difficulties and breathtaking taking on between protagonists and the Mexican enemies that stalk to them . The film blends thrills  emotion  intrigue  high bodycount and it's fast moving and exciting  being filmed in Mexico though Warners' studio head Jack L. Warner had the unit return to Hollywood when the budget started to exceed 3 million . Thoughtprovoking screenplay by the same Huston  concerning about greed and ambition that threaten to turn their success into disaster . Director John Huston had read the book by B. Traven in 1936 and had always thought the material would make a great movie . Based on a 19thcentury ballad by a German poet  Traven's book reminded Huston of his own adventures in the Mexican cavalry . When Huston became a director at Warner Bros.  the smashing success of his initial effort The Maltese Falcon 1941 gave him the clout to ask to write and direct the project for which Warner Bros had previously secured the movie rights . Although by many to be director John Huston's finest film  this is a tale of fear  greed and murder  as three partners fall out over the gold they have clawed out of the inhospitable and banditridden deserts and mountains . It also has probably the most brutal gold bar fight ever put on film along with The Ruthless Four . Overrated by some reviewers  but very interesting and attractive to watch . It above all things mostly also remains a real characters movie in which the three main roles are the essentials . Their dynamic together is also great and is what mostly keeps this movie going . They are three totally different characters which is the foremost reason why they work out so great together on film . Bogart is superbly believable and gives a nice portrait of an increasingly unhinged prospector  Walter Huston is very good as a cunning veteran and Tim Holt is also pretty well . John Huston has a cameo as an American tourist  this scene was directed by Humphrey Bogart who took malicious pleasure on his director by making him perform the scene over and over again. And the little boy who sells Bogart the portion of the winning lottery ticket is Robert Blake . The bum seated near Walter Huston in the first scene in the Oso Negro flophouse is Jack Holt father of Tim Holt . Walter Huston father of director John Huston won the Academy Award for best supporting actor  John won for best direction . This was the first fatherson win . The musician Max Steiner composes a vibrant soundtrack and well conducted  including a catching leitmotif and considered to be one of the best . Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors  dirty landscapes under sunny exteriors and a glimmer sun and fine sets with striking cinematography by Ted McCord  this was one of the first American films to be made almost entirely on location outside the USA . Also shown in computercolored version . The picture was shot on location in Tampico Mexico  just as John Huston was starting to shoot scenes in the production was shut down inexplicably by the local government  it turns out that a local newspaper printed a false story that accused the filmmakers of making a production that was unflattering to Mexico . Fortunately two of Huston's associates Diego Rivera and Miguel Covarrubias went to bat for the director with the President of Mexico  then the libelous accusations were dropped . The motion picture was stunningly realized by John Huston and the film took 512 months to shoot and was 29 days over schedule  Robert Rossen submitted at least nine drafts of rewrites on the screenplay when John Huston was away during the war . Rating  Above average . Well worth watching  essential and indispensable seeing . In 2007 The American Film Institute ranked this as the 38 Greatest Movie of All Time.".

The use of lighting is painterly in a way that is almost impossible to achieve in black and white  particularly in the scene in the peasant village which looks almost biblical. Huston also has this unique style of framing whereby he uses figures in the foreground and background to give the effect of a closeup and a midshot simultaneously. It's a look that is totally at odds with anything else produced in Hollywood at that time.Actor wise Treasure of the Sierra Madre turns the clock back to the 1930s putting the director's father Walter Huston in a starring role and casting Humphrey Bogart as a seedy villain. The cast is rounded off by the toolittleseen Tim Holt. All three of them are spot on. The spry old prospector is a role Huston senior seems to have been waiting to play all his life. Bogart is also great playing the sort of character he made his name with a decade earlier. Also worth a mention is Mexican actor Alfonso Bedoya who gives what is for this era an incredibly naturalistic performance as the bandit leader.Huston's forte was in his cinematography his shot composition and the rhythm of his films not so much in his handling of action or actors which is why his pictures tend to be a bit hit and miss. This one is a hit though thanks to the strength of its story and the quality of the cast not to mention Huston's persistence for authenticity.

	schema:reviewBody "A brutal and uncompromising portrayal of greed's effects on the human spirit and an exhilarating quest of the Mexican El Dorado the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. You'll be thrilled by John Huston's masterpiece a genuine monument that would catch by surprise even the most skeptical viewers when it comes to 'old' movies.The Sierra Madre was the first major studios films set outside Hollywood in Mexico when even the most acclaimed masterpieces didn't raise such a level of authenticity in their exotic setting like in Casablanca when Captain Renault refers to the titular town as the middle of the desert. The geography in Huston's film is crucial as it provides the obligatory escapism for any adventure film with a unique flavor. In Sierra Madre we get the same authentic feeling that probably inspired Clouzot's Wages of Fear with the proverbial financial struggle of the white men in South America. There's almost the same criticism of capitalism that prevailed in B. Travel's novel as these men have been purely and totally exploited by the capitalistic majors that literally raped Mexico from its precious resources.Huston's movie is less politically loaded but it portrayed capitalism in a negative light through the downfall and total disintegration of its main character Humphrey Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs. Bogie after having been a gangster a private eye a cynical detached and sometimes romantic lead probably gives one of his best performances as a big s.o.b. And how he didn't get a nomination is unbelievable. His evolution from a decent man who wants a job and some money to the coldblooded paranoid lunatic who tries to keep the gold for himself is not only fascinating but also mirrors the evolution of the film from a lighthearted mood made of some comedic running gags like the encounters with Huston as the rich man in a white suit to a heartpounding thriller.And on that very level the differences between the characters set the perfect circumstances for tension despite the many signs of camaraderie displayed in the beginning. Curtin Tim Holt in a remarkable performance is younger and exudes a certain idealistic naivet that counterbalances Dobbs' growing cynicism. Howard the oldtime prospector an unforgettable Walter Huston knows everything about prospecting with enough experience to foresee the psychological changes on people when gold is at stakes. Of course the movie is also remembered for the famous 'Gold Hat' Alfonso Bedoya with his unforgettable stinking badges line but more than an exotic villain Bedoya foreshadows with a sort of charming charisma the evolution of Dobbs as a similar bastard.Indeed one never knows how gold would transform us and one must have the guts to work alone without falling into madness. During their journey guided by Howard Dobbs and Curtin discover the true meaning of the word 'value' as measurable through the efforts you spend days and nights to find the treasure. Walter Huston deservedly won the Oscar for best supporting character but he's as central as Vito Corleone in The Godfather. Whatever Howard says we know it's the truth when he's reluctant we understand it's a bad premonition. And when Howard esteems that the best would be to split the share when it becomes money Dobbs already showing signs of suspicion recommends that each one takes care of his own share. Howard is experimented enough to resign with all the wisdom of a man who doesn't want trouble.Dobbs' gradual descent into paranoid madness is highlighted in the episode when a gila monster gets stuck under the rock that covered his share while he suspects Curtin to have come for another reason. The paranoia grows and contaminates the whole team when another American named Cody joins them and proposes his help. He's obviously smarter than them and doesn't deny that murdering him is an option they would consider. The way the team handled his proposal says a lot about the conservative instinct that could govern so called 'civilized' hearts and again doesn't speak in favor of the monopolistic systems regulated by capitalism. The alienation that grows within the team erodes all the camaraderie built during these months of labor to a point even the word 'partner' loses its humanistic meaning.Bogart perfectly embodied the metamorphosis of a man alienated by his own greed where the value of his share of gold exceeded every kind of principle that made him a decent man. As it's almost impossible to break free from a gila's bite Dobbs became that gila with paranoia as a venomous poison too mistrustful to go to let go or to be reasoned. When Curtin says he protected Howard's money as he would have done for Dobbs Dobbs uses the same reasoning in a reverse way pushing cynicism to its paroxysm  betraying before being betrayed. And in an ironic anticlimactic twist Dobbs is killed by bandits 15 minutes before the end of the film as to highlight the pointlessness of this entire struggle. After all what's the point of earning money if you lose principles? Failure is a recurrent theme in Huston's films with this double dimension of cynical denunciation generally driven by an impeccable script and this entertaining dimension that pleases the crowds as much as the more sophisticated audience both who matured enough by World War II accepted a story about greed and deception but maybe not Bogie so far from his usual character playing such an unsavory bastard. I don't know if like some said this is why the film's flopped. One thing for sure after 60 years it remains as one of the most enduring classics ever that beautifully earned a father and a son three deserved Oscars.And any other consideration is as pointless as crying over the loss of the Treasure of the Sierra Madre and the only reaction it deserves is the unique loud and hysterical jigdriven maniacal laugh of Walter Huston ".

But once the trio decides to quit digging the film deteriorates rapidly from then on farfetched and annoying plotdevices abound. For example the little episode where Huston Sr. heals a Mexican boy this entire scene was shot with too much pomp the superior white man cures the savage child while the entire village looks on with the village lights shimmering with a divine glow  all this accompanied by glorious Hollywood music. Silly. Then Huston is forced to stay with the villagers as their thanks for curing the boy John Huston uses an old clich of natives threatening to use force when their wishes for hospitality aren't met. A plotdevice I'd use only in a comicbook. A little later Bogart makes it crystalclear that he a has gone crazy and b will kill Holt to get all the gold. Holt in spite of this overwhelming evidence takes no other measure to deal with this dire situation other than to take Bogart's bullets away from him. Eventually Holt falls asleep and Bogart injures him thinking he had killed him. Now I don't care how noble Holt's character is supposed to be in this Tinseltown fairytale but there is no way in hell that Aany reasonable person would have not bumped off Bogart or at least tied him up or something like that.The film presents us with three golddiggers whose characterizations aren't bad but one of them is insane and evil while the other two are good and nice there is no inbetween no grey area just movie or comicbook stereotypes. Black and white. Huston Sr. is far too understanding and patient he gives his wiseoldman speeches on a regular basis but this is forgivable. However what isn't forgivable is the ease with which he takes the news that Bogart tried to kill Holt and took all the gold. Huston Sr. even shows UNDERSTANDING for why Bogart acted this way! Again Aany reasonable person would have been very upset to say the least  even the old man with his I'veseenitallbefore attitude. Makes one wonder who is more insane Bogart or the goodietwoshoes Holt and Huston Sr? At the end when no one gets the gold how very symbolic... Huston Sr. even laughs at the idea that they lost all of it! To make things even more annoying Holt joins in after staring at the old geezer in bewilderment.I find it ridiculous that the Mexican bandits who killed Bogart didn't recognize the gold they mistook it for sand and threw it away. But why would anyone carry dozens of bags of sand in the middle of a desert?! Huston would have us believe that Mexicans or Mexican bandits are this dumb. Not very PC...The kind of nonsense that takes place in the latter parts of this movie would never be tolerated in a modern movie by any critic good or bad. But old movies are like little children they get away with almost anything.I like Bogart much better when he isn't playing gangsters or detectives. However his portrayal of insanity is not without typical 30s and 40s touches of naivety this may be the director's fault not Bogart's especially in view of the fact that it was Huston who wrote or adapted those monologues that Bogart has when contemplating his next moves these scenes come off very comicbooklike with the difference that movies don't have balloons so Bogart had to speak his thoughts out loud. Holt is the most convincing in the cast. Huston Sr. is a motormouth actor who could have challenged even Cagney to a duel to find out who the fastest mouth in the West was. There were moments where I wished that Huston's machinegunfire linedeliveries had been subtitled. He is likable enough but occasionally acts in the sort of semisilly manner typical of the 30s 40s and 50s.The worst acting came from the character early in the film who didn't want to pay Bogart and Holt. Which brings me to the fight these three had in a bar this is one of the most strangely choreographed fightscenes I've ever seen. The fight looks totally unconvincing and lacks logic. But Huston is known for that just check out the silly fights in Across the Pacific.Perhaps Huston's overblown reputation has something to do with his largerthanlife persona. People say he looked and talked like God commanded respect. Unlike his movies that elicit unintentional laughs.If you're interested in reading my biographies of Bogart Huston and other Hollywood people contact me by email.".

	schema:headline " How 'bout some beans?";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by John Huston The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre stars Humphrey Bogart and Tim Hold as two down on their luck Americans struggling to make ends meet in rural Mexico. Upon learning that a nearby mountain contains gold the duo team up with a wise old timer and go in search of riches. Predictably Bogart falls under the spell of greed and descends into violent madness. The film's point material wealth makes you paranoid increasingly greedy and eventually corrupts the soul.Unsurprising for a John Huston flick a subtle socialist undercurrent runs throughout the picture. Bogart is oblivious to his own class status turning his back on those who struggle like him in favour for embracing the race for wealth. Instead of truly uniting himself with his partners developing a trusting mutually beneficial relationship Bogart sabotages everything with his paranoia and everymanforhimself ethos. So Bogart is essentially the ugliest incarnation of a popular American icon the rugged frontier iconoclast striking out on his own to make his fortune. Huston and B. Traven the author of the novel upon which the film is based also manage to turn the story into an anticapitalist antifascist adventure tome in which the greed and deviousness of human nature is juxtaposed with the psychological underpinnings of poverty and postrevolutionary politics on peasants and indigenous peoples. Like Huston who fraternised with communists in is youth Traven was an avowed leftist at one point a character in the film even quotes Marx applying Marx's labour theory of value to the search for gold and so the film must be read through the lens of the workers revolutionary movements of the era when the Soviet Union was more an ideal and less a corrupt manifestation of power.Huston made at least two films which defined their genres The Asphalt Jungle and The Maltese Falcon. Madre is equally influential everything from Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia to The Man Who Would Be King to The Wild Bunch to The Good The Bad And The Ugly to There Will Be Blood borrowing heavily from its pages. George Lucas even stole the look of Indiana Jones from Bogart's character. Indeed all 4 Indiana Jones movies are basically The Treasure of Sierra Madre with action scenes greed corrupting the souls of each film's villains.More interesting is the way Madre fits in with its subgenre of adventure stories. There have always been tales in which heroes go on quests to find grails gold treasures or magical things but for the most part these characters have all been looking for essentially the same mixture of wealth power knowledge dignity and individual freedom. In Madre though the quest for wealth is seen as being inherently negative. Nastily portrayed Bogart's gang evoke Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice Gekko and Bud in Wall Street or Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. Economist Friedrich Hayek noted this longstanding tendency to interpret the acquisition of wealth as being sinister Distrust and fear have long led ordinary people to regard wealth as being suspicious inferior dishonest and contemptible. Activities that appear to add to available wealth 'out of nothing' without physical creation and by merely rearranging what already exists stink of sorcery. That a mere change of hands should lead to a gain in value to all participants that it need not mean gain to one at the expense of the others was and is nonetheless intuitively difficult to grasp. Many people continue to find the mental feats associated with trade easy to discount even when they do not attribute them to sorcery or see them as depending on trick or fraud or cunning deceit.For Hayek it is not that greed is bad but that people are irrationally suspicious of the entrepreneurial skills required to acquire and create wealth. Hayek of course is the godfather of contemporary Neoliberalism spawned every evil from Thatcher to Reagan and has been thoroughly debunked by post neoclassical ecoeconomists. His stance which is how most vaguely and intuitively understand modern society a type of sorcery which denies physics energy flows and in which value is magically created and benefits everyone is ultimately an apologia for exploitation which ignores deep rooted systemic problems.The lesson put forth by art like Madre though is consistently the wrong one. Such art doesn't challenge our conceptions of wealth or the paradoxes of capitalism the physics of contemporary money is fundamentally unethical and creates indebtedness but simply warn us that too much is bad. The moral tone of all these tales is thus similar to how Spinoza famously reinterpreted the Bible. Because early people were primitive he says God's will took the form of a performative command Thou shalt not do so and so!. For the modern man however the way to grasp this is not through commands that appeal to authority but through a kind of scientific or objective constructive statement Thou shalt not smoke because thou shalt get cancer! which highlights a certain causality designed to keep excesses in check. And so modern man doesn't get orders any more. Instead commands are hidden in a universal form never spoken directly Smoke but nicotine is dangerous for your health Eat what you want but beware of cholesterol Money is great but too much corrupts. The whole world is now a mass of conflicting information food tins swamped with tables and charts detailing the levels of sugar fat salt etc. In our permissive society everything is available you can have whatever you want the world is yours but actually you better not touch anything. Everything is prohibited even though it's not.

	onyx:emotionText "Directed by John Huston The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre stars Humphrey Bogart and Tim Hold as two down on their luck Americans struggling to make ends meet in rural Mexico. Upon learning that a nearby mountain contains gold the duo team up with a wise old timer and go in search of riches. Predictably Bogart falls under the spell of greed and descends into violent madness. The film's point material wealth makes you paranoid increasingly greedy and eventually corrupts the soul.Unsurprising for a John Huston flick a subtle socialist undercurrent runs throughout the picture. Bogart is oblivious to his own class status turning his back on those who struggle like him in favour for embracing the race for wealth. Instead of truly uniting himself with his partners developing a trusting mutually beneficial relationship Bogart sabotages everything with his paranoia and everymanforhimself ethos. So Bogart is essentially the ugliest incarnation of a popular American icon the rugged frontier iconoclast striking out on his own to make his fortune. Huston and B. Traven the author of the novel upon which the film is based also manage to turn the story into an anticapitalist antifascist adventure tome in which the greed and deviousness of human nature is juxtaposed with the psychological underpinnings of poverty and postrevolutionary politics on peasants and indigenous peoples. Like Huston who fraternised with communists in is youth Traven was an avowed leftist at one point a character in the film even quotes Marx applying Marx's labour theory of value to the search for gold and so the film must be read through the lens of the workers revolutionary movements of the era when the Soviet Union was more an ideal and less a corrupt manifestation of power.Huston made at least two films which defined their genres The Asphalt Jungle and The Maltese Falcon. Madre is equally influential everything from Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia to The Man Who Would Be King to The Wild Bunch to The Good The Bad And The Ugly to There Will Be Blood borrowing heavily from its pages. George Lucas even stole the look of Indiana Jones from Bogart's character. Indeed all 4 Indiana Jones movies are basically The Treasure of Sierra Madre with action scenes greed corrupting the souls of each film's villains.More interesting is the way Madre fits in with its subgenre of adventure stories. There have always been tales in which heroes go on quests to find grails gold treasures or magical things but for the most part these characters have all been looking for essentially the same mixture of wealth power knowledge dignity and individual freedom. In Madre though the quest for wealth is seen as being inherently negative. Nastily portrayed Bogart's gang evoke Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice Gekko and Bud in Wall Street or Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. Economist Friedrich Hayek noted this longstanding tendency to interpret the acquisition of wealth as being sinister Distrust and fear have long led ordinary people to regard wealth as being suspicious inferior dishonest and contemptible. Activities that appear to add to available wealth 'out of nothing' without physical creation and by merely rearranging what already exists stink of sorcery. That a mere change of hands should lead to a gain in value to all participants that it need not mean gain to one at the expense of the others was and is nonetheless intuitively difficult to grasp. Many people continue to find the mental feats associated with trade easy to discount even when they do not attribute them to sorcery or see them as depending on trick or fraud or cunning deceit.For Hayek it is not that greed is bad but that people are irrationally suspicious of the entrepreneurial skills required to acquire and create wealth. Hayek of course is the godfather of contemporary Neoliberalism spawned every evil from Thatcher to Reagan and has been thoroughly debunked by post neoclassical ecoeconomists. His stance which is how most vaguely and intuitively understand modern society a type of sorcery which denies physics energy flows and in which value is magically created and benefits everyone is ultimately an apologia for exploitation which ignores deep rooted systemic problems.The lesson put forth by art like Madre though is consistently the wrong one. Such art doesn't challenge our conceptions of wealth or the paradoxes of capitalism the physics of contemporary money is fundamentally unethical and creates indebtedness but simply warn us that too much is bad. The moral tone of all these tales is thus similar to how Spinoza famously reinterpreted the Bible. Because early people were primitive he says God's will took the form of a performative command Thou shalt not do so and so!. For the modern man however the way to grasp this is not through commands that appeal to authority but through a kind of scientific or objective constructive statement Thou shalt not smoke because thou shalt get cancer! which highlights a certain causality designed to keep excesses in check. And so modern man doesn't get orders any more. Instead commands are hidden in a universal form never spoken directly Smoke but nicotine is dangerous for your health Eat what you want but beware of cholesterol Money is great but too much corrupts. The whole world is now a mass of conflicting information food tins swamped with tables and charts detailing the levels of sugar fat salt etc. In our permissive society everything is available you can have whatever you want the world is yours but actually you better not touch anything. Everything is prohibited even though it's not. Finding gold is great but it will royally mess up your life.Incidentally the film's downbeat climax is pure noir very much akin to the climaxes of Huston's Maltese and Asphalt. Huston would win Oscar's for directing and writing the film.8.910  Worth two viewings.";

These are all wonderful reasons to catch the film. For myself I find two in particular that stand out the first of which is the wonderfully observed carefully executed psychological journey on which the main character Fred Dobbs Bogart embarks when he and his buddy Bob Curtin Tim Holt decide to join old experienced goldprospector Howard Huston on a new prospecting trip. The changes in his character are gradual but shocking as he becomes increasingly more paranoid and suspicious of his partners. This is further complicated by the appearance on the scene of James Cody Bruce Bennett whose desperation to strike gold becomes clear following his death. But Dobbs becomes horrifyingly cold and unfeeling even rejoicing when Howard is brought away to a Mexican village and leaves the 'goods' with himself and Curtin. The final denouement is painful to watch but true and not at all patin fact it's a great Huston ending realistic but also selfconscious particularly at the end with Howard and Curtin realising that if they've lost anything it's nothing compared to what Dobbs has lost. A good simple message.The other reason to watch this film is most certainly Bogart's lead performance. His lined extraordinary face conveys emotion like few others can and simply calls to the camera for attention. Little wonder that Huston loved working with Bogie so muchBogie's face creased in nonsinister joy or twisted with crazed suspicion is truly one for the camera. His work in this film is exceptional as well we believe his descent into madness just as we accept his rough but amiable pleasantness before he gets enticed by the prospect of striking it rich. We can't help being revulsed by the seachange in the man but we can't help feeling sorry for this man so generous and friendly in the beginning whose corruption through gold is so scary and complete. It's truly a fabulous performance.So for these two reasons and a host of others previously mentioned THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE comes very highly recommended. It's a cracking film suspenseful and funny with a great score as well. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw Ay Juancito!. A friend highly recommended it and I found it at a Blockbuster store here in Buenos Aires. Excellent! The pacing of the movie is very smooth the actors are good Adrin Navarro as Juan Duarte the 'Hero' of the movie Laura Novoa as Evita Pern Leticia Brdice as Yvonne Pascal Not the name of the real actress in this true story and all the others in the cast. An amazing achievement of the casting was that of Alejandra Majluf as Nin Marshall since she looks almost exactly like her! The recreation of the period about 1950 was very good even the colors looked like those of the old Technicolor.The wardrobe was designed by Horace Lane who actually designed clothes for Evita so the accuracy of the women dresses is flawless. So were the make up and hair styles. The interiors were recreated quite lavishly and accurately. And we must consider that a great deal of ingenuity must have been used since Argentinian movies are made with budgets that will only cover few minutes of shooting an American movie!There are a couple of scenes that are intensely moving one is when Evita is forced to renounce to the vice presidency of the country due to her gender The excuse given to the people at the time was another and to the threat that she represented to the military the church and the oligarchy of the country. The other scene is I don't consider the following A SPOILER since this movie is not fiction and everybody knows contemporary history the one of her death. Wow! with a minimum fuss this actress accomplished a very delicate and subtle ending of a very painful agony. The more I think about this movie the more impressed I am with it. I'll check Hctor Olivera's work The Director to see the rest of his production.".

The pacing of the movie is very smooth the actors are good Adrin Navarro as Juan Duarte the 'Hero' of the movie Laura Novoa as Evita Pern Leticia Brdice as Yvonne Pascal Not the name of the real actress in this true story and all the others in the cast. An amazing achievement of the casting was that of Alejandra Majluf as Nin Marshall since she looks almost exactly like her! The recreation of the period about 1950 was very good even the colors looked like those of the old Technicolor.The wardrobe was designed by Horace Lane who actually designed clothes for Evita so the accuracy of the women dresses is flawless. So were the make up and hair styles. The interiors were recreated quite lavishly and accurately. And we must consider that a great deal of ingenuity must have been used since Argentinian movies are made with budgets that will only cover few minutes of shooting an American movie!There are a couple of scenes that are intensely moving one is when Evita is forced to renounce to the vice presidency of the country due to her gender The excuse given to the people at the time was another and to the threat that she represented to the military the church and the oligarchy of the country. The other scene is I don't consider the following A SPOILER since this movie is not fiction and everybody knows contemporary history the one of her death. Wow! with a minimum fuss this actress accomplished a very delicate and subtle ending of a very painful agony. The more I think about this movie the more impressed I am with it. I'll check Hctor Olivera's work The Director to see the rest of his production.";

There are so many reasons and none of them is good enough to hate the movie but the sum of them is quite disappointing.First of all the main actor is just awful. I haven't seen him in any other movie and judging by this one I won't see him again. Why he was chosen I cannot imagine. Leticia Brdice is not that great either but that does not surprise me anymore. Anyway her character is not very good. The story is not amazing ends abruptly and has no suspense which is the biggest disappointment being Juan Duarte's story so surrounded by mystery. Furthermore there are some moments in which it seems just an excuse to make some remarks against Pern Eva Pern and their government I don't know if that's the case but that's what I felt even though I'm not a Pern supporter. And most important of all if you haven't spent enough money in your fake head if you have a sorry plaster fake head that couldn't look human even among apes you must NOT do a close shot of it!!! sorry but it's trueWell now the good part the part that made me give it a 5 and no less even when I'm not old enough to have lived that times I got the feeling that the setting was very good. Ins Estvez was absolutely great a true diva. And Norma Aleandro was amazing as always. Alejandra Majluf whom I never saw acting before was quite good I don't think she is an extraordinary actress but somehow her part suited her perfectly the resemblance is impressive. Marrale and Novoa had their moments. Their lines especially her lines are not great and their start is quite shaky but they're fine. Nevertheless none of them is good enough to save the movie.Ay Olivera it could have been so much better...".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the greatest Egyptian and Arab movies of all time.  It is a beautiful portrayal that is worthy of Salah alDin.  It shows Salah alDin as the man he was one of the greatest leaders of all time a man at all times humble who was able to unite a fragmented Arab world and free it from its invaders.  It is an enlightening film for most Westerners who only learn of the Crusades through traditional Orientalist views.  It does a great job in eliminating typical stereotypes of the Arab world at the time but is fair in its representation of both sides.  The film shows the aggressiveness of the Catholic armies but also the treachery and deceit that plagued the Arab world.

	onyx:emotionText "One of the greatest Egyptian and Arab movies of all time.  It is a beautiful portrayal that is worthy of Salah alDin.  It shows Salah alDin as the man he was one of the greatest leaders of all time a man at all times humble who was able to unite a fragmented Arab world and free it from its invaders.  It is an enlightening film for most Westerners who only learn of the Crusades through traditional Orientalist views.  It does a great job in eliminating typical stereotypes of the Arab world at the time but is fair in its representation of both sides.  The film shows the aggressiveness of the Catholic armies but also the treachery and deceit that plagued the Arab world.  It also treats Richard the LionHearted with the respect he deserves and the most spectacular scene is a split screen comparison of Salah alDin and Richard that shows how the men were so alike but caught on opposite sides of a war.  Fantastic film a must see.";

	schema:headline " Walter Scott meets Nasserera Arab nationalism...";
	schema:reviewBody "'El Naser Salah el Dine' is a curious blend of Nasserera panArab nationalism with plot elements and characterisations derived from the works of Walter Scott. It is not Islamist in approach the fictional romantic hero like the director and cowriter Youssef Chahine is an Arab Christian and is named 'Issa'  'Joshua''Jesus' in Arabic. He is played by Salah Zulfikar. He is very loosely inspired by a historical 'Issa the Swimmer'  in the same way that Ridley Scott's 'Balian' is by the real one. The name and one attribute are taken from history... and um that's all! At least there's an excuse that less is known about Issa the Swimmer! As he explains to the Frankish heroine Louise de Lusignan Nadia Lutfi his loyalty is to his fellowArabs across religious differences. Like 'Kingdom of Heaven' 2005 the film imposes a positive ideology of toleration and peaceful crosscultural links all very worthy in modern times but nothing to do with 12C attitudes in this case it reflects a secular Arab nationalist ideology. It is never mentioned that Saladin was not an Arab but a Kurd and Issa claims Jerusalem has always been an Arab land. The depiction of the situation of the Arabs under Frankish rule is clearly intended to echo that of the modern Palestinians. Walter Scottderived components perhaps from Chahine's education at a Britishrun school include the negative characterisation of Conrad of Montferrat Louise being threatened with burning as a witch straight out of 'Ivanhoe' and Saladin in person tending Richard after he is shot with a poisoned arrow from the 1954 Hollywood film adaptation of 'the Talisman' 'King Richard  the Crusaders' which this film resembles in some respects. As with Western historical films there are numerous inaccuracies in fact and characterisation. Guy de Lusignan is depicted as a peaceable elderly man who wants to negotiate with Saladin but is overruled by Reynaud de Chtillon he was actually probably in his late 30s and quite reckless in the 1187 campaign. Reynaud is depicted as being killed in a duel with Saladin he was in fact summarily executed. Richard I Hamdi Geiss receives remarkably favourable treatment partly through the influence of Scott also I suspect because the film may have an agenda of repairing links with the UK postSuez. Philippe Auguste Omar ElHariri meanwhile is depicted as a villain and is shown giving the order for the massacre of the prisoners from Acre  when in reality he had already set off home to France. It was actually Richard who was responsible for the massacre. Again I think this reflects contemporary 1963 antiFrench sentiment because of the war in Algeria. The siege of Acre itself is depicted as a picnic for the Franks aided by a treacherous Arab governor in fact it lasted for 23 years with hard fighting and many deaths including those of the Queen of Jerusalem and her daughters from disease in the camp. The hostile characterisation of Conrad of Montferrat  in reality respected by his Muslim contemporaries as a tough warrior and an intelligent diplomat with whom they could negotiate  is Walter Scottbased Mahmoud ElMeliguy plays him as scheming and treacherous much as Josef Schildkraut did in Cecil B DeMille's 'The Crusades' 1935 and Michael Pate in 'King Richard  the Crusaders'. The female leads are both fictional although one the villainess played by the voluptuous Leila Fawzi is purportedly Reynaud de Chtillon's widow. She is named surely ironically Virginia and depicted as bedding in turn all the movie villains  the treacherous governor of Acre Philippe Conrad and the elderly Duke Arthur Richard's fictional scheming adviser  in the hope of becoming Queen of Jerusalem! As is usual in the historical adventure genre  in Western films also  she pays a high price for her intrigues although she seemed to me the most interesting character. Louise is a more conventional winsome romantic lead again as is typical in the genre she is on the other side but has to be persuaded of the superiority of the hero's cause and won over. Less conventionally  and rather implausibly  both young women are depicted as donning mail and fighting in battle although Louise gives this up for fear of confronting her beloved Issa in action. Louise is in fact depicted as an officer of the Hospitallers! While there were Hospitaller sisters they were nurses not fighting members of the Order and as nuns romantic involvements would not have been approved.'El Naser Salah el Dine' is a very colourful film and strikes me as a lightweight period adventure in much the same vein as DeMille's 'The Crusades' or 'King Richard  the Crusaders'. In the same way as DeMille it tries to be portentous and 'deep' but isn't and only the political baggage is different. The armour and costumes are no more authentic than in Hollywood and the blond and auburnwigged Arab actors as Franks are certainly no more or less odd to the eye than Rex Harrison in brown makeup as Saladin in 1954 Hollywood! While both the leading ladies are attractive the only really goodlooking man in the film is Saladin played by Ahmed Mazhar. However where this film has the edge is some interesting cinematography use of stillsmontage and a very effective use of splitscreen evocative of medival manuscript painting and crosscutting during Louise's trial to compare and contrast Saladin and Richard. What surprised me most about the film though is how little screentime Saladin himself has the intrigues of the Franks dominate the narrative much as in the related Western films. This is unfortunate the intrigues and battles of his own rise to power are fascinating although would require a less reverential treatment than is customary with historical heroes in Arabic cinema.".

Despite the fact that it relatively flopped in theaters partly because of how huge the production is and how little the theaters these days in the Arab world can cause profit it became one of the most loved and respected movies and watched by everyone when aired on television. Historically it didn't bring everything about the hero that's not why it was made.... it depicted a certain section in the history of the crusades without looking at the roots of the characters because there's only so much you can show in a limited time motion picture. Anyways the movie showed the nobility of the leader the power of his faith his distinguished skill in warship and most of all his human side. There's a real reason for why he is seen as one of history's legendary warriors in the east and such a respected figure in the west as well..The movie did him justice there and didn't drift away from being very entertaining. Frankly not many movies or series in the middle east can make you feel the period that it's supposed to be in but this one doesn't distract you in thinking about that manner because it seemed so real the way it should be. And on the other hand Chahine being a Christian himself diminishes the idea of the movie being biased against Christianity. An amazing movie I enthusiastically recommend to anyone...".

Direction isn't the best of the movie and it gets even silly in a shot or two but the simple and elegant performance of most of the staff keeps you enjoying.

	schema:headline " Amusing examination of junkie Darwinism";
	schema:reviewBody "After I watched this film I checked out the trailer for it on the DVD. The trailer makes High Life look as though this is some sort of action thriller. What it really is however is a low wattage dark comedy about 4 junkies on various stages of the junkie evolutionary scale that succeeds by never asking for any sympathy or understanding for its characters only that you be entertained by them.Dick Timothy Olyphant is a scruffy morphine addict and excon working as a hospital janitor in 1983 when his scruffier sullen and violent excellmate Bug Stephen Eric McIntyre shows up. Bug quickly gets Dick fired but Dick doesn't hold it against him at all which tells you a lot about both men and their relationship. With no work and no prospects and a horse that shows up in the middle of his rundown apartment Dick comes up with a plan for a big score. It's so big he and Bug can't handle it alone so they've got to recruit Donnie Joe Anderson a sickly addict who's developed a scam where he steals people's wallets and uses their ATM cards for easy money before putting the wallets back and Billy Rossif Sutherland another addict with the looks of a high school heartthrob and the good luck to never have gone to jail.Dick's big plan revolves around the repairmen who service ATM machines and it actually seems like a decent criminal idea until it goes wrong from the very beginning and launches Bug into a shooting spree and leaves Dick covered in pink dye waiting for the cops to show up.The most interesting thing about High Life is the picture of junkie society it paints. Dick is a high functioning drug user that the others cluster around and unthinkingly look to for leadership. They all consider him smart but Dick's brain is pretty well fried. All he can do that the others can't is think farther than 5 seconds ahead. A step down from Dick is Billy who is the sort of addict that's cruised through life without anything all that terrible every happening to him.

	onyx:emotionText "After I watched this film I checked out the trailer for it on the DVD. The trailer makes High Life look as though this is some sort of action thriller. What it really is however is a low wattage dark comedy about 4 junkies on various stages of the junkie evolutionary scale that succeeds by never asking for any sympathy or understanding for its characters only that you be entertained by them.Dick Timothy Olyphant is a scruffy morphine addict and excon working as a hospital janitor in 1983 when his scruffier sullen and violent excellmate Bug Stephen Eric McIntyre shows up. Bug quickly gets Dick fired but Dick doesn't hold it against him at all which tells you a lot about both men and their relationship. With no work and no prospects and a horse that shows up in the middle of his rundown apartment Dick comes up with a plan for a big score. It's so big he and Bug can't handle it alone so they've got to recruit Donnie Joe Anderson a sickly addict who's developed a scam where he steals people's wallets and uses their ATM cards for easy money before putting the wallets back and Billy Rossif Sutherland another addict with the looks of a high school heartthrob and the good luck to never have gone to jail.Dick's big plan revolves around the repairmen who service ATM machines and it actually seems like a decent criminal idea until it goes wrong from the very beginning and launches Bug into a shooting spree and leaves Dick covered in pink dye waiting for the cops to show up.The most interesting thing about High Life is the picture of junkie society it paints. Dick is a high functioning drug user that the others cluster around and unthinkingly look to for leadership. They all consider him smart but Dick's brain is pretty well fried. All he can do that the others can't is think farther than 5 seconds ahead. A step down from Dick is Billy who is the sort of addict that's cruised through life without anything all that terrible every happening to him. He's physically and mentally unscarred but his lack of suffering has left him incapable of taking anything seriously even his own impending death. On the next lowest rung is Donnie the meek little petty thief who's just going from hit to hit with no thought of the future. At the bottom is the tough but emotionally fragile Bug who can't even function in normal society though it's not at all clear whether his drug use has anything to do with that.

The film starts with the now somewhat clichd tactic of showing the audience a scene of how everything has fallen apart for the four criminals during the heist and then taking us back a few days to see how things got to that point. Make no mistake this is a 'light' film and not a particularly memorable one but it's a fun and often unpredictable ride that provided plenty of chuckles right until the end. After the screening Director Yates and the cast fielded some questions. Yates was an amusing guy and made some insightful comments particularly regarding the fun soundtrack but I was a bit disappointed at how flippantglib Timothy Olyphant's responses were.

And entertaining it is if you're not expecting too much of an action flick.We meet Dick Timothy Olyphant and some of his bad buddies back in 1983 all dependent on drugs and all except one jail birds. Dick involves Bug Don and Billy in a bank heist. Of course a very bad idea with a very stupid gang which has to go horribly wrong...Well acted by all suitable for such a comedy. A great and very suitable score follows the film throughout adding to the pleasant watch. You might want more of the ending but otherwise this does the job. You also might react to the cars being used in the film is very worn to be in the eighties and the Mercedes used there didn't come into production until 1986. But that shouldn't ruin your enjoyment of watching this. It's not by any means a fast paced film more slow but relying in he acting. Nice little film!".

	schema:reviewBody "Many other reviews have covered the excellence of the stonedjunkedout humour and the overall kind of lackadaisical mood of entropy everything going to a chaotic baroque hell.What I really loved in this little movie was the attention to detail. The costumes and hairmakeup for instance are brilliant. Steven Eric McIntyre couldn't look greasier and his cold gray eyes burn holes out of his pale grizzled face. He struts into his first scene wearing clapped out flares and some seriously flash rattlesnake cowboy boots reminding me of legendary closeup shots of gunfighters' boots as they stride into the road for a battle. Bug Is Here and things are going to proceed downhill at a steady clip. Later you see big black and silver rings and a huge silver belt buckle of galloping horses that fit right in with Bug's selfimage of a badarse cowboy pining for his horse Jezebel. It's fitting that he dies in the saddle no? Pretty boy Billy has the perfect Euroboy new waveish uniform of stripy tight tshirts and pegged black jeans along with big 60ish sideburns and a flop of wedgecut hair that was the hipster haircut of the early 80s.Then there's some of the best use of soundtrack music I've heard in a while. The director has a similar gift for setting moods with music as does Scorcese and his legendary oeuvre that uses the Rolling Stones in pitchperfect moments. This being a Canadian movie it makes perfect sense to string the music of April Wine along with screen shots of their vinyl albums and cassettes throughout the movie. This band along with CCR 3 Dog Night and the kind of obscure if you're not a Canadian who was in his 20s during the late 70s Montreal recording artist Pagliaroset a very specific mood that of balls to the wall lose your head stoner rock. I was a total new wavemodskapunk snob in my early 1980s jr high and high school years but I still have fond memories of secretly blasting stoner rock out of my headphones or car stereo and leaning back and just time traveling. This kind of epic release is what all of the characters in this film are searching for.Lastly there are the strange and wondrous uses of visual motifs specifically pink and horses. The morphine pills are bright pink as they are crushed in the ice cream scooper then dissolved into a brilliant pink solution that courses through the veins of Bug Billy and Dick. Billy eats a pink fluff of cotton candy and the ice cream Bug pulls out of the freezer as they are cooking pink morphine in Dick's apartment is pink strawberry ice cream. Junkies crave sugar and in this movie it's pink sugar that is their cracked ambrosia. When we first see Bug and Dick cooking up and getting high there's a junky dream of thick pink slop reminiscent of the cook dripping over the edge of a cardboard box. Incidentally that box has an image of a big red barn that perfectly syncs with the big red barn that contains the horses that Bug finds at the end of the movie. Then there's the mother of all pink paint bombs that so hilariously covers Bug and Dick making Bug look like in Dick's words a fking pink Chuck Norris.And then there's the horses. First we see them on Bug's belt buckle and then he has a junky vision of a horse standing over him that he calls Jezebel. A childhood memory of a long lost pet? A sly reference to the junky slang word for heroinhorse? Bug fancies himself to be a kind of twisted cowboy and he meets his storied end covered with pink paint on the back of a beloved horse on his way to South America. I just love that kind of attention to detailit's what makes me want to watch this film over and over. And since High Life is on heavy rotation on Showtime that's exactly what I've been doing with the speakers turned up to 11.".

	schema:headline " Inspired Lunacy!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This lowbudget crime caper about a quartet of clueless cretins who assemble to rob a bank qualifies as inspired lunacy. Director Gary Yates and scenarist Lee MacDougall have fashioned a funny little flick with good and bad characters.

It was one of the first great epics of the Sound Era and is still very entertaining to watch. Occasionally there is a bit of overacting perhaps and technical difficulties with the microphones can be discerned while trying to hear the stars' voices clearly during some crowd scenes but this in no way detracts from the enjoyment of viewing the film.The performance of Richard Dix as pioneer  dreamer Yancey Cravat has been criticized as being too florid and overripe but this is unfair. The popular actor had his roots in silent films when acting techniques were somewhat different but this robust style perfectly suits the energetic wanderlust of his character. Anything less than abundant enthusiasm would look silly in a fellow called upon to deliver a sermon and shoot an outlaw almost simultaneously vigorously champion the rights of fallen women and racial minorities and yet still blithely abandon his family for long years as he follows his own star of destiny. Call it what you may Dix's performance can certainly never be tagged as being dull.Irene Dunne as Yancey's wife Sabra  his Sugar'  provides the calm emotional center for the film. She is the one who holds the family and newspaper together while her husband is off bringing civilization to other frontiers. She is even able to achieve substantial business and political importance. What saves Dunne's performance from becoming too sweet is the story giving her a few personality wrinkles to deal with most notably her determination to destroy the town's bawdy house madam well played by Estelle Taylor and her intense bigotry towards the local Indians. Her growth as a human being is juxtaposed with that of Oklahoma's expansion as a state.Some fine character actors provide prime entertainment value stuttering Roscoe Ates as the Cravats' faithful printer George E. Stone as a gentle Jewish peddler who becomes a firm family friend Stanley Fields as a town tough who tangles with the wrong hombre William Collier Jr in a brief vibrant outlaw role as The Kid and Eugene Jackson as the young Black servant who gives the ultimate sacrifice of loyalty to the Cravats. Marvelous gossipy Edna May Oliver replete with snooty sniffs  piercing glances neatly tucks all her scenes as a society matron into her handbag and stalks off with them.With production costs of 1.5 million dollars RKO could give CIMARRON excellent production values featuring crowds of extras and very realistic sets. A few of the scenes are classics and remain in the mind for a long time the 1889 Land Rush sequence which opens the film the church service in the saloon the gun battle in the dusty street. It is very interesting to watch how the town of Osage changes during the movie from a dangerous dirty settlement to an Oklahoma metropolis in 1930 all achieved most convincingly for the screen.The Cimarron is a wild  unruly river that arises in New Mexico and runs for about 600 miles before becoming a tributary of the Arkansas River near Tulsa Oklahoma. The word is Old Spanish and refers to the thickets along the River and the bighorn sheep which inhabited them".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER re the fate of IsaiahBeing a huge fan of Edna Ferber's novels and having watched the 1960 and 1931 film adaptations of Cimarron back to back I detested the 1960 version for the liberties it took with my beloved book and loved the 1931 version for staying true to Ferber.What some have called overacting from Richard Dix I see as capturing perfectly the character of Yancey Cravat a man of sweeping gestures and grand oratory  a drama king. His assigning Isaiah the black servant boy to guard the house instead of accompanying the family to church in Yancey drag is actually a compassionate gesture intended to spare the boy from ridicule by the town.And Irene Dunne's Sabra is the quintessential Ferber heroine who starts out as a starryeyed innocent and learns the meaning over the years of life is what happens while you're making other plans emerging in the autumn of life as a strong wise magnificent woman. See Barbara Stanwyck's Selina DeJong in So Big for another example of a Ferberella who translates well to the screen. And she eventually gets over her prejudice against Indians and becomes their champion.Isaiah does embody some unpleasant stereotypes but this too is from the book. He was originally a servant of Sabra's family oldschool Mississippians transplanted to Wichita for whom emancipation was a mere technicality. They didn't beat or sell their servants but demanded total subservience and obedience as they had in slave days. SPOILER Isaiah's death is the one big glaring deviation from the book which gives him a far more grisly ending. END SPOILERWorthy of the best picture Oscar? No. But a faithful adaptation of the source material? For someone who loves her books and has seen her share of favorite books butchered on film from Heidi to Needful Things a big yes.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILER re the fate of IsaiahBeing a huge fan of Edna Ferber's novels and having watched the 1960 and 1931 film adaptations of Cimarron back to back I detested the 1960 version for the liberties it took with my beloved book and loved the 1931 version for staying true to Ferber.What some have called overacting from Richard Dix I see as capturing perfectly the character of Yancey Cravat a man of sweeping gestures and grand oratory  a drama king. His assigning Isaiah the black servant boy to guard the house instead of accompanying the family to church in Yancey drag is actually a compassionate gesture intended to spare the boy from ridicule by the town.And Irene Dunne's Sabra is the quintessential Ferber heroine who starts out as a starryeyed innocent and learns the meaning over the years of life is what happens while you're making other plans emerging in the autumn of life as a strong wise magnificent woman. See Barbara Stanwyck's Selina DeJong in So Big for another example of a Ferberella who translates well to the screen. And she eventually gets over her prejudice against Indians and becomes their champion.Isaiah does embody some unpleasant stereotypes but this too is from the book. He was originally a servant of Sabra's family oldschool Mississippians transplanted to Wichita for whom emancipation was a mere technicality. They didn't beat or sell their servants but demanded total subservience and obedience as they had in slave days. SPOILER Isaiah's death is the one big glaring deviation from the book which gives him a far more grisly ending. END SPOILERWorthy of the best picture Oscar? No. But a faithful adaptation of the source material? For someone who loves her books and has seen her share of favorite books butchered on film from Heidi to Needful Things a big yes.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a comment following up to a previous post. Richard Dix was a big silent film star before Cimarron. He was one of the few silent actors who successfully made the transition to talking pictures. I hardly recognized Irene Dunne at first this was only her second film. This film is fun to watch as the talent of the actors is evident. People must keep in mind that the sound quality sets etc. were all still relatively new in 1931. Actors and directors were accustomed to silent movies. The costumes performances and sets are quite good in my opinion. Once gets a feel for how the home life new life in the southwest and the timeless snobbery of the town ladies. The courtroom scenes are intense. The writing was realistic for the time period. Scathing accusatory and judgmental remarks to browbeat and break the woman's spirit. A very moving picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sprawling is the adjective most often associated with novels and moviesfromnovels by Edna Ferber.

In the case of CIMARRON it's the story of how Oklahoma became a state seen through the life of Sabra Cravat Irene Dunne demure wife of guntotin' macho dude Yancey Cravat Richard Dix. It's a fascinating and not pleasant relationship He always hankering for another risky adventure and she wanting to settle down and be respectable. He is also politically minded a fighter for the underdog defender of the prostitute victim of the social order and the Indians robbed of their land and cheated thereafter dispenser of frontier justice against the bad guys but only when provoked to the limit and literate to boot frequently quoting Shakespeare Milton and the Bible. The film is splendidly produced with well staged action sequences particularly the opening Oklahoma land rush which puts even DeMille's exodus to the Red Sea to shame and realistic recreation of a filthy crowded violent and anarchic boom town which gradually gentrifies as the decades pass. Interiors are similarly authentic. Wesley Ruggles directs multiple crowd scenes with great mastery. And the whole film is structured in fully realized episodes beginning with a title card and a year 1889 to start 1930 to finish and ending with a close up on the character at hand as the screen slowly fades to black. The Dix character is heroic in the old style and though many modern viewers find his acting preposterous I disagree. I think he is the perfect actor for the character he is playing. Yes such a person would definitely be out of place in today's urban world but so what? We aren't watching a contemporary story anyway. The supporting cast particularly George E. Stone as a Jewish peddler who is defended against ruffians by Dix Edna May Oliver as the pushy judgmental neighbor and Stanley Fields as a grizzled sociopath are my favorites. Ferber's feelings about intolerance always informed her stories and make us think. Seeing a film like this 78 years after it was made also reminds us that although the US has come a long way the consciousness that all was not well was firmly operating even back then and available for wide public consumption. CIMARRON works as pure entertainment as well as history in fact the film and novel themselves are now history and have been folded into the larger history of this country. The only problem technically is the soundtrack which has become fuzzy. Maybe a pristine print is lurking around somewhere. And the supporting character of a black house servant played by Eugene Jackson will raise PC hackles from the early scene in which he is perched on a platform above the family dinner table fanning the white employers with bird feathers through one degrading interaction after another with whites. But this film was made in the age when most black actors and black people played servile or childlike roles so it is not a surprise to see the practice here.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very dated western but so much so it makes it interesting to watch in spots. However it's too long  131 minutes  and I watched it on a VHS tape in which the sound quality wasn't the best which helped make it too tough to watch in one sitting. Yet for its uniqueness and strangelooking characters and strange scenes it made it worthwhile to stick it through to the end. However the first half of the film is a lot better than the second half.This was Irene Dunne's first starring role and frankly I didn't recognize her. She was anything but pretty and certainly looked different. Her role was that a steady person who keeps her marriage together but has a major flaws including a real prejudice against the local Indians. In the end sees the error of her ways. Richard Dix plays her husband. He overacts and looks cartoonish most of the time. This movie was in the beginning of talkies and Dix still looked like he belonged in silent movies. He marries Dunne and quickly leaves to go wandering. He comes home briefly and leaves again....and it's okay. Strange.The story revolves around the two leads Yancy and Sabra Cravat and the their town which grows from nothing into a big city by the late 1920s. Seeing that city grow was interesting.Included in this movie was the strangest gospel meeting I've ever seen. It begins wellintentioned but becomes so spiritually weak and so secular that it makes a farce out of the whole proceedings. You have to see this to believe it. I just shook my head in amazement about how Hollywood has never had a clue when it came to topics like this.I got rid of the VHS long ago but if given the opportunity now that it is out on DVD would give it another look. It's almost a curiosity piece.".

Later when she embraces the long gone Yancy who asks her 'are you alright' it is heart wrenching. As he declares Sabra 'wife and mother stainless woman hide me in your love.'

He is a newspaper man a politician a lawyer a preacher a family man and a gunfighter. When he talks people listen when he decides to do something he does it and when he draws his guns men die. Richard Dix may not have been the most natural actor in the world but his broad build booming voice and intense energy lent itself to the strong forceful character of Yancey Cravat. Cimarron is also quite an impressive production. The opening Oklahoma land race is captured every bit as well as it was sixty years later in Ron Howard's Far and Away. The costumes sets and decor show us the passage of time as a small shanty town develops over the years into a major city. Like most films high on production value though Cimarron is low on substance. The storyline is too broad to be engaging and there is no real emotional core to the film. Nonetheless it is entertaining and that is enough to make it worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "050 Cimarron 1931  released 12631 viewed 51306.Gandhi is released from prison again.BIRTHS Charles Nelson Reilly James Earl Jones Sam Cooke.KEVIN Cimarron the first western to win the Academy Award for Best Picture back in 1931 is the story of Yancey Cravat a settler in the old west who takes his family to Oklahoma where he starts a successful newspaper business and becomes an all around town hero as the film tracks the Cravat clan from the Oklahoma land rush in 1889 all the way up to the present day. After the first hour of Cimarron I had dismissed it as a racist misogynist fossil of a film. The Cravat family keeps a Negro slave the wideeyed doofus Isaiah. The main character Yancey Richard Dix never listens to his longsuffering wife Sabra Irene Dunne and is always telling her to go to bed when she complains to him. There's a lot of Yancey going Stand aside dear. I've got to be macho. Then the second half rolled through and I began to reconsider. The movie is still severely dated and the things I said about the first half still stand. Yancey is never a likable human being for one second of the film. But it seems the episodic sentiments of the film evolve with the times. Their son Cim marries an Indian girl and the father approves. Yancey in an uneven scene defends a local woman in court who originally stole his land passionately standing up for the woman's poor lot in life in the everchanging times. He also after singlemindedly settling on Indian land for years takes up the good fight for Indian citizenship. Sabra becomes a congresswoman later in life and runs the household and the company while Yancey is out pursuing other adventures what a lout. Irene Dunne is superb and carries the film beautifully even when all she can do is be the longsuffering wife of the hero. I always found myself on her side.DOUG We power on through '31 with that year's Oscar winner for Best Picture Cimarron also the first western to win the honor. All well and good except for the fact that I didn't like this movie much at all. I never found Yancey Richard Dix particularly heroic just a macho jerk who's more interested in settling in Indian territory and running off for adventures than in looking out for his wife and kids. When his wife Sabra tells him that she wants to go back to Wichita and doesn't want to raise her kids out here in a place where men shoot at each other without provocation he rather condescendingly sends her to bed. Whenever she makes a valid argument about anything he launches off on some speech about Godknowswhat. Then there's the scene where Sabra has Dixie on trial and Yancey decides to defend her we never get a clear idea about what she's on trial for public nuisance is all Sabra says and I wasn't too pleased to see Yancey's impassioned and offtopic argument get her acquitted. And don't get me started on Isaiah the family's dimwitted and black slave. If you're looking for the reason why no one talks about this particular Best Picture winner anymore he's it. As for good points and there are some the second half is better than the first with Yancey fighting the good fight for Indian citizenship. The movie does also give us some good moments about settling in the hostile territory of Oklahoma. I was rather surprised that the movie takes us all the way to the present day or 1929 close enough and shows Irene Dunne with some impressive oldage makeup. In the end if we had seen this film before we would have definitely skipped it this time and written a retrospective review.BTW a couple of statistics This is the 50th fulllength film we've watched on our chronological odyssey. Also at 124 minutes it is the longest film we're watching from 1931. Interesting how the average running time has risen over the years.Last film Little Caesar 1931. Next film City Lights 1931.".

	schema:reviewBody "After starting off quite well this Western starts to get bogged down and it ends up being quite a bit less effective than it could have been.  It does have a handful of good action scenes especially the opening land rush sequence which is exciting and is done nicely.  And it also has good period details in many of the scenes throughout the movie.  But it just has too many faults to be very satisfying.The story in itself is an interesting one and had good potential.  It starts off with the Oklahoma land rush and then focuses mostly on one family as they deal with their new surroundings and build new lives in the years that follow.  One big problem is that Richard Dix as the lead character overindulges himself with practically every line.  At first you kind of like his earnest energetic character but it doesn't take long at all for his style to become annoying.  Then most of the other characters are onedimensional and some are unfortunate stereotypes.  There are a few good scenes but many others that drag on far too long.  Then too while quite a bit happens there are too many times when the characters' decisions don't make enough sense to maintain credibility.If you enjoy older Westerns there might be just enough here to make it worth watching once.  But given how highly it seems to have been thought of in its own time it's a bit of a disappointment to those of us who enjoy the classics.  It's probably an example of how difficult it is to evaluate movies or other creative works in their own time.  There were probably a lot of viewers in 1931 who saw parts of their own lives in this movie and this blinded them to its obvious flaws.  In the same way many of today's mediocre films are widely praised only because they tap into current trends and will seem equally shallow to future generations who can view them more objectively.  Cimarron does have its pluses but it's not good enough to be of more than passing interest now.".

The majority of movies didn't go from being silent to talking until 1929 and Cimarron was filmed in 1930 so both these films were real early talking films and the performers had not learned to down scale their performances.The editing and cinematography were outstanding even revolutionary for that era. The film needs to be viewed in a historic context and not compared to current films. I do agree that Cimarron does not hold up as well during the march of time from 1930 to 2008 as does Public Enemy Little Caesar Scarface but it was a complex and ambitious film adaptation of a novel by an outstanding writer Edna Ferber. Richard Dix's character does stand up for and vehemently support fairness to Indians and prostitutes which was a revolutionary idea for a movie made in 1930.I did notice that Eugene Jackson the young black teenager worked for 60 years in the film business including a recurring role in Stanford and Son and in Julia. Richard Dix a major star in silent films starting in the early 1920s peaked around the time of Cimarron and by the second half of the 1930s was stuck in B films but did continue his career and stared in films until his retirement in 1947.Irene Dunne went on to super stardom for the next 20 years and made quite a few classics check out her film list in her biography. It is amazing!I want to compliment the other writers who are classic film lovers but do want to state that too many readers check the not helpful box instead of the helpful box when evaluating the reviews of others. I feel that they are being too picky. After all we are a select group of people who appreciate old films and should have support each other more as a group unless the review is vindictive or totally uninformed.".

Dix also helps independent woman and presumed prostitute Estelle Taylor as Dixie Lee. After some decades pass we meet the title character wild and unruly son Don Dillaway as Cimarron Cim Cravat.Cimarron is mostly recalled as the first western to win an Academy Award for best film. Some may think it should be recalled as the first time an award was given to prop up the box office of a flop. But the red ink was due to RKO spending so much on the film while not recouping its cost Cimarron was one of the biggest box office hits of 1931. It was also a triple crown Best Picture award winner with prizes from Photoplay and Film Daily included. Those awards were also the ones bestowed upon The Covered Wagon 1923 which was the world's previous western standard.None of this means Cimarron is anything more than a swaggeringly average western with a lot of production cost. Some of it is so dull the ethnic characters emerge as most perversely entertaining. It's difficult to justify the acting nominations for Dix and Ms. Dunne. Director Wesley Ruggles manages the crowds well and adds a few artful moments like the clever crucifying positioning of Jewish character George E. Stone as Sol Levy after some bullying. Edna May Oliver as Tracy Wyatt also makes the most of her role employing many mannerisms seen later in Carol Burnett. Cimarron 12631 Wesley Ruggles  Richard Dix Irene Dunne Estelle Taylor George E.

It is lavishly photographed and the scenery is beautiful Irene Dunne is good and Max Steiner's music is rousing and dramatic.However some parts have dated quite badly particularly the one with the gospel meeting. The dialogue is mostly poor and heavy handed while the story is bloated and has lots of unfocused scenes that could have been excised. The characters are clichd not always a bad thing unless the component is poorly explored or acted out which was the case with Cimarron the film is much too long the direction is flat and the pace drags on and on. The acting didn't do much for me either Dunne was good though but Richard Drix overacts and comes across as embarrassingly pompous.Overall a dull film albeit with some good points and worth seeing for historical interest and one of my least favourite Best Picture winners. 410 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "In a year that saw the release of City Lights Little Caesar and The Blue Angel Cimarron was surely the oddest choice to win the Academy Award for Best Picture but win it did although the award failed to translate into big bucks at the box office. At over two hours the movie is both long for its era and strangely sluggish given its actionpacked western setting. Adapted from the novel by Edna Ferber Cimarron is interesting primarily for the celluloid collision of two schools of cinematic acting. The first exemplified by Richard Dix playing twofisted editorpioneer Yancey Cravat is the school of silentfilm histrionics the second is the more naturalistic school of screen acting which found in Irene Dunne playing Dix's loyal wife Sabra one of its more sensitive and enduring interpreters. The two styles don't mix well. Dix is all ham and bluster shaking his fists gesturing like a roadcompany actor playing Julius Caesar casting his eyes up to heaven and ringing the bells loudly on every emotional change his character undergoes. Dunne by contrast engages in a quieter duet with the camera one that allows her character to develop slowly over the course of the movie. The disparity between the two styles is unsettling the viewer is left with the impression of having seen the same movie through two different sets of lenses. The fact that Cimarron is both incredibly dated and blatantly racist doesn't help much either.All that said however the movie's still worth watching if only as an example of an early Hollywood blockbuster epic. The opening land rush sequence with a cast of thousands is compelling and cinematically sophisticated even by today's standards. And there are several worthwhile cameo turns including one by Edna May Oliver who manages to steal every scene she's in.".

In a sense it combines the depth of European Russian movies with power and speed of Hollywood.

The scene where Rita tries to comfort Yaya after the dreadful experience and Yaya first mentions the Strana Gluhih and describes it to her was the best IMO. Overall plot is not quite thorough yet catchy. It provides an interesting perspective to lives of Muscovites during the transition from USSR to Russia. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who's fed up with the crap that keeps coming out of Hollywood persistently for quite some years now. I just wish I'd seen this movie earlier.

Theodore the town's mayor and Miss Lundi the schoolteacher protect and help the Gypsies. Despite this They are arrested and placed in an internment camp. Theodore manages to rescue them and gives them a piece of property where they must settle. But the Gypsies' deeply ingrained thirst for freedom makes this sedentary lifestyle difficult to bear.

While Gatlif's work documents the way of the Roma gypsies the themes are universal celebrations of music culture ethnicity and so on. It's the dramatic and visual way in which Gatlif portrays these elements that has much impact for me.Korkoro certainly doesn't disappoint. The visuals are beautifully rendered and the frame is used wonderfully  sometimes with extreme closeups sometimes panoramic. Like Robert Gudiguian's latest film The Army of Crime the film is set during World War II. According to the end credits an estimated 250000 to 500000 of Europe's 2 million prewar gypsies died at the hands of the Nazis. This story follows a wandering family of 15 of those.The Germans in occupied France decreed a law forbidding the movement of itinerants and this family find themselves stranded in a town where they seasonally perform farm work before they are imprisoned in a camp. The family has the sympathy of the town's mayor  who provides land for the family  and the local teacher Mademoiselle Lundi MarieJose Croze who is based on the reallife resistance fighter Yvette Lundy.I love this film. Not only does it have all the trademark Gatlif traits wild depictions of gypsy life wild music and spurts of insanity but its presentation of the rarely depicted and tragic part that the Roma played in WWII combine to make this a lovely story.Some of the visuals are amazing like a sick horse and its gypsy treatment it'll have you wondering how the hell they got animals to 'act'. The cinematography is superb. The acting is strong and Croze's role is especially beautifully understated. Well worth seeing.".

For that reason alone this film is important. If you are looking for other films you might check out The Man Who Cried with Johnny Depp.This film was a nice surprise. I expected it to be depressing but it was not. What Gatlif managed to portray through some very nice cinematography and story development is the gypsy love of nature and the outdoors. It was beautifully done.Another theme that comes across well in this film is the gypsy love of music. They seem to have an unusual flair for music and they use it to enrich their own lives but also to provide an income and support themselves.As someone with a history degree I appreciated the fact that Gatlif attempted to shed some light on a subject that few have touched. I also appreciated the cultural insights on gypsies and their lifestyle. Anyone looking for something a little different should enjoy this film.".

The movie is in French but as an English speaking person there was ample time for me to digest the subtitles and the action taking place on screen. I found the characters to be well rounded and real with only a few minor hiccups. The acting is superb and very believable. Surprisingly for a movie with such a supposedly sad theme there were a few times when I found myself having a good old belly laugh even though this movie is not a comedy. The humor comes from the ridiculous but so real situations andor some of the characters idiosyncrasies. Probably a bit like watching someone consciously avoid slipping on a banana peel only to be run over by a Mac truck. In my humble opinion this is a very well made and highly entertaining film.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all sorry for all the details in the following review but I guess those of you interested in this film may find them useful.Having followed Gatlif's progression as a filmmaker from the early 90s onwards  I still have his 80s works to catch  I've been wondering for quite some time when he would tackle the Porraimos the 'Devouring' in Nazioccupied Europe which left 250500.000 Sinti and Roma dead. It's a sadly neglected aspect of the Holocaust and neglected for a reason the stereotypes and social conditions which make Gypsies easy targets for fanaticism and slander are still very much in check as demonstrated by the recent forceful deportations of Roma from France Gatlif's home country. Unfortunately Gatlif's usual strengths translate as weaknesses when it comes to the story structure such an issue calls for. His films are great when they center around music and place the characters around it Gadjo Dilo Latcho Drom Swing. They are weak when the focus is on the characters proper for Gatlif invariably attempts to create rather a tableau of images than empathy with the protagonist's dilemmas Exiles or even worse when he appeals to romanticist views of Gypsies for the sake of accessibility Transylvania. In the case of 'Freedom' all these weaknesses come into full swing there's next to zero character development which results in very weak story structure. There's little music to render the admittedly great cinematography alive. The scenes of Gypsies in French internment camps are long dreary and lifeless  the controversial fact that French police collaborated with the Nazi Regime which later deported the Gypsies to death camps is somewhat alluded to in the character of the limping agent but incomprehensibly so if you don't know already. This ambiguity may be explained by the fact that Sinti and Roma rarely discuss the Holocaust due to taboos in regard to the dead. It's one of the most important aspects of Roma culture and again alluded to in the scene where the Kumpania 'extended family' refuses to use a house for fear of the spirits of the dead mul. If you are wondering why there are so little films and books dealing with the Holocaust in spite of its impact on the Roma  that would be the most important reason. This also explains the blatant anachronism to use Romanian Roma who speak a Transylvanian dialect of Romanes instead of French Manouche who speak Sinti Romanes a different language the Western European Sinti were wiped out by the Nazis to an extent of about 80 their culture was almost completely annihilated therefore they understandably reluctant to participate in reenactments of this catastrophe. The Eastern European Roma were also persecuted to an appalling extent but their social structure survived which may allow them to enact the persecution with more confidence.Still Gatlif himself has illustrated a much better way to deal with this silence in 'Latcho Drom' in a shot of an old woman singing a lament with the camera just brushing over her arm  and her tattooed Auschwitz internment number. Given that the silent way Gipsies deal with the Holocaust is fundamentally different from that of most Jewish groups this kind of symbolism would probably have been more appropriate and artistically successful. As it is 'Korkoro' is still quite important being the first film by a Gypsy film maker to deal with the subject. But judged by itself it's a failure and not a very interesting one to watch failing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The McCarters are one of the many marriages of convenience that form the thread of high society. Helen McCarter in a voice over even says so herself husband Charles is a man in love with appearances. It's confirmed right after his award has been given to him and has dropped her in their enormous Atlanta mansion he orders her to get out of the car and she does.So how couldn't she see his abandonment coming? How could she not know that seeing all her items boxed outside was a sign that something terrible was about to happen? How could she confuse the new clothes in her closet rack as being hers and go one step further to lovingly wait for Charles to get back and spend a quiet romantic night? I found it shocking but not surprising when he comes home with his mistress and in a violent scene throws her out of the house and into an uncertain future.If Tyler Perry had built upon this premise and had Helen find herself and her feminist voice without resorting to the gimmicks he gives us here DIARY would have been a complex character study. Once this prologue is over the movie shifts into a completely different gear and in having Helen being driven to her Aunt Madea's house. Anyone who is acquainted with the outrageous Madea will know that for a movie relating to issues such as spousal abuse she is NOT a character who could bring anything to the story. I can understand that a drama like this needs some outlet for humor to avoid maudlin but Madea? The moment she storms onto the screen DIARY screeches to a halt. Sure Madea teaches Helen to get in touch with her anger  after all she's the wife and was so for 18 years implausible seeing how young both Kimberly Elise and Steve Harris look and is entitled to half of Charles' assets. She even takes a chainsaw into play and saws Charles' belongings each and every one stressing her point. Not before doing a bad parody of Faye Dunaway in the wire hanger scene from MOMMIE DEAREST as she rips the gowns Charles has bought his new paramour and I wondered why? I answered myself that maybe Perry loves MOMMIE DEAREST that much and felt that it suited Madea. Oh it did  just not for this movie.And this isn't the only bad decision turn DIARY makes. There's the inclusion of Madea's foulmouthed brother Joe. There's Brian Helen's cousin also unhappily married to Debrah a drug addict trying to Do The Right Thing. And there's the shady dealings of a not so lawabiding Charles who filmed in deep shadows resembles an episode of LAW AND ORDER and makes the movie change drastic tones again because it seems out of place in Helen's plight. And speaking of Helen her story takes not one but two awful left turns that are completely inconsistent to character. First she begins working as a waitress and reluctantly accepts the courtship from hunky factory worker Orlando who drove her to Madea's house at the start of the movie and happens to be associated with Brian via friendship a little hokey and another mistake from Perry but once Charles gets shot in court also unlikely but with the recent Atlanta events in which the judge was killed plausible and becomes paraplegic she becomes vindictive. Consistent? Well from the viewer's point of view yes. Considering the way she was dragged from her hair out into the cold at the start of the movie yes. That her revenge is equally dragged on for too long? Absolutely. Not to mention the blatant mention of MISERY as if we the viewer did not catch the visual reference. The second inconsistency comes when Christian values are introduced and the need to forgive in order to move on comes into play. Suddenly we're flooded with images from a gospel choir Charles experiences a miracle and Brian's wife comes walking in singing of rebirth no doubt a device which can work in a stage play and can give the first of three climaxes but not here. When all this is done we can see the ending coming a mile away and even that seems as fake as fake fur but necessary for a happy ending appealing to a large audience.I also feel that the actors try to handle the material even though it seems to me they're all miscast. Elise and Harris are too young to play a couple married for close to twenty years  Angela Bassett and Denzel Washington would have brought their characters' natures out more easily but probably were unavailable. Shemar Moore plays his role as if he were back in THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS but then again his part was written to fit a romantic triangle much in the style of old Hollywood soaps a la Franchot Tone patiently waiting for his woman. Tamara Taylor brings pathos to her characterization of Debrah but does not belong in this story. Cicely Tyson has two small scenes and reaffirms her welcome back to the acting business.Tyler Perry is the star of DIARY as writer producer and playing three roles the ubiquitous Madea Joe and Brian. I can appreciate his movie in segments and respect its honesty but as a whole it's all over the place. And including what looks like a skit in which Judge Mayblean Ephraim calls upon Bobby Brown for an offense and we hear 'Whitney' shrieking Bobbay! I love you Bobbay! in the background doesn't help. He clearly loves camp movies and spells them out to us. Paring a story down to its bare essentials however makes a perfect airtight viewing instead of packing too much into two hours. Perry has a lot going for him and I think he'll create better scripts instead of focusing on one caricature which as a secondary player was overbearing.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're looking for full on Tyler Perry comedy don't watch this one. Every time I watch this movie I laugh and I cry. I've known women who've been cheated on and it changed them from sweet and happy to vindictive people who trust no one. I've known families torn apart by drugs and alcohol and the pain I see in Diary of A Mad Black Woman is dead on. Yep I know older ladies who carry a pistol in their handbags. Maybe that's why I am so attached to this film. I know these people. DOAMBW is rough on the emotions. The pain is palpable and we need Madea to break up the hard parts. It's like when you have sickness and death in the family and you get punchy and silly. You have to laugh to keep from crying. The pretty people in this movie are really beautiful. Who could ever get tired of looking at Kimberly Elise and Shemar Moore? When I hear the voiceover of Kimberly Elise reading the diary entries it's so realistic. It's the exact things you think when you are falling for someone and trying not. I've read a lot of negative reviews about this movie but I just don't see the problems. It isn't a documentary after all.".

I'm old enough to remember the original Diary of a Mad Housewife and when Miss Jane Pittman first aired and I have done the electric slide lived in the south never been to Atlanta but love Georgia and have attended barbecuesbut know very little about the chitlin circuit. Yet I and the two white friends I went with loved this movie! As I see it people who have witnessed this movie can be divided into two camps 1 reviewers probably mostly white who disliked the movie even when they tried to like it and 2 ordinary people mostly probably black as many tell us who loved it. So why do many apparently white viewers not get it? Why did I see it in my mostly white area with only about five other people in the audience?Well a lot of people didn't like Showgirls or Carwash or Lonely Lady when they first came out and now those are cult hits even classics. Diary is only like those movies in that it is similarly overthetop unapologetic ironyfree awkward amateurish that is not slick and yet so intrinsically watchable you can't take your eyes of the screen for a split second. I must admit that I probably laughed at some inappropriate moments but then so did Madea. The whole faithbased initiative Christianvalues quasiRepublican message might have made me wince or even gag in another context but is delivered so sincerely here you can't help but forgive just as Jesus or Helen! would.One could only call this movie operatic or Shakespearian. WaitI'm not trying to sound pretentious only trying to point out that like Shakespeare this movie mixes high melodrama with low comedic relief music and spectacle. The comic actors comment upon and undercut the ultraseriousness or piety of the rest of the storyand so we can only enjoy it more when the plot rides another twist on its emotional rollercoaster.Tyler Perry is obviously a man with a visionhe doesn't have the finesse of Eddie Murphy perhaps but I admit I was halfway through the movie before I realized he was playing both Madea and old Joe AND Brian. My fear is now that he will be sucked in by Hollywood the executives will convince him to deliver what they think white people want or need and he will lose his rough but raucous magic. So when Hollywood comes knocking please don't answer Mr. Perry! When I went into this movie I was grumbling that ticket prices had gone up to ten dollars but since we are given about five films for the price of one I consider it a very good deal. It is simply one of the most astonishing movies I've ever seen.".

Kimberly Elise is excellent as Helen an emotionally abused spouse who gets kicked out of her mansion and has to learn to live life on her own and learn to trust men again. There are moments that are so heart wrenching that much of the theater was crying. However before things get too down there are numerous hilarious scenes led by Tyler Perry. The great thing is that these funny moments are integral to the story for the most part and are not just thrown in without relating to the main story lines. Best of all this movie has heart and a message. It's about how forgiveness is better than revenge and that you need to forgive someone because it hurts YOU if you hold that anger inside yourself. It's about how love endures even through pain and disappointment. It's about how God can turn people's lives around. It's the type of movie that you can proudly take your mother and grandmother too.I wish they would market this type of movie more to a broad audience. It looks like they advertised this almost exclusively to a black audience I was one of the few white people in the theater in a very integrated community.".

	schema:reviewBody "Darren grant is a cool cucumber. After over 120 Music videos and commercials in just 8 years the youngish helmer has delivered with Diary of A Mad Black Woman. This debut director has entered the Hollywood fray on par with any big shooter. As a former Madison Avenue ad agency creative director I will admit I am biased because he directed an award winning commercial for me 2 years ago. Still Mr. Grant pulled off the same trick he did with our controversial cinemaTV commercials which featured a cigarette executive as a lethal Hitman he took a complex ethnically esoteric subject and simplified it making it digestible for the masses. Slap me around a little but I think that's what a good Director should do. The playwright Tyler Perry has had things cooking for years on the Chittlin' Circuit bringing his own unique brand of urban theatre to workingclass black America. Mr. Perry came to Hollywood as a prepackaged star. And Hollywood has acknowledged his presence in grand fashion.The rather surreal Madea character is more than just a manindrag it is Perry's vessel of choice. Via Madea he can impart a spiritual gospel that reflects his experience growing up in the black church. He can also channel his insights on politics and perhaps give a few pointers to wayward minorities who feel they are up against it. The rest of the characters in DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN Helen Charles Orlando Debrah Brenda Tiffany and Myrtle  not to mention Brian Madea and Joe  all played by Tyler Perry serve to hone Mr. Perry's particular brand of cultural propaganda. To wit love it or hate it there is a well defined black American subculture that cannot be ignored.DIARY OF A MAD BLACK WOMAN is indeed complex. Whereas Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire was deliberately in drag as a scheming septuagenarian and as was Martin Lawrence in the Big Momma's House  Tyler Perry's Madea is a REAL woman! He's also Madea's dirtyoldman of a brother and takes off the makeup to play handsome young attorney. Tyler is almost on par with Eddie Murphy as he bandies about in multiple roles. Again credit Darren Grant's deft understanding of the characters' interaction. The only criticism here is that Tyler Perry is actually a more convincing actor when he is talking to himselfs!Kimberly Elise is a true Alist acting talent. If Madea is comic relief Elise's Helen fulfills the dramaturgy aspect of the film. She admirably holds her own with screen legend Cicely Tyson as her mother. Steve Harris is menacingly effective as an Ike Turneresque booji Atlanta attorney who emotionally terrorizes his wife and associates. Shemar Moore gives a breakout performance that is sure to take him to the next level in Hollywood. Watch as he is next transformed into a mainstream matine idol What's most important about this film is how it OWNS the right to speak of an ethnic genre. Darren Grant and Tyler Perry have cleverly positioned themselves as experts on American black culture. And how there are thousands of similar stories yet untold. Look for this director to perhaps do what Spike Lee intended what Carl Franklin suggested and what the Van Peebles' aspired to do become the definitive fresh new voice in Black American film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to like this movie. I really really did. Tyler Perry is a comic original and his character of Madea is a hilarious creation even to this white boy  but Lordy this movie is a confusing mess. It starts out with a serious soap opera style that we hope will give way to a nicely contrasting comic spree of good natured revenge selfdiscovery and adventure. Wrong. After a brief flirtation with that notion we are flung immediately back into the soap opera world with liberal doses of religious fervor and a secret knowledge that 'God can do miracles'. When the film eventually returns to it's comic roots in order to give the likable heroine her moment of triumph I said to myself 'now this is what we've been waiting for! You go girl!' But once again the movie retreats tempering our spirit with a dose of the holy spirit. After a lengthy montage sequence that is as phony as most of the rest of this movie the film culminates in what can only be described as a gospel movie musical sequence  stolen right out of THE COLOR PURPLE. But we're not done yet  after a 'happily ever after' family dinner starting with a closeup of a plate of fried chicken yet our heroine marches off to find her real happy ending in a steel yard. Perry's Madea and his Joe seem lost in a film that isn't really where they want to live. They would be much more at home in a scenario like GREATER TUNA or MRS. DOUBTFIRE where comedy is the main course. Or maybe better yet keep them on the stage where Perry seems to thrive.".

The characters are one dimensional all characters are either all good or all bad. Nothing in between. There is no subtlety to this movie or colors of emotion. It is lacking in verisimilitude. The over the top performances of the grandmother and grandfather knock you out of the reality of the story. You can't have it both ways.The music is annoying manipulative and intrusive. I can't help rolling my eyes and yelling oh brother as it underscore emotional changes and epiphanies. Again no subtlety. The love interest is so good he is always talking about love. The wife is so good and kind and hurt. The husband so mean and hateful. People have good and bad in life they are not all one way. This movie insists that people are one or the other. This takes us back to melodramatic morality plays of the middle ages.Tyler Perry rips off Eddie Murphy by playing multiple roles that aren't nearly as funny as Murphy's. He even rips off the fart jokes of the elderly black man.There is not one iota of cleverness or originality in this infuriating mess of a movie. This movie insults the intelligence of every moviegoer.Positives it was great seeing Cicely Tyson again and Judge Mablean's cameo was fun. Overall a colossal waste of time.".

Although she was distraught and destitute she still kept up her appearances of having and keeping it together making way for a positive new life while finding herself and new love.Steve Harris's role made it easy for you to harbor hatred towards him. Tyler Perry couldn't have picked a better actor to portray such a wicked character. What I also loved is that you eventually grew a tolerance and understanding of his role as well and learned to forgive him then yourself as Ms. Elise's role learned to do.If you'd like to catch up on Tyler Perry's character Madea please purchase the plays that are provided via DVD and VHS.

Whilst trying to tackle such topics as divorce spousal abuse drug abuse and even spinal injury the movie also attempts to be a romance and even a comedy and fails miserably on all counts. Because the movie tries to tackle all these themes and fit into all these different genres it winds up with a mish mash of scenes that unfortunately make no sense scenes of slap stick humor followed by intense romance followed by serious drama. Some story lines get thrown into the mix for no obvious reason other than to be able to say we had that in our movie which leaves the viewer feeling confused because it confounds the main storyline and doesn't get explained in any real way.

	schema:reviewBody "The review by kellyadmirer is pretty spoton regarding THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT. It is not hard to perceive  or ridicule  both the naivet and the shallow thinking of many '60s radicals from the perspective of 40 years later but naive and shallow they were. For the first 90 minutes or so of THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT screenwriter Israel Horovitz and director Stuart Hagmann were able to perceive that naivet and shallowness at roughly the time it was happening  and gently satirized it. In the last 20 minutes or so however they change course about 150 degrees and suddenly the student revolutionaries become martyrs victims of The Establishment and its brutal police lackeys.I've never read James Kunen's book on which the film is based but I recall having little sympathy for the Colombia University students whose attempted takeover of that institution in the spring of 1968 is the basis for THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT. I entered college the following year but I thought of myself as an educational consumer rather than an owner or investor in the institution I attended. If I didn't like the fact that the university was doing militarydefense research or offering ROTC classes I could always go to school elsewhere. The students were transients the trustees faculty and staff and in the case of the state university I attended all of the citizens who supported it were the ones with the longterm interests of the school at heart. Students who called for strikes to protest policies they didn't like were playing at being proletarians. Hell I was in school to get out of the working class.I guess my antipathy to most student protests of this ilk as opposed to antiwar statements and demonstrations that respected the rights of the nonpolitical or apolitical members of the university community may have blinded me to the satirical edge of THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT when I first saw it at the end of my freshman year. The national traumas of the 1968 Chicago convention riots in which Mayor Daley's police definitely overreacted to largely peaceful protesters and the Kent State shootings of May 1970 were still fresh when this film arrived in theaters. That may have led Horovitz and Hagmann to add the climactic scene of the film which changes the tone drastically for the sake of timeliness. Of course the contrast between the preceding 90 minutes of idealism and pseudorevolutionary rhetoric with the stark reality of the last 20 minutes may have been the filmmakers' point  but if so they do a lousy job in setting up the ending. The sudden radicalization of Simon is pretty hard to believe and the film ends ambiguously as though Horovitz and Hagmann are afraid to come down on one side or the other.Up until that transitory moment of radicalization however THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT contains some shrewdly observed scenes. The obsessive horniness in the midst of revolution the verbal masturbation of the student politicos the nonviolent radicals' fascination with violence and the resentment of the working class cops toward the privileged college students are wellportrayed. But the need for a big dramatic and yes violent climax really undercuts the subtlety of most of the film. Too bad because it reduces THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT almost to the level of clich.For Hollywood filmmakers  concerned mainly with attracting the collegeage population that most obsessively went to the movies  portraying the Sixties meant depicting the counterculture and ignoring the fact that most Americans weren't a part of it. THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT is a movie about a rather small if heavily publicized slice of The Sixties  and a rather wishywashy film for all the sly humor that promises so much for the first 90 minutes and then falters.".

Hell I was in school to get out of the working class.I guess my antipathy to most student protests of this ilk as opposed to antiwar statements and demonstrations that respected the rights of the nonpolitical or apolitical members of the university community may have blinded me to the satirical edge of THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT when I first saw it at the end of my freshman year. The national traumas of the 1968 Chicago convention riots in which Mayor Daley's police definitely overreacted to largely peaceful protesters and the Kent State shootings of May 1970 were still fresh when this film arrived in theaters. That may have led Horovitz and Hagmann to add the climactic scene of the film which changes the tone drastically for the sake of timeliness. Of course the contrast between the preceding 90 minutes of idealism and pseudorevolutionary rhetoric with the stark reality of the last 20 minutes may have been the filmmakers' point  but if so they do a lousy job in setting up the ending. The sudden radicalization of Simon is pretty hard to believe and the film ends ambiguously as though Horovitz and Hagmann are afraid to come down on one side or the other.Up until that transitory moment of radicalization however THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT contains some shrewdly observed scenes. The obsessive horniness in the midst of revolution the verbal masturbation of the student politicos the nonviolent radicals' fascination with violence and the resentment of the working class cops toward the privileged college students are wellportrayed. But the need for a big dramatic and yes violent climax really undercuts the subtlety of most of the film. Too bad because it reduces THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT almost to the level of clich.For Hollywood filmmakers  concerned mainly with attracting the collegeage population that most obsessively went to the movies  portraying the Sixties meant depicting the counterculture and ignoring the fact that most Americans weren't a part of it. THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT is a movie about a rather small if heavily publicized slice of The Sixties  and a rather wishywashy film for all the sly humor that promises so much for the first 90 minutes and then falters.";

The cops were powerless to do much of anything to the protestors except occasionally put handcuffs on them and herd them around and the administration flipped back and forth constantly between trying to compromise with the students and threatening to expel everyone. What I got out of it was that revolution sounds like a great idea until you get into the dean's office and realize that you don't know what to do besides pose for a photo in his leather chair while holding a joint.But that doesn't sell tickets.

	schema:reviewBody "Style tells the story here or at least what there is of it. But don't expect much dialog or exposition. Instead it's a swirling camera and incessant movement that impart mood and progression. Simon's an ordinary college student until he's drawn into the student protests of the turbulent 1960's. There he more or less discovers a 'true self' and becomes a leader of the movement along with his now coactivist Linda drawn together by the exhilaration of events.Despite frustrations with what seems at times a selfindulgent approach there are some good touches. Catch how Simon's previous life is summed up by the regimentation of the rowing team. There's even an overlay of barbed wire to emphasize the point. I guess that makes up for the absence of a peek into his home life. Moreover Simon's fantasy moments are also strategically inserted thereby avoiding dialog to account for his actions. Thankfully however the device is not overused.On a more personal note as a student activist SDS of the time at a large metropolitan university I'd like to offer a couple observations. The movie barely mentions the war then raging in Vietnam. Yet in my experience it was a prime motivational factor especially with the draft breathing down so many male necks in behalf of a bloody politician's war. Also there's almost no political theory discussed even briefly in the movie's fastmoving kaleidoscope. Instead the movement's leftist orientation is imparted visually by repeated images of an iconic Che Guevara.The strike we mounted at my school failed to come off when an important student group opposed it. As a result the movement there soon faded away. In the movie however the police violently overwhelm the student strike. Nonetheless the police action appears overdramatized even if correct in essentials. This latter I base on what I experienced at the socalled Century City riot of June 1967 in west LA. There an allwhite march of mostly respectable adults ended at a hotel where President Johnson was to speak. Planners however failed to provide an exit route and the crowd soon overflowed with bunched up marchers. Both police and protesters panicked and a melee ensued in which many folks were beaten bloody with batons. It's probably the biggest policewhite people fracas in LA since that time. I mention this as a perspective on the movie's portrayal of a police takeover of striking students. Overdone though I believe the depiction is the movie is still correct in the use of random police violence. And though hippiestyle free love is at least implied in the movie my experience was that the political side of protests was clearly distinguishable from hippietype cultural protest.Anyway the film's disruptive style is rather frustrating. But that may be the moviemakers intended effect since the protest movement itself disrupted convention. In that sense the finished film would amount to an intentionally awkward combining of style and content in order to better depict turmoil surrounding real student protest. To me however some essentials that depend more on words than visuals get unfortunately left out.All in all I think the movie does capture a sense of newfoundfreedom as the students rebel against a background of 1950's conformity. At the same time the protest gatherings also provided an educational exposure to many of the country's most vital but suppressed realities. Sure SS may not be the best student movie of that time but it does have its moments.".

I question whether those who are so negative had any personal experience with the period. I'm curious about the locations as I recognize San Francisco and New Orleans but cannot tell about the river sequences...nevertheless it was put together to make one city in part due to campus jitters at the time about the story line. Particularly noteworthy with this film are the great Editing and Cinematography...also one of the greatest Music Compilations for a soundtrack. It definitely deserved the 2 awards is won at the Cannes Film Festival. Hats off to Director Hagmann as well. I just finished watching it again on TCM and was struck by the feeling of suddenly being drawn back in time and a feeling of reliving the experience. This is a fine film for us old revolutionaries from the 60s actually a Screen Gem!".

BATF Doug Carlin is brought in to assist in the massive investigation and gets attached to an experimental FBI surveillance unit one that uses spacefolding technology to directly look back a little over four days into the past. While tracking down the bomber Carlin gets an idea in his head could they use the device to actually travel back in time and not only prevent the bombing but also the murder of a local woman whose truck was used in the bombing?";

	schema:headline " U can save herDj Vu";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a real shame that everything I had read about Dj Vu concerned the highpowered explosions and loud clatter of guruproducer Jerry Bruckheimer. No mention except maybe as a footnote was given to Alist director Tony Scott and the magic he has woven in his past three films. The man who brought us Top Gun has seen a sort of revival in style lately with the entertaining Spy Game the amazing Man on Fire and the kinetic Domino. Scott has taken the quick cuts of music videos and has infused them into his shooting style. His editor better be making some good money as these films fly by with filters jumpcuts grain and camera angles swiveling at every turn. Greatly overshadowed by brother Ridley Scott and his more serious awardwinning epics Tony has been pumping out some of the most solid and entertaining films of the past couple decades. With a reuniting of semiregular star Denzel Washington Dj Vu proves that when Bruckheimer is paired with a like mind his usual drivel can become great. Scott shows us how to hone the explosions noise and clutter to an effective level and gives us a helluva ride.Dj Vu could have easily reduced itself to timetravel farce going by the books to show a time warp in order to solve a crime. The farfetched premise of being able to see the past as it happens four and a half days later should seem crazy and by watching the previews you are given the idea that it will be just a series of doovers. Fortunately the trailers these days show a totally different movie than what has been crafted. Scott and his screenwriters have not only developed a scifi tale seeped in enough reality to at least be looked upon as plausible for the sake of the story but they nicely tidy up any chance of their being a plothole. Our story begins with a devastating domestic terrorist act upon a ferry carrying over 500 people Navy and family. Washington's ATF agent is brought in and discovers that it was no accident. Intrigued by the efficiency he displays an FBI agent played with nicely effective restraint by Val Kilmer calls him in to check out a new toy they have to find who the perpetrator is. During the use of this screen of the past Denzel acquires a feeling of obligation to do all he can to prevent what he sees from occurring in the present no matter what consequences that might entail for the future. The quest to stop the violence begins with an attractive young woman who unknowingly has become an integral part in what will ultimately transpire.The beauty of this film is that with multiple timelines being shown parallel to each other there are many questions that desperately need answering. To credit all involved they appear to have put themselves in the audience's shoes and piecebypiece wrote in a reason for everything. Anything that is seen either in the past present or future has a reason for being there and will be intelligently explained. Also the performances are stellar Denzel and Kilmer as well as a quietly maniacal Jim Caviezel and the emotionally exasperated Paula Patton and the visuals unique. While Scott has toned down the ultrakinetic cuts and filters for the main action his style is still stamped on the graphics of their screen showing the past. The motion trails and speed scans lend a stylized digital editing program feel and are gorgeous to watch. Dj Vu's best sequence however is the crazy car chase during the present in pursuit of a vehicle in the past definitely a rush and orchestrated almost flawlessly. Even though Ridley gets the accolades and Tony gets the hackoverproduced label I must say while they are the best directing duo in Hollywood I might have to give the edge on pure cinematic entertainment to the younger Tony. He is on a roll and doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon.".

It has been described as an actionadventureromancescifi pic and it truly is all of that.First of all the cinematography was stunning. Tony Scott and his DOP Paul Cameron do fantastic work  every shot is beautifully composed. And all the footage that involves a cast of thousands meaning the crowd scenes is masterful work.I don't know why I started with commenting on the photography also the editing of this movie. It's probably because that is what struck me from the very beginning particularly when there is so much going on in the opening sequence. Yet you never get lost. Above all the performances and story are great and really suck you in. Yes this movie requires a fair bit of suspension of disbelief. I would go so far as to say the plot was farfetched but the heart of the story just takes you along for the ride.For the record I felt Scott's most recent teaming with Denzel Man on Fire was one of the best movies of 2004. I don't think Deja Vu is as good as Man on Fire but it's right up there as one of the most entertaining and thrilling movies I've seen this year.For sheer entertainment and an intriguing though not flawless plot Bruckheimer Scott and Co. sure have DELIVERED the goods.I recommend you see Deja Vu on the big screen with a big loud audience for maximum enjoyment. Part of the appeal last night was exactly that hearing the audience  as one  laugh applaud and sigh along with this movie and getting swept up in that communal experience.post scriptum  Any fans of Otto Preminger's wonderful 1994 classic Laura may be delighted by the echoes of that storyline in Deja Vu.".

The acting is very convincing and the storyline follows quite closely to a Michael Critonesquire novel. I was rather surprised at the 6.8 rating this movie has received thus far and I hope that more positive reviews will come in order for the score to be bumped up to at least the mid 7's. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed by this film. For one thing it stars Denzel Washington Jim Cavizel who I felt did a marvelous job at playing the antagonist Val Kilmer and Bruce Greenwood. With these four actors you typically cannot go wrong. I notice that these four are also never in the tabloids and don't get caught up in the typical Hollywood tripe that is so prevalent today. They have raw talent are not just getting by on their looks and their performance especially in this film shows it. Deja Vu is one of those rare films that grabs a hold of you from the very start and does not let go of you until the very end. People even clapped after the film ended and such applause was well deserved. If you do anything at all this Thanksgiving weekend then by all means put going to see Deja Vu on your shopping list. I can promise you that both you and your familysignificant others will be blow though the very back wall of the theater.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was expecting more of this film based on the title and the trailer but ultimately came away feeling a bit taken for a ride. I read Sci Fi I understand some of the time travel stuff they write so would like to add some thoughts.To begin the whole process the ferry must blow up and he must travel back in time at least twice. The script writers get lazy in adding the ambulance and the stuff at the flat in the wrong time loop. They are compressing the two time loops into one time loop and using some of the elements to explain stuff that is logically wrong. Why two time loops and why is the film wrong? because the dead girl and the stuff at the flat and the ambulance all exist in the same time stream in the film. Why is this a problem she must have been alive to help put it in the flat which he finds before he time travels but her dead body is in the morgue so where was this other alive version of the girl in his current time stream???? She can't be the same girl in the river with fingers missing as that should already have happened. Now there are two of him at the end but only because he time travelled she never did so there can only ever be one of her in any one time stream or loop at any one time. He saved her with the ambulance therefore its in the wrong time stream loop if she is also dead in the same time loop so there must be two time loops one where she is dead and one where she is alive. now some might try to get round this by saying she was killed after going to the flat with Denzel and then placed in the river but I don't think the timing and the positioning of the bomber will support that very well and of course that didn't happen in the filmThe whole sequence would make more sense if it went like this. start A note arrives from the future on his desk his partner gets it. His partner disrupts the bomber gets shot. Bomber can no longer use the car. This makes the bomber go for the girl and her car. The car is changed the girl dies at the hand of the bomber she ends up in the river and found later but too early for the ferry explosion. There should be no traces at the flat. There should be no ambulance at the bombers place. Science team get him on board he starts the investigation he sends the note into the pastLoop 1 He travels back in time. He gets the ambulance. He saves the girl from the first death. They go back to her flat he arranges the letters and leaves the blood etc. Bomber still rides across the bridge very very important for the logic They try and save the ferry they fail and die The ferry blows up again.Logically this should have happened to have all the elements available at the start of the film to travel back a second time where everything in the past is in place so he can now see all of those things in the past that he put there and changed. So the time travel trip shown in the film should actually be the start of the movie as it fits all the requirements for the first time loop not the one leading to the shown ending which should logically be the end of the second time loop and the continuation of the time stream and exit from the time loop that could potentially go on for ever if the ferry keeps blowing up.NB Bomber riding across the bridge In reality if he had succeeded in stopping the ferry from blowing up as shown in the movie he would not have been able to see the bomber ride across the bridge on the CCTVfuture part as he was changing the past in real time eg Bomber is now on the ferry. remember the two are linked in real time they said so. The ambulance bandages at the flat phone call etc must exist in the same loop as the bomber riding across the bridge.".

He saved her with the ambulance therefore its in the wrong time stream loop if she is also dead in the same time loop so there must be two time loops one where she is dead and one where she is alive. now some might try to get round this by saying she was killed after going to the flat with Denzel and then placed in the river but I don't think the timing and the positioning of the bomber will support that very well and of course that didn't happen in the filmThe whole sequence would make more sense if it went like this. start A note arrives from the future on his desk his partner gets it. His partner disrupts the bomber gets shot. Bomber can no longer use the car. This makes the bomber go for the girl and her car. The car is changed the girl dies at the hand of the bomber she ends up in the river and found later but too early for the ferry explosion. There should be no traces at the flat. There should be no ambulance at the bombers place. Science team get him on board he starts the investigation he sends the note into the pastLoop 1 He travels back in time. He gets the ambulance. He saves the girl from the first death. They go back to her flat he arranges the letters and leaves the blood etc. Bomber still rides across the bridge very very important for the logic They try and save the ferry they fail and die The ferry blows up again.Logically this should have happened to have all the elements available at the start of the film to travel back a second time where everything in the past is in place so he can now see all of those things in the past that he put there and changed. So the time travel trip shown in the film should actually be the start of the movie as it fits all the requirements for the first time loop not the one leading to the shown ending which should logically be the end of the second time loop and the continuation of the time stream and exit from the time loop that could potentially go on for ever if the ferry keeps blowing up.NB Bomber riding across the bridge In reality if he had succeeded in stopping the ferry from blowing up as shown in the movie he would not have been able to see the bomber ride across the bridge on the CCTVfuture part as he was changing the past in real time eg Bomber is now on the ferry. remember the two are linked in real time they said so. The ambulance bandages at the flat phone call etc must exist in the same loop as the bomber riding across the bridge.";

	schema:reviewBody "I kept my hopes low for this mediocre time machine movie and my expectations were not exceeded! I realize the filmmakers are solely in it for the money. Film is now for the most part a commodity like toothpaste and paper towels  and it shows! I wouldn't even be surprised if Hollywood stooped so low as to hired Public Relation firms to write fake positive reviews on internet sites like this one! While I have no complaint with the acting the storyline is just utterly ridiculous and boring as tears. I don't think it is asking too much for a story to make some sense instead of treating the movie going public like a bunch of teenagers looking for some cheap thrills!Where do I begin? This highly professional terrorist has no motive for his madness. He pops out of the blue belongs to no organizations or movements and has no ideology no allies and no one helping him. Our meany terrorist quotes Thomas Jefferson claims he's not killing people because the U.S. military hurt his feelings when they rejected him for being too much of a patriot I kid you not and all he wants when he's captured is to confess like he's talking to a priest. Plus a cigarette of course  don't all bad guys smoke these days? Oh please give me a break! How sanitized a story can you get? The filmmakers and screenwriters of Deja Vu have absolutely no guts whatsoever to make any kind of statement other than that terrorists are crazy and get hurt feelings! Wow! What an interesting insight! Next The U.S. Government has a time machine that uses so much energy it caused the last Canada to New York blackout while doing experiments with just small animals which inturn all endup going into cardiac arrest and dying. But when our fearless hero Denzel Washington goes back in time the energy problem miraculously disappears. Keep in mind a single piece of paper was sent through time a couple of days earlier and it knocked out a whole city's power! The dying problem is also solved too with a full recovery taking less than a day. Keep in mind when most people recover from going into cardiac arrest they are usually not strong enough to waltz out of the hospital a couple of HOURS later! But Denzel is special and he doesn't even have super powers! When Denzel is shot by a rather large caliber bullet he begins losing blood fast. So fast in fact that it's obvious to everyone he needs to make a trip to the emergency room pronto! Instead he goes over to his women's home because of time constraints. There they wash his wound with water and dry it with paper towels. He miraculously stops bleeding because he washed his wound. No need for stitches or compresses just soap and water stops bleeding from gunshot wounds. Imagine what other miracles would have occurred if he had the time to wash the rest of his body!I think you get the picture. This is such a dopey film because the stupidity is nonstop! It's a shame films are not rated based on cleverness and intelligence. If they were perhaps filmmakers would start making more interesting movies!".

But then he sends himself back in time yeah likely and saves the day and the girl not to mention himself. Seriously the ending was a complete disaster. In the end nothing makes sense at all.Finally who the heck was the bomber anyway and what were his motives? I gave this movie 310 because it was partially entertaining. But it was mostly annoying.

Denzil creates mayhem and carnage on the streets of New Orleans with a trickedout Hummer with enough productplacement stickers on it to make the movie's endorsement agent shudder uncontrollably with logolistic ecstasy with impunity. he prolly kills several dozen innocent bystanders and doesn't get as much as a reduction of his expense account. and it's BORING!

But even when he was sent to the past after the girl's rescue the screenwriter created suspense by making characters once again stupid and complicating everything. Why didn't Denzel try to contact ATF and just warn to abort that ferry travel so that they could safely dismantle the bomb without risking all that people's life... Well i'll answer that because screenwriter wanted to break people's heart after his death just when love between he and Claire Paula Patton had been set. And of course even more important was to make him appear once again so that all people get happy again... I can't like movies that get their suspense or any other type of emotions by turning characters dumb this is usually done in bad horror movies. These and many other reasons don't make this movie a good reason to go to cinema. This is a Sunday's afternoon movie to watch with the family while pictionary is played so that we don't take the movie too seriously.".

The story is great the acting is pretty good. There were a few moments where the story was broken but was not a big issue within the whole story. The story is about a terrorist blowing a ship where there was a celebration of the Navy. Denzel investigates the crime and finds some clues that don't make sense. He is invited to work with a special investigation unit because he is a local and a smart detective. There are pretty original action scenes that were shot clearly unlike Domino where the camera was shaky and fuzzy all the time. If you like an action movie with some good story this is the movie for you. TRIVIA The word Dejavu is not mentioned even once in the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though moderately entertaining there are too many things you have to overlook to make it one cohesive movie. So let's begin. Let's first overlook the fact that the movie butchers physics you would think they'd at least bring someone on staff that knows SOMETHING about wormholes etc. to at least attempt to ground this movie in science. They didn't. Since it's a fictional movie this is forgivable  we'll overlook that it producing wormholes can't possibly happen and the science behind it is laughable. Secondly they never really explain why there are two of him  is this some sort The Prestige ripoff? My thought is if you send someone into the past  that's changing the past and there is only one of the person you're not cloning someone  they use all this fake science mumbojumbo to make you try to answer your own question or just ignore the fact there's two of him. Give me a concrete answer on why there's two of him and how he makes it back to the future when it hasn't worked beforewhy this time? because it's Denzel? It also seems they kind of just ignore the fact he most probably killed his partner probably 4050 people on the highway by driving recklesslyif not killed paralyzed to save the girl that he had a crush on real romantic. Let's also overlook all the scenes where they spied on the girl in the shower and changing  because they should be arrested for that considering that's pretty illegal and inappropriate. I'm going to start rambling so bear with me she pulls a gun on him and he makes a joke that he didn't know that was going to happen  but he really should have they pass it off as a joke because they can't explain that scene. The ending where they drive the truck off of the boat  in a stroke of divine intervention they crash through all the immobile cars with the distance they had  maximum they could be going 15 MPH  yet they plow through and manage to not only drive the truck OFF the ship but get it way up in the air to flip around. That's impressive! My last huge qualm about the movie is when he heads towards the bayou at the end he's in SUCH a hurry  yet  at the girl's house they spend so much time bandaging him and are in no hurry. That scene would lack ANY suspense if they hurried up at her house and didn't park right out front of the Bayou.In my opinion this movie would have been better served having Denzel die  the girl get sucked into the ships propeller to have her fingers cut off and wash up on the ocean shore to show that you can't mess around with the past or to elaborate more on the 'human sacrifice' line of the movie.".

I will not make the same mistake....The movie itself is a complex of thrillerdramaactionSciFi and i have to say that Tony Scott did a very good job especially for his action scenes. Denzel and Val are very good but the applause goes for Jim and the new girl Paula Patton. She actually steals the first role from Denzel. And Jim who plays for about halforless an hour makes you think immediately that he is the bad guy. What more can you expect from an actor?The film has a fast pace that doesn't let you get bored and although it lasts about 2 hours it's coming to the end quite quick. I have to admit that there are some errors thecountryhurtmyfeelings explanation for the bad guy turned to a terrorist is at the least laughable the timetravel theories cannot be minimized into a 2 minutes analysis such as portrayed here but after all when you see a film of this kind you do not expect everything to be clear as the stars in the night sky without clouds of course.And that's the BIG question. Do you watch this kind of movies for entertaining reasons just simply to pass your time relaxed make your mind forget the things you worry about the rest of the day etc OR you want every single movie you watch  even a SciFiactionthriller like this one  to make you think about our cosmos and the universe and the societies and the world and whatever?Answer the question what you REALLY want and expect for any given kind of movie and i promise that you will find yourself to be more amused after you watch any film from there on.....For myself speaking this film deserves a brave 8.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was pretty much what I expected. Nothing too serious just a fun ride from the beginning till the end. The plot has this good twist in it which makes the movie interesting and there is overall pretty much the right amount of scifi and thriller blended together.What to expect from a movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer? Explosions gun fights car chases and over the top dramatized scenes. Well that's pretty much what you get from Dj Vu. The movie's enjoyable but like said before it's nothing too serious. Denzel Washington is entertaining as usual a right man for the role indeed. Don't expect this movie to contain any phenomenal role performances as that is really not the case when it comes to movies like this one. This is just another perfect example of a movie which is only made for entertaining purposes. If you want to see this and you see this it's what you expect it to be nothing more or nothing less you finish the movie with that usual smile on your face. Your entertain level is satisfied.The movie's a big clich overall quoting myself on what said before Over the top dramatized scenes. I mean it's so predictable. The cinematography almost does that all for you Fast forwarding slow motions shaking the camera the screen flashing white every now and then.. I could go on and on but oh well you get the point. That is sadly pretty much what the cinematography always does in these kind of movie nowadays. It's like every possible way of cinematography is already used before and noone tries to make anything unique anymore. You could always just cut down the clichish ways and keep it simple and normal. Well then the movies like these wouldn't actually be movies like these so the cinematography does what it's supposed to do after all. You can't complain about that now can you? The music is also used to make it more over the top and it's just a bunch of corny compositions put together to make the movie more emotional but for me it's more like a bad joke. Overall the music is also so predictable giving a random example of that Now he sees a dead man now his eyes freeze now he walks next to the body closeup shot of the body corny piano music starts playing closeup to the main character's eyes now a tear drop oh how sad Yup got it right again. So predictable. Well you can't complain as then again you get what you order.Like I mentioned before the plot has this good twist in it and it does make the movie interesting. It's also a bit unique in its own way. Though it is surprising at first it's all downhill after that as then it catches that famous predictability. Well it's not as bad as you may think from that last sentence it's just is what it is. Despite from all of this negative feedback I'd still recommend the movie if you're looking for an action packed ride with a bad ass lead actor in it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deja Vu is a highaction crimedrama scifi thriller which is exactly what you would expect from Jerry Bruckheimer producer of such actionadventures as Con Air Enemy of the State National Treasure Pirates of the Caribbean and another Denzel Washington favorite Remember the Titans. The story opens with an explosion on board a New Orleans Ferry and takes the audience back through an unfolding of events that leads up to the tragic scene. Even the most modern technology hasn't gone as far as the storyline takes us. The premise is thrilling and the implications stimulate the imagination. For example how would altering the past impact people and events of the present? The acting is superb with Denzel Washington and Paula Patton as romantic leads. James Caviezel does an extraordinary job as the villain which is a departure from his role as Jesus in The Passion of the Christ. There is plenty of action and some of it violent. Be prepared to see a few corpses like those on television's CSI or Crossing Jordon. There are gun fights but with a minimum of blood. While the movie is certainly intense much of the severe action is implicit and takes place off camera. For an action packed PG13 movie I was particularly impressed with the limited amount of rough language. I imagine with Denzel and James in the cast there was an effort to keep it clean. This is one of the few remaining Touchstone Pictures releases. Parent company Walt Disney Studios is committed to producing action movies that appeal to a wider family audience. We're awarding Deja Vu the Dove FamilyApproved Seal at for audience members over age 12.www.dove.org Parents should look over the violent content issues before deciding whether to bring tweens along.".

That is pictured by a slogan saying Katrina only made us stronger. Then there's the Fox News helicopter being the only one covering the ferry. Of course the whole movie seems part of the relentless post 911 scare mongering tactics. Too many direct and indirect allusions to support the troops and mission accomplished makes it a blatant propaganda piece. The little scifi part was absolutely pathetic. Don't get me wrong I like being lied to for entertainment's sake but way too many trivial things didn't add up.The acting while backed by names like Denzel and Val was not anywhere near what the standard of a good movie. The only thing the movie had going for it was the very good job Tony Scott did with the action scenes. All in all go see this one if you're a lobotomized action fan. Otherwise better skip it.".

Of course the whole movie seems part of the relentless post 911 scare mongering tactics. Too many direct and indirect allusions to support the troops and mission accomplished makes it a blatant propaganda piece. The little scifi part was absolutely pathetic. Don't get me wrong I like being lied to for entertainment's sake but way too many trivial things didn't add up.The acting while backed by names like Denzel and Val was not anywhere near what the standard of a good movie. The only thing the movie had going for it was the very good job Tony Scott did with the action scenes. All in all go see this one if you're a lobotomized action fan. Otherwise better skip it.";

	schema:headline " Black Narcissus is a story of ghosts wind faith frustration sexual tension and madness.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen Black Narcissus in three different ways.  First I saw it in a movie theater when I was 7 or 8 with my mother.  I remembered it as being beautiful to look at and rather strange and I fell in love with the idea of The Roof of The World.I next encountered Black Narcissus as an older adult.  I purchased Black Narcissus in VHS format.  I devoured the film scene by scene.The film is ravishing spectral and profound. The idea of someone being given a trust much heavier to bare than their abilities can handle opens the door to all sorts of possibilities.  The suggestion that all the nun's had lives before they became nuns and not all of them are suited to The Life adds depth and tension.  The introduction of a barechested handsome man in shorts adds lust and temptation to the mix.One of the best characters in the film is one that no other poster has mentioned.  The marvelous character actress who plays the role of Aiyah the caretaker of The General's House of Women.  A woman who is already slightly mad when the film begins.  A woman who lives in the glorious past of the place.  She conjures ghosts. She casts shadows.  She has a voice as harsh as a parrot's.  She is priceless and wonderful in every scene for she is not just mad but wise.  She is the key to The House of Women.In the Alfred Hitchcock film of Rebecca Mrs. Danvers the mad housekeeper of Manderly asks the new Mrs. DeWinter Do you believe that the dead come back to watch the living?  In Black Narcissus the viewer gets the feeling that just around the next turn or at the top of the stairs is one of The General's Women watching these odd women who live without men.A previous poster mentioned the superb sense of place in the film and I agree.  The Palace is a player.  It has a personality and a mystery of its own. So is the everpresent wind.  Jack Cardiff the genius who performed miracles with light and painted backdrops to photograph a film set in the Himalayas without ever leaving England can't be praised highly enough.The cast is splendid.  Deborah Kerr's tortured Sister Clodagha registers every emotion every longing every doubt and every fear with her eyes and the set of her chin. Dame Flora Robson better known as Elizabeth I in so many films portrays Sister Philippa the nun in spiritual crisis.  Her I think it is this place.  You can see too far.  I think you either have to give in to it like Mr. Dean or leave neatly sums up the entire film. When she can't bring herself to plant vegetables instead of the flowers she loves she knows she MUST leave or lose herself and all she has worked for forever.  Judith Furse the capable and sturdy Sister Brione has no such concerns. Hers is an unquestioning faith.  Kathleen Byron as Sister Ruth the extra burden the Mother Superior foists on Sister Clodagha as a test of her dedication and skill at managing a small but dynamic group of womenis excellent in her demanding role as the nun who cracks.A beautiful young Jean Simmons is sensuous as Kanchi who seduces Sabu who is very good as the young Prince who has set himself to learn just about everything and who thinks the nun's shunning men Isn't very nice. After all Christ was a man... He is named Black Narcissus by Sister Ruth.David Ferrar as Mr. Dean may have given in to the place but he is still civilized enough to empathize with Sister Clodagha and resist Sister Ruth's advances.  He has predicted that the nuns will last until the rains come...Black Narcissus is filled with magic images and haunting echos.  The flowering of the snows scene is breathtaking. The chapel scene frightening and tense.  The Bell scene horrifying. The final view of The House of Women viewed by Sister Clodagha from the valley below is heartstopping A mist rises slowly and inch by inch blots out the Palace until it is only a dream in your mind's eye. Then a large leaf is seen.  One drop falls. Then another like tears of regret.  A black umbrella is opened.  Mr. Dean sits on his pony and runs his hand through his thick black hair.  He had said the nuns would be gone with the first rain and he was right.Brian Easdale's brilliant score underlines the changing moods and the mounting terror but never overwhelms the action.My most recent encounter with Black Narcissus is the new Criterion DVD. The commentary and behindthescenes photographs and the marvelous documentary Painting with Light is as extraordinary as the film.  It is a revelation. The sharper image doesn't bother me as much as it does a previous poster but I do when I have friends over to watch Black Narcissus start with the VHS film and then put on the DVD for the special features.  That way I get the best of both worlds.If you love great films great acting or just stunning cinematography purchase Black Narcissus.  It will haunt you forever.".

In Black Narcissus the viewer gets the feeling that just around the next turn or at the top of the stairs is one of The General's Women watching these odd women who live without men.A previous poster mentioned the superb sense of place in the film and I agree.  The Palace is a player.  It has a personality and a mystery of its own. So is the everpresent wind.  Jack Cardiff the genius who performed miracles with light and painted backdrops to photograph a film set in the Himalayas without ever leaving England can't be praised highly enough.The cast is splendid.  Deborah Kerr's tortured Sister Clodagha registers every emotion every longing every doubt and every fear with her eyes and the set of her chin. Dame Flora Robson better known as Elizabeth I in so many films portrays Sister Philippa the nun in spiritual crisis.  Her I think it is this place.  You can see too far.  I think you either have to give in to it like Mr. Dean or leave neatly sums up the entire film. When she can't bring herself to plant vegetables instead of the flowers she loves she knows she MUST leave or lose herself and all she has worked for forever.  Judith Furse the capable and sturdy Sister Brione has no such concerns. Hers is an unquestioning faith.  Kathleen Byron as Sister Ruth the extra burden the Mother Superior foists on Sister Clodagha as a test of her dedication and skill at managing a small but dynamic group of womenis excellent in her demanding role as the nun who cracks.A beautiful young Jean Simmons is sensuous as Kanchi who seduces Sabu who is very good as the young Prince who has set himself to learn just about everything and who thinks the nun's shunning men Isn't very nice. After all Christ was a man... He is named Black Narcissus by Sister Ruth.David Ferrar as Mr. Dean may have given in to the place but he is still civilized enough to empathize with Sister Clodagha and resist Sister Ruth's advances.  He has predicted that the nuns will last until the rains come...Black Narcissus is filled with magic images and haunting echos.  The flowering of the snows scene is breathtaking. The chapel scene frightening and tense.  The Bell scene horrifying. The final view of The House of Women viewed by Sister Clodagha from the valley below is heartstopping A mist rises slowly and inch by inch blots out the Palace until it is only a dream in your mind's eye. Then a large leaf is seen.  One drop falls. Then another like tears of regret.  A black umbrella is opened.  Mr. Dean sits on his pony and runs his hand through his thick black hair.  He had said the nuns would be gone with the first rain and he was right.Brian Easdale's brilliant score underlines the changing moods and the mounting terror but never overwhelms the action.My most recent encounter with Black Narcissus is the new Criterion DVD. The commentary and behindthescenes photographs and the marvelous documentary Painting with Light is as extraordinary as the film.  It is a revelation. The sharper image doesn't bother me as much as it does a previous poster but I do when I have friends over to watch Black Narcissus start with the VHS film and then put on the DVD for the special features.  That way I get the best of both worlds.If you love great films great acting or just stunning cinematography purchase Black Narcissus.  It will haunt you forever.";

Depending on the talents of the artists involved and usually the stellar performance of one individual the results can be quite good and at times extraordinary.Now take that premise and reverse it.  What happens when you have an entire group of individuals who for some reason beyond their understanding begin to question their faith vows and purpose in life?  You have the film Black Narcissus.A group of Anglican nuns led by Deborah Kerr as Sister Clodah are sent to the Himalaya Mountains to create a school and hospital from an abandoned palace.  The palace was once called The House of Women and is rather ornately decorated with erotic art.  In the opening scenes we are told that an order of Brothers had attempted to do the same thing as the Sisters but failed.Sister Clodah obviously enjoys the fact that she has been chosen and also enjoys being in charge.  Not long after the nun's arrival their straightlaced behavior begins to loosen their discipline becomes more lax and the foundation of their selfimage begins to change.Deborah Kerr is wonderful as Sister Clodah.  There's more to her character than immediately meets the eye.  David Farrar as Mr. Dean Flora Robson as Sister Philippa Sabu as The Young General and Jean Simmons as Kanchi are a superb acting ensemble.  However it is Kathleen Byron as the emotionally disturbed Sister Ruth that you will remember the most after viewing this film.The extraordinary performances in this film are complimented visually with the flawless cinematography by Jack Cardiff.  This is one of the most beautifully composed color films I have ever seen.  I did not know that this film was shot entirely in a studio until after I had seen it several times. Some of the matte shots are extremely realistic and others look more like beautiful paintings.  All this serves to reinforce the struggle between illusion and reality and also passion and chastity.Brian Easdale's musical score is extremely effective and his use of a wordless chorus is fascinating  whether they are singing an Irish folklike song or an Indian chant.  In the climactic scene there is over 10 minutes of film time when not a single word is spoken just the chorus and orchestra.Black Narcissus brings home the point that we are all sometimes far too ambitious vulnerable obstinate passionate and alas human.".

What I will point you to are the most incredible cinematography and acting elements of this classic presentation. Technicolor is remarkably presented by Jack Cardiff and I have yet to see a movie which is so visually vibrant and pleasing. Some of the still paintings and sets at Pinewood are truly remarkable considering this picture was made over 50 years ago. Alfred Junge must take credit for those remarkable designs and sets. The acting is pure theater with an absolutely insane delivery by Kathleen Byron Sister Ruth as the emotionally fragile nun slowly loosing grip with reality. Her red lipstick scene is pure magic as is her appearance from the large wooden doors pale insane and soaked in water towards the end of the movie. What a terrific shot displaying her insanity captured in all the right mood music and color. Deborah Kerr Sister Clodagh does same amazing acting with visual delight and incredible facial expressions. Her anger scenes are quite remarkable throughout the film as she shakes with pure venom at Sister Ruth. The terror in her face where she prays alone in the chapel with Sister Ruth roaming the stairways is quite remarkable. There are many other memorable scenes with light color and music which makes this the best movie of  Powell and Pressburger IMHO. Buy the Criterion DVD and watch it endlessly.".

The film brilliantly photographed by Jack Cardiff one of the best men in the business and a frequent ally of Mr. Powell is one of the best pictures of the English cinema.

It's Mr. Dean who challenges her in asking how would her God deal with the old man. Sister Clodagh's past is revealed in flashbacks when she was a young woman and in love with a young man who wanted to emigrate to America and she wasn't ready to follow him.Also Sister Ruth who is a rebel decides to abandon the order because she is in love with Mr. Dean. The highlight of the film is the scene in which Ruth begins applying the deep red lipstick which makes quite a contrast with her beautiful reddish hair to the horror of Sister Clodagh who clearly is not prepared for the desertion.There is also an undercurrent between Sister Clodagh and Mr. Dean who one feels loves her. The nun is too loyal to the principles that made her take the vows.

David Farrar is Mr. Dean the Englishman who is now living in that remote part of India and knows the people well. Kathleen Byron makes an excellent contribution as the rebel Sister Ruth.

It was a palace built for a ruler's women and every wall painting every decoration contrasts the sensuality of this society with the chaste and energetic vocation of the nuns.  Only Dean David Farrar the ruling General's Agent links the steamy life of the valley with the windblown austerity of the nunnery above.It is the destructive power of emotions reppressed and released that is most obvious in 'Black Narcissus' but more fundamental to this beautiful film is a stronger yet quieter ancient and more subtle power that of place.  The Himalayan setting is established surprisingly convincingly for the period in a series of vivid shots that disclose the fact of that landscape's power from the beginning.  And the particular quality the particular power of that place is continuously present in the wind that blows constantly stirring every fabric every soft thing.  Only as that power of place begins to work its insidious magic on the nuns does it begin to reveal its nature. Everyone there is affected their practical efforts diverted by poetry and passion.  Somehow flowers are planted not potatoes.  The Young General Sabu falls in love with a dancing girl Jean Simmons.  Two of the nuns are drawn to the rough Agent already sunk into the life of the society around him.  Sister Clodagh Deborah Kerr the Sister Superior initially drawn back to memories of her lover in Ireland remains strong in her faith yet is softened becomes more human.  Sister Ruth Kathleen Byron on the other hand becomes maddened by jealous passion and it is her tragedy itself peculiarly bound up with the geography of the place that brings the drama to an end.The testing of a few people brought together in isolation is a familiar theme but this is an unusual example.  'Black Narcissus' has an unusual symmetry acceptance of this tainted life in the person of the agent is compared with the surrender to her passions of Sister Ruth whose irrational passion in turn contrasts with the gentle loves of the Sister Clodagh the abandonment of this world by the holy contemplative who lives in the nunnery grounds contrasts with the nun's holy yet practical struggles.  So too we see the valley richly coloured but the Mopu Palace nunnery almost monochrome washed out.The project at Mopu fails the struggle against the genius of the place is abandoned. But not everything fails Sister Clodagh has become wiser and less proud.  Some struggles are too great but we learn that there can be victories in small things the Young General wins Kanchi his dancing girl.This is a fine film well acted.  David Farrar though at times uneasy in a difficult role requiring roughness and sympathy in equal measure generally manages to strike the right balance.  Kathleen Byron grows convincingly mad with jealousy and is stupendous in her dramatic final scene.  Flora Robson as Sister Phillipa tending her gardens has a small part which she plays to perfection.  Deborah Kerr is outstanding that Sister Clodagh has a fundamental sympathy disguised by pride is apparent from the beginning and the progressive disclose of the quiet loving passion of her character is finely judged.  The art direction and cinematography too is excellent the wind tugging at every fabric the sputtering candles the long shots of the landscape Sister L pausing momentarily to caress a strikingly phallic baluster.  It is astonishing that this was all achieved without leaving the suburbs of London.  The music is ravishing and in the later scenes intense.  Finally in its emphasis on the spirit of place even set in the Himalayas 'Black Narcissus' is a very British film.".

Deborah Kerr is outstanding that Sister Clodagh has a fundamental sympathy disguised by pride is apparent from the beginning and the progressive disclose of the quiet loving passion of her character is finely judged.  The art direction and cinematography too is excellent the wind tugging at every fabric the sputtering candles the long shots of the landscape Sister L pausing momentarily to caress a strikingly phallic baluster.  It is astonishing that this was all achieved without leaving the suburbs of London.  The music is ravishing and in the later scenes intense.  Finally in its emphasis on the spirit of place even set in the Himalayas 'Black Narcissus' is a very British film.";

With her she brings several other nuns a levelheaded Judith Furse an older nun Flora Robson and a neophyte Kathleen Byron. The strange atmosphere of this remote region affects all those involved. Ruth Kathleen Byron falls hopelessly in love with a British jackofall trades and local agent David Farrar. The surrounding events and Farrar's presence also rekindle Kerr's memories of a failed love affair she once had with a young man Shaun Noble. When Noble left her life Jesus Christ entered and Kerr became a nun. Jean Simmons plays a beautiful beggar girl who is placed in the care of Kerr by Farrar. Simmons later becomes Prince Dilip Raj's Sabu's wife of sorts. The most stunning scenes occur toward the end of the movie. Ruth's mental disintegration and her pathetic pass at Farrar are very sad. Ruth's change in appearance is visually riveting as much perhaps as Isabelle Adjani's transformation in The Story of Adele H. The performances by Kerr and Byron are superlative their facial expressions revealing deep heartfelt emotion and pain. If you think Holly Hunter did a great nonspeaking acting job in The Piano see Black Narcissus for a real revelation!This PowellPressburger film is one of the most beautifully photographed color movies ever made. Black Narcissus won two Academy awards for art direction and cinematography. It would take over 3 decades for a comparable film Days of Heaven to come along. If you are fortunate enough to have viewed the laserdisc version of the movie you will be able to listen to Powell and Scorsese do a running commentary of the movie. Toward the end you will learn how the final scene was shot to a film score and not the other way around.".

All the nuns of the order are repressing something from maternal instincts in one love of nature in another culminating in the contrast from Sister Clodagh's own haunted memories of her thwarted young love to of course Bryon's barely controlled passion which ultimately leads to her own death and communal defeat for the sisterhood as the nuns wind their way back down the hill at the film's conclusion. Director Powell prefigures each major section of the film with scenes of changes in the seasons with the budding of spring leading ultimately to an explosion of passion in Bryon's character which ends in disaster. The casting is unusual  Kerr  Bryon do seem too young and for want of a better term no offence meant to nuns worldwide attractive for their parts while there's an early part for Jean Simmons as an errant native girl who successfully Salome  like ensnares the general's young son played by Sabu in a counterpoint to Bryon's attempted seduction of Ferrar. Memorable scenes come in waves  Powell presenting scenes reminiscent of Oriental and Indian tableaux in lurid colour utilising huge angular shadowed close ups of his leads betraying their inner feelings. Ultimately it's the justly famous arousal of Sister Ruth which lingers longest in the memory take your pick from her scene making up her face opposite the chaste Kerr her eerie looming before Kerr by the bell climaxing of course in their fateful struggle at the bell tower. Unreal and highly stylised it may be but for me this as engrossing and beautiful as cinema gets.".

One is a close up of Sister Ruth and another is of the jungle right after a very important act occurs. Sorry avoiding spoilers spoils reviews. Whatever Spoiler just in case and I was not as taken as some by Kathleen Byron's performance as Sister Ruth. I felt it lacked subtlety. Every time we see her she's got them keerazy eyes. It just strained credibility too much to have her behave so brazenly when for God's sake she's a nun! Not that they don't have inner lives but it went beyond permissible boundaries without proper reprimand and it felt like they were avoiding the issue instead of addressing it and finding a way for her to go nutty anyway. Also they stir the pot so it looks like the natives are going to kill the nuns then the Ruth plot which is only circumstantially tied to that plot contrivance becomes the main focus then they completely forget that there was supposed to be danger.I also did not love the attitude towards the natives. I didn't just want some politically correct concessions but they are all described as children throughout and the script has them all behave like children throughout.I was very surprised that was Jean Simmons. Quite a transformation.David Farrar was serviceable but the part is underwritten. He should have a sign on his hairychest that says charming rogue. He does little to merit the fuss made over him or to suggest that the character has greater depths.Even the title is referred to only in passing as a label for Sabu's character and then forgotten and it isn't really quite apt as it relates to vanity and not temptation as it would be more appropriate to.Quite a good score wonderful cinematography although I believe the other comment about color processes is correct and there are moments where Powell's sheer intelligence shines through but they are rare.On the whole I don't quite understand why this film has acquired its epic reputation on the whole it leaves too much out not to the imagination just out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having enjoyed the recent release of Jean Renoir's The River on the Criterion Collection DVD I was looking forward to seeing this film adaptation of yet another exotically set Rumer Godden book. As it turns out this 1947 classic is far more enthralling thanks to the visionary filmmaking team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger an intriguing plot line focused on the conflict between devotion and desire and a sterling cast headed by 26year old Deborah Kerr as Sister Clodagh a precursor to her similarly themed work in Heaven Knows Mr. Allison ten years later.The beautifully photographed movie tells an unusual tale of Anglican nuns who establish a convent in an extremely remote region of the Himalayas called Mopu. Chosen in Calcutta by her Mother Superior Sister Clodagh becomes the Sister Superior one of the youngest ever chosen of the convent. Her primary task is a daunting one to convert a donated sultan's palace into a convent transforming it from a residence for concubines to a school and a hospital.

Amazingly the film makes extensive use of matte paintings and large scale landscape paintings the artwork is by Peter Ellenshaw to suggest the mountainous environment of the Himalayas. The cast is mostly quite effective. In one of her first starring roles Kerr is superb as Sister Clodagh providing the right shadings to her conflictridden character. However it is Kathleen Byron who looks eerily like Cate Blanchett as the deranged Sister Ruth and a 17year old Jean Simmons as Kanchi who threaten to steal the picture. The suspenseful climax will remind you a bit of Hitchcock's Vertigo made 11 years later. This is a fascinating subtly erotic film about repression and duty sometimes melodramatic but constantly affecting and quite worthy of viewing.".

	onyx:emotionText "Having enjoyed the recent release of Jean Renoir's The River on the Criterion Collection DVD I was looking forward to seeing this film adaptation of yet another exotically set Rumer Godden book. As it turns out this 1947 classic is far more enthralling thanks to the visionary filmmaking team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger an intriguing plot line focused on the conflict between devotion and desire and a sterling cast headed by 26year old Deborah Kerr as Sister Clodagh a precursor to her similarly themed work in Heaven Knows Mr. Allison ten years later.The beautifully photographed movie tells an unusual tale of Anglican nuns who establish a convent in an extremely remote region of the Himalayas called Mopu. Chosen in Calcutta by her Mother Superior Sister Clodagh becomes the Sister Superior one of the youngest ever chosen of the convent. Her primary task is a daunting one to convert a donated sultan's palace into a convent transforming it from a residence for concubines to a school and a hospital.

	schema:headline " Excellent film with a ridiculous story";
	schema:reviewBody "This film amounts to an astounding array of cinematic techniques and artistry put in the service of a fairly conventional and even quaint story. In order to fully enjoy this film I would have to turn my brain off. The fundamental idea of the story is that there is some qualitative difference which amounts to an excess of earthly sensualism in this remote mountain location that is responsible for shaking the religious faith of a group of nuns and even driving one Flora Robson beyond the brink of sanity. I find this premise naive and so the entire film despite its sometimes astounding beauty falls apart for me.Another problem is that Deborah Kerr is such a good actress she makes the relatively average talents of the rest of the cast almost a painful detriment. Sabu is a corny actor whose attempts to be cute are irritating it's like he imagines he's still a child star and his perfunctory romance with the young native girl played by Jean Simmons comes off as an afterthought in the movie. David Farrar has the right rugged screen presence but can't act either to save his life. The big fireworks are reserved for Robson whose performance is mostly made up of lighting effects and makeup  and thank the cinematic gods for that because otherwise it's a thoroughly clichd and dull performance.But Kerr makes up for some of that... she truly was a genius. The way her eyes flash in the climactic scene when she whirls around thinking to confront Robson in the small church that's what I call the goods. She's one in a million. Too bad even she can't rescue the embarrassing flashback sequences where she has to go through the motions of the typical doomed young romance. She's anything but convincing as a naive emotional young girl.Her character is deeply repressed and even though the film shows that the life she's living is a huge lie it expects us to accept her vocation as some kind of noble sacrifice. Now I was raised Catholic but I never heard of an Order that requires its adherents to renew their vows on an annual basis. This seems like just a very idiotic literary device included to provide some kind of dramatic impulse to the potential romance between Kerr and Farrar's characters.Even more troubling to me is the film's naive argument that this particular place is so sensual that it represents a threat to the ascetic philosophy of the nuns. Surely these nuns never should have been in a convent in the first place if they are so upset by a little fresh air and a nice view. And this is compounded by the film's insulting and patronizing depiction of the native people of the region  Farrar's character describes them as children and nothing in the film contradicts this idea. However what's truly bizarre and compelling is that the actual artifice of the film itself all done in a studio does seem to give this naive premise a very tangible quality as if it were plausible. I don't think you could get the same effect with natural lighting and images. So what really should seem silly instead seems sublime. Still the whole idea of the film is based on an illusion. The film did have a chance to push this into a higher gear by acknowledging it and transcending it but instead squandered the chance on cheap dramatics and a brief action scene between the two contentious nuns.This is a very hard film to talk about. I think it is a film of great beauty but it has nothing meaningful to say about the real world or about the real problems of people. Perhaps if you can watch a movie and disconnect from all feeling that there is such a thing as a real world outside the movie then this could be one of the great films of all time. It truly is that much of a technical feat. But for me it's basically a very well made adaptation of what seems to be a pretty lame novel. I only wish that all this talent could have been poured into something that I could believe in.".

	schema:reviewBody "Black Narcissus is one of those films that no matter how many recommendations you get or how many plot synopses you read probably won't make you want to rush out and buy it. After all the story  nuns struggling to set up a convent in the Himalayas  won't grab many people. But Black Narcissus is far more than just a plot  it's one of the most vibrant exciting and  how can I put it?  hysterical films ever made. Once again Michael Powell pushes the possibilities of cinema to their extremes to show you a story.First of all Black Narcissus has to be the most visually beautiful film I have ever seen. The set design and shot composition hark back to both German Expressionist films and the work of Dutch painter Vermeer. Joined together with the breathtaking scenery in actual fact carefully painted backdrops and gorgeous Technicolor every single frame is a work of art.Michael Powell had of course made a few great colour pictures before this but this is probably his most assured use of Technicolor. Part of this is down to the amazing cinematography of Jack Cardiff but Powell also shows a brilliant mind for colour scheme. Like in Life and Death of Colonel Blimp he picks fairly neutral almost monochrome shades which give the really bold colours a greater impact when they appear. It's no accident that this order of nuns uses white habits  white symbolising purity like a wedding dress. In Kathleen Byron's first major scene her habit is splattered with blood and by the end of the film she is wearing all red. The nun's peakshaped cowls also resemble the snowy mountains that surround them on all sides although ironically not nearly as permanent or immovable.This is also one of the earliest examples I can think of where one genre is played as another. Black Narcissus is really a drama played as a horror. Those German Expressionist films referenced with the wonky set design and artistic shot composition  Cabinet of Dr Caligari Nosferatu Faust etc  were horrors. Most of the film with its whites and blues its large cavernous halls and not to mention the wind howling through every set has a feeling of cold eeriness. This builds up to the final halfhour which has a contrastingly hot aura of hot terror culminating in a sequence that is the equal of the last five minutes of Nosferatu.The use of music was Powell's best up to that point. Like the best silent film scoring the imagery is often perfectly matched up to the score by Brian Easdale. This is particularly nicely done in the wordless courtship between Sabu and Jean Simmons. There was a growing musical dimension to Powell and Pressburger's films which would reach its peak with The Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffmann.Michael Powell's films were generally as daring in terms of their ideas as they were in style and his collaborator Emeric Pressburger is really half the secret of his success. Black Narcissus has often been noted as being rather risqu and ahead of its time in portraying sexual tension and in a convent of all places! But it is also quite bold in its statements about the British Empire and it's perhaps no surprise that this was made one year before India gained its independence. The whole thing could be read as an allegory for the colonies biting back but it's the smaller details that really struck me. The attitude of the nuns towards the natives is at best patronising and at worst arrogant but they are constantly being surprised and proved wrong. For example in one scene Deborah Kerr walks past the holy man's tree talking about him as if he wasn't there only for David Farrar to point out that the old man once served with the British Army and apparently speaks perfect English.There isn't a single weak link in this picture the actors being no exception. Deborah Kerr and Flora Robson are their usual brilliant selves. The great Esmond Knight makes a all too brief appearance. Sabu one of the most naturalistic young actors of his era puts in perhaps the best performance of the film with some of the playfulness of his role in Thief of Bagdad but with an edge of maturity and an almost dangerous feel in some scenes. There's also an appearance very young Jean Simmons who in my opinion outdoes her better known adult performances. Her character is almost entirely mute but she communicates plenty in her face and body language. Then there's David Farrar who like another Powell regular Roger Livesy was never a star but always a great actor. But the performance that really sticks in the mind is Kathleen Byron who looks manages to look positively demonic with the help of a little lighting and makeup that is.A decade or so later Fred Zinnemann would make The Nun's Story a film with many similarities in plot but stylistically completely different. Whereas The Nun's Story has a detailed realism to it Black Narcissus is a vibrant clashing melodrama with everything turned up to eleven. It's perfectly made and the only reason I can think of for anyone not liking it is that they might find it too overthetop  so much for the storyline sounding dull! As the tagline says this truly is drama at the top of the world.".

This is my favorite of all of Powell's films every frame is a work of art. It is difficult to believe that this movie was not really filmed in the Himalayas. The juxtapositioning of the closed innerdirected world of the convent with the sweeping panorama of the world's highest mountains is the point of the film we are simultaneously within the vast universe and within the confines of ourselves. Black Narcissus has another special thing to recommend it  a suitable role for the woefully underappreciated Sabu. He was the most natural of performers with a wonderful screen presence. The way he is shot by Jack Cardiff shows just what a handsome and regal presence he had. I have read that the story's author Rumer Godden was unhappy with the casting of Sabu for the part of the Young General and said some very unpleasant things about him. She was wrong. If Sabu were around today he would be a major international star. Most of the studios he worked for simply didn't know what to do with him  the times just weren't right. We are fortunate to be able to see him in this excellent movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 'King and I' meets 'Vertigo'Numerous times I've found that movies I stumble across while flipping channels in the middle of the night suggest some profundity and importance that dissipates entirely when I rent the same movie and start from the beginning. I wish I had left this as a halfunderstood oneiric fragment instead of seeing how little is going on in it. The script barely gives voiceor presence to the tensions that are supposedly driving these women bonkers. It has other primarily visual charms but for me that adds up to a mixed bag. Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first. The 50's produced a number of films that must've stuck in the minds of the filmmakers who came of age in the 70s and produced that decade's filmart renaissance strange little films that were trying to break out of genre constraints that took the viewers out of the mainstream viewpoint. This is one. Summertime is another. They try very hard to be fresh but ultimately they don't know what narrative will be in the future so much as they know what color photography and an attitude towards film could be. The results are intriguing halfmeasures.Kerr plays another enormous controlfreak but here she shows an iron will missing from the rest of her handwringing career. Sister Clodagh is from Ireland as is Kerr who oddly affects an English accent. Clodagh selfrighteously speechifies about what a hardworking order she's in but she's never shown so much as lifting a feather. She does tell others to work harder though. As a protagonist this make her ahem. rather unappealing and we come to resent her like Sister Ruth does. But back in the day when you could count on audiences reared by jerky nuns like this it might've played differently. Sister Clodagh seemingly imagines god is most pleased with her when she's being a major tightass so she punitively seeks out any sign of independent thought. God is just an excuse that someone like this use to get you to yield to her will. The 3 things you'll remember the artifice the set and the powerful use of color. And though not filmed 'on location' shooting outdoor scenes outdoors is still very novel for this era. The film is legitimately known for it's striking photography and it's ability to conjure up India in the middle of England sometimes more successfully than others. The miniature of the convent never successfully jumps scale. And birds disappear as they fly under the matte painting in an opening shot. !? But it's England and this type of effectsbased synthesis is rarely attempted so you have to cut it some slack. More intriguing is the complete artifice of the milieus with heightened color schemes and a haunting wind the psychological space is key here. On the bad side the first drops of the final rainstorm are absolutely absurd. How can you solve such major problems Technicolor and get tripped up on such trifling dumb details? Ditto for Sister Ruth's symmetrical bloodstains paint on her habit. How the hell did bloody handprints get there?The crazy housekeeper who's a nitwit is straight out of Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte people seem to enjoy her performance. The young general Sabu here is a complete closet case who wants to wear brocade  ermine cheap perfume and hang out with women. If he has a single nerveending interested in the hotty beggarwoman Jean Simmons then I'm Bea Arthur. He couldn't arouse anything in a nun but contempt. His subplot is DOA. Although originally I found too little occurring in the plot I find loads in it now after several viewings. There are some shocking entries by the denunnified Sister Ruth who is rapidly going completely out of her gourd.INFLUENCES This is practically a companion piece for Vertigo. And the siting of the convent is stolen directly from the hilltop lamasery in Lost Horizon  It's placed in the exact same disposition on the left on a precipice with a valley below on the right. Some dishonest authorship there.".

About an allCanadian interceptorfighter built in the late '50's that was years if not decades ahead of its time.  The true story shows the development of The Arrow a plane capable of Mach 2 but also the politics that ultimately doom the project.  I am glad that it was not ALL blame the Americans as it showed Canadian internal politics personality conflicts personal flaws.....  and ........ yes....... The Americans who didn't want the competition in aviation from North of the border.This ranks right up there with space and aviation films like THE RIGHT STUFF and FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON.  It is also a great story of concepts ahead of their time getting squashed like the film TUCKER A Man and His Dream.  A similar story might be though not yet on film to my knowledge about Jack Northrop and his flying wing which had a similar development and fate in the US.  Of course Northrop's concept was validated with the B2......  But I digress........Though the budget was low a Canadian Miniseries after all they did the most with what they had.  The choice of RC models for most of the flying scenes was a good choice!  It gave the look of the film an organic feel as opposed to the CG effects which were soso.  I hope they donated the fullsize mockups to a museum!If you love stories about aviation space engineering or cold war history this is one to find on tape or DVD or search for on cable!  A must see!".

This is one of the few movies I've seen that made me interested enough in the subject matter to want to learn more about the real Arrow. This is a very serious movie with lots of technical information but is fascinating. It is also interesting because the development of the Arrow is completely unknown to most people even people interested in planes and aerospace. Even though it focuses on technology the movie is a character study in how the individuals developing the plane are affected by political and management decisions they have no part of. Note to Ackroyd comedy fans this is not a comedy and although this may be some of the best acting Ackroyd has done this is definitely not his most sympathetic character.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those that don't know the history the Avro Arrow project was a Canadian interceptor project from the late 1950s. It was cancelled due to excessive cost and to a perception that interceptor aircraft were obsolete in the wake of Sputnik and the development of ICBMs. Subsequently the Arrow program has become the basis of a Canadian cottage industry of book publishing and conspiracy theory about why the cancellation occurred the involvement of the dastardly Americans the downfall of the Canadian aircraft industry etc.This program is interesting in many respects  most particularly the use of CGI to show what a flying Arrow would have looked like and the use of a nearfull scale mock up of an Arrow as set dressing in many scenes. The Arrow was a very large aircraft and building a mock up was a major proposition. Genuine archive footage of the original Arrow is also used. The set design does a good job of setting the scene for the story.Where the program falls down is in the story itself. Some posters here have suggested that history needs to be mythologized a bit to make it palatableinteresting. I don't agree with this as a general rule and certainly not in this case as the story is every bit as interesting just as it occurred. I understand the need to compress characters and keep a story simple enough to fit in a reasonable duration but there's no need to generate a whole pile of total fiction to fill out the story. The important issue is that many people who watch this program will think that it's 100 historically accurate  An impression that the program doesn't try very hard to correct. The story is very heavily fictionalized and diverges significantly from the established history.The one good part of all this is that one of the extras on the DVD release of The Arrow is the one hour CBC documentary Dateline  There Never was an Arrow from 1980. This is probably the most informative and balanced examination of the Arrow program and was unavailable for many years. If you want some light entertainment watch The Arrow  It's not bad just don't take the story seriously. If you want to know the true history see the Dateline documentary or the Avro Arrow book by Ron Page et. al. from Boston Mills Press.".

First viewed it on CBC in December of 1997. I bought the movie direct from CBC I was so impressed. Dan Akroyd plays an executive with the right stuff to make Canada's Avro corporation a success.  Character development was fabulous as you see how his professional and personal life affect each other. A few fictitious characters are introduced to help add depth.  For example one of the lead engineers is a female developed in this movie to represent all females who contributed to the Arrow's success. It is a true representation of the actual events.  Political influence from the government in Canada's business sector.  Governmental influence of the United States and Europe on Canada.  The fight for political power within Canada.  And the struggle for air superiority in the 1950's. It also is a very real portrayal of the challenges of producing an aircraft. The engineering team includes all facets of design.  The unrealistic expectations and design specifications.  But most importantly the dedication of the employees to make Canada a great country and respected in the political and economical arenas. This movie is a long detailed drama that starts slow and keeps rolling down hill.  I recommend that those with any interest in the aforementioned items it is worth the time for your viewing pleasure and historical knowledge.".

This film has a lot of faults but the film producers like the plane manufacturer itself had an uphill battle just trying to get this fourhour miniseries made. It looks like Dan Ackroyd is ideal for playing Avro president Crawford Gordon and I understand that Ackroyd as a child actually met Gordon. The rest of the cast play sympathetic characters well although I don't know how true to life they are. However Robert Haley and Michael Moriarty do bad impressions of John Diefenbaker and Dwight Eisenhower which is a shame given Dief's reallife colour. The political bias shown against the Conservative Party and for the Liberal Party is a little shocking. Much dramatic license is taken with the actual story.  Spoilers Follow  Computerized piloting was not really included in the final prototype planes. The real design called for the planes to be fitted with nuclear missiles but that detail is conveniently omitted from the story. There were actually no key leaders at Avro who were female so the charming Sara Botsford is inserted for gender balance and romantic interest as a key singlemother engineer. However I found out about these dramatizations because the show impressed me so much that I read the nonfiction book that it was based on. Therefore I have to admit that the show works for me. If you like invention stories then you should like The Arrow. If you are a Canadian who has some patriotism then know that this is one of those rare specimens that appeal to Canadian patriotism. After the catastrophic way in which the Arrow project ended I found nothing so poignant and bittersweet as the long list shown before the closing credits of Avro talent that left Canada to help lead the development of Apollo Concorde and the Space Shuttle.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Arrow is a compelling story of inventive and persistent people who strive to make an impossible airplane. Overcoming setback after setback a team of Canadian engineers managers and workers create one of the fastest and most capable fighterinterceptors in the world. This somewhat fictionalized miniseries effectively pulls the viewer into their struggles much as From The Earth To The Moon created a feeling for the efforts behind the U.S. Apollo program. Indeed the parallels between the American Apollo program and the Canadian Arrow program are subtly drawn several times in the film many of the engineers who worked on the Arrow went stateside to work on the Saturn V and the Lunar Module. About halfway through the 3hour film it becomes apparent that the true challenges to the Arrow project are not engineering or practical problems but political realities. Unlike the journey to the moon the goal of building the world's greatest airplane cannot survive the conflicts of personalities vagaries of public opinion and budget overruns that plague any huge engineering project.The film effectively depicts the drama of the project. However even if one overlooks the factual discrepancies the film suffers from a few flaws 1 The film is a bit slow in some places and certainly feels as if it were padded to fill the time for a twopart miniseries. If it had been paced differently or edited down by 30 minutes or so it certainly would have flowed better. 2 While most of the characters are based on real people and indeed seem fleshedout rather well the film also includes a composite character representing all the female workers on the Arrow project. This character seems artificial and out of place much like the Charlton Heston character in the movie Midway she seems to be everywhere doing everything and thus comes across as a caricature. This is not helped by the performance of Sara Botsford who seems to be playing the role as if she is thinking my character is 50 of the population dammit. 3 Some of the other casting seems odd. For example Michael Moriarty is a fine actor but he is singularly unconvincing as Ike.Despite its flaws this is an entertaining and inspiring film if you enjoy stories of people who strive to achieve.".

Unlike the journey to the moon the goal of building the world's greatest airplane cannot survive the conflicts of personalities vagaries of public opinion and budget overruns that plague any huge engineering project.The film effectively depicts the drama of the project. However even if one overlooks the factual discrepancies the film suffers from a few flaws 1 The film is a bit slow in some places and certainly feels as if it were padded to fill the time for a twopart miniseries. If it had been paced differently or edited down by 30 minutes or so it certainly would have flowed better. 2 While most of the characters are based on real people and indeed seem fleshedout rather well the film also includes a composite character representing all the female workers on the Arrow project. This character seems artificial and out of place much like the Charlton Heston character in the movie Midway she seems to be everywhere doing everything and thus comes across as a caricature. This is not helped by the performance of Sara Botsford who seems to be playing the role as if she is thinking my character is 50 of the population dammit. 3 Some of the other casting seems odd. For example Michael Moriarty is a fine actor but he is singularly unconvincing as Ike.Despite its flaws this is an entertaining and inspiring film if you enjoy stories of people who strive to achieve.";

The movie will make you feel sick in your stomach just like Saw and Hostel but what separates Dread from other movies in the same genre is the level of intellectual incorporated into this movie. Yes I am talking about intellectual that is very sick but again there is no limit to humans intellectual.Cast wise I don't know anyone. I have no idea whether they are small timers or novice at all but all of them did a very good job. I have seen low budget independent movies starring actors who don't even know the basics of acting just pretty faces. But Dread steers itself clear by its cast which does a very good job.The best thingor rather sick thing about this movie is that even though it lacks the blood gore and violence of Saw or Hostel or Texas Chainsaw you still feel sick by the events in the movie. Cause Dread showcase human's limit when faced with the thing they most fear in a very naturalistic way. The dark setting throughout the movie greatly adds to the overall sordid atmosphere.Overall watch this movie. But one thing it's not for faint hearted. Even though it's not a horror movie with creepy creatures and gore it will disgust you for sure.My Verdict 710".

With the help of fellow student Abby Hanne Steen the advert is placed and the camera begins to roll on a series of interviews as the trio start to document their findings. However each of the three has their own fears to deal with not least of all Quaid whose childhood is stained by a terrible trauma...Having never read the original short story by Clive Barker Hellraiser Lord Of Illusions that Dread is based upon i wasn't certain what to expect from this movie. Last year we were given the impressive and criminally overlooked Midnight Meat Train also based upon a Clive Barker story and Dread continues the trend of incredible horror movies adapted from his work.Dread takes its time setting up its premise but i hesitate to call it slowmoving. Every scene is important to the story and the chemistry between the three leads ensures that you keep watching. There is a real tension in Dread as Quaid's behaviour becomes more erratic whilst his obsession with the project starts to grow to dangerous levels. By the point at which the taped confessions are no longer enough for him the audience has spent enough time with the characters to feel uncomfortable at what might occur next. It's rare to find a horror movie where you feel genuinely sorry for the victims.It's also good to see a movie about students which appears to be set in the real world rather than a stylised Hollywood version of it these are multidimensional young adults rather than catalogue models reciting hip dialogue to one another. The cast is excellent without a bad performance to be found. Evans impresses as a character who is capable of moving from charming to dangerous without blinking but the standout would have to be Laura Donelly who plays a girl with a gigantic birthmark covering one side of her body. Although initially brimming with confidence her heartbreaking vulnerability gradually rises to the surface and you can't help but emphasise with her. Jonathon Readwin is also fantastic in a smaller role as one of the trio's interviewees. Don't be fooled into thinking that Dread will be your average teenstalker horror movie. Sure there is blood and death but this a more cerebral effort than usual a bonechilling descent into madness and obsession with a careful and deliberate pace. There are no sudden scares to be found here only a creeping sense of foreboding and a third act that will stay with you long after the credits have finished rolling. Make no mistake the final scenes in this movie are ruthless and nasty but they are also very wellwritten.Dread is a solid effort. If you are a serious horror fan this is certainly worth your time.".

This is a very well done adaptation of Barkers short story and has kept the dark and ominous feel of the original.The cinematography is masterfully done while keeping an almost home movie feel. The flickering lights and dark sets lend an eerily dreamlike feel to the bulk of the movie so that when the brighter scenes appear the contrast is quite stark.To say this movie is disturbing would be an understatement. The decent into madness depicted here is powerfully dramatic and quite intense. Not only is there violence gore and blood but a realistic view of trauma inflicted psychosis becoming complete madness.The bottom line is this. The ability to suspend disbelief is the cornerstone of any good story and this one delivers in buckets.".

Really people? A 5.6? This movie deserves at least a 7 hands down and I will tell you why.First of the acting was surprising good and since I've only ever watched Jackson Rathbone in the two Twilight where he doesn't talk barely at all I was really excited to see this guy as a man actor in a movie with more than 2 lines of dialogue. Let me tell you folks he did not fail to amaze me with his acting ability. I thought at the beginning I would only be seeing an alone depressinglaughable personality but throughout the movie he grew into a serious role that helped carry the movie further.I do not think there is a point of summarizing this movie because that's what the internet and of the back of the movie case is for but basically it's a school project based on people's worst fears and the  hits the fan in the middle of the film which is good. It's quite original and the cinematography and editing is definitely something I admire especially since I go to school for this stuff.All I can say is that you should see this film once you get the chance and you most will definitely appreciate it because it is most likely one of the best horror movies I have ever watched.".

Psychologicalhorror would be the best way to describe this movie. It plays on the deep rooted fears of people but please don't expect from this movie to give you plenty of scare moments or anything of that sort. It's not really an horror in the classic most common sense of the word. The drama plays an important part as well which only strengthens the movie its psychologicalhorror aspects. In that regard alone this movie already works out as an original and interesting one.But above all things it's also a really well done film. It has a good build up and narrative some fine actors and the movie has a good look over it as well. It's not a big budget movie that had a big cinematic release anywhere but you can't really tell that judging by the movie its looks or just overall greatness. Actually hard to believe that this was the first ever movie for director Anthony DiBlasi who was also rumored to direct the new Hellraiser movie for a while. He would had certainly been capable of it and he had worked with Clive Barker the creator of the Hellraiser franchise before which was on this movie actually that got based on a short story by Clive Barker. His approach of the horror and more serious story aspects which he shows that he is capable off with this movie would had been great for a new Hellraiser movie.The movie has a story that steadily but slowly progresses. Yet the movie becomes never a boring or dragging one because it is capable of getting you involved with the characters and their stories. It's a real intriguing movie to watch and because it's being so original you also can't really predict all the time what is going to happen next in it. No not everything works convincing or works out as strong and effective as it could had but still this movie feels like a breath a fresh air and is perfectly watchable.A nice original well done little film.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the Clive Barker short story Dread which made its world premiere at the 2009 edition of Montreal's Fantasia film festival is remarkable on two fronts Barker's striking departure from his traditional macabre story lines and Anthony DiBlasi's impressive directorial debut.The story unfolds with two college students Steve Twilight's Jackson Rathbone and Quaid Shaun Evans agreeing to work together to create a documentary of people's innermost fears. The two put out a call for candidates and document their interviews on video.An expert manipulator Quaid is able to coax these troubled souls into revealing their innermost demons deeply personal revelations they would otherwise never dream of discussing in public much less on camera. Meanwhile Quaid harbors deep seated psychological scars of his own having been a childhood survivor of the brutal home invasion axe slaying of his parents at the hands of a mysterious psycho.Espousing the belief that by confronting one's ultimate fear an individual will either overcome their phobia or be consumed by it Quaid convinces the more demure Steve and friends Cheryl and Abby to participate in the study. Unknown to everyone involved however is Quaid's desire to take things to the next level progressing beyond mere interviews to the actual physical and psychological nightmare of tackling their fears head on.DiBlasi displays a remarkably talented hand at spinning a yarn that incorporates introspective characterdriven drama and some spectacularly jolting and emotionally moving sequences. While deviating out of necessity from the plot structure of Barker's original story which didn't provide much meat for a feature length film Barker equally deserves kudos for providing DiBlasi with a twisted tale that is firmly rooted in the real world where human cruelty is infinitely more tangible and terrifying than anything the supernatural can invoke.Led by Rathbone and Evans the young cast turns in uniformly strong nuanced and intensely emotional performances not typically found in this genre. Among the standouts is Hanne Steen who plays Cheryl a friend infatuated with Steve who bears the curse of a disfiguring skin pigmentation that covers a third of her face and body. Steen deftly manages to convey her character's sensitivity and long held pain in a manner that the viewer can readily attune to earmarking her as a future talent to watch.As debuts go DiBlasi's Dread is as solid slick engaging and thought provoking as it is terrifying making this a must see not merely for fans of the genre but anyone with untold skeletons in their closet.".

Stephen partners with CherylHanne Steen an editor and the trio compile the thesis but Quaid wants more truth and trauma..it's all part of Quaid's ultimate goal to understand fear through others' dread so he can be freed from the monster that lurks in his nightmares a hooded killer who used an ax to butcher his parents right before his eyes. Such a devastating experience is certain to warp a young child's mind and so he seeks total gratification by inducing trauma through any means necessary by pitting the worst fears against his chosen victims. This movie is a dark dark tale with quite a disturbing conclusion. The heralded meat sequence regarding Cheryl's torment at the hands of Quaid who uses her worst fear against her a past of molestation by her father who worked at a slaughterhouse brought back to the surface in a most unfortunate way packs a wallop. The entire cast is excellent every important role especially Evans and Laura Donnellyas Abby whose face and body is inflicted with discolored skin pigmentation which is the source of her misery despite the fact that she is a sweetheart taken advantage of by Quaid who preys on her vulnerabilityis handled effectively. Quaid is quite a memorable character he's such a coldhearted sociopath willing to go to any lengths to not only face the beast but touch the beast. In regards to the violence it's stylishly presented in particular the way director Anthony DiBlasi uses camera angles with the ax as the killer moves up the stairsand how it buries into the face of Quaid's mother and into another victim's torso. But the starvation of a victim who eventually eats rotted meat in the hopes of getting out of her temporary prison is just as potent and shocking as any amount of grue. The most amusing scene while quite eyepopping is when Quaid sees a stripper opened up with various imaginary slices of the skin not long after flushing all his meds a hallucination that expresses just how far gone he is. How Abby responds to a cruel act from Quaid embarrassed because she was baring her heart and soul to Stephen is really bloodcurdling in how it pertains to her attempt to clean herself of her current affliction. I imagine this kind of movie leaves one with a bad taste in their mouth due to it's unnerving close. What Quaid does to a kid who suffered a period of deafness after being hit by a car will be certain to appall. This film has some graphic scenes involving Quaid's love making to Abby and his oral pleasure to a girl he picks up at a club..just a word of warning if such things repulse youas if the subject matter itself isn't enough.".

In this movie as well as others he brings a special depth and quirky charm to his characters.This movie starts rather slow  however the build up is definitely worth the wait in the end. The plot is entirely believable and the acting genuine. Not to mention that there were some moments in this film that I personally thought topped even the most squeamish moments in the Saw franchise. This is NOT a movie to watch if you are faint of heart or get grossed out easily.However this is a completely unique story and I've never seen anything like it before. I love Clive Barker yet I've not read the story on which this movie is based am definitely putting it on my to read list!. As a horror movie it stands out above the crowd as one of the best in years if you've got the stomach for it!".

For the thesis they with the help of an editor friend of Grace's interview students about fear nightmares and so on. Nothing impresses Quaid except some kid who lost his hearing for a while. Grace has some mild fear of cars because his brother died in a car crash. The editor girl is a vegetarian because her dad used to work at a slaughterhouse and used to molest her after coming home from work. A girl Grace works with has a giant birthmark that covers half of her body. But it's Quiad's fear and panic that has the greater impact. He witnessed his parents being butchered by some maniac who was never found. He has nightmares and visions about it.As time goes by Quaid's behavior gets more aggressive manipulative bizarre and even violent. He attacks an interview who was just acting. He aims to confront his new friends with their fears in most brutal ways hoping they will meet the monster.While one expects his story to take a turn and there is a confrontation it turns out it's the vegetarian girl whose story is the most surprising and twisted. This being a Clive Barker story the turn the story will take is just brilliant. The problem however is with the movie. There is no doubt it's quite effective. You end up despising the villain more than any other villain in recent movies. Perhaps even the movie will sicken you. But this is achieved by sheer ugliness and by wearing you down. And this movie is ugly. The actors are unattractive and once you are caught up in Quaid's obsession there is nothing nice anywhere in the movie except for a few minutes of romance between Grace and the editor girl. The movie also looks ugly everything is a tone of brown. The pace is awfully slow even though it's not particularly long and that's what gets you. You're slowly dragged into a world of ugliness with no respite. All that nastiness almost detracts from the great story. I wouldn't mind seeing this story filmed by a different crew and a different cast. There is potential here. On the positive note the violence and gore are terrific. The gore is surprising and well made. The special features include an interesting conversation between the man himself Clive Barker and the director.".

I would have a hard time recommending this to my friends because they would think I was a psychopath if I claimed I liked it.

And in my eyes this movie does not do justice to his original story.Maybe it's because I had such a high hopes for it because at least from the first two volumes of Books Of Blood this was the only psychological thrillerhorror not just slasher.Yet it is only my opinion and yes I like C.B. I like low budget films and I like horror films especially early Italian classics but this movie disappointed me greatly even more than Hellraiser Hellworld and made even Midnight Meat Train look like some Oscar contender.A couple of stars for young actors and to the filmmakers that tried.

	schema:reviewBody "Three students decide to study people's fears for a video documentary college class as sort of a fear study. Initially they simply interview their subjects but then one of the students progresses to setting up situations where the subjects are forced to confront their fears.Pretty much universally positive reviews from horror magazines and websites were given to this film and I feel bad that I cannot be as supportive. While I think this film has a lot of strengths and may be better than the average film it also has some weak points too.I have to say the film is very admirable with regards to the gore on the topless dancer and the dismembered girl in the bed. Other gore scenes were also decent and there is no short supply of blood and a special effects that shines beyond the budget. I also enjoyed the gritty sex scene reminiscent of the style of Derailed though the sex scenes are quite different.The film as a whole has a lot of sexuality to it which I find to be a flaw. I liked the painting of nude woman with the addition of her blue hair but soon realized it was just he first step towards more and more nudity. Usually I am the last one to frown on nudity gratuitous or otherwise. But I felt this film was using it as a crutch that despite having a strong story they felt they could not get by on merit alone. And that is a shame.As far as being compared to recent Clive Barker films this one is clearly better than Book of Blood which was just boring and on par with Midnight Meat Train. I may like Train slightly better but both have their strong and weak points. Barker's original story is roughly 40 pages including some casual references to Kant and Bentham and unfortunately Dickens. The film tends to ignore these intellectual touchstones and veers off into more pornographic territory. They do however take the fear of meat to a new height.Dread was chosen as the 2010 horror film of the year by HorrorHound contributor Dave Kosanke with Jon Kitley agreeing. Kosanke thinks the film is primordial and raw and even manages to oneup the story. Another HorrorHound contributor Aaron Christensen disagreed and felt the film was too long and would work best as an anthology coupled with one or two other Barker stories. Incidentally he chose Black Swan as the year's best.Thankfully none of them picked Harpoon like Aaron Crowell did that film had few things right going for it. And I have to agree with Christensen that Black Swan easily trumps Dread though I think Adam Green's Frozen was also a worthy contender. I would not put Dread in my top three for 2010.I would though not necessarily endorse Christensen's idea that this be squeezed into an anthology. While Book of Blood clearly ran over its needed time this film seemed to go over by mere minutes for me. The writer added enough to the original story to really have it stand on its own two legs. I would say that it could be trimmed five or ten minutes as some scenes just went on too long for me. But it has enough story and depth to really be its own film.Ultimately I do not see this being one of the strongest films of recent years. The gore effects are amazing and I hope the crew behind that goes on to bigger things. The cinematography is also stellar. But beyond that I do not know. I feel it went on a tad too long and what should have been a story about dread became too exaggerated for me. It pushes the level of realism too hard and enters a surreal stage. And that is not dreadful. Psychologically unstable maybe but not scary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dread is an adaptation of a story by Clive Barker and it starts out on a very interesting premise exploring our fears. That's Quaid's motivation for his thesis study he decides to interview people and have them tell their most vivid memories of being afraid. Quaid has a deeper darker motivation for this when he was 6 years old he saw his parents being murdered by an axe killer. In his quest he will team up with Steven an agreeable fellow student and with Cheryl. Each of them has a personal story of haunting fear too. Of course as is expected Quaid's childhood trauma and dabbling into people's darkest fears do not mix well.Dread evolves as a psychological suspense with moments of great intensity thrown together with scenes that are included just for shock value or what's worst as a rushed and stereotypical means of characterbuilding e.g. the scenes at the pub at Quaid's studio or with the two girls that they hook up with at the beginning where we're supposed to learn about Quaid's personality. Despite its ups and downs though it is a pretty solid suspense with sobriety of characters a compact and believable plot that follows well and good subplots e.g. Abby's story with the best performance of the movie from actress Laura Donnelly. And one good point about this movie is that it is never boring.The last half hour is the most intense as the accumulating events and actions come to their conclusion.Dread is in my opinion a quite good movie in its genre. It's not groundbreaking and it may remind you of something you have watched or read before. However it has good points welldone scenes that will keep your attention and it's always entertaining. Warning don't expect anything at all like Hellraiser.My score 710.".

I felt a little uncomfortable until I glanced a bit longer and noticed that it was From the mind of Clive Barker. But alas this is a review of it's content and not it's cover.I'm glad I did pick it up however because it turned out to be a decent psychological thriller more so than it was a horror film. The characters are convincing in particular Quaid the protagonist bad guy who we feel isn't all right from the very beginning of the film. I feel as if I was led to question whether the motives of Quaid were inherently bad or environmental due to a childhood of significant psychological torment. When an audience is opened up to the possibility of these influences immediately it changes from a horror film to an intellectual psychological thriller that borders existential exploration of the human psyche. I couldn't help but feel as if some scenes of the film kind of reminded me of Fight Club as Quaid attempted to groom Stephen in to his mode of thinking but unlike Fight Club this was unsuccessful and we saw the further polarisation of the characters involved in the college project from Quaid.All in all Dread is a film which won't cater to your grisly sleazy gore driven desires mostly due to the fact that a lot of the gore is paced out through the film and used tactically in order to keep it relative to the conceptual element of the film and also to keep the suspense. For those who enjoy psychological thrillers college sociopathic sadists and existentially driven plots will enjoy Dread. Fans of Clive Barker can rest assured that Anthony DiBlasi has effectively captured Clive Barker's depiction of the story and doesn't buck to the sleazy needs of Hollywood gore and torturewithoutreason films Saw and manages to effectively convey the terror torment and disorientation of Dread.".

	schema:reviewBody "I may be biased because Dread is the story that turned me on to Clive Barker originally. I love the story and was so blown away by it I actually made my girlfriend at the time read it I probably should not have been surprised when she broke up with me soon after and I still consider it one of his best. I was slightly hesitant to see the film because i knew the filmmakers would change all kinds of stuff around which they did. Unfortunately not much of it is for the better. Basic setup is the same as in Barker's story Quaid a mysterious and wealthy young college student who suffers from recurrent nightmares enlists classmates Stephen and Cheryl to help him conduct a Kinseyesque fear study to find out what people dread the most. Stephen and Cheryl have their own fears Stephen is scared of driving ever since his older brother died in a car crash and Cheryl won't eat meat for reasons that are revealed about halfway through the film. Another character who isn't in the short story at all is Abby whose face is half covered with a dark birthmark. Another character Joshua a student in the study is fairly important as he fears what Stephen originally feared in the short story. The original story only had three characters whereas the film has many. I think the basic problem with the film is one of padding. They've taken a simple story and padded it out to feature length but in the process they've made it a lot less interesting. Also in order to cater to the blood and guts crowd they've taken the motivation behind the Quaid character and made it less fascinating. In the short story Quaid's recurring nightmare was of a clown with an axe slowly coming to get him in the middle of the night. Why he had the dream or what it represented remained a mystery. We knew only that it haunted him. In the film Quaid's dream involves witnessing the murder of his parents by an axe wielding psycho. We've seen that done a million times in a million movies. Who the hell cares about yet another runofthemill axe wielding psycho? Boring!! Additonally in the short story Stephen's fear is going deaf a fear transplanted to the Joshua character and one of the most compelling parts is when that fear is realized. But the filmmakers botch this completely. They go for the easy way out. The only thing the movie gets right is Cheryl's fear of meat and the way Quaid exploits this. It plays out pretty much like it does in the short story and is very well done. Other than that I thought the cinematography was really nice. The direction is pretty decent. The acting is above average for this sort of film particularly the girl who plays Abby. She has one scene where she comes on to Stephen that's heartbreaking. The guy who plays Quaid is pretty good as well although it might have been better if he had been more sympathetic. All in all not bad. But I would still read the short story before seeing it.".

Both are reasonably true. This is one of the best recent entries in the genre I've watched and instead of being direct and essentially torture porn this is subtle and psychological. The plot deals with a fictional documentary that three students are producing think Kinsey only with dread as the subject. It moves along at a fairly fast pace without being overwhelming. While there are a couple of horror flick clichs this is largely devoid of them. The acting is pretty good for all concerned particularly the leads. Every character is a credible human being with flaws they're rather welldeveloped and accurate as far as their mentalities go. They aren't necessarily likable however they're certainly interesting. This is realistic a lot of the way. The FX are relatively convincing and nicely done. Editing and cinematography are somewhat experimental and it usually works wellarguably a little of it can be called flashy. The soundside is marvelous. This had me on the edge of my seat and it surprised me several times. The tension and suspense are effective. There is a bit of nudity of both genders strong sexuality and brutal bloody violence as well as occasional swearing in this. I recommend this to fans of Clive and his style. 810".

	schema:headline " From the Mind of Clive Barker....";
	schema:reviewBody "Dread is taken from a story that was originally published in the mid 80's from volume 2 of Clive Barker's Book of Blood. The story concerns a group of college students who decide to embark on a psychological study of an individual's fear and how certain defense mechanisms develop. Jackson Rathbone plays the lead character in this twisted affair  he is most recognizable as Jasper in the Twilight series. Although associated with that GQ image of sparkling vampires Rathbone dives into the role of a student who's placed in a difficult situation that helps shape Barker's usual sinister outcome.This film does not execute much in the way of gore...it taps more into the human psyche. The tension is built upon slowly maybe even too slowly but eventually gains enough momentum to exist as a tangible force  it is through this process that one realizes Barker's genius.

	onyx:emotionText "Dread is taken from a story that was originally published in the mid 80's from volume 2 of Clive Barker's Book of Blood. The story concerns a group of college students who decide to embark on a psychological study of an individual's fear and how certain defense mechanisms develop. Jackson Rathbone plays the lead character in this twisted affair  he is most recognizable as Jasper in the Twilight series. Although associated with that GQ image of sparkling vampires Rathbone dives into the role of a student who's placed in a difficult situation that helps shape Barker's usual sinister outcome.This film does not execute much in the way of gore...it taps more into the human psyche. The tension is built upon slowly maybe even too slowly but eventually gains enough momentum to exist as a tangible force  it is through this process that one realizes Barker's genius.

Yeah...you know that eventually this will not end well. Fortunately for the viewer the same is true of Dread. While I didn't really grow up watching Clive Barker's movies still can't stand Hellraiser I've grown an appreciation for him over the years. Even though he didn't have much to do with the making of the actual movie I'd like to think it's very much what it would look like if he had.This film is kind of hard to define. It's not really what you'd call a horror movie in the traditional sense although it definitely has horror elements. I guess it kind of walks a fine line between a psychological thriller and paranoia horror. Sure there's a bit of gore here and there but the film isn't relying on it. There's also some scenes of what some would call torture but there's more of a point to it than films like Saw or Hostel. So in a way you'll feel like you've seen it before but you really haven't. I suppose a quick and dirty summary of the plot would be seemingly normal but slightly eccentric guy slowly becomes crazier than a craphouse rat...hijinks ensue.All said and done I quite enjoyed it. Not the best thing I've seen from Clive Barker but far from the worst. I guess in a strange way you could compare Barker to Lovecraft. People will always be trying to turn his stories into movies and they'll probably succeed admirably or fail horribly. Here's to hoping for the best.".

But I was extremely disappointed and had the feeling afterwards that I wasted two hours of my life on this bad thing. What especially annoyed me about this movie were three things a The verbal contents what first seemed to having a good start  some smart phrases about fear and our human relation to it  did not go much further and remained all in all at the surface of this theme. Shallow I would say. b The gore stuff there is some needless display of extreme violence which could have been easily avoided contributing by avoidance to the atmosphere of this movie. But by displaying senseless moments of bloodhappy gorefeast the movie lost much if not all. c The overall meaningfulness as dimension of a movie in this one is quite low. It appears to be just another splatterridden trash movie enriched with some common phrases about fear anxiety or dread. In my mind this movie is almost totally meaningless. So what is the point of this movie if there is one at all and what was the point of making it? My impression was that someone turnedon by pointless violence has livedout once again his own lecherousness about human suffering. I presume that already the producers must be persons who love to see other human beings tortured which speaks for the sadomasochistic basic trend or underlying corecurrent of this movie. If someone never thought deeper than the common surface of fear anxiety or dread he might find the shallow words put into this film maybe interesting which rather serve as disguise for the real motives or justification for making the movie. And if someone also loves bloody gore senseless violence and humans being tormented and tortured by other human beings then he might actually like this movie. Since I am though neither sadistic nor masochistic I truly disliked and despise this movie. We all know already what humans can do to fellow human beings.

Led by the hilarious and unfortunately late Phil Hartman in top form the family take turns accomodating Douglas and verbally assaulting him in private. The movie takes a turn when they decide to call Douglas' favorite nephew played by Michael J. Fox who has moved away to get away from his gold digging cousins in order to cheer up Douglas. Fox and his wife played by the charming Nancy Travis are the only ones who aren't after their uncle's money. Or are they?With many twists and an ending to die for this movie is my pick for the most underrated comedy of the 90's. See it!".

	schema:headline " One of the more underrated comedies of the last two decades";
	schema:reviewBody "This comedy from the same director that brought us My Cousin Vinny is certainly a bit of a buried treasure. A wellcast surprisingly effervescent production that has a good number of genuine laughs. Kirk Douglas is an aging millionaire whose immediate family is comprised of a loathsome greedy horde of bloodsuckers who spend their time in outrageously sycophantic displays while trying to undercut their competition. Their plans hit a snag with the arrival of sexy pizza delivery girl Olivia D'abo who stays on as Douglas' caretaker. To attempt to ameliorate her influence the clan seeks out Douglas' favorite estranged nephew  a downonhisluck bowler played by Michael J. Fox who does his best to rise above the shenanigans but finds himself drawn ever further into the melee.If the film has a major weakness it is that once the family unites to draw Fox into the game the entire group of them including Hartman Jere Burns Colleen Camp etc. suddenly operate as one mind rather than continuing to undermine each other. It would have been far more intriguing to see each specific relative continue with schemes of their own. Otherwise the film is a lot of fun. Douglas is hilarious as the millionaire who knows all too well what the family is doing and always seems one step ahead of their foolishness. Phil Hartman is a deadpan delight as the primary golddigger who spends his time disparaging his relatives to Douglas with acid backhanded compliments. Director Jonathan Lynn is acerbically funny as the putupon butler and D'abo is suitably sexy as the wild card in the mix. The usually capable Nancy Travis is stuck with a largely humorless role as Fox's wellmeaning girlfriend and the voice of reason in the film. Truthfully her character could have been omitted or combined with the D'abo character without any deleterious impact. Fox himself has rarely been better outside of the Back to the Future franchise. This is one of his most appealing and consistently amusing performances. I would also be remiss in not mentioning his pleasantly surprising extended nude scene. I mean WOW! Who knew? Sharpeyed viewers will figure out the ending but it does not make it any less satisfying. A film comedy that definitely needs to be rediscovered and reevaluated by a new crop of viewers. They will definitely be rewarded.".

Keaton days in Family Ties he has proved to be a talented actor.He has won some awards from his TV work in FT and Spin City.Unfortunately Mr Fox has suffered from Parkinson's disease since 1991 and he had to stop acting in Spin City last year.I hope all the best for Michael. Greedy is an educational film about greed and what it can make you do.Nobody should wish for somebody's death just to get some money.

Joe regularly has dinner with all his family which turns into a fight as each relative attempts to undermine the others. When a young blonde Molly moves in with Joe his family suspect a golddigger and bring Joe's favourite nephew Danny back to get the money for the family.This starts out as a comedy and bits of the first half hour are funny the first dinner is very good with plenty of fighting and smart remarks from the kids. But in the final 30 minutes it suddenly decides it wants to be a drama of sorts as everyone turns greedy this sudden mood change is very uncomfortable and doesn't really work since everything else about it says comedy. And the ending! The ending is just stupid and can be seen coming quite easily. The comedy bits don't totally work because exploiting an old family member for money is a hard subject to make funny the drama bits don't work because the comedy made us uncomfortable and it's handled with too much sentiment.The performances are pretty good  Michael J Fox is ok but not as good as he has been in other things. Kirk Douglas is good but doesn't play a particularly sympathetic character and he looks a shadow of his former self and it's difficult to watch him. Of the family the late Simpson's contributor Phil Hartman is the standout and is really funny for most Ed Begley Jnr and Olivia D'Abo both turn up but don't do anything special. Nancy Travis is good as Fox's girlfriend and she carries the film's moral core well.The direction is nothing special and really you expect more from Jonathan Lynn who was involved in such good things as Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister. Overall this is a confused film  it's an uncomfortable comedy the longer it goes on then it wants to be a drama and then it has a silly conclusion that makes you stop caring for any of the characters shortly before the end".

Given that there are a few among them that I don't care all that much for... some I've even forgotten. There are even two or three that I've only watched once and never really felt like watching again... each time it came up as I searched through my collection of films for something to watch I would cringe at the thought of sitting through it even one more time. This is one such film. I'm not entirely sure what compelled me to give it another chance... I read a quote or two halfremembered how they were said and recognized some names on the cast... Phil Hartman Ed Begley Jr. and Jere Burnsin order of how talented and funny I'd rate them all three of which I've seen elsewhere and grown to appreciate the talents ofDouglas and Fox were the only two actors I knew the first time I watched this and I think those were the main contributors the last of the two reasons being the most importantin fact Hartman is one of the people on a short mental list of people that I want to watch all ofwell at least as far as the watchable ones go the work of. As the opening credits come on I nearly regretted this decision... but that went away fairly quickly after the film itself began. The plot is pretty good. The actors all fit their roles and perform quite well. The cinematography does its job fine as well as the editing even if they are a little weird at timesspeaking as a film aficionadoand someone who enjoys using words from foreign languages in everyday life as well as someone who's enjoyed the pleasure and the privilege of trying his hands at both it seems like there were many situationsbe it in the production or postproduction phase shooting or editing where they couldn't quite think of a good solution how to get all the elements or properly frame the shots so they just went with the best they could think ofwhich leaves a bit to be desired at times. It isn't that huge a deal though. All those elements are fine if not downright good. The real problem here is the humor... in spite of some wit and some black comedy that is among the darkest I have seen there just seems to be too little of the film's humor that works. The timing is occasionally off and a lot of potentialnot to mention comical talent is wasted. For a comedy this just doesn't provide enough laughs to keep you watching for almost two hours. What made it truly worth it for me and the main reason I urge anyone who decides to give this film a chance is the moral... the message of the filmit alone lifted my rating above the average of a 5. It gives such a clear perspective on greed one that I don't believe I've ever seen presented beforeand certainly not so skillfully. I recommend this to any fan of comedies who is willing to accept a lesser comedy to get to the great message of itwhich is neither preachy nor heavyhanded as some the moral of some messagemovies is. Maybe the biggest fans of the actors should avoid though... you may hate for the sole reason of how little the biggest talents in the film get to do. 610".

What one person finds extremely funny another person will be left completely cold. So when rating or reviewing Comedies which I don't do very often a person HAS to realize this and try to decide if this is the KIND of Comedy that they would appreciate.Probably one good clue would be who is in the film. If you are already a fan of Michael J. Fox then you will probably like it. Although it isn't one of his more prominent performances I find it interesting that this could be one the better MOVIES that he has been in not counting all you avid 'BACK TO THE FUTURE' fans of course   Seriously though although I REALLY love some of his specific performances in other films more than this one this movie was SO frigg'n entertaining OVERALL that it was one of the better Comedies that I've seen in a while thus the somewhat unusual '8' rating that I gave it...I have never really been familiar with Phil Hartman's work as I did not watch SNL during the years 8 apparently that he was on it. This is the first film I think that I've seen with him in it and man let me tell you the guy frigg'n KILLED it! Damn was he funny! Some of his lines were great as was most of the dialog overall which I feel GREATLY contributed to why this film was so good and so DAMN funny.It had a nice 'Heart' to it too. Especially considering the overall theme of Greed and how it can affect people. BUT... it wasn't overly sentimental or preachy about it at all. And the surprising way that the story eventually develops gives it a nice sense of depth much more so than you would expect from most superficial Comedies.The writing was brilliant the acting is excellent and the characters are really very funny. And although it is COMPLETELY unnecessary for me to mention it Olivia d'Abo was absolutely stunning of course... Kirk Douglas did a great job I have a TON of older Film Noir movies and such with him in them some of them quite Classic. But I don't think I've really appreciated what a good actor he can be and he did a wonderful job here. His face and eyes were extremely expressive and conveyed subtle changes of emotion and mood. Also the director Jonathan Lynne did an awesome job playing Kirk Douglas' British butler. One thing that made this movie so enjoyable was a number of 'little' scenes with secondary characters. Like the director of the sports show where Olivia worked. He was really funny.So I would say that if you like Comedies that have a strong story line and good quality writing and acting and if you HAPPEN to like Michael J. Fox and you are not looking specifically for either a lowbrow Comedy or one with pitch Black humour that is typical in many modern Comedies today which DO have their place of course  and if your looking for a Comedy that is a little sharper and has a nice good flow to it then there is a decent chance that you might really enjoy this very clever and entertaining movie...".

Oh and his dad was portrayed too much like a utopian hippy to be believable.I DO urge everyone who has the chance to watch the opening credits for the Late Jimmy Durante to sing his signature song of 'Inka Dinka Dinka Doo'! Durante definitely steals the show because he is the ONLY vaguely likable character in this whole movie! Yeah Fox does a good imitation of Durante but is it worth going through the REST of the movie to see? I think not.".

Before the actual movie begins it might have been nice to include the few seconds where Mr. Durante kicks the bucket from the opening of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World 1963 if the rights could be obtained. The Durante film clip is included so those unfamiliar with the entertainer will know who boyish Michael J.

All of Mr. Douglas' greedy relatives expect him to buy the farm at any moment...Mr. Fox has a touch of arthritis in his wrist and must give up his career as a professional bowler. He wants to marry girlfriend Nancy Travis as Robin Hunter and needs 300000 to invest in a bowling center. Fox is in great shape and shows a generous amount of skin including a buttocks closeup. Keeping her bikini on and showing less flesh is curvy Olivia d'Abo as Molly Richardson a main competitor for the McTeague millions. Douglas says the sexy blonde arrived as a pizza delivery girl and moved in as nurse...Supporting cast cousins Phil Hartman as Frank Ed Begley Jr. as Carl Jere Burns as Glen and Colleen Camp as Patti also want the fortune. The film starts out amusingly vulgar and loses its grip on comedy to become a fairly predictable series of plot twists there are enough to insure at least one will be a surprise.

It is a mistake to make us side and sympathise with them if ultimately they are not important or developed.

Although Michael J Fox is a welcome addition to any film and his energy wit and compassion make him a watchable lead he is introduced too late to be this lead. Danny either isn't needed in this plot of greedy relatives versus evil old man or it should start with and focus entirely on him. It is very difficult to care about his failed professional bowling career as it is boring and the sappy music that follows Danny and girlfriend Robin around is far too overdone.While childDanny and Michael J FoxDanny's impressions of Jimmy Durante are impressive the need to show the audience who they are doing impressions of by starting the film with a lengthy clip of Jimmy Durante from Two Girls And A Sailor makes for a slow beginning that has little to do with the film.Molly is a badly written character. She knows Joe is perving on her but she likes the lifestyle he provides and eventually she nearly sleeps with him for money and yet she isn't supposed to be that sort of girl. Well she clearly is. Also Olivia d'Abo is apparently English so it is confusing that her English accent is one of the fakest I have ever heard. Exactly what part of England is she from?The plot plays out pretty obviously excluding Joe's insanely over the top ploy to discover who loves him with bad people getting nothing and good people being rewarded but it is the despicable Joe who has ruined his family's lives. Without him they would never have become the people they are so to see them end up with nothing while he is still rich isn't satisfactory at all.Amusing characters suffer an irritatingly twisty plot dominated by a detestable patriarch and are buried under too much moral for this film to be as funny as it wants to be. It should have stuck with the idea of relatives who will do anything for their inheritance and dumped the morals of Danny and manipulation of Joe which just hinder the laughs.".

Both Black and White South Africans found this extremely funny and in a way it was able to overcome most racial barriers of the time.I have asked many of my black friends if they weren't offended when they watched it the first time and most said that they weren't simply because it poked fun at all races. It was hilarious and I have to agree the best work of both actors' careers.I can't see many people in other countries truly enjoying this if they don't understand South African Culture but if you did enjoy it I'm really glad!

This movie's funniest bits were when Prince William decided to set a trap for this German guy in the middle of the bush with a tub full of flammable liquid. And when the guy sits in the tub because his backside got burnt William drives his remote control car with a little trailer attached to it which contained a cigarette and matches. And when the German dude lights his cigarette the tub explodes and he goes soaring through the sky. And the other was when the domestic servant wanted to make love to Schuster and when he took off the servant said AWU! which means  Oh dear! Goodness gracious me! Schuster is such a joker!".

And considering when the movie was made racial relations humor is quite good balanced.  Obviously political correctness thank God was not necessary to release it.However the whole construction is much worse balanced.  It looks as if at least four writers and four directors made short movies and then just leaned not even connected them to release it as one single film.  In the beginning we have an almost romantic comingtoage part made in European French or Swedish style.  When characters become adults we get a story with well included jokes made as USA authors were doing when average target audience was still older then 12 and for me this is the best part.  Third quarter becomes a slapstick comedy but if the authors came quite close to the best in the first half they are far far behind trying to look like Mel Brooks or Peter Sellers.  And who knows why finally we get a cartoon comedy a copy of 'Home Alone'.  Suddenly a male and female clone of Culkin barely seen before become main stars of the final quarter and finish movie with all lack of logic and reality already damaged in slapstick part in neonazi house that Homealonetype of movies suffers from.  And that's probably when your kids will enjoy more than you.  But I don't understand why some comments suggest that this movie might not be appropriate for children.

This film is much different from  any other of the Gods Must Be Crazy films. The only similiarity is that  it takes place in South Africa like the rest of the films. A major  miss in this film is that it does not contain N'!xau the bushman and  it is not by Jamie Uys. This is the last U.S. based film of the Gods  Must Be Crazy series. The rest of the films including Vampires Must Be  Crazy The God's Must Be Funny in China and Crazy Hong Kong. So if you  were expecting N!xau the bushman in another hilarious adventure this  is not the movie for you.".

I'm a Brit who's just watched this movie with my Zimbabwean wife and i fell about laughing almost the whole way through. It's just so funny and pokes fun at just about everyone i mean there's the potential to offend several races or colours in this film but if you have a sense of humour you'll understand it's actually a clever movie that blends satireslapstickgross outpoliticalculture and gender based jokes into one great big funny melting pot. But it almost feels affectionately insulting and i for one am fed up with Political correctness anywaythe Prince Charles and Camilla sequences were funny despite the sensitivity of that story. But the last half hour is pure classic slapstick physical comedy its like watching a blend of Laurel and Hardy meets Home Alone in the African bush. I can't say a bad word about this movie it's one of the funniest i've seen in years. I will watch this again and again...treat yourself and buy it and prepare to be all laughed out afterwards !!".

Finbar gets the chance to play soccer in an international soccer team abroad but can't use it and comes back. He went as a hero and came back as loser. Even the relation to Danny gets worse. In an act of desperation he jumps from a bridge and just disappears. After years of missing Finbar he calls Danny from Sweden and Danny follows this call disappearing from this neighbourhood too. In an odyssey Danny travels from Stockholm to the far north of Sweden to Lappland looking for Finbar. Up there he does not only meet Finbar but also very nice people and the lovely Abbi. But the friendship to Finbar has changed and their lives evantually separate.";

The music was great the scenery shots were gorgeous and I thought Danny was doing good detective work.  There is an element of humor in the film that really got me.  I wasn't expecting it but it was there though subtle.  Griffin does a fine job as Danny.  He is understated and very likable. RhysMeyers' Finbar is very interesting.  He is a mysterious figure that we never get the real deal on.  We get a look here and there of real emotion and feeling but I don't know Finbar.  The energy Jonathan gave the role was a little unexpected I expected him to be more subdued but it was a perfect foil for Danny.All in all I thought it was a good film worth the time to see.".

There are strong antiJapanese messeges including one Japanese guy having a tash similar to a certain German dictator in the film but it has been over 33 years since the film was made and so this can be put down to it being dated. Ultimately it is a film about injustice and Revenge. The Bushido School's general evilness the injustice against the Chinese in Shanghai and Bruce's called Chen in this one hot headedness create a circle of violence which escalates completely out of control. This is an intensely gritty Kung Fu film unlike Bruce's later films which were more escapist in nature and Fist Of Fury has the highest body count in terms of Bruce actually killing people with those fists. The legendary 'Sick Man Of Asia' scene is amazing and the end of Kill Bill clearly homage's this so any Tarentino fan's will get an added joy out of watching this beautiful sequence.

	schema:headline " Bruce Lee classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Film maker Lo Wei directed this Bruce Lee classic Fist of Fury immediately after the success of Lee's first martial art film The Big Boss. Fist of Fury tells the story of Chen Lee who arrives in Shanghai to his martial art school only to learn that his beloved teacher has died and the funeral is going on when he arrives. Soon it is revealed that the death was without a doubt a murder and our fierce hero is going to solve the mystery..With the power of his fists and kicks.This film is prehaps little too racist towards Japanese since they are depicted as dirty and greedy criminals here and some lines in the script are very underlining and judge the Japanese people too much. Then again the film makes me wonder about racism in general since there is so much mayhem in the film and so many Chinese and Japanese get killed by each other so maybe this film was not meant to be racist at all. Maybe the intention was to tell something about us who cannot live in peace with each other. All these things happen even today 30 years after the film's release so the subject matter is definitely universal as it was back then in 1972. Still I would have toned down some of the dialogue bits since they are little too strong and I think Bruce Lee himself didn't like the film's racial elements.On the other hand this film is really beautiful as it depicts the sensitive love between Bruce and Nora Miao who is very beautiful and sweet female in this film and also in other Lee's films. The scene at the teacher's grave is one of the most sensitive scenes of love I've ever seen and those two characters are hand touchingly full of emotion. The themes in this film are mainly about relationships between individuals and humans in general so the film has many things to offer moreover mere action. This is action classic with heart.The film is famous for its legendary first nunchaku fight scene at the Japanese' training camp as Bruce shows for the first time his personal fighting tool and weapon a pair of nunchakus. That fight scene even before nunchakus is among the greatest ever filmed since the choreography and timing is totally marvellous as the one take lasts very long without edits and Bruce kicks and hits about ten victims during that and the timing and stunt men had to be really sharp in order to not to get hurt for real. Also the nunchaku fights in the film are incredible as Bruce uses his weapon without flinching an eye and with fierce look on his face. This all is even more powerful in his next film Way of the Dragon.The film was shot mostly in studio and there are only few exteriors in Fist of Fury. The staging is very convincing and the film's bigger budget compared to that of The Big Boss' really shows. The last fight in night time at the Japanese yard is very beautifully lighted and full of cinematic magic. The film is full of details and elements from Chinese culture and traditions so this is little more personal and interesting film than The Big Boss which had some irritating little flaws like the sound of Bruce' necklace he got from his mother and the scene where Bruce punches a guy through a wall with funny and campy result which director Lo definitely didn't meant to look that funny. Fist of Fury is a stunning piece of Hong Kong and world cinema and easily among Lee's greatest films. The atmosphere is created so convincingly that even people who usually don't appreciate action films should appreciate this since this film is many more things than just action and fighting. Fist of Fury hasn't lost any of its power and punch during these 30 years and will remain one of the most important martial arts movies ever made. 910".

Lee was allowed to choreograph his own fights and his battle with Japanese martial artists in their school and climactic duels with a Russian boxer and a Japanese swordsman remains classic fight scenes.The film drags somewhat in the middle although the lengthy dialogue scene between Lee and his girlfriend was another step forward for the Hong Kong martial arts movie vivid proof that Lee was a pretty good ACTOR. By contrast Lee's final farewell to his girlfriend is all the more powerful for being done completely without dialogue at all. The ending is the most powerful and moving of all the Lee films the final freeze frame managing to encapsulate Lee's grace and power in a single shot.Many mock Lee's films as being silly and just consisting of fighting. Both accusations are completely untrue. They have far less fights than most films of this kind and at least in the three Hong Kong films he made there is a clear message that violence does not solve anything. They may not have the polish of the more recent works of Jackie Chan and Jet Lee but their power remains undiminished as long as of course one does not watch the awful dubbed versions!".

The entire basis of this Kung Fu film becomes a real reaction to the pain of discrimination and the hatred of a sense of racism that the Japanese dished out to the Chinese and is based actually off of a real story that followed similar tones. What makes this film very special is the commitment that Bruce Lee has to defeating the Japanese whose goal is to crush the will of the Chinese  a very accurate reflection of the sentiment that existed.Overall this is a very good film that was well done it has a lot of the defects that films similar to its' genre have having the grainy feel of Kung Fu films of its' time but other than the typical it really sets a standard for Kung Fu and film in general. One can see it in many ways as being a good basis for subsequent action and Kung Fu films.

	onyx:emotionText "...most of you have seen the dubbed cutted version. this review is for the uncut version.bruce lee makes his most memorable performance in this excellent martial art film. the main character is not the perfect kind forgiving guy you always see in these types of movies. he cannot forgive all he can think of is revenge. he's even prepared to kick down some innocent people on the side if need be to achieve his goal.martial art movies often suffer from the same problems as porn movies do. the lack of a decent plot.in this one bad guys are really bad guys the good guy is like 'the punisher' shows anger in every turn but is unable to show his emotions towards his girlfriend. here even the ending is an unconventional one.a very good film compared to the remake with jet li bruce lee's movie loses in great fighting scenes but wins in attitude and depth. jet li wasn't very believable as chen zhen but you can see the fire burning in bruce's eyes in every single screen.";

It of course serves its purpose of dishing out lots of great combat complete with hilarious over use of impact sounds. But there's more here going on than that. This also features some funny comedy and some particularly potent drama. It's a tale of bigotry as the Japanese in Shanghai treat their Chinese counterparts with contempt and demean them.Taking place at the turn of the 20th century it stars Bruce as Chen Zhen a student who returns to his school to learn that the beloved Master has died. Not only that but he just might have been murdered to boot. Naturally Chen swears to solve the crime and get some revenge. He takes on all comers while the carnage mounts.There's some pretty delicious gore in this lively affair which goes on a bit long at one hour and 47 minutes but it still has much to recommend it. Lo and Bruce get your attention and keep it with their many intense fight sequences. It also offers a little dose of romance as Chen hopes to marry the girl whom he loves Nora Miao. The villains are wonderfully despicable you love to hate them and eagerly anticipate the inevitable showdown between Bruce and characters such as Petrov Robert Baker a massive Russian who shows off his superhuman strength in one amusing segment.The acting is just fine from everybody concerned. Bruce is indeed at his best proving his physical prowess at every turn and displaying that memorable screen presence.Good solid action entertainment a must for martial arts fans.Eight out of 10.".

Well paced with creative and fairly realistic fight scenes distributed evenly the movie keeps the audience's attention all the way through the long fight scene near the climactic end I won't spoil the actual ending for you.      The predictable revenge plot provides the emotional trigger to release Lee's ragefilled fights and his nowfamous smashing of the No Dogs or Chinese Allowed sign.  Equally famous is his this time you eat paper next time you eat glass line.  Viewers are also treated to the only onscreen kiss by Lee some comical moments with Lee playing a bumbling telephone repairman a cameo by director LoWei as the chief inspector and a soundtrack which effectively builds tension in the fight scenes.  You won't recognize Jackie Chan as the stuntman for one of the Japanese martial artists who flies through the screen door.      The most memorable part of this movie is Lee's dynamic vitality as he goes about his business cocksure and confident and with the goods to back it up.  I am forever grateful to those who in marketing this movie to the west decided to dub only the dialogue and to leave Lee's original fight sounds untouched.  As is evident in the US version of Return of the Dragon aka Way of the Dragon dubbing Lee's fight sounds is nothing short of a sin.".

Having said this 'Jing wu men' does have its share of flaws e.g. the sound effect is very poor good background score and it's very antiJapanese. However one must take into consideration that this is a film made more than 35 years ago. The choreography of the action scenes is superb as Lee leads them with a lethal grace. The acting is competent though most of the villains appear as caricatures. Lee shines and he excels in the emotional scenes particularly the graveyard scene and the sequences with his beautiful costar Nora Miao. The plot is well handled making the film an entertaining experience that ends on a powerful note.".

Shortly afterwards Chen learns that the Japanese were responsible for his master's death and soon he is taking his revenge.Fans of martial arts films will surely want to watch this Bruce Lee classic. The story is fairly simple but it provides a good excuse for some bone crunching action. Bruce Lee brings an animalistic intensity to the role of Chen it is hard not to believe the character's rage. The fight scenes are particularly intense. There are some aspects of the story that one might not expect most notably Chen's actions don't really help anybody he gets his revenge but makes things worse for his school. The film does assume the viewer has some awareness of early twentieth century Chinese history when areas of Shanghai were controlled by different foreign powers including the Japanese and the local Chinese population were treated as second class citizens if one doesn't know about this it doesn't spoil the film though. As said before Bruce Lee is great in the lead role the rest of the cast is pretty impressive too.

Once again Bruce Lee is a legend but that's not enough to save this film.";

	schema:reviewBody "While it is true that Bruce Lee never made a perfect film in his remarkably short life films such as his first and last Englishspeaking American film Enter the Dragon 1973 and this Hong Kong effort The Chinese Connection 1972 rank as some of his best work to me. A year ago in my review of that film I proclaimed Return of the Dragon 1972 as Lee's greatest Asian work but I've been proved wrong since I hadn't seen The Chinese Connection and I was disappointed by Fists of Fury 1971. But director Wei Lo improved with this film which features Lee as martial arts student Chen who returns to Shanghai upon receiving news of the death of his beloved master. The story set in 1908 has a timely vibe and pays close attention to the animosity growing between the students at a Chinese martial arts school and imposing Japanese occupation forces. When Chen investigates deeper into his master's death he finds he may have been murdered and sets out to find the culprits. The Chinese Connection is Lee's best Asian work to me. From the getgo we can see that Chen is deeply saddened and angered and pummels through all in his way as he embarks on a costly and dangerously bloodthirsty quest of vengeance. The scene at his master's funeral is especially disheartening and Lee shows respectable acting skills as his rage and emotions overpower him and it takes a priest to have to knock him out with a shovel. Lee's Jeet Kune Do skills are at their peak in this work fast and furious delivering deathblows to all who oppose him especially in the noholdsbarred confrontation between himself a rockhard Russian named Petrov Robert Baker and the ruling Japanese forces. The only real drawback to the whole experience is the decidedly racist and onesided portrayal of all the Japanese as inherently evil. A surefire Hong Kong classic The Chinese Connection was given greater treatment in 1994 with Jet Li in the remake Fist of Legend.910".

It is pretty wellchoreographed for the time and features a decent supporting cast and characters  although the fact that all the police officers are sporting fedoras with their traditional garb is a bit ridiculous. Wu is a nice slimy villain Petrov  portrayed by Robert Baker is a pretty good toughguy and the film builds up towards the final confrontation between the two quite well. Notice as well that in this movie Bruce Lee is about ten pounds heavier than in his other feature films and looks stronger. I prefer this look to the skinnier  and thus a bit more muscularly definedversion of Lee we see in Enter The Dragon. The music in this movie is another highlight the sound effects used during the combat scenes coupled with slowmotion death blows are a nice touch  check out the killer blow to the Japanese cook's sternum  that add to the intensity and mortal nature of the violence being portrayed. The movie Fist Of Legend which tells the same story about actual event sin Chinese history is a decent film as well. One afternoon when time permits watch both offering s backtoback and you will find it well worth the time spent.".

I ain't kidding! Believe me from where I was sitting this was a sheer delight to watch. This sort of conduct from Bruce was a real slice of pure slapstick comedy straight out of an episode from The Three Stooges.This film also contained a helluva lot of outright prejudice and antagonism towards the Japanese. I certainly won't go into any great detail about it here  But I will say that the Japanese were all depicted as being a truly despicable bunch of pseudoNazi types.When it came to this picture's overall action sequences and the wonderful choreographing of its fight scenes I was really quite surprised when I came to realize just how often these very scenes have been lifted and blatantly used over and over again in such films as The Matrix Reloaded Kill Bill and other such films.Anyways  In spite of all the wooden performances the laughable dialog and the terrible dubbing that prevailed it was undeniably Bruce Lee the ultimate master of martial arts who shone magnificently throughout this very film that literally started the whole Kung Fu moviecraze over 40 years ago.".

But such assumptions are unfair since they are mainly based on the heavily cesored chopped and dubbed version which is rightly so laughably bad as to not even warrant a rating.Now I like to think I have seen enough of films to know what is good and what is not and this in its original form is marvellous although still not without its shortfalls i.e. some of the talky scenes expecially the romance scenes.  But other then that the film is powerful story albeit straighforward with the traditionhistory associated with the myths and legends of the martial artists from yesteryear.  The film is fused with revenge heroism and of course uncontrollable charisma! from a fully expressed Bruce Lee who plays the best role of his career downside is the overly dispicable portrayal of the japanese  on par with Saving Private RyanParticularly impressive in the film is the build up of the raw feral tension e.g. the funeral scene where a Lee dressed all in white is goaded by the translator.  Seen in widescreen you can really appreciate the composition of the fight scenes although the budget means the scenery on offer is samey and a bit stagey.  Again Lee is influenced by the traditional samurai films anyone familiar with Kurosawa's work will recall the Seven Samurai when Lee first enters the doorway to Suzuki's office and notably the 'Dollars' trilogy i.e the close up montage and build up of encounters.The fights feature Lee at his emotionally and maniacal best particularly the underrated exchange between the Russian Wall even if its ruined by a few random hits and the equally underrated if short killing of the two imposters in the kitchen.  Most memorable however is the first dojo set piece and the cat like grace of an eluding Lee to a Samurai sword towards the end.Those who are lucky enough to see the nunchuka v samurai sword battle at the end will see one of the most thrilling sequences in cinema since the shower scene from Pyscho or the crop duster scene from North by Northwest or the murder in Strangers by a Train etc or the shootout in Good the Bad and the Ugly.The film is intellictually and overaly not on par with Kurosawa's best naturally but is arguably just as or more 'superficially' enjoyable. Also worth a mention is the powerfully downbeat ending.  The film revolutionaised action films and is universally the ultimate martial arts film  still providing unsurpassable enjoyment for those who enjoy a good enjoyable flick.Also look out for a cameo appearance from Steve Martin at the end!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Fist of Fury is an improvement over Bruce Lee's previous movie technically speaking and the story is stronger. Above all the martial arts choreography is simply superb and represents the best of its kind. The violence is brutal and unpretentious. There is some history associated with this film focusing on the hatred between the Chinese and the Japanese races. That is the reason why the plot is better than usual.  Bruce Lee plays the avenging student of a local Chinese school who seeks revenge for the murder of his teacher. He soon runs afoul of this Japanese school  or should that be the other way round? Soon all hell breaks loose as Lee exerts his own brand of justice  in Kung Fu style! There is added tension in the story courtesy of the Chinese citizens being under the control of the Japanese.  Bruce Lee is a more hardedged character in this film. He displays almost no humour or charm and is strictly business. He dispatches his enemies without a second thought and without conscience. His anger and grief surface on more than occasion and in spectacular fashion. The fight scenes are amongst the best I've ever seen in a martial arts movie and I have watched a lot of them. Real life student of Bruce Lee  American Bob Baker  is on hand as a Russian martial artist. His fight against Lee is not to be missed. For the first time we bear witness to the use of the nunchukus. In the hands of Lee they are an exceptionally dangerous weapon.  At the beginning when Lee first enters the Japanese school he says the line We Chinese are NOT sick men the cinemagoers went wild with applause during the film's release in 1972. The Chinese people immediately regarded Bruce Lee as their hero and who can blame them? Fist of Fury proved to be so successful at the Asian box office after breaking all records that two different sequels were made. In my opinion neither one of them can match the original.".

Bruce Lee wanted to make films that appealed to everyone and wanted to break into the Japanese market but this movie wasn't going to allow that due to the subject matter provided by Lo Wei. His next film would be to date his biggest success money wise Way of the Dragon.";

	schema:headline " The Best Martial Arts Expert to Have Ever Acted on Screen";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie takes place in preWorld War 2 Shanghai when the Japanese were involved with expanding their empire at the expense of China. As a result Shanghai was considered an international city in which the major powers at the time pretty much used as they saw fit. Anyway it's during this time that a martial arts student by the name of Chen Zhen Bruce Lee returns to the dojo that meant so much to him. When he arrives he finds that his beloved master has died and is in the process of being buried. After a few days of intense bereavement Chen angrily demands to know how his master died. When told the official diagnosis was pneumonia Chen immediately rejects that explanation and suspects a more sinister cause. Not long afterward some members of a nearby Japanese dojo arrive and disrespectfully taunt those who are paying a final homage to their late master. This infuriates Chen who decides to take matters into his own hands and pay a visit to the rival dojo later that night. Now rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was one of the first martial arts films shown to American audiences and it made a huge impression at the time. Even so while it is certainly good I don't consider it to be the best martial arts film ever made. I say this because the dubbing on the film that I watched was extremely bad. Additionally the first fight scene between Bruce Lee and Yi Feng as the Japanese martial arts instructor named Yoshida was rather pathetic. Along with that the film quality wasn't exactly topnotch either. On the plus side this movie features the best martial arts expert to have ever acted on screen bar none. Likewise with the exception of the fight scene mentioned earlier the rest of the combat scenes were quite excellent. I especially liked the fight between Chen and Petrov Robert Baker. I also liked the addition of Nora Miao as Yuen Leerh. Be that as it may I thought this was a good movie and I rate it as slightly above average.".

Bruce lee jetli Donnie yen and Vincent zhao. one was even a world championjetli for a few years. Jackie sammo and yuen baio don't count because they studied peking opera dance and acrobatics. my favorite out of all of them is Bruce lee. mark my words just like there will never be another James Dean there will never be another Bruce lee. the mans a legend and he had a total of four completed films the last one in 1973 after that there were countless imitations. so if you are a true fan of Bruce lee his last completed film was enter the dragon in 1973. he was about to take the world by storm right before his death.OK on to the movie...the setting is preworld war 2 shanghai China and it is about his masters poisoning death by the hands of the Japanese while Bruce was away. he comes back for the funeral and is immediately suspicious unlike his other classmates.the investigation goes deeper he finds out people from his school were directly involved with the death and the bodies start pilingup from there on. the pacing got a little bit slow during the middle but thats okay it wasn't just a kungfu movie there was serious acting in it too. it is just the awesome imagery Bruce lee conveys when he is doing his thing...it is like on a visceral level impossible to duplicate. i love kungfu movies in general but i have to say there is no one like Bruce Lee...his style was his own and everybody tried to imitate him and everybody failed miserably or it was just meant to be comical. forget about other kungfu movie stars trying to imitate him... ever since i can rememberearly 1980'sof my childhood in NYC i would see him on TV i walk down the street and guys are imitating him i see tshirts of him and this is in the United States...i can imagine how crazy it must have been in Hong Kong.when Bruce lee did his moves they look so real and he was incredibly quick like a cat and the closest i've seen in speed is jet li. watching Bruce lee beat up badguys is like a guilty pleasure that you don't mind. there is so many classic images from this movie and they are like burned into my mind and i will never forget those images...the initial dojo fight the ending where the shot ends on a freeze frame and like a hundred other shots in the movie. this movie is bleaker then his other three films but it was shot beautifully more so then the other 3 films.thank you for your 4 completed films and may your legend and myth live on forever!".

If you read the other user reviews you'll see that everyone has their own different opinion loving the movie or hating it for their own personal reasons. And now I'll share my personal reasons with you...I was just a kid when the movie was released and far too young to see it. I was however aware at the time that every man in America was in love with Rachel Ward and that the Phil Collins title song and video was played incessantly. From what I had heard and seen of the movie it seemed very adult even taboo... unusual in the mostly familyfriendly 1980's.Flash forward twenty years... I finally saw the movie on cable... it was great not just as a film but because I'd been waiting so long to see it. It's an adult movie a loose remake of an old film noir but Against All Odds never gets too heavy. The mistake so many noirwannabes make is to have the characters so dark so doomed so DAMNED that you lose all sympathy for them. This film avoids that carefully showing how decent people can do terrible things and still remain... decent people.Jake Wise James Woods great as always is the skunky understated gangster who hires his footballer buddy Terry Brogan Jeff Bridges to find his missing girlfriend Jess Rachel Ward. Terry finds the sultry irresistible girl in South America but decides not to tell Jake opting instead to take her to bed and spend two weeks with her in paradise. Trouble finds them as it always does and the rest of the film is spent unraveling the web in which all three find themselves with enough surprises to keep you guessing.This film also fits nicely into my favorite subgenre The 80's Cocaine Nightmare. Such films including Bright Lights Big City American Psycho Tequila Sunrise and Less Than Zero feature successful beautiful people whose greed ambition and love of the flake eventually bring them to their sticky end.You may love it you may hate it but Against All Odds to me is a definitive 80's movie. It just works. And the final scene scored by Phil Collins' title song is perfection.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just recently discovering this on dvd I'm actually suprised I haven't heard much about it before. A modern film noir that's a very loose remake of Out of the Past with Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas. The film instead focuses on gorgeous sunny locations like Mexico and the finer locations of L.A. instead of the dark and grungy look that most film noir's follow. Jeff Bridges stars as a pro L.A. football player that gets cut because of a mild injury. Upset because he has some good years left in him he attempts to sue the team to no avail. Broke and looking for a job a shady past friend played by James Woods shows up with a job offer find his girlfriend who split on him and headed to Mexico. This girlfriend also happens to be the daughter of the woman who owns the L.A. pro football team a ruthless business woman who is primarily interested in real estate and inherited the team from her late husband. When he decides he needs a vacation and the money he takes Woods up on his offer. After a couple days of useless searching he finally finds her...and immediately falls in love. The femme fatale is played by Rachel Ward a hot commodity back then coming off of The Thornbirds. A spoiled rich princesstype she eventually succumbs to him and the following scenes are some of the most beautiful sequences put on film. The only commercial movie that has filmed scenes in the gorgeous ancient ruins of Chichen Itza and Tulum these sequences make the film. The sex scene is one of the best I've seen really putting a passion on the screen without becoming too...late night cinemax. Unfortunately from here the film plummets into a convuluted mess trying to deal with issues that seem out of place with the film The L.A. business elite gambling real estate etc. I think the film is definitely worth a watch for the first twothirds alone. Also dvd fans are encouraged to listen to the cast commentary. One of the better commentaries I've heard there is a lot of great anecdotes from a rare track by Jeff Bridges and James Woods. The two leads really seem to come off as real friends joking and ribbing each other unlike some of the stuffy professional actor commentaries that are usually the case.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ex football player Terry Brogran Jeff Bridges takes a job from sleazy friend Jake Wise James Woodsfind his ex girlfriend Jessie Wyler Rachel Ward who shot him and ran away with a large amount of his cash. Terry tracks Jessie to Mexico...and immediately they fall in love. That's the first hourthe second hour becomes very convoluted with murders and double crosses all over the place.Interesting movie which is a semiremake of Out of the Past. In fact Jane Greer from the original plays the mother of her character here! The original was a strong wellwritten film noir. This is not film noirit's a combination romancemysterymelodrama. Also Greer played a totally amoral woman in the originalhere Ward isn't amoral just misunderstood. Also Bridges is all pumped up and him and Ward work wonderfully together. Their frequent very R rated sex scenes really work. And it looks greata portion of the film takes place in Mexico. Still there are definite problems here.One character Edie Swoosie Kurtz is introduced to provide some REAL clumsy exposition...and doesn't pop up again until a HOUR later. I had forgotten who she was! Alex Karras is incredibly bad in his role. The plot gets way too confused. And the movie isn't sure what it wants to be. It switches gears so much I thought I was gonna get whiplash! The best part of the moviean incredible car race down Sunset Blvd. has NOTHING to do with anything in the movie! The acting is pretty good. Bridges in one of his few commercial films and Ward LOOK fantastic have great bodies and are both good in their roles. Woods is surprisingly pretty wooden. Greer isn't in much but she IS very good. And Richard Widmark hams it up in his small role.Also the film has a surprisingly somewhat downbeat ending. And there's a wonderful title song by Phil Collins nominated for an Academy Award.A very interesting movie. I give it a 6.

	onyx:emotionText "Ex football player Terry Brogran Jeff Bridges takes a job from sleazy friend Jake Wise James Woodsfind his ex girlfriend Jessie Wyler Rachel Ward who shot him and ran away with a large amount of his cash. Terry tracks Jessie to Mexico...and immediately they fall in love. That's the first hourthe second hour becomes very convoluted with murders and double crosses all over the place.Interesting movie which is a semiremake of Out of the Past. In fact Jane Greer from the original plays the mother of her character here! The original was a strong wellwritten film noir. This is not film noirit's a combination romancemysterymelodrama. Also Greer played a totally amoral woman in the originalhere Ward isn't amoral just misunderstood. Also Bridges is all pumped up and him and Ward work wonderfully together. Their frequent very R rated sex scenes really work. And it looks greata portion of the film takes place in Mexico. Still there are definite problems here.One character Edie Swoosie Kurtz is introduced to provide some REAL clumsy exposition...and doesn't pop up again until a HOUR later. I had forgotten who she was! Alex Karras is incredibly bad in his role. The plot gets way too confused. And the movie isn't sure what it wants to be. It switches gears so much I thought I was gonna get whiplash! The best part of the moviean incredible car race down Sunset Blvd. has NOTHING to do with anything in the movie! The acting is pretty good. Bridges in one of his few commercial films and Ward LOOK fantastic have great bodies and are both good in their roles. Woods is surprisingly pretty wooden. Greer isn't in much but she IS very good. And Richard Widmark hams it up in his small role.Also the film has a surprisingly somewhat downbeat ending. And there's a wonderful title song by Phil Collins nominated for an Academy Award.A very interesting movie. I give it a 6. A sizable hit in its daybut that's because of the steamy sex scenes between Ward and Bridges.";

	schema:reviewBody "Just bought and watched this DVD. This is the first time I've watched this film for many years. I've always loved this film and its great to finally own it on DVD. Its hard to believe this film is 20 years old now but it hasn't dated and is one of the best films to come out of the 80's. Its a cracking thriller that goes along at a fast pace. it does get a bit muddled in the middle as the plot unfolds but builds up to a dramatic ending. Rachel Ward is totally stunning in this film and has a fantastic body though sadly we don't get to see all of her body thanks to some pretty remarkable camera work!! The scenes between her and Jeff Bridges are very hot. James Woods is great in this film as well. Its a real tear jerking end with the end credits rolling to Phil Collins greatest ever song 'Against all Odds' with our two stars of the film unable to be with each other thanks to Rachel Ward's powerful family. If ever a film needed a sequel it was this one but sadly it was never made. This film is well worth owning on DVD and can be bought at a pretty cheap price and comes with quite a few deleted scenes which do add to the film. I must check out the Directors commentary with James Wood and Jeff Bridges. On the whole this is a very watchable film with some very steamy scenes. I give it 8 12 out of 10. A little known fact is that the song 'Against All Odds' was a reject song from one of Phil Collin's albums which he deemed wasn't good enough for the album!!!!".

However Rachel Ward fails to convince that Jessie could obsess anyone with her flat delivery and phonedin performance. Jessie runs off to Mexico to snorkel and shop and her gangster boyfriend hires an injured football player to find her. Sending a handsome hunky athlete off to find your girlfriend at the beach is not an inspired idea and both the expected and the unexpected ensue. The twisted convoluted tale occasionally meanders and the pacing falters at times. However when the sweaty romantic scenes are over the plot manages to reenergize and recapture attention towards the fade out.Despite her physical beauty Ward is the black hole at the film's center. However her two costars are more captivating. James Woods can play slimy gangsters in his sleep and his Jake Wise is appropriately chilling and creepy which makes Jessie's attraction to him even less convincing. Evidently Jake had a brain fart when he decided to hire Terry Brogan to search for the girl who deserted him because Jake and Terry are worlds apart in the looks and charm departments. Jeff Bridges's athletic Terry who has history with Jake is unwittingly drawn into a vortex of corruption during his search for Jessie. Although always watchable Jeff Bridges has had better and more demanding roles than an injured jock playing private eye. Despite a decent script adapted by Eric Hughes from Daniel Mainwaring's original the film's central mystery is why Jake and Terry would be hopelessly drawn to a shallow drifter like Jessie. Ward received top billing over Bridges and Woods another mystery as baffling as any in the plot.Experienced veterans provide solid supporting performances led by a stillhandsome Richard Widmark who at age 70 remained a commanding presence. In a nod to film buffs Jane Greer star of the 1947 version appears as Ward's cold distant mother. Location work in the Mayan temples of Mexico's Yucatan is travellog appealing and the end credits feature an Oscarnominated title song by Phil Collins. An exciting car race through Los Angeles traffic is thrilling if pointlessly reckless. Although Against All Odds runs more than 20 minutes longer than the 1947 original Bridges and especially Woods are compelling enough to hold attention even when the tricky plot wanders.".

Not that the players in this film are bad far from it. But the whole basic structure of the story was completely changed.What made Out of the Past the classic it is is the moody tension and overwhelming sadness surrounding the leading characters. Most of all Jane Greer who is an evil temptress beyond description bringing death and destruction to all around her.Jane Greer is in this film but as the mother of Rachel Ward who plays the part Greer had in the original. Ward in this one is just a spoiled young woman who runs off with bookie James Woods to upset mom and then runs off with him.Greer is the owner of a professional football team in Los Angeles which she runs with her high priced fixer of a lawyer Richard Widmark. I think they're characters are modeled on Joan Payson who was the original owner of the New York Mets and M. Donald Grant who was reputed to be the hard character Widmark portrays.Anyway Jeff Bridges gets into the act when he's cut from Greer's team and goes to work for Woods trying to locate Ward. The rest of the film is pretty much following the plot of Out of the Past until the ending which is completely different. Remember how everyone ended up in the RKO film and the same doesn't happen to most of them.Still it's not a bad film but Against All Odds just won't be a classic.".

There are so many twists and turns in the plot it will keep you guessing right up to the end.I don't want to give anything away but there's a great car chase scene that will have you on the edge of your seat. There are some nice scenes of the ruins at Chichen Itza in Mexico and the beautiful island of Cozumel before it became a tourist trap. The soundtrack is great too.I've seen this movie at least 10 times on video maybe more. When I first saw it in the theater in 1984 I hadn't even heard of James Woods before. He is truly a plus in this picture in fact all the cast is really good. Even though this is in the category of Romance it's not a chickflick. Guys will like it too.".

Although Mr. Woods does a very courageousconvincing job of staying with the schizophrenic character. If there could be a reason to slog through this film James Woods would be it.

	schema:headline " An Obscure Film Starring Jeff Bridges";
	schema:reviewBody "For those who consider themselves Jeff Bridges fans have never experienced him in this rather obscure film back in the year 1984. Jeff Bridges was definitely eye candy to the female demographic and it doesn't hurt that a romantic story is added to the crime drama that also stars James Woods and Rachel Ward. The gorgeous island landscape will surely inspire you reconsider where you plan to go to for your next vacation. And if the romance and the island paradise are not your cup of tea there is also a story filled with conniving dirty scoundrels corruption greed money and power that will likely keep the fans of noir intrigued. Jeff Bridges stars as Terry Brogan a football player trying to make a comeback after being on the shelf with a shoulder injury. But due to a political loophole Brogan is cut from the team. Suffering from financial debt and nowhere to turn to he is contacted by a sleazy businessman Jake Wise James Woods whose reputation has not always been clean. Jake is also not on very happy terms at the moment because his girlfriend Jessie Rachel Ward who's the owner's daughter to the team that Brogan played for betrayed him and left the guy in a perpetual limp. With an act of desperation for money Brogan arbitrarily agrees to help Wise look for Jessie and sure enough he finds her but is not sure if he wants to bring her back to Jake Wise as he falls head over heels for her. They soak up sun sun together they frolic in the sand which lead to Jake bringing in a hired hand to see what the hell is going on. Things take a turn for the worse and the lovebirds find themselves in a precarious situation that neither of them can escape. Do they have the any chance to escape their fate before it is too late?The love triangle is surprisingly very engaging even though situations like this has been done thousands of times before. The chemistry between Bridges and Woods is very intriguing and the romantic angle between Ward and Bridges will surely make your heart melt like a snowman in a microwave. The suspense is engaging the thrills are exciting and the action could get pretty intense at times. But the crime drama can also tend to have its share of awkward moments as well. Brogan has become a man on a mission even through blackmail and is now a man running for his life all on account of just looking for extra money to get him out of debt. The premise can at time be quite surreal at times and the twists and turns are can leave you puzzled thanks mainly to the script by Eric Hughes and Daniel Manwaring. The plot of the story gets lost in the shuffle and the good relaxing time on the beach well let's just say it wipedout.Bridges plays his role quite convincingly as a wounded man a naive guy who put his foot in a place he never should have been in from the beginning. The man has a heavy burden on his shoulder and he succeeds very well in carrying it. I was never a huge fan of Rachel Ward but she's not sore on the eyes. The dialogue between her a Bridges are well executed but his attraction to her is well obvious and not very well hidden. Woods is in his usual territory as the slimy backstabbing remorseless scoundrel who has no problem dealing with anyone who crosses his path even if it isn't always pretty. Alex Karras as the head patriarch from the 1980's sitcom Webster plays a pivotal supporting role as a coach and sponsor to Mr. Brogan. Though the story has its share of lopsided scenes it is still one worthy enough to enjoy. For Jeff Bridges fans who have overlooked this one should see him in his prime. He brings his charm and personality here like he's done in almost 45 years he has graced the silver screen.It will surely please everyone who enjoys romance suspense and action.".

	schema:reviewBody "The knock on 1980s movies is that they sacrifice substance for style leaning too hard on whizbang visuals and MTV video aesthetics at the expense of character and story. Like every such generalization it's not strictly true but you would be excused thinking otherwise after watching this 1984 crime drama.Terry Brogan Jeff Bridges is a pro football player suddenly cut from the Los Angeles Outlaws on bogus terms. Sleazy gambling buddy Jake Wise James Woods offers him some needed funds in exchange for Terry finding a mysterious woman who stabbed Jake stole his money and fled to the Mayan ruins of Mexico. When Brogan discovers this woman Jessie looks exactly like Rachel Ward in her gravitydefying heyday he decides on a new plan involving much sex and tequila. Naturally things get crazy setting in motion murder heartbreak and an emotive Phil Collins ballad.Based loosely on the classic noir firm Out Of The Past Against All Odds is best known today for the Phil Collins tune. It's a classy song that emotes a lot but doesn't overstay its welcome. At two hours you can't say the same of the film.When we first see Terry he's walking around Mexico showing an old photo of Jessie to random passersby. This shouldn't work except of course its a movie. Bridges looks great with a lean build a tan shades and a beard that makes him look like a cross between Dan Fouts and Kenny Rogers. He has good chemistry with Woods here debuting his hardguyinasuit who would brighten many a film over the next two decades.Director Taylor Hackford gets the visual elements right but the story feels as lost as Terry in his opening scene especially when it is complicated by a L.A. real estate venture and Jake's gambling activities. More than most '80s films the plot seems to do little more than whisk the characters from one exotic locale to another.The Out Of The Past connection works only to the detriment of this film as the plot of the Robert Mitchum film followed a more straightforward path and gave us a central female figure in Jane Greer who is one of the great femme fatales in cinema. Ward by contrast is painfully unsteady as she wears her heart way too far out on her sleeve.Can't anyone love me without it being life or death? she cries out a line she delivers so badly you wince from watching it. Judging Ward's acting skills is unfair given the fact she must spout lines like this with painful regularity.Alex Karras as Terry's trainer is just as awful as Ward and not nearly as much fun to look at showing up out of nowhere in the middle of Terry and Jessie's most heated lovemaking session to up the ante on the film's unbelievability quotient.I enjoy its aesthetic very Miami Vice with more earth tones and good musical segues. Hackford is always terrific at that anyway. The sex scenes got a lot of attention in 1984 though they are actually subtle by today's standards. Ward and Bridges sure can kiss at any rate which helps keep dialogue to a minimum.I wish I'd seen you play football she says.I could see how Jake would go crazy without you he replies.Dumb characters are at the heart of a successful film noir but the passion that usually guides them to their doom feels tacked on here. As an ambiance bath Against All Odds has something going for it in Bridges' lazy effectiveness as a romantic foil and Woods' nicely underplayed menace. But even the noirish darkness of the last scenes can't conceal the weaknesses of this overstudied underbaked time capsule.".

The chemistry between the actors is blah at best and the script's dialog is as elementary as the plot. It's not worth the time or effort to watch.

Yet another 80's movie where the theme song is the only good thing about it see also Caddyshack 2 Over the Top Chariots of Fire and many more that I can't think of right now 2 out of 10 bc the song makes it only slight better than Mo' Money".

Basically in Los Angeles professional football player Terry Brogan Jeff Bridges is cut from his team due to his age and numerous injuries in need of money he accepts a job from an old acquaintance the shady gambler and nightclub owner Jake Wise James Woods. Jake wants Terry to track down his girlfriend Jessie Wyler The Thorn Birds' Rachel Ward who has disappeared somewhere in Mexico she is daughter of a wealthy land developer who owns Terry's team apparently she has stolen money from him Jake claims he just wants to know what has happened to her. Terry is reluctant to take the job but he is desperate for the money and knows Jake can blackmail him Terry starts by visiting Jessie's mother Mrs. Wyler Build My Gallows High's Jane Greer to get information about where to find her daughter but also to convince her business partner Ben Caxton Richard Widmark to reinstate him on the team. Terry travels to the eastern coast of Mexico to Cozumel an island in the Caribbean Sea and he finds Jessie living there she refuses any attempts he makes to approach her as she is confident he was sent by Jake or her mother. Eventually they have a conversation Terry has fallen in love with Jessie they get much closer and happily spend the next few weeks together Terry continues to call Jake claiming that his search is unsuccessful. Terry's team trainer Hank Sully Alex Karras is sent by Jake to investigate he catches the lovers he corners them into the ruins of Chichen Itza wielding a gun but a struggle ensues and Jessie ends up shooting Sully she disappears while Terry disposes of the body. Terry returns to Los Angeles he is shocked to find Jessie has returned to Jake who has a hold on Terry due to the incident between them in the past and the death of Sully so Terry is blackmailed into doing some dirty work. Terry breaks into the office of Kirsch Saul Rubinek the team's corrupt lawyer who is involved in Jake's operation only to find Kirsch there and dead a security guard has been hired to kill Terry and make it look like he committed murder but Terry fights off the security guard. Terry visits Kirsch's secretary Edie Swoosie Kurtz she tells him about a secret box containing information to bring down the entire syndicate and local politicians after another security guard confrontation he is able to get the files. Jessie claims to still be in love with Terry but stays by Jake's side she tells Caxton everything she knows unaware that he is actually Jake's boss in the syndicate Caxton takes charge and arranges a meeting with Terry at at the site of a new construction project that he and Mrs. Wyler are backing. Terry is able to disarm the henchmen he demands Caxton take down Jake in exchange for the files but Jake pulls a gun and threatens to kill Jessie Terry drops his weapon Jessie retrieves this and shoots Jake. In the end Jessie is forced to agree to Caxton's terms to avoid jail returning to her estranged mother and ending her relationship with Terry months later Terry wants to look at Jessie one last time before leaving Los Angeles to play with a team in Miami Caxton reminds him he is no longer part of Jessie's life all they can do is look at each other from a distance. Also starring Dorian Harewood as Tommy Pat Corley as Ed Phillips and Bill McKinney as Head Coach. Bridges is alright as the guy in love but stuck in the middle Ward is good as the not so innocent girl and Woods does fairly well as the mean minor mobster this film is apparently a loose remake of Build My Gallows High I found the first half of the film pretty good the love story is nice but the second half is slightly confusing and uneven with the rest it doesn't help that the show is just over two hours at least it has the great song play in the end credits overall I found it an average romantic thriller. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Phil Collins  Against All Odds Take a Look at Me Now. Worth watching!".

While this is nowhere near Oscar worthy it is what it is an exciting fun beautifully filmed movie featuring an unforgettable couple with some of the hottest screen chemistry to come out of the 80's.Against all Odds has a few major things in it's favor and one of them is the characters of Jessie and Terry played by Rachel Ward and Jeff Bridges respectively. Rachel's Jessie is such a complex badgood girl and Jeff's Terry is so utterly pristine with a touch of bad boy that the combination makes for a pretty well matched sizzling couple with screen chemistry that is almost effortless. Likewise from a cinematographic standpoint the movie is beautifully filmed the scenes with Jessie and Terry on the run in particular are magnificent and pure eighties. And the movie is great at building tension as well.Against all odds isn't without flaws there are times when one is tempted to channel surf. Frankly when Terry and Jessie aren't on screen together the movie slows down noticeably. But for the most part it's a mostly fun to watch picture. And as frequently mentioned already by others the end shot is flawless.I'd give this a solid 7.5. One very good thing about Against All Odds is it can be viewed more then once and still stay interesting. Most definitely recommended for those who have yet to check this one out.".
