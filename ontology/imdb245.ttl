	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion this is one of the best Laura Antonelli comedies of her whole career. There can be no doubt she did better films per se  Malizia Mogliamante L'Innocente  but when it comes to a truly successful comedy Il Merlo Maschio is definitely high in rank in her filmography.Niccolo Vivaldi is a talented but failing cellist at the famous Verona amphitheatre orchestra. Slightly neurotic he feels disregarded disrespected unfairly treated all the time. When his wife little dorky but likable peasant girl Costanza needs to go into rehab Niccolo is there when she undresses in front of the doctors  and all of a sudden he realizes his wife is a bombshell like no other! And how to get the admiration he desperately seeks. Niccolo starts out easy by taking pictures of Costanza in the nude and gains selfesteem after showing them to his colleagues. But his role plays and increasingly wild sexual phantasies put their relationship to the test...Lando Buzzanca is just fantastic to watch as Niccolo going from deep depression up to maximum excitement and then anew. Of course it's a role taylormade for the comedy veteran Buzzanca and he succeeds in generating sympathy for underdog Niccolo right from the very first minute. Costanza is played by the young Laura Antonelli in 1971 still not too wellknown. But films like this one surely made her stand out. Laura is just adorable as the simple housewife and she does some really funny peasant dialect in the Italian version. Her dialogs are just hilarious and although the part lacks some depth she acts very decently and is definitely convincing.There can be no denying the script relies heavily on the typical sexy commedia all'italiana ingredients  frivolous dialogs and female nudity packed in funny and awkward situations. And oh boy this film delivers plenty of that. Or let's say Laura delivers plenty of that. She is a feast for the eyes and there is a variety of very memorable scenes. Truly awesome.But at the same token this is not just a Laura inspection. We take part in Niccolo's career efforts at the orchestra there is a surprising amount of not too farfetched psychological elements and the two get into a marriage crisis due to Niccolo's desires. There is considerable substance beyond the nudity. Music plays a huge part itself and the score provides wonderful renditions and variations of classical tunes combined with very pleasant original music.However the situations that Niccolo puts Costanza in during the final twenty minutes are going a little over the top some scenes felt repetitive. But this is complaining from a very high level as the movie remains entertaining until the end.As said this is a very good comedy with a funny script and a great pair of actors. Laura Antonelli fans mustn't miss this!".

	schema:headline " Superior Italian sex comedy with the great Lando Buzzanca and the gorgeous Laura Antonelli";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those vaguely arty Freudianbased Italian sex comedies that were popular in the early 70's. It's very similar to Lucio Fulci's The Eroticist and to the director Festa's earlier The Libertine but it's not as cleverly satirical as the former and doesn't quite have the effective story of the latter. The film reteams Lando Buzzanca and Laura Antonelli from The Eroticist. Buzzanca plays a bass cellist who's frustrated by his own ignominyno one seems to ever notice him or remember his name and he lives perpetually in the shadow of his famous virtuoso violinist father. While accompanying his wife to a doctor's appointment he becomes obsessed when he notices other men staring at his his wife's gorgeous naked body apparently he was not previously aware he was married to Laura Antonelli. He concocts increasing elaborateand publicschemes to get both strangers and colleagues to see his wife in the altogether. His wife's body replaces the bass cello as his instrument for getting the attention of the world and he has strange Freudian dreams where his snooty conductor conducts he and his wife's lovemaking or where he takes Antonelli out of his bass cello case and plays her naked backside with a violin bow.Buzzanca is always very good in these manictype rolls. Antonelli has been sexier in other films like when she played a guilty but lustcrazed nun in The Eroticist a cruelly unfaithful wife in Venus in Furs and an improbably sexy maid who seduces both a father and teenage son in Malizia. However with the possible exception of The Ventian Lady when she was considerably older this might be her most perpetually naked role andgood god!what an incredible body she has here. Warning heterosexual male viewers who watch this movie may find themselves being sexually aroused by bass cellos for years afterwards. The direction by the talented Italian comedy director Pasquale Campanile Festa is good as always. This is marred only by a rather lame ending but since I saw this on a bootleg perhaps I got a bad cut of this. It's perhaps not the highest of compliments but this is certainly one of the better Italian sex comedies of the era.".

It premiered in Sweden was shot on locations in Sweden and USA and is a Swedish production which was produced by Bengt Forslund is the second and last part of a twopart film and was preceded by The Emigrants 1971 and was produced by Bengt Forslund. It tells the story about KarlOskar Nilsson and Kristina Johansdotter who after having emigrated from Smland Sweden with many other Swedish emigrants travels from New York City USA to an area in Taylor Falls Minnesota USA. KarlOskar finds and claims a piece of land for his family at a place called KiChiSaga and there they settle after saying goodbye to his brother Robert and his friend Arvid. Acutely and engagingly directed by Jan Troell this period drama set against the backdrop of America during the late 1850s and 1860s draws an extensive and gripping portrayal of a group of Swedish emigrants who travels to the United States to make new and better lives for themselves and a compassionate portrayal of a relationship between a peasant and his wife who are striving to support their children and themselves in a foreign country during the American Civil War. While notable for its poignant production design by Swedish art director P.A. Lundgren 19112002 the brilliant cinematography by Jan Troell and the fine costume design by Swedish costume designer UllaBritt Sderlund 19431985 this character driven and dialogdriven epic examines themes like family relations interpersonal relations friendship poverty religion cultural differences love courage and dignity.With the natural surroundings playing an important and symbolic part of the story and depicting various character portrayals this reverent sequel becomes an indepth study of character has a distinct atmosphere which is emphasized by the naturalistic milieu depictions and the efficient score by Swedish composers Bengt Ernryd and Georg Oddner 19232007 and is impelled and reinforced by the empathic and involving acting performances by Swedish actors Max von Sydow and Eddie Axberg Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann and Swedish actress and singer Monica Zetterlund 19372005.

Today no bottom line fixated TV executive would green light such a drama series. What? No cops no doctors no forensic experts? No go. I guess the 70s were a more adventurous time in TV programing. In any case the series was canceled after one season. I recently read Vilhelm Moberg's novel I think there were really three novels in this saga The Last Letter Home and while KarlOskar dies at the end of the novel he does not suffer quite the humiliation his character suffers in the film. At the end of the film I seem to recall that he had been forced by bad health perhaps? to leave his farm and live in as an anonymous shuffling old man in some urban setting. In the novel he is still on his farm when he dies. Perhaps Jan Troell the director of the film was trying to make a point about how the struggles of the pioneers are not remembered or honored by those generations who came after them. it's too bad these films seem to have also slipped from our collective memory.".

The acting like the average Swedish immigrant is very restrained and understated. Again they were seeking absolute realism and got it. However while I generally enjoyed this SLOW tale I found the part when von Sydow's brother returned to be very poorly executed. Instead of a narrative it was shown through cloudy dreams and confusing snippetsand TOTALLY derailed the movie until this segment was completed. I really can't understand why they chose to change the pacing focus and perspective of the film so abruptly. Well fortunately after this brother dies the film gets back on track. Not a great film as it's too slow to interest all but the biggest historians and cinephiles and the segment with the brother just didn't ring true.

But in The New Land they've settled into that life and their new home proves not to be the utopia they dreamed.It's astonishing how authentic these films feel and it's hard to remember while watching them that they were made in the early 1970s. The New Land has some really difficult passages to watch namely one involving the murder of a settler family at the hands of a gang of Native Americans  including the horrific death of a baby  and another an extended segment that details the nightmarish fever dream of a journey two of the settlers take to mine for gold in California. This story line started to feel long to me and in a film that clocks in at nearly three and a half hours I wouldn't have minded this one being left on the cutting room floor. But it doesn't mar the overall brilliance of this film as a stand alone story or the entire twofilm saga.And unlike The Emigrants which I only found in a dubbed version The New Land is subtitled in English which makes for a much more pleasant viewing experience.

The films are actually one long film broken in half so that each could be seen separately.   As can be guessed from the titles the first film sets up the plot by showing us that despite intelligence and hard work many families couldn't make a living on the small plots of land in Sweden. The second film follows the family from Sweden to the United States.   The situation for them in the U.S. isn't that much better when they arrive but they have reasonable hope that they will succeed.  Max von Sydow plays the husband Karl Oskar and Liv Ullmann plays his wife Kristina. Both are extraordinarily talented. In addition Von Sydow is handsome and Ullmann is impossibly beautiful.  The remainder of the cast is strong and the acting by the children is wonderful.  These movies will work better on the large screen but we had to settle for the small screen.

Scandinavian immigrants to the Minnesota Territory in the 1850'sbefore the US Civil War found conditions both familiar and alien. The cold climate was like their native land but the soil of the New World was more fertile and not so stony. It was a place of open spaces and vast pine forests few towns and no cities to compare with Stockholm or Oslo.In the story friendships are tested some broken over issues of religion. Family life isn't always smooth or predictable. There are generational conflicts. Historical events are alluded to such as the Civil War or depicted if briefly like the 1862 uprising of the Eastern Sioux starving on their Minnesota reservation with deadly attacks on surrounding settlements until put down by the US Army. Yet the Indian side of the conflict is given play also with the emigrants coming to understand that The New Land had belonged to others before them.".

We see the great struggle of human existence played out against hardship joy horror and tragedy. All of it told through acting directing and a poetic visual style that drive home the themes and haunt the memory long afterward.

Trll spares the viewer nothing as far as life's harsh realities go. He takes chances too. Midway through THE NEW LAND we are shown a lengthy flashback of Robert's harrowing ordeal when he and a friend leave Minnesota to find gold in California. Things go terribly wrong and the sequence can resemble the writing of Cormac McCarthy in its grim poetrytold mostly without dialog and a percussiononly score. Not many directors would have risked it but he sequence adds immeasurably to Robert's tragic character. In the end this is Karl Oscar's story with Max von Sydow in what could be his greatest role. All the wonder and sadness of life is in his performance and up there on the screen. This is a great film by any standard.".

	schema:reviewBody "Julia Piper Perabo is a fetching college student with a host of admirers and big dreams of a career. Enter Drew. He is a law student and from the minute he sees Julia he chases her relentlessly. When he finally captures her Drew convinces Julia to move cross country with him to California. He has good job prospects. However she has to give up a nice career opportunity in Chicago. Despite the fact that she has only known him two months Julia agrees to the move. But will it be love everlasting or will there be complications? This would be a good movie to recommend to anyone who is on the verge of rushing into a relationship. Julia and Drew are genuinely in love they believe yet their love is definitely tested by other relatives by job choices by attractive coworkers etc. The two stars are beautiful people and this fact adds much to the film's enjoyment. Also the film features the most darling DOG ever put on screen and a charming little apartment setting complete with flamingo decor. No the movie is not perfect. Yet for those who love the tales of romance and are forever searching for a new one this is a good addition. Because yes the film is perfect for a cozy evening in the dead of winter. Cook up the hot chocolate and wrap yourself in this story as well as a suitable afghan.".

Although the film can be a bit slow at times and a little silly...it does have some very funny situations and moments.I enjoyed it and will probably see it in the future as well.

A Piece of my Heart aka My Last First Date not only has some great scenes about the 'truth of dating' it also provides some comical fillers and connections between the lives of all the characters. Based from the play 'Heart' this script had many truthful analogies about what each sex is thinking. It covers both sides of a relationship Martin Henderson and Piper Perabo and then gains more insight from the friends watching the relationship. This movie is brutally honest and I believe that EVERYONE who goes to see this movie will say at least once 'That's happened to me before'. Finally it's a good romantic comedy since last year.".

It shows in Perfect Opposites that everybody worked with happiness and dedication. It's a comedy but it's well made funny and good.The story is told by Drew played naturally and confidently by Martin Henderson. He wants the viewer to know what happen to him and a girl he is in love with. He places himself in Los Angeles about to get it on with her but suddenly the movie stops. Drew has stopped it to go back in time and tell us how both of them met it has been done before but it's constantly repeated here and it works every timeJulia is the name of the girl.There was a movie I saw a long time ago about some girls struggling for their life and trying to be independent and one of them wanted to be a singer. It was called Coyote Ugly and I don't remember liking the movie very much but the girl in the main role a beautiful and talented actress called Piper Perabo who illuminated the screen and still does today here as Julia.Julia and Drew suffer every couple's problems and the movie does a very good job putting them on screen. Drew's friend Danny Jason Winer has a theory about the monogamy of men They can't have sex with one woman only. And Drew starts to think about that and concludes that if he stays with Julia he'll have sex with only one woman in his life.But he loves her and although she loves him and it should be enough we know that most of the time it's not. They become friends of an older couple a null Jennifer Tilly and a wonderful Artie Lange who gives advice to each of them when they go through rough times. It happens that we know what we want but we are not able to show it.The movie is an example of the comedies with pleasure we should be getting every week in theaters. Pieces about people with feelings and aspirationsLike Drew who works for Louis an excellent Joe Pantoliano and forgets about Julia. But we laugh then because they are very similar and they find themselves because of it and we smile when they kiss with passion.Director Matt Cooper causes that effect on us and he should be proud. Stewart Zully who wrote the picture with Cooper should be proud too. They do their best to skip the clichs of the genre and they skip a lot of them. And the few they show are so in the tone of the film that they don't seem like clichs. They are connected to the characters and their forms of being and we believe it.Because in every romantic comedy whether good or bad the clichs are just clichs because they need to be in the film. Not here this is a comedy at a different level away from everything you've seen lately. Take my word.".

This movie worked for me on so many levelschiefly the casting was flawless and their performances hugely satisfying.  What is most surprising is that the movie succeeds in creating that old fashioned romantic comedy where the leads are true 'movie stars'. You love them because they have charisma screen presence and chemistry and you simply can't look away! In these movies the supporting players are true character actors that due to the generosity of the leads steal every bit scene they're in. It's been years since a romantic comedy has had any success or appeal to me.  Usually these are tortured films with postFreudianpostmodern angst attempting to reinvent the genre by making the leads as unattractive and neurotic as filmmakers think audiences can relate to.  Love and Sex is a case on point of the nadir postwhatever romantic comedy. This film stars the improbable coupling of the exbond girlWoody Allen alummodel Famke Jansen struggling to be modern in NYC and having a warm and fuzzy time with  Jon Favreau the once favorite antimovie star. Or Happy Accidents the Marisa TomeiVincent D'onofrio romantic comedy which suffers from and even greater desperate need to attenuate the genre by making its lead a space alien without having watched the wonderful Starman with Jeff Bridges for pointers. These and others like them represent the soulless grasping of clueless filmmakers trying to re invent the wheel only to end up  with a sloppy narcissistic acting exercises on tape.It seems to me that these quirky indie romances have a chip on their shoulder as if  they had been backed up into an angry corner screaming their head off.  Their look and style is  usually suffocating and claustrophobic.  I found Piece of my Heart refreshing and familiar the way old fashioned movies with their movie stars and predictable formulas always promised a good time a true escape.  At the screening there were a group of fourteen year old girls.  The film had been an obvious success with them and someone commented that they were the true audience of this film. I disagree.  I have sat through films designed for this demographic replete with ribald fart jokes and enough stupidity and insincerity to last them through High School.  A Piece of my Heart is too sincere and guileless too do that.  It succeeds despite the obstacles of a jaded 'postmodern' audience because it truly has the elusive ingredient that love stories no matter when have always reached forChemistry!And yet as old fashioned as it seems it has such verve and modern flair. The characters are totally contemporary.  The look is a fun kaleidoscope of LA living.  The editing has all the wit and modern vernacular youth culture has come to expect and love. All that is no simple achievement in my estimation.  What comes through is true movie magic!".

Nevertheless as the complications arise we find ourselves identifying with the two main characters more than we expect to at the beginning of the story.

It takes a slightly more mature view of the world than most films of its type building to a final scene that is a tad more thoughtful than what we are accustomed to in a romantic comedy. For that reason alone it deserves some recognition.".

The young couple become close friends of their neighbors Elyse Jennifer Tilly and Lenny Steinberg Artie Lange who owns a small real estate business. However the immature Drew breaks the relationship with Julia afraid of the consequences of their commitment.Perfect Opposites is a little gem in the genre of romantic comedy. The cute story presents funny romantic and dramatic situations in right doses and pace and has a very appropriate inconclusive end. The chemistry of Martin Henderson and Piper Perabo together of the humor of Jennifer Tilly and Artie Lange and good lines make this sweet movie a surprisingly great entertainment and therefore highly recommended for fans of a delightful romantic comedy.

I didn't like very much ''A Piece of My Heart'' also because I don't like very much predictable endings and when Julia says to Drew in the end of the movie that she got divorce I already knew she would end up being with him again. I thought that Julia's character was too good to stay with Drewa guy who was so much malleable and susceptible to make wrong choices. The good thing about this movie is to show some of the real problems and discussions that we do have in a serious relationshipspecially between men and women and starts to make our lives complicated.".

Treat each other with disrespect from the beginning and you'll go right on doing it.That's what eventually broke this couple up  he didn't keep his promises to her nor keep his eyes to himself. She didn't let him have a say in the decisions that they were supposed to make as a couple.Both of them blame the other person and don't accept responsibility for their trail of broken relationships. So although it's no surprise that they're both single at the end of the film they are inexplicably thinking about getting back together again.This movie goes in my Watch it Once and Only Once category.".

The production value was high for it was easy to believe that what was seen was really a little Russian village by the sea. The ship must have been authentic outfitted with no less than real scarlett silk sails! The story is a simple fairy tale following the adventurous hero and graceful heroine from childhood.Sadly this may not reach the audience it deserves. Perhaps that just as Western art students are reexamining Soviet creations without the political prejudice of times past so too should these wonderful films come to light. I'd recommend this to anyone who appreciates classic storytelling.".

It's been many years since I saw Scarlet Sails but it still has the same power over me. Watching it again recently I realized how incredibly beautiful it is how wonderfully directed by Walt Disney of the Soviet Union Alexander Ptushko who had made such masterpieces as The Stone Flower Sadko 1953 The Tale of Tsar Saltan Ruslan and Ludmila The New Gulliver and many more. The film tells the story of a little girl named Asole  who meets a wizard one day. He tells her that sometime in the future a ship with red sails will arrive  to take her away to a new happy life. She holds onto this prediction in spite of taunts and the ridicule of her neighbors Ruscico DVD is great. The film's images are fresh and joyful. The DVD includes Russian version with subtitles and dubbed to English and French versions. 16 years old Anastasiya Vertinskaya whom you may remember as Ophelia in Kozintzev's Gamlet plays Asole  it was her first role ever. Vaslily Lanovoy plays Arthur Grey  the young nobleman who dreamed of becoming a sea captain since he was a boy and who made Asole's dream come true by creating a miracle for her the only miracle she had been waiting for all her lifeI have come to the person who is waiting only for me. I want only her perhaps for the precise reason that thanks to her I have been able to understand one simple truth that socalled miracles are made with one's own hands.But there are other miracles a smile gladness forgiveness and a word which is needed and said in time. To experience them is to possess everything. As for Asole and me we will remain forever in the glow of scarlet sails created in the depths of a heart that knows what love is".

It presents the story about how a miracle can happen when faith and love join together. A small girl was told once that a noble prince will come for her on a ship with scarlet sails. She believed the story and kept this faith even when she grew up. She was considered strange the town's people laughed at her and her life wasn't easy but she managed to preserve a golden heart and pure eyes of a child. And when a brave young captain saw her he fell in love with her and decided to fulfill her dream.This movie is for everyone who has a romantic soul and believes in miracles. It's very air is full of beauty dream and poetry and it has a lot of Christian motives in it though this may seem strange when speaking about a Soviet movie. But it is so because eternal virtues that this movie is about are common for all people whether they are Russian or not. I highly recommend The Scarlet Sails for family viewing and for those everlasting romantics that world would have been so dull without.Rating 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I've liked all that I've seen from Aleksandr Ptushko the three films of his that have been shown on MST3K are much better than they're made out to be because the original versions are beautiful but are ruined significantly by the dubs. Scarlet Sails is one of his absolute best if I had a top 3 I would almost certainly put it up there alongside Stone Flower and The Tale of Tsar Sultan. Like with all of Ptushko's films it is visually stunning with photography that has a simple sweep that is kept unobtrusively and breathtaking sets and scenery that makes you wish you were in Russia. Any details seen like the ship are so well constructed also that you are convinced they're real. The music is sumptuous and has a feel of affecting romance and wondrous fantasy it also has a very Soviet sound to it and if there was a CD of just the music I'd gladly buy it. The dialogue is noble and wellwritten clearly written with heart and thought yet it also allows for the drama and romance to speak for themselves. The story like Stone Flower is essentially a simple fairytale the fairy tale elements are recognisable and have a real enchantment to them while never doing so in a complicated way and the romantic elements are genuinely touching and don't bog the film down in any way. Emotionally Scarlet Sails is really one of Ptushko's most beautiful mainly because the romantic elements are so well done. It also helps that the characters are so easy to identify with and that Scarlet Sails with two outstanding lead performances is for me is the bestacted Ptushko film. In conclusion one of Ptushko's best and a personal favourite as of now. 1010 Bethany Cox".

It's based on Aleksandr Grin's 1923 novel of the same name and I understand that Grin's work enjoyed a renaissance under Khrushchev's thaw. The movie doesn't have the most complex story but it's enjoyable enough for its hour and a half.

The movie's power comes from a levelheaded and empathetic depiction of the prerevolution conditions in Russia. Technologically Russia was a hundred years behind the western countries with 65 million people living  in practical terms  in slavery.The said conditions are rarely talked about but they explain the desperate need for a change in the gigantic nation. It is a startling notion that even with the atrocities committed by The Party Russians still had it better than before.The Thorndikes use archival material to great effect in this well directed still timely and intelligent film.".

	schema:headline " A gem among African films and one that publicizes a great African novel";
	schema:reviewBody "Not many filmgoers may be aware of Portuguese director Teresa Prata's Sleepwalking land. A film that took Ms Prata 7 years to complete it is yet to be extensively screened beyond the international film festival circuit. The movie is evidently Ms Prata's labor of love after she spotted a goldmine in Mia Couto's Portuguese novel Sleepwalking land published in 1992. The novel is now widely recognized as one of the finest literary works from and on Africa in recent years. Extracts translated into English that I read indicate a remarkable powerful literary work falling within the realm of magical realism. It was indeed a work screaming to be captured on celluloid with the help of special effects and convincing local acting talent. The young lady grabbed the opportunity to shoot the film in Mozambique and do the special effects in Portugal. Today her interesting movie adaptation is helping publicize Mia Couto's writing even further and is bringing global attention to both the Mozambican and the Portuguese cinema.Sleepwalking land. is one of the most interesting and realistic films on Africa. In the past two months the film has won the international FIPRESCI award for the best film in competition at the recent Kerala film festival and an award for best director at the lesser known Pune film festival.The book Sleepwalking Land and film based on the novel are both set during the 15year civil war that crippled Mozambique. Mia Cuoto has a gifted philosophical turn of phrase to describe the catastrophe of the war what's already burnt can't burn again. The film as in the book looks back wistfully at the tragedy of the unrest through the eyes of a dreaming orphan boy and provides a glimmer of hope for the survivors of civil anarchy to cope with what is left to build anew. While Mia Cuoto and Teresa Prata focus on the social and economic plight of Mozambique their respective works can equally mirror the problems of the continent.The film follows a young orphaned Mozambican boy Muidinga an endearing performance by an acting novice Nick Lauro Teresa who can fortunately read as he had once attended school and is even familiar with Melville's Moby Dick and his unrelated illiterate guardian a wise old man called Tuahir played by nonprofessional actor Aladino Jasse tossed accidentally together by the civil war. The film and the book trace their common will to survive the difficult days. The young boy might have read. or rather heard the story of Moby Dick but the name is indelible in his memory. Director Teresa Prata who adapted the story for cinema therefore takes creative license and allows the young boy to call his pet goat Mody sic Dick. When I questioned the director on this detail she stated that she was responsible for this change and that it was not part of Couto's book.The film and book have two parallel plots. The young boy and the old man on the run in the bushes from marauding guntoting factions of the civil war come across a charred bus with burnt corpses and their possessions that escaped the fire. Among the possessions of the dead passengers are notebooks that tell a story of a woman named Farida a squatter on an abandoned ship waiting for her young son to find her and a hardworking young man Kindzu who has fled his burning village that has faced the wrath of the civil warmongers. In this discovered manuscript Kindzu meets Farida. Subsequently Kindzu goes searching for Farida's lost son. The young boy narrates the tale to the illiterate old man after reading the manuscript and begins to associate Farida as his lost mother. He even imagines the name of the ship she is squatting on is called Mody sic Dick again Ms Prata's contribution to the story.The parallel love story of Farida and Kindzu never takes center stagethe backbone remains the dreams of the young boy under the guiding spirit of the wise old man. Between the two the viewer of the film is introduced to the problems of Mozambique of Africa of any developing country. As in a Greek tragedy you trudge along a path that gives you a notion of travel and progress only to return to the same spot literally and metaphorically. Pretense and dreams make the film move along. To aid the young boy on his journey to his loving mother Farida squatting on Mody sic Dick the old man devises the means to reach the sea Indian Ocean from the bushes of Mozambique. The old man digs a hole in the ground. Water sprouts and a stream forms. The stream becomes a river and at the end of the river there is the ocean. In the Ocean the lead characters find the derelict Mody sic Dick with Farida on it. Obviously if you demand conventional realismthere is very little that the film can offer. If you accept magical realism as a tool to narrate a realistic sociopolitical scenario in Africa both Mia Couto and Teresa Prata have much to offer and delight your senses. The viewer gets a glimpse Couto's Mozambique. But among the ruins Couto and Prata show a glimmer of hope in the form of an orphan representing the new generation learning hard lessons of life in the bush. Ms Prata has made a fine effort to extract remarkable performances from nonprofessional actors and has proved her capability to adapt and direct an interesting work that would be interesting for any person interested in good African cinema. This film may not be a cinematic masterpiece but a fine example of good African cinema by a gifted and persevering lady from another continent.The description of a civilwar torn country itself as a sleepwalking land offers fodder for thought beyond the usual images of violence poverty and carnage that adorn the typical Africa cinema.".

The director uses film language to make very effective use of landscape and mise en scene such as the burnt out bus. The bus and the journey the two characters go on is like a metaphor for life we keep repeating ourselves or those who do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it. Images from this keep coming back to my mind such as the toy boat which opens the film. Use of visual cues like this indicate a skilled film maker in that they elicit an emotional response. Moving you to tears while completely avoiding sentimentality. I saw this at The London African Film Festival and thought it incredibly powerful really moving emotionally quite draining. Whats great about African cinema is its seriousness its willingness to engage with important issues. For enthusiasts of African visual media and those willing to make the conceptual leap necessary to appreciate new cultural forms this is highly recommended. I will just add this seems to me a fusion of African and European sensibilities. The poetic realism has an obvious European influence but there's nonetheless something distinctly African there and I m not just meaning the setting. There's a whole thing about journeys returning and fatalism things being set things being a certain way. See it yourself I think it will leave you like it left me wondering.........or wandering?".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was invited to a special screening of Sleepwalking Land I was familiar with the novel by Mia Couto but very much doubting the capacity of any filmmaker to represent and enact not only the structure and events of the book but most importantly the sense of time and space transposition that embodied the feeling of living that same journey as the characters to be placed in the same shoes. Fortunately I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It's not that the film is a work of art in any such way but it does exactly what is required of a book adaptation it transcends the mediums and carries exactly the message and feeling of the book. A quest for survival in a land ravaged by war hiding underneath the true nature of this journey a self discovery of perception and place in the world of the 20th century man to find a place for peace when we're lost in time. I don't think I will forget the moment the old man an amateur actor as the rest is first participation in a feature film but a solid one the moment when he recalls his days as a train worker acting with his imagination relaying to the boy a glimpse of his past life. The movie is just about that whether or not one should hold on to his past to what was left behind or if one should start anew to rise from the ashes in this case the journey leads one to his place of birth his womb we're he will be born again. Although the acting might be sub par at times due to the fact that the cast was mostly untrained actors amateurs it doesn't really damage the film but it can make it seems sometime constricted. The most compelling aspect is definitely the background the sets filmed in natural settings it creates a very enduring perception of time and space. In conclusion it is a very special little film simple but powerful holds it's greater qualities by being so humble and so true to the source material. A strong portrait of war torn Africa and the search for one's place in the world. Highly recommended and a new breeze in Portuguese cinema a must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mathew McConaughey is Brandon Lane a former football star recruited by Walter Abraham Al Pacino the head of a sports consulting firm to help them set the line for their sports betting business. Lane's ability to predict the outcome of games quickly turns him into a golden boy but it soon becomes apparent that he's bitten off more than he can chew when his abilities start to falter.Two for the Money is a forgettable generic thriller that doesn't really offer anything new. The film does have some entertaining moments and the first half of the movie is actually pretty exciting to watch. But the second half is really slow and very tedious. It just drags on and on and for no reason either. It could have been a nice 90 minute movie but the story is stretched out into a two hour film. Luckily Al Pacino is in the movie and he keeps the film exciting. He gives a good over the top performance and he pretty much raises the film up to mediocrity. Personally sports betting isn't that interesting to me but Al Pacino makes it interesting. He can turn a bad script into an okay movie which is what he does with the film. Let's be honest the script is not very good and the direction is weak. It's so obvious where things are going which is not surprising because this is the same guy that made Taking Lives.Al Pacino is playing mentor to Matthew McConaughey and their chemistry together isn't very strong. McConaughey is a pretty weak actor and he can't keep up with Pacino. The lead role should have gone to someone else. Rene Russo is okay as Pacino's wife. She gives a decent performance but she was a little too bland to truly stand out. Another thing about the film that people may not like is that every character is unlikable. It's hard to care for these characters because they are either pretty mean or bland. It didn't really bother me because I watched the film to be entertained and I did get some entertainment value from the movie. In the end if you like Al Pacino then you should give the film a shot if you don't then just skip it. Rating 610".

	schema:headline " Worth betting on for the most part.";
	schema:reviewBody "Two for the Money is a decent diverting picture. The material at times seems a little beneath these fine actors but the film ends up hitting enough of the right notes to make it worth seeing.Matthew McConaughey would seem a little out of his league on the same screen with Al Pacino and Rene Russo. By the end of the film you will most likely feel that he's more than held his own however. McConaughey plays a former college football star who sees his chances of a professional career destroyed by a serious injury. He quickly finds himself picking college football games for a lowrent betting line. With all of his past experience as a player he does quite well with it. Well enough to attract the attention of Al Pacino who runs a more upscale operation in New York. By the end of the first half hour McConaughey is picking all kinds of football winners and making Pacino a ton of money. As you would expect this success does not last very long as various egos spiral out of control and the betting gods turn on our heroes as they eventually do to all of us. The film is more of a character study about the minds of gamblers and lost identity than it is about the workings of an actual betting organization. Overall it works on a couple different levels.Pacino is fine but not as out of control as you might hope. His character has a bad heart so any typical Pacino tantrums are not really in order for him. He brings as much dignity as one could to the role of an addicted gambler though. Rene Russo is terrific as his longsuffering wife and a former junkie. Pacino at some points seems to be trying to lose her to McConaughey. He being one of those terribly afflicted gamblers who only feels alive when he's just lost everything he wagered. The supporting cast is pretty good too. Jeremy Piven is always appreciated and so is the appearance by Armand Assante.The best scene in the film takes place at a betting support group meeting that Pacino and his new protg walk in on. Pacino being a hopeless gambler himself shows empathy toward these degenerates then has the nerve to pass out his business card to them!!! The logic I guess being that if you people have to lose you might as well do it through a fellow degenerate gambler.The biggest flaw I noticed was too many shots of McConaughey without his shirt on. Yes the guy has great abs but we don't need to see so much of them!! Overall this is a good film with some interesting things to say about people who bet. Notice how in the end the experts are really just like the guys they take calls from. During the big games we're all just sitting there with a beer in our hand hanging by every first down or dropped ball.7 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

Mr. Pacino compensates when the screen play is not going anywhere by applying an intensity that doesn't go well with the others playing opposite him. Matthew McConaughey is a light weight actor who aside from his good looks doesn't bring anything to this story.

Six years later and still dreaming of making it as a player of football finds him in the numbers game with a talent for picking winning teams and calling 900 numbers to urge gullible people t place bets according to his predictions.

He coerces Brandon to join him in New York wines him dines him with the aid of his smart and beautiful wife Toni Rene Russo and in no time Brandon Long takes on the persona of John Anthony and makes it big as a TV personality who successfully bilks willing gambling people out of their money. Long as Anthony takes on a life of his own and it is the conflagration between the creator Abrams and the protg Anthony that fleshes out the film.Interesting to a point the story loses steam in the last half and we soon lose interest in the outcome or the characters. And not that that is the fault of the actors! Al Pacino is very effective as the reformed gambler still fighting demons and Rene Russo is as beautiful as ever acting her role with complete conviction and holding what is left of the story once started together. Matthew McConaughey spends much of the movie without his shirt on which is a major contribution to the visuals of the film! Buff and beautiful he manages to keep the heart of Brandon Long beating inside the persona of John Anthony.Not a great movie by any means but some truly fine acting from the trio of stars. The supporting cast also gives solid roles despite the skimpy script. If gambling of any sort and sports gambling in particular is of interest to you then this is a movie to recommend. Otherwise see it for the actors not the story. Grady Harp".

Although it isn't a terribly convincing film Pacinos performance allows is to not be a total disappointment. McConaughey was good as well casted well in his role. Jeremy Piven was great in his supporting role but Armand Assante was bad boy does he not know how to perform lines and be convincing while doing it. Most of my problems with this film was Dan Gilroys screenplay which although at times smart and entertaining all in all not concise and consistent. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Networks can't talk about it. The government can't tax it. Yet sports betting is a 200 billion a year business. A business that strives to exploit every vulnerability manipulate every gullibility and convince the client that it can provide them certainty in an uncertain world.Two for the Money is the story of one man's journey into the sports gambling world. Matthew McConaughey delivers one of his more impressive performances as he transforms from Brandon Lang the smoothtalking golden boy into John Anthony  The Million Dollar Man with the Billion Dollar Plan. A transformation that comes complete with a new suit a new car a new attitude and slicked back hair  a surefire movie sign that corruption or a loss of innocence is imminent.Portraying a character that must deal with this corruption of innocence McConaughey demonstrates that he can act with more than just his dimples and downhome Southern charm. Lang is a machine. He knows the teams the leagues the players the game. All he does is work out and pick winners two facts made abundantly clear by McConaughey's propensity to walk around shirtless just as often as he makes football picks. I may have rolled my eyes once or twice but I heard nary a complaint from the ladies in the audience. Except for that one that looked a little like my Uncle Larry.Lang's corruption rests solely on the fragile shoulders of Walter Abrams a sleazy character played so effortlessly by Al Pacino that you can't help but feel slightly disturbed by the ease with which he seems capable of tainting ambitious young men. Screaming less than usual Pacino's portrayal is nothing short of an indictment of those sports advisors who feed on the weak. Sports gambling may be illegal in 46 states but Abrams is well aware that sports advising the politically correct preference no doubt is not. Despite the false promise of certainty sports advising is presented as more used car salesmanship than mathematical study. Figure out your client's needs and get his money. That's the name of the game. As for actually picking a winner? It's 5050. A flip of the coin.Sure Lang is able to compile a pretty impressive hot streak but what happens when it comes to a crashing halt? The peaks are indeed very high when the fun and money are flowing but is it worth the lesson learned when your family is threatened and you're hit with the realization of what losing 380000 can do to a family? Ultimately the movie would have proved more effective if there had been a greater emphasis on the devastation of the lows of losing. Consequences are touched but never fully realized. I would have also liked less predictability in a movie about a very unpredictable lifestyle but Two for the Money still succeeds in giving the audience a glimpse of what gets in the minds of those willing to gamble. Is it about the game? Is it about the money? Or as Abrams believes is it about the risk some people are willing to take to feel what they perceive as being alive?The dialogue and character interaction happen at a quick enough pace to grab and seal your attention and while the last act is somewhat weighed down by the twohour runtime and the semisappy melodrama of plans gone awry Money still manages to convince the audience to care about whether or not Brandon can get back to where he began  the purity of the game.You want certainty in an uncertain world? Then put your money on obligatory shirtless Matthew McConaughey scenes and Pacino's incisors getting a nice scenechewing workout. It's a safer bet than trusting your money with the decisionmaking of those who care more about the profit than they do about you.THE GIST Two for the Money will prove to be most enjoyable to those with some familiarity or interest with sports and the gambling side of the business. But McConaughey and Pacino deliver enough laughs and energy to make this more accessible to those with little knowledge of the subject matter. If you have your doubts about this one then don't worry about spending the big bucks to see it on the big screen  it'll make for a good rental.".

I think Al Pacino and Matthew McCoughnahey work well together because of their difference in acting styles. Pacino's is more overstated while McCoughnahey's is more understated. Pacino seems to have tons of fun with his character and gives a tourdeforce. Yet at the same time he gives a subtle bit of humanity to his slimy character. I've liked McCoughnahey ever since I've seen him in Ed TV and contrary to what some reviewers say I think he's a lot more than just a handsome stud for the female viewers to swoon over unlike someone like Vin Diesel. Jeremy Piven also gives a fine performance in a nice little supporting role. Plain and simple if you're in the mood to see some great acting Two for the Money is the movie to see.".

I would say it is a comic drama or a dramatic comedy. Whatever you like. We laughed at many many places the script is very intelligent and the 3 main actors are so wonderful by the way I usually don't like Pacino!. The only complaint is a slow down in the pace of the movie around two third but after 10 minutes it picks up again. I recommend it for the acting and the script specially. Very unpredictable even 15 minutes before the end I could not predict how it would end. No I won't give any spoiler. The end is very simple and I must say touching!".

I thought Walter Abrams was exactly like Walter Burke in The Recruit except  ironically for a movie linked to gambling  the stakes weren't as high by the time he came around to doing it all again in Two for the Money. Unlike many people I also enjoy the frequent 'shouty' aspects of his method  but come on just because you're good at being loud doesn't mean you have to play a demagogue over and over again. Vincent Hanna in Heat was often loud for instance but he wasn't an overtly controlling manipulative master of his universe like we see in The Devil's Advocate Any Given Sunday The Recruit or indeed here...Not to mention that this movie doesn't even do a very good job of showing an infrequent gambler like myself how the true expert has to lose it all just to feel like they're alive. I don't buy this kind of talk that the movie peddles at all. It feels too much like conventional wisdom that's been perverted and inverted to me. I've heard of gamblers being in it for the 'highs and lows' but never for the 'lows and lows'. If that psychology were true then a punter who loses a ton of money and soon finds themselves living in a cardboard box and eating from a dumpster still wouldn't have a problem. Why?! Because they'd be happy! Yet I've heard tales of lots of gamblers who are desperately unhappy with their lot find it a miserable experience to lose an amount they can't afford and would like desperately to rid themselves of this destructive compulsion. If I like something then I don't want to give it up. It's impossible to feel elated by something and yet want to get rid of it. Contradictory. People who are tempted to take the leap are enslaved by the lure of a big win which certainly does feel good but the catch is that something like that comes around all too rarely to have any hope of exerting a positive influence in the long run.That's my logic anyway and if I'm wrong then the movie doesn't explain its glib philosophies adequately enough to teach me otherwise. All this product trades on is a hypothetical synthetic adrenaline rush delivered by two stars on autopilot with not a scrap of substance to be found beneath its shiny surface. In short Two for the Money heralds a payoff that's not worth laying down cold hard cash for.".

If you like sports gambling and movies then this is the flick for you.Two for the Money tells the story of exCollege QB Brandon Lang's Matthew McConaughey introduction to the multibillion dollar world of sports betting. Brandon starts out working for 1900 number company in Las Vegas and soon discovers his ability to predict the results of College and Pro football games at 80 accuracy. This draws the attention of Walter Abrams Al Pacino the owner of a large sports advisory service in NY who hires Brandon and introduces him to the world of bigtime sports betting. And that's when the action starts.Although the story takes place in a sports betting company and has some great scenes about sports betting the movie is really about the three main characters  Walter his wife Toni Rene Russo and Brandon  and the relationships between them. Each character has their own history and motives and watching the events unfold is the core of this movie. The performances are great you get what you have come to expect from Pacino and Russo and McConaughey also does nice work with his character. Jeremy Piven gets props for his role as Jerry Brandon's rival at the betting agency.Two for the Money gets 810 from me.".

He also gets to drive the MercBenz SL 500 which coincidently my boss drives at well and says that one day it will be but I don't really believe that people . So far so good but then during the second half of the film when things turn sour and Lang's world starts crashing down before him the film then gets a little sloppy and thusly loses what direction it wants to go in  from this it tends to drag on a little longer than it should do which I didn't mind as long as it was given time to recover but instead it started developing plot holes .

	schema:reviewBody "How it works is my boyfriend gets invites to screenings and if he doesn't know about the film he asks me and we decide if we are free interested or not depending on buzz or our availability all the same reasons anyone chooses to see a film or not. We usually get the invite weeks ahead of time and have to RSVP. If I don't know anything about the film I check IMDb of course.. and this time I did so. I hadn't heard about this gem but the moment I saw the cast I was sold.For starters Al Pacino and Rene Russo  these actors don't bother with bad films can't go wrong I'm thinking... and the script was written by Dan Gilroy who has not been prolific yet but wrote one of my favoriteever future romps  1992's Freejack.YES! RSVP definitely I am so there. Tonight was our screening and I'm here to say it was SO worth it. Excellent story excellent script I could see this one getting an Oscar nomination for best screenplay tight performance from Matthew McConaughey who is truly at his peak.When Brandon Lang McConaughey is swept into the top tier of the sports betting industry his life accelerates from 060 so fast your head spins. Walter Abrams Pacino and his wife Toni Russo have a masterfully complex relationship and Brandon sweeps into a thoroughly complex and amazingly believable association with them.The film propels forward with unbelievable tensions a script in which nothing was stereotypical predictable or absurd. I bought every moment  each executed with razor sharp dialog. I don't believe it's a spoiler just to say in and of itself that there is an elephant and one line regarding the elephant jumps out as the best line in any movie since Frankly Scarlet I don't give a damn. I think the film is that good. This is a classic a new classic a powerful film that hits all the right notes. The right blend of humor pathos tension drama exposure morality and fairytale. The whole magilla. I have to tell you I've never been a sports person and don't like sports movies. I had a little trepidation going into this thinking that I don't really care for sports or sports movies. I grew up in a house where my brother was completely into sports and I remember my Dad and brother and others gathered around watching The Game I've seen people in bars hanging on the edge of the TV screen I've watched grown men jump and yell SCORE during hockey games about to blow a gasket... and sorry I never really got it. Until now.Tonight watching Two For The Money  I had an epiphany. I was so drawn into these characters and their fate that when everyone was watching a big game suddenly I was on the edge of my seat in anticipation of the score I was so drawn in to this world through the power with which the portrayals and story carry that I GOT it I was right there. Everything these people were feeling I was right there.I'll be honest I thought I knew how this one was gonna end and if it had ended that way it would have been a cheesy way out I was SO wrong. Thinking about the film all night after I conclude the writer was dead right the ending is the only logical conclusion.This is a great powerful story about great powerful characters portrayed by a trio of great powerful actors  and indeed a brilliant supporting cast  no disrespect to Jeremy Piven  in fact I apologize for not talking about him more  but Pacino McConaughey and Rene Russo never more surefooted kind of eclipse his supporting role  which sorry to say he plays like a slightly watered down Ari Entourage I did not vote this a ten because of a single weak location choice. It was so unmistakably 'where it really was' rather than 'where they were saying it was'. And you may not even notice although it was glaring to me so you go see this and then come back here and vote 10. You will!".

	onyx:emotionText "How it works is my boyfriend gets invites to screenings and if he doesn't know about the film he asks me and we decide if we are free interested or not depending on buzz or our availability all the same reasons anyone chooses to see a film or not. We usually get the invite weeks ahead of time and have to RSVP. If I don't know anything about the film I check IMDb of course.. and this time I did so. I hadn't heard about this gem but the moment I saw the cast I was sold.For starters Al Pacino and Rene Russo  these actors don't bother with bad films can't go wrong I'm thinking... and the script was written by Dan Gilroy who has not been prolific yet but wrote one of my favoriteever future romps  1992's Freejack.YES! RSVP definitely I am so there. Tonight was our screening and I'm here to say it was SO worth it. Excellent story excellent script I could see this one getting an Oscar nomination for best screenplay tight performance from Matthew McConaughey who is truly at his peak.When Brandon Lang McConaughey is swept into the top tier of the sports betting industry his life accelerates from 060 so fast your head spins. Walter Abrams Pacino and his wife Toni Russo have a masterfully complex relationship and Brandon sweeps into a thoroughly complex and amazingly believable association with them.The film propels forward with unbelievable tensions a script in which nothing was stereotypical predictable or absurd. I bought every moment  each executed with razor sharp dialog. I don't believe it's a spoiler just to say in and of itself that there is an elephant and one line regarding the elephant jumps out as the best line in any movie since Frankly Scarlet I don't give a damn. I think the film is that good. This is a classic a new classic a powerful film that hits all the right notes. The right blend of humor pathos tension drama exposure morality and fairytale.

To save money the bank allows Nick to operate both the floor trading and the back office facilities and force him to employ cheap unskilled staff.

There can be no drama if the majority of viewers don't actually realise what's happening.Rogue Trader then for it's many flaws is at least partially successful because it makes clear the central principles of what Leeson was doing  making a double bet on the market going only in one direction.  Having worked on London's futures exchange I can't really be objective.  I laughed out loud many times at the actors' and extras' bad handsignals the unrealistic dialogue in relation to price and size etc.  Real marketspeak often takes for granted that both parties understand alot more than needs to be said thus leaves alot out.  But of course that makes for bad cinema so one can't grumble too much.The cast is generally pretty good McGregor acting his socks off as always. The main problem is that the script and direction are from the getgo just totally OBVIOUS.  By this I mean that no visual or audio clich is left unused.  For example every Barings office in London seems to have a plum view of St. Paul's Cathedral just in case we forget where they are.  And if these scenes can be accompanied by some chamber music to remind us of the history and upperclass pedigree then they will be.  The reckless young traders by contrast are followed around by a largely anachronistic soundtrack of dance music and Britpop.  When Leeson arrives in Asia for the first time we hear Kula Shaker!  Please!  Perhaps a different less conventional style of direction might have improved matters...It's interesting that many people have commented along the lines of Leeson only does what I'd do in that situation trying to make things better. Since it's based on his book the film unsurprisingly tries to make Leeson look... well if not good exactly then at least not like a total idiot. I can't sympathize entirely because NEVER double up and a small loser is better than a blow out are amongst the first things you learn down there. But even if only one tenth of all this is true it's still truly stunning that Barings London didn't know what was going on and accepted his story unchecked for so long...  If they were that incompetent they deserved to go bust.Ultimately Rogue Trader is neither a great movie nor a terrible one.  As far as financefilms go it rises majestically above the plain awfulness of Dealers or Limit Up but is still less informative than what is still the best market movie Trading Places.  But who knows maybe I have just lost 50 million quid! will enter traders' vocabulary in a few years just as Turn those machines back on! already has.  As a film it's an entertaining diversion and an interesting footnote to the headlines.610".

Putting the same individual in charge of both the front office and back office bypasses the appropriate checks and balances and is tantamount to having the fox guard the henhouse. The official report of the Bank of England concluded that Barings' failure to segregate Leeson's duties was reprehensible and those with direct executive responsibility for establishing effective controls must bear much of the blame. Yet little mention is made of this in the film. And the mechanizations of the stock market are downright incomprehensible at times.

	schema:headline " Very Enjoyable";
	schema:reviewBody "I very much enjoyed this film for two main reasons. Firstly it closely resembles the book written by Nick Leeson and secondly it does take slow steps to try and guide the viewer through the complex world of options  futures.The film did leave a realistic impression of what the highlife is for some of these traders especially those from England to which Singapore must have felt like another world. The soundtrack although quite varying at times also helps create the buzz of Singapore  Asia in the early 90's.There have been a lot of vocal critics of the film with comments such as boring and lack of dramatic material but I often prefer films that stay strictly to the subject material and don't get too carried away for dramatic effect.The performance which I actually thought was best was that of Lee Ross who played Nick's friend Danny. Although quite different from the character in the book Danny actually doesn't drink and is Greek not English Lee's performance was wellrounded and very enjoyable as the loyal and dependable friend of Nick. That scene in the bar during the famous mooning incident was hilarious.If you look closely during the film you will actually see the real Danny Argyropoulos  Ches Lemming of which the latter actually worked alongside Nick on the Simex trading floor.Ewan McGregor was great as usual and I often find it strange to see the real Nick Leeson in a photo as I'd became so accustomed to seeing Ewan as Nick. The very attractive Anna Friel didn't have much material to work with but did manage to pull off the role of Lisa Sims.Although I've read much criticism of Nick Leeson I still have seen or heard nothing to make me doubt the overall story as told by Nick. He could have put a very big boot into Barings when writing his book and would have been perfectly justified in doing so but his main criticism was of their management practices and not whether he was in fact a Fall Guy for Barings.When reading the criticism of Nick I've tried to put myself in his position and try to imagine how things were for him. Imagine you've been offered a fantastic job in the vibrant early 1990's market of Singapore you've just been married and your earning a fantastic salary. Surround yourself with many others like yourself and you can imagine how things can get carried away with young guys in their mid20's who must have thought of themselves as invincible.In the end I did end up feeling quite sorry for Nick. I'm sure if I'd lost money from investments in Barings my sympathy wouldn't be as strong! But going from the high life in Singapore to being alone for 4 years in a jail cell is quite a shock to anyone and especially with the added pressure of developing cancer and ultimately the breakdown of your marriage. Having to part with your wife in that German police station must have been very hard.Lisa sums up the subject material late in the film when she said to Nick You were gambling with other people's money and if that is the case then Nick is guilty as sin. But according to the story it all started from trying to fix the errors of others and so on. He did get himself back to profit at one point but with most gamblers especially after winning back lost money it's hard to resist that one last punt.Chin up Nick!4 out of 5 stars".

The very attractive Anna Friel didn't have much material to work with but did manage to pull off the role of Lisa Sims.Although I've read much criticism of Nick Leeson I still have seen or heard nothing to make me doubt the overall story as told by Nick. He could have put a very big boot into Barings when writing his book and would have been perfectly justified in doing so but his main criticism was of their management practices and not whether he was in fact a Fall Guy for Barings.When reading the criticism of Nick I've tried to put myself in his position and try to imagine how things were for him. Imagine you've been offered a fantastic job in the vibrant early 1990's market of Singapore you've just been married and your earning a fantastic salary. Surround yourself with many others like yourself and you can imagine how things can get carried away with young guys in their mid20's who must have thought of themselves as invincible.In the end I did end up feeling quite sorry for Nick. I'm sure if I'd lost money from investments in Barings my sympathy wouldn't be as strong! But going from the high life in Singapore to being alone for 4 years in a jail cell is quite a shock to anyone and especially with the added pressure of developing cancer and ultimately the breakdown of your marriage. Having to part with your wife in that German police station must have been very hard.Lisa sums up the subject material late in the film when she said to Nick You were gambling with other people's money and if that is the case then Nick is guilty as sin. But according to the story it all started from trying to fix the errors of others and so on. He did get himself back to profit at one point but with most gamblers especially after winning back lost money it's hard to resist that one last punt.Chin up Nick!4 out of 5 stars";

But back to the film it tells the story of Nick Leeson the man who broke Barings. He tells of all the problems he suffered with untrained staff mistakes and how he tried to cover for his staff. Nothing was ever his fault. This part of the film was pure fiction mistakes always get made and the mistake Kim made at the start would not necessarily have resulted in her firing. Nick himself remains blameless in the film when what he should have been doing was telling his boss to hire some decent people. The fault with the Barings scandal of course lies with the management. They believed it because they wanted to. No dealer can make 20 million in a week unless he is gambling in excess of 2 billion or committing a fraud. A good film for those uninitiated in the way the financial world works but not totally accurate. I hear Nick Leeson is working for a football club in Ireland now.

Enron had no products and a bunch of dummy corporations and the banks were loaning them millions upon millions of dollars. Try getting a loan from a bank some time.

No one asks any questions as long as you're making money. By the time they start asking questions it's too late. Everyone is culpable. Enron had no products and a bunch of dummy corporations and the banks were loaning them millions upon millions of dollars. Try getting a loan from a bank some time. And they wonder why they had to be baled out.Anna Friel does a good job as his wife. That was another sad thing in the film  she wasn't a woman who cared about the money. She didn't even want to live in Singapore. She just loved him and wanted to be with him.I really can't follow the technical aspects of these finance stories but still this was good.";

Because at the end of the day we'll never know. For every person involved or affected by that event there's another version of the truth and finding the 'true' truth is just about impossible. So to hell with it! Let's just look at 'Rogue Trader' as a story shall we?I can't honestly say that I enjoyed this film mainly because I found it so exquisitely awful that I was scrunching my eyes shut and moaning more and more loudly as events unfolded. As depicted here Nick Leeson wasn't exactly a criminal he was just criminally stupid ... and naive ... and  pathetic ... and  and  well I found myself screaming at the tv set No you fool don't stop now stop now quit while you're ahead  arrrrggghhh!!!It is almost impossible to believe that one person could collapse an entire bank. And of course it is impossible. Nick Lesson didn't bring down Baring's on his own he had a lot of help from people who both wittingly and unwittingly conspired to support his insane behaviour. Regardless of whose truth you're telling that point is pretty safe to  make I think. And I think this film does a good job of demonstrating that. I also think it does a good job of capturing the insanity of Futures Trading surely a hideously evil invention and of showing how Gordon Gekko got it really really wrong.At the end of the day however the film stands or falls by Ewan McGregor's performace as Nick Leeson ... and again he doesn't disappoint. Again we are treated to a portrayal of a deeply human deeply flawed individual as only McGregor can reveal. His Leeson is a man who makes mistake after mistake who is far smaller than he wants to be who isn't without conscience or moral compass but whose many fears outweigh his few strengths. He's the very embodiment of the 'fatal flaw' theory brought to ruin by his weaknesses and failings.I find it frighteningly easy to identify with McGregor's Leeson. What he did many of us have been tempted to do or have done in various small ways. Or maybe not so small. Some people find him profoundly offensive others find him pathetic. Whatever your reaction to this film the fact that you even have one shows that it's worked. It's made  you feel something about what happened ... or at least this version of what happened. Perhaps some of us resent being made to feel any kind of empathy for this character. By making him  human his actions are humanised made comprehensible ... and that's uncomfortable.It's far more comfortable keeping him demonised reprehensible beyond understanding or forgiveness for in that way we keep ourselves safe. We are not like him. There is nothing that we share. He is ... other.The problem is he isn't. That's where Rogue Trader succeeds I think. In showing us that the Nick Leesons of this world aren't monsters at all ... they're people like us who make mistakes like we do. By challenging us ... you say you would never ever do something like this but can you be sure? Really? Truly? This isn't a lighthearted film a fun film.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the true story of Nick Leeson the fantastic Ewan McGregor the employee who broke the oldest bank in England the Bearings Bank. Nick is an ambitious young man son of a simple man who works with plaster transferred to Singapore to operate in future market of derivatives. He was considered the best employee of Bearing Banks but indeed he was gambling with high amounts of the bank and hiding the losses under a secret account number 88888. There are at least three points to highlight in this movie. The first one is the great performance of Ewan McGregor. Everybody knows he is an excellent actor and once again he does not disappoint the viewer. Second is about the screenplay based on a book written by Nick Leeson is it possible to believe that the oldest bank in England was managed by a board of directors that look like the Little Red Ridding Hood instead of the bad wolf? Everywhere in the world persons very aware of cash flow administrate banks. How could one unique employee keep the real situation hidden from the Bearings Senior Management? I believe it would be almost impossible therefore it seems that some kind of arrangement may be made having Nick as the scapegoat of the whole situation or high profits were expected in those dirty operations with the participation of other important persons in the bank. Anyway if this film shows the truth it is amazing how this bank had survived for such a long time. Last but not the least is it possible to believe that a smart guy like Nick Leeson 'has not reserved' some money for his early retirement? It is hard to believe! The great love of Lisa for Nick is also very easily forgot in the end of the story. However it is a good movie and a worthwhile entertainment. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Fraude The Fraud".

	schema:reviewBody "Although ultraconservatives will undoubtedly dismiss The Cradle Will Rock' as blatant leftwing propaganda the rest of us will see it as a fascinating rumination on the intricate relationship that has always existed between politics and art.  Writerdirector Tim Robbins whose leftleaning sympathies are common knowledge in the film industry has managed to create a screenplay of amazing complexity and depth functioning on an enormous number of levels  political historical aesthetic personal  without ever losing clarity and focus.  He has set up a dizzying array of characters yet each one is fleshed out with enough depth and particularity to make him or her a vital part of the overall tapestry.Set in the turbulent 1930's Robbins' tale focuses on the National Theatre Company an organization set up by Roosevelt during the Depression to provide outofwork artists a vehicle through which to ply their trade and culturestarved audiences a chance to revel in the glories of live theatrical performances.  Unfortunately it was also a time of great civil and political upheaval with Communism and Fascism battling for supremacy abroad and many Americans divided along similar lines in their loyalties. With passions running deep it was only a matter of time before many in the United States Congress began suspecting the NTC of Communist sympathizing  and it was a short road from there to the eventual dismemberment of the organization.  The film centers on the production of a controversial musical play called The Cradle Will Rock' that portrays the glorious coming of unionism to a steel factory a scenario that parallels the events in the lives of several of the characters in the film.Given this fascinating historical background Robbins has filled his film with a rich assortment of characters from Orson Welles as a fledgling young actor who sees unions as the ruination of artistic purity to Nelson Rockefeller as a wellmeaning art patron who balks at the mural Diego Rivera has painted for him only after Rivera refuses to remove the image of Lenin from Rockefeller's monumenttocapitalism lobby.  In fact the cast of characters is so enormous with each one taking a crucial part in the narrative proceedings that it is quite impossible to mention them all here. Suffice it to say that Robbins covers the social spectrum from industrialists and capitalists to union workers and the unemployed from sympathetic patrons and patronesses to the little people eager to root out the seeds of Communism even at the expense of their own ostracism.  And not a one is uninteresting.Robbins has assembled an allstar cast that reads like a who's who of contemporary movie acting albeit of a nonblockbuster variety. Although at the beginning of the film the casting of such familiar faces seems a bit disconcerting  leading to what critic Judith Crist refers to as the hey there' syndrome i.e. destroying the verisimilitude of a work by parading too many recognizable people before the camera  this technique actually helps the audience to differentiate the many characters who might otherwise pass by in a confusing and disorienting blur.  Hank Azaria Ruben Blades John Cusack Joan Cusack Cary Elwes Bill Murray Vanessa Redgrave Susan Sarandon John Turturro and Emily Watson comprise this truly fine cast.Liberal as his leanings might be Robbins is able to focus on the bitter ironies that abound on both sides of the political spectrum.  For instance while Susan Sarandon portrays a Jewish ally of Mussolini abandoning her proworker principles to act as his capitalist representative in the States Ruben Blades plays a Diego Rivera who has subordinated  if only temporarily  his own revolutionary ethos to the power of the almighty buck.  Also there is a certain paradox to the fact that when the government has decreed the theater closed and thereby forbidden the premiere performance of the play it is the actors' UNION that threatens the performers with firing if they carry out their plan to stage it furtively.  Robbins is even somewhat evenhanded in his treatment of the enemy'  the rich capitalists and the anticommunist members of the theatre organization  portraying them with goodnatured humor and pathos.  Joan Cusack as a clerk at the employment office and Bill Murray as a vaudeville ventriloquist seem like decent people only hopelessly misguided and lonely.  Unfortunately Murray's sudden change of heart at the end seems inexplicable and unmotivated.  As for the elite in the story Robbins does a lovely job of spoofery at the end of the film as the play is finally being performed at a nearby theatre  representing the triumph both on stage and in the world at large of the common man over the oppressive tyrants of industry  the tycoons dressed in masquerade ball costumes of the 18th Century aristocracy and Catholic hierarchy mull over their plans to retain control of the art world by bankrolling only those paintings depicting the scenes of utmost blandness and banality.  Thus these men of corporate power are portrayed more as amusingly quaint pests than malevolent or malicious despots.There is certainly no denying that The Cradle Will Rock' is at heart a bit of a leftwing diatribe.  However it is not a cruel or unreasonable one. And Tim Robbins' extraordinary skills as both a storyteller and filmmaker make this clearly one of the most interesting and impressive films of 1999.".

Now he has written and directed something that elevates him to world class.The simple first Tim has learned from Altman how to make a camera move in such a way that the viewer becomes part of the action. Some of his long multithreaded action shots are breathtaking. More this is used to tie together dual threads and multiple stories. Altman again but even Altman is inconsistent in this.But Tim can do something Altman cannot. He tunes this ensemble so tightly it seems that they are siblings. Many individual performances deeply charm reach high.That alone makes this a must see. But there's more. This is yet another play about a play a common enough genre that has a very specific set of pitfalls. Robbins the writer cleverly avoids this with a facile trick. Uncareful viewers will see this as a simple leftleaning story about artistic McCarthyism Jesse Helms anyone?. But that is a ruse. The story is just the excuse.Watch it again and look for why the play couldn't be put on. It was the unions as much coopted by the system as Rockefeller that was the real threat and who the players defy at the end. This ahistorical fact was inserted for a reason. Also watch for how the whole thing is nested in Faust with a deeper recursive level with the players as the puppets in Faust. The puppet thing is worked a few other ways with Murray of course but also so many others until we feel that the only nonpuppets are the actors.I think this is one of those cases where Robbins exceeded his own intellect but it still works as a deeply recursive self examination even of itself because he trusted his instincts as dramatist and presumably the actors' instincts as well.I rate this high for intelligence. It achieves what Altman has not. Some seem to object that some of the characters are silly Wells and Houseman and the Countess. But this is deliberate. They are playing players IN A PLAY. That's the point. Perhaps it would have been better to not use historical names since it confuses people who might look for accuracy.Some misgivings though. Sarandon's performance was the weakest. Cinematically the crushing of the mural during the performance was blunt editing. The pacing was off  it should have been better integrated with the pacing of the play's action. The transposition of the dummy to modern Broadway was radically less subtle than the dummy theme's life in the rest of the play. If you didn't tease it out early you'd be confused.".

The concept of this film is a breakthrough for the big screen since Hollywood seems to be the capital of selling out. The comments on artistic integrity are strong and literally moving in the acting of an amazing cast as well as the way in which the story is edited to David Robbins' beautiful score.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the events that occurred in post Depression era New York in 1936 The Cradle Will Rock' is a spectacular extravaganza of people places and most of all cultures. Truly an exemplary take on the battle of radicals and corporates art and politics when they could be united in a common bond. Thus it is only suiting that such a film be directed by uberliberalist Tim Robbins. This picture simply wouldn't have worked without him.From an overhead point of view this is the cinematic equivalent of a protest a real bite on shady politics. But in actuality it is something far deeper focusing on numerous interesting subplots and taking in everyone's point of view. The backdrop is the closing down of a theatrical play when it is accused of being communist. Throughout the 135 minutes we take in all of the different isms' fascism capitalism communism Nazism Catholicism and Judaism. Not only does this require a passing knowledge on these people and events one must have an interest in the proceedings to get the most out of it.One reason why there have been some negative reviews is because people are confused as to why Diego Riviera Margherreta Sarfatti etc. are in the story. I can explain. Rather like Magnolia which followed on totally dissimilar outlines you have to read the subtext. This is a movie about passion for art and music. Marc Blitzein Hazel Huffman and Diego Riviera and all connected had a deep passion for their work that the authorities would soon destroy because of rules and regulations.Interesting is the fact that all the characters are based on true life people and Robbins has assembled a fine cast who give noteworthy performances all across the board. One of the hardest to portray has to be Orson Welles. It's a true fact that 21yearolds from the 1930's look much older than those from the 90's. No one wanted to see James Van Der Beek Casper Van Dien in the role. Thus Angus MacFadyen was a superb choice portraying Welles as an egotistical selfcentred man. Equally impressive is Susan Sarandon with an impeccable exotic accent as a Jewish Fascist art dealer.  She knows exactly what she's doing and highlights some of the best scenes. Other standouts include John Cusack's aristocratic Nelson Rockafeller and Cary Elwes' interpretation of flamboyant producer soontobe Oscar winner The Paper Chase' 1973 John Houseman.If there were a flaw it would have to be the last 1520 minutes. What for the most part is an illustrious brilliant character study later dissipates into a shinysmiley low glitz Singin In the Rain' effort. Such a shame because the film was doing so tremendously up until that point. Then of course it is 135 minutes long so much of that final sequence could and should have been excised.Nevertheless if you can forgive that you have a remarkable audacious film on hand. The Cradle Will Rock' truly is an overseen landmark in ensembles biopics and interweaving. By far Robbins best movie yet the subplots are equally impressive from Blitzstein's paranoid delusions to Constance La Grange's overthetop characteristics. If you are in any way interested in fascism communism etc. then don't miss this polished spirited picture. My IMDb rating 7.610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tim and Susan have been on the forefront of our political and artistic landscape for many years regardless of the personal or artistic costs. They are Hollywood players and as such I do not always stand and cheer when I see one of their films. It's taken some time for me to recognize their excellent aspirations. Not to say I haven't embraced their intentions in a general way. With this film Cradle Will Rock however I embrace them unconditionally.I have deep theatrical roots and was simply enchanted by the frame of this story inside Roosevelt's WPA theatre project of the early '30s. As deeply embedded in the theatre as I am I had no idea I blush to admit that I owed so much to the extraordinary legacy of the artists and managers from that era. So for this alone I am grateful to the filmmakers.Within my personal history in the theatre I have long struggled with the zeal in needing to produce theatre in defense of civil and human liberties and reconciling that with the ongoing pressures of making a buck. Not that I insist all artistic need be liberty oriented. But I am uneasy in choosing a work to produce or to witness if I cannot find a pillar of social justice within it. The earth is far too fragile and the threats to her and her inhabitants are far too imminent to waste time otherwise.Back to the film Not only was I unaware of the WPA theatre project I was unaware there was a McCarthyEralikewitch hunt to dismember the artists and producers and administrators. I kept thinking as I watched the Senate interrogations Is that Senator McCarthy? That can't bethat doesn't happen for 30 years! The parallel is unmistakable uncanny and one can't help but ponder its legacy The McCarthy Era Senator Jesse Helms' vicious relentless attacks on public funded arts media and humanities the Bush Doctrine and so on. And as I watched there was this small voice telling me what we all know Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. I was shocked to learn that this hideous bureaucracy has been using every weapon at hand to demolish the arts in the US for at least 80 years. For this revelation alone I honor these filmmakers.The history and political science are presented excellently here and might be subjects for good documentaries. Believe it or not I do like entertainment and it's likely I would've missed the lessons had they been presented as documentaries. Instead Tim has written one of the most compelling screenplays with very diverse human stories interwoven in what must've been a pitch to studio execs that was unwieldy and impossible to track. Not so in the execution. I write screenplays and I am many times undone by the weight of my convictions. Not so with Cradle. The writing here is superb.To climax with a performance of the musical Cradle Will Rock booked in a vaudeville house in a last ditch effort after the Feds close down the original venue is divinely inspired. The showmustgoon mentality produced with a pianist and piano on an empty stage before a standing room only crowd of recently fired performers and technicians their families friends and supporters is just bloody brilliant. When the performers stand up in the house to join the performanceEquity Union rules they cannot step on stagewhen these performers step into their roles rising up from the audience itself and in spite of very real threats of being black balledthe effect is sublime. It's as though the observers become the observedthat alchemical magic every sincere performer strives to achieve. To accomplish this on film is rare. Sure you often identify with a character in a film but you often do it in a kind of hypnotic escapist state. This film achieves something more particular more active in the way of audienceperformer union.Cradle Will Rock is one of the best film arts arguments for democracy. It is a gift to all of us. Let us honor and treasure the filmmakers.".

	schema:reviewBody "While it was fun seeing Cradle Will Rock with my motherinlaw who had some memories of the time period I also did a huge paper on the WPA Arts Projects in graduate school I recommend Jerry Mangione's book on the Federal Writer's Project as a good introduction and am quite familiar with the personalities and facts involved so was curious to see it as a docudrama. But we plus my parents felt the film was too agitprop and the 20 of it that's overthetop aw come on Hearst  Citizen Kane foreshadowing Rockefeller and a steel magnate at a Versailles costume party at the climax? weakens the historical telling of a confluence of happenings  the strangulation of the Federal Theater Project as a precursor victim to McCarthyism through the Dies Committee including actual testimony wherein Christopher Marlowe was accused of being a Commie as were the classic Greek dramatists and Nelson Rockefeller's benighted sponsorship and then destruction of the Diego Rivera murals at Rockefeller Center. Effectively written and directed by Tim Robbins is how passionately political the artists were not as card carrying Communists per se but as committed antiFascists and unionists in every aspect of their personal livesas equally committed as they were to the magic of the theater as a communication device. It does go over the top including Susan Sarandon as an elegant Jewish courier to Mussolini selling stolen Old Masters it is effective to show how TPTB were sympathetic to and profited from alliances with the fascists and how much they hated That Cripple in the White House.Amidst the politics the art for art's sake oversize egos of John Houseman and Orson Welles are also well portrayed if a shade as buffoons compared to the grimness of everyone else around them most of whom needed these WPA jobs to keep from starving there's a toss away line that barely explains that FDR had to throw the Theater Project to the wolves in order to save his whole alphabet soup of programs for the vast majority. It's also a bit over the top in painting those who testified at the Committee as probably crazy but who knows. The Vanessa Redgrave character is silly but I guess it's making a point that Radical Chic is not new.The climax of the factual occurrence the one and only original performance of Marc Blitzstein's ThreePenny Operainspired political musical Cradle Will Rock is a delightful recreation and from what I've read true to the real story. This is definitely a very un1990's story. Additional recommended background reading Cultural Front The Laboring of American Culture in the Twentieth Century by Michael Denning Verso 1998 556 pagesoriginally written 122000".

	onyx:emotionText "While it was fun seeing Cradle Will Rock with my motherinlaw who had some memories of the time period I also did a huge paper on the WPA Arts Projects in graduate school I recommend Jerry Mangione's book on the Federal Writer's Project as a good introduction and am quite familiar with the personalities and facts involved so was curious to see it as a docudrama. But we plus my parents felt the film was too agitprop and the 20 of it that's overthetop aw come on Hearst  Citizen Kane foreshadowing Rockefeller and a steel magnate at a Versailles costume party at the climax? weakens the historical telling of a confluence of happenings  the strangulation of the Federal Theater Project as a precursor victim to McCarthyism through the Dies Committee including actual testimony wherein Christopher Marlowe was accused of being a Commie as were the classic Greek dramatists and Nelson Rockefeller's benighted sponsorship and then destruction of the Diego Rivera murals at Rockefeller Center. Effectively written and directed by Tim Robbins is how passionately political the artists were not as card carrying Communists per se but as committed antiFascists and unionists in every aspect of their personal livesas equally committed as they were to the magic of the theater as a communication device. It does go over the top including Susan Sarandon as an elegant Jewish courier to Mussolini selling stolen Old Masters it is effective to show how TPTB were sympathetic to and profited from alliances with the fascists and how much they hated That Cripple in the White House.Amidst the politics the art for art's sake oversize egos of John Houseman and Orson Welles are also well portrayed if a shade as buffoons compared to the grimness of everyone else around them most of whom needed these WPA jobs to keep from starving there's a toss away line that barely explains that FDR had to throw the Theater Project to the wolves in order to save his whole alphabet soup of programs for the vast majority. It's also a bit over the top in painting those who testified at the Committee as probably crazy but who knows. The Vanessa Redgrave character is silly but I guess it's making a point that Radical Chic is not new.The climax of the factual occurrence the one and only original performance of Marc Blitzstein's ThreePenny Operainspired political musical Cradle Will Rock is a delightful recreation and from what I've read true to the real story. This is definitely a very un1990's story.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a romantic look at 1930's liberalism with a hamhanded script that pits the evil fascists against the enlightened intellectuals.It tries to be a little of everything and doesn't quite pull it off. It alternates from a comedy to poignant vignettes of depression era poverty to a musical to farce to political drama. I just felt Robbins couldn't make up his mind as what this film was supposed to be. I am guessing that most of it wound up on the cutting room floor and maybe a longer film would have allowed some of these themes to develop more completely.It has one of the largest casts I've ever seen. It seems everyone in Hollywood wanted to get in on this one. The biggest problem I had with the film was that if you weren't one of the warmlyportrayed socialists then you were either a simple minded right wing alarmist or a big businessman in bed with the fascists.One thing is clear  Robbins and Sarandon yearn for the days when being part of the far far left was fashionable.".

Welles like Hitchcock and many others in this age of Steadicams did the uncut tracking shot masterfully suspensefully infusing almost every frame with some kind of significance and moving the story forward at the same time.

It's like going into it the makers figured they were going to make the kind of film that people made in the sixties where it was accepted who the good and the bad guys were so you just needed to get to the payoff scene where a the workers are massacred or b the workers rise together and triumph.  So Robbins plunges forth without taking any time to connect us with his characters or with the complexities beneath their surface to make us participate in what makes them tick.  They are just assigned a function and off they go into the plot.Susan Sarandon and Vanessa Redgrave as a fascist and a decadent aristocrat respectively are ridiculous pieces of obvious casting against type.  But since the whole film is so firmly planted in stereotypes when it tries to go against them as with the casting of these two characters it is transparent and selfevident.If you miss movies like Sacco e Vanzetti or They Don't Wear Black Tie you'll probably eat this up.

Robbins effectively reduces Welles to an alcoholic homophobic buffoon with zero tolerance for an actor's personal needs.I never heard of this film until reading about it on an Orson Welles web site.

Robbins' homage or plagiarism of Robert Altman's ensemble format fails badly as he tries to push his spin on historical fact. At least he posts a disclaimer during the opening credits that the film is mostly true. His message seems to be that those on the left are oppressed holders of the truth while those on the right are corrupt censors of artistic freedom.Another weak spot of the film is that the musical play itself is of dubious quality in both words and music. Robbins to his credit shows very little of the play's weak content.The cinematography in the film is very good as is the production design.

	schema:reviewBody "Cradle Will Rock is not a very exciting title for a film and my eye would most certainly have slid past its listing in the TV guide if it were not for the onesentence plot synopsis below Orson Welles attempts to stage a controversial play in Depressionera America. My attention was immediately captured and even more so during the very impressive onetake opening shot which also boasts a lengthy lineup of casting credits that features everybody from Hank Azaria to Emily Watson with no less than two Cusacks to seal the deal  if there's one thing to be said about actorsturneddirectors it's that they can certainly bring in the big names. 'Cradle Will Rock 1999' was Tim Robbins' third directorial effort and he courageously tackles a wide assortment of political and social issues from 1930s America as well as providing a commentary on the importance of art and culture as a means of expressing one's personal beliefs. It is only fitting that a film about the role of art be directed by a man who is obviously very passionate about his craft and Robbins has produced a mature and intelligent comedydrama.The film based on the true story of Marc Blitzstein's 1937 musical The Cradle Will Rock was originally planned as Orson Welles' final project and preproduction commenced in 1983.

My attention was immediately captured and even more so during the very impressive onetake opening shot which also boasts a lengthy lineup of casting credits that features everybody from Hank Azaria to Emily Watson with no less than two Cusacks to seal the deal  if there's one thing to be said about actorsturneddirectors it's that they can certainly bring in the big names. 'Cradle Will Rock 1999' was Tim Robbins' third directorial effort and he courageously tackles a wide assortment of political and social issues from 1930s America as well as providing a commentary on the importance of art and culture as a means of expressing one's personal beliefs. It is only fitting that a film about the role of art be directed by a man who is obviously very passionate about his craft and Robbins has produced a mature and intelligent comedydrama.The film based on the true story of Marc Blitzstein's 1937 musical The Cradle Will Rock was originally planned as Orson Welles' final project and preproduction commenced in 1983. However not unusually for the great director financial support was withdrawn shortly afterwards and Welles passed away in 1985.

Nicholls who has a cameo as George Zorn said that most of the actors worked almost for free out of friendship for Robbins and love for theater and that Cradle Will Rock's poor reception at the boxofficecritics is the main reason why Robbins hasn't directed another movie since then. That's a shame since this is even better than his previous directorial efforts Bob Roberts and Dead Man Walking which were much easier films. It's true you have to know at least a little bit about the people portrayed here in order to fully appreciateunderstand the film and movies like this don't usually become blockbusters but the fact that Cradle Will Rock was ignored altogether and seems quite forgotten is really sad.

Mostly it seemed like rich people wandering about being excited that there is at last another corpse in the castle. This has got to be the dullest of the films made from a story by either of the Wallaces. This is a time killer of the worst sort. I'd avoid it unless you're in need of sleep.

And in this case they've got not one but three the first two of which are barely passable as girls and the third looking like the spitting image of the big redhead that Arnold disguises himself as in Total Recall. The whole plot is based on three members of Kappa Omicron Kappa not exactly a subtly acronym getting kicked out of their fraternity after they were set up and accused of stealing the alumni party funds. They need to sneak back in their old house to recover a videotape that will prove their innocence. Their first scheme is to dress up as girls and get in during a party but they quickly get ejected by the dog catcher whose job it is to get rid of ugly girls. While still in drag they are invited to pledge the ultrafeminist Delta Omicron Gamma sorority another nonsubtle joke and since they've no food money or lodging they accept. The rest of the movie is about their awkward attempts to keep up their ruse and fit in with a bunch of sorority girls all the while scheming to get back that tape. Naturally much of the laughs come as the girls are forced to adjust to their new roles and dealing with stuff like leg shaving and walking badly in heels although in the process these formerly crude horndogs learn to start appreciating women as more than just object to either lust after if they're hot or make fun of if they're not. Fortunately they don't get too heavy on the feminist message stuff at least not enough to get in the way of the humor. And there's a fun little love twist in which one of the boys starts falling for the sorority president Leah. Her character's a bit of a modern movie cliche like Julia Stiles in 10 Things I Hate About You she's supposed to be this bitchy angry ugly man hating feminist but is simply too good natured and good looking to really fool anyone. Of course the twist is as a boy in her Women's Studies class she hates him but as a girl she starts to develop feelings for her. Naturally once she learns the truth she's initially outraged but seeing as this is a simple comedy and not something like Chasing Amy she quickly relents and all ends well. This is by no means a great comedy it's definitely a rent don't buy kind of movie but considering I had no real expectations other that to get about 90 minutes of shutoffyourbrain entertainment I must say it wasn't bad.610".

I never once had the urge to look at my watch and found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion. It was great to see how typical guys would react to being in a woman's shoes physically and emotionally and maybe learn a little something about how they should treat a woman in return. All in all it was a feelgood comedy and by the end of the movie you saw a lot of character development. I can't say that I have made a completely unbiased evaluation of the movie because my main motivation for seeing it was a certain Sexy Lexy of televisions Smallville but all in all I found it well worth my six dollars and hour and a half. However I don't recommend that everyone go see it. There are many people who are far too critical of movies and don't believe that they can be just for fun you know who you are but think they should have some deep philosophical meaning. If you're one of THOSE people don't go see this movie!! For those of you who can enjoy a movie at face value and then some in this case go check it out! And if you're interested in seeing adorable shots of the main cast in drag stay for the credits!! I gave it a 9 out of 10.".

If you're one of THOSE people don't go see this movie!! For those of you who can enjoy a movie at face value and then some in this case go check it out! And if you're interested in seeing adorable shots of the main cast in drag stay for the credits!! I gave it a 9 out of 10.";

The 3 guys really are funny. The football game scene's could have been a little more realistic. I mean come'on girls knocking guys out on the field is a little far fetched but it's a movie...you know.. make believe! Barry Watson and Harland Williams are great but to me Michael Rosenbaum stole the show. His expressions falling off his shoes the fight scene with Barry Watson he just cracked me up. And looks like he could be Chevy Chase's son which I checked and he's not. If ya not looking for an Academy Award winner and ya just want to be entertained and have a good laugh this is the movie.".

Of course after seeing the trailers I was expecting a D movie so it was actually better than I thought it would be.  There is quite a bit in the movie to offend people who like to be offended.  Personally speaking as an ugly girl who would be kicked out of frat parties although why any girl would want to be at a frat party in the first place is beyond me I wasn't offended because I'm too apathetic to get worked up about the messages in a badly written movie.  What bothered me a lot more were the dropped plot points all throughout the film.  There are too many to mention so I won't. It is also much easier for me to ignore the fact that the guys looked like guys and no one noticed suspension of disbelief in favor of going with the main plotline than it is for me to ignore the fact that they wore dresses and pumps and carried little purses to college classes.  Or that the president of the cool fraternity was such a complete dork.  Long story short there are just SO many things wrong with this movie that if you aren't the type who can shut off the critical or easily offended portions of your brain and just enjoy Michael Rosenbaum looking pretty in a miniskirt and heels or skinny girls in wet tshirts for some of you then you don't want to watch this movie.".

So in order to get in the house they think dressing in drag will do the trick plus they get free room and board at the DOG house. Of couse the president of DOG is a really hot blonde who is supposed to be geeky because she wears glasses. Like we haven't seen that before.So the few laughs come from the guys in drag in awkard situations. Such as when one guy takes  a shower with the hot blonde who can't tell he's a guy because she isn't wearing her glasses. As if! And of course the uncomfortableness of them wearing dresses. And being hit on by some of their frat brothers. But one thing I can't get over with movies like this is that the 3 guys are obvious male and not women but everyone they see falls for the drag getup. I mean you can see their beards.And you know how it ends the 3 guys who didn't think much of the DOG girls think they are OK and not such geeks after living with them.

It's kind of brainless and stupid at times but it's also really funny watching guys trying to be girls.  I was particularly taken with the performance of Michael Rosenbaum who not only stole the show when the job was obviously Harland Williams' but made it more than fun to watch. Speaking as a female of the species I was surprised that some women were offended by this movie.  So there are a lot of gratuitous boob shots so what?  Personally nudity doesn't offend me the fact that none of the men are naked offends me.  If a woman truly considers herself a feminist she must demand equal rights and not be afraid to back those beliefs up.  Where are the naked men?  Harvey Keitel isn't doin' it for me. Really all that Sorority Boys is saying is we should all be a little more tolerant considerate and have fun.  The best of both worlds. I enjoyed it and I may just check out smallville as a result.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is likely you have read other viewers' comments on Sorority Boys so you will already know the plot summary. I would love to tell you why I liked this movie enough to go out and buy it. They say that you don't know a person until you have walked a mile in their shoes and this movie takes that piece of wisdom quite literally! The three guys undergo some slow and subtle changes in their attitudes towards women after a few days masquerading as sorority girls. It is not a politically correct tale by any means but who cares? Life is serious enough without getting bent out of shape over a movie and anyone who takes serious offense at this one really needs to get a sense of humor. The talent is outstanding and thus one can overlook any flaws in the plot or script. The guys are hilarious especially Michael Rosenbaum who takes a break from playing Lex Luthor Smallville for a while and turns out to be an ace at physical comedy. The jokes are coarse at times as is the language but it is only what one would expect and the whole thing is a laugh a minute. Quite frankly at times I laughed until I cried. I was thinking that once I had the movie and could watch it over and over it would not be as funny but this one just does not get old. The DVD includes a filmmaker's angle feature and a very funny behindthescenes featurette which shows the boytogirl transformation process including leg waxing  hope the guys got paid extra for that. Sorority Boys  I loved it. Oh  and I am a female!".

	schema:reviewBody "SORORITY BOYS  2002 12 out of fourBelieve it or not I was actually looking forward to Sorority Boys. I hoped it would be different from the recent explosion of aimless sex comedies considering the ample comic opportunities. Unfortunately five minutes into the movie when a JellO dildo crashed threw a window I realized my expectations were incorrect. At this point I knew this would be 94 minutes of pure aimless sex comedy. Sex can be funny sometimes but not as often as Hollywood likes to think. Am I the only person getting sick and tired of these pathetic attempts at humor?The surprising thing about Sorority Boys is how much potential the story actually has. Harland Williams Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson play three members of Kappa Omicron Kappa fraternity who find themselves evicted from the KOK for stealing party funds. Somebody has a video tape of the incident but very few people know it exists and their exfraternity pals will not allow them back inside to retrieve it. After learning that the Delta Omicron Gamma house needs new members they disguise themselves in drag in order to stay somewhere and concoct a plan to prove their innocence.  Even with potentially funny situations directly under its brow the movie's humor resorts to characters tumbling down staircases and silly lipstick jokes. The script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge desperately lacks imagination. The plot is so handicapped of ideas it becomes wound up in a love story so out of place even the actors involved look as if they think it belongs in a different movie altogether. Although we've seen guys in drag before in much better movies this film is not without unique humorous intentions. In one scene two characters sword fight with large dildos in another the men in drag lead the DOG members against the KOK's in a game of footballthey are the first three to hit the bench due to injuries. Again these are funny concepts but director Wallace Wolodarsky doesn't find a punch line. The idea of two guys fighting with dildos is funny but watching them actually fight for five minutes is not. There is no moment when the audience identifies with the humor and laughs. The visualization of the jokes are so utterly stupid the audience couldn't laugh at these sight gags if they wanted to. Sorority Boys simply expects us to laugh at the utter stupidity of the characters. But that doesn't work when the movie is equally as stupid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Norman Taurog directs and Spencer Tracy plays Father Flanagan in another film about the priest who walked the walk in his philosophy about their being no such thing as a bad boy.Men of Boys Town finds Tracy burdened down with a lot of responsibility. His responsibility to each and every boy that he takes in at Boys Town and to the institution itself. Some of their stories overlap with Tracy's main concern about keeping the institution afloat.One of those kids is Larry Nunn a kid crippled after he killed a guard in a reformatory he was in. His story is similar to the one that was in the original Boys Town where Gene Reynolds was another kid who was crippled. Nunn is far more cynical and bitter after seeing and experiencing what he has in that other institution.Another kid is Darryl Hickman a young juvenile offender from that same place who sneaks out of the place with Mickey Rooney when Rooney goes to visit one of Nunn's friends. Talk about deja vu in the original Boys Town it was Rooney who was the smart mouth who gets tamed by his experience at Boys Town. I guess the Deity and the scriptwriters have a sense of humor.Besides Tracy and Rooney Sidney Miller and Bobs Watson are retained from the original film. Rooney would be stealing this whole film if it weren't for Tracy. Nobody steals a scene from Spencer Tracy. I guess since Boys Town is still here we do know that Father Flanagan did solve the problems shown in this film as well. Though it looks a whole lot like Tracy is getting stretched way to thin in the movies and in life itself problems sometimes do have a way working themselves out if we can only perceive the solution.Anyway Men of Boys Town is simply Spencer Tracy continuing his award winning role as the ever wise and patient Father Flanagan. Good enough reason to see this film.".

However three years later both Rooney and Whitey are more mature and the characterization benefits. Rooney has toned down and deepened his performance and with more screen time he holds his own with Tracy.The film's plot is melodramatic and includes a crippled boy a dog a potential adoption an escapee from a reform school and financial problems all of which not surprisingly resolve themselves in a flood of tears and smiles in the best tradition of old MGM movies. Bobs Watson returns as Pee Wee and although he should have outgrown the game with the candy in the drawers he remains memorable for the waterworks that he could evidently turn on and off at the director's command. Anne Revere no slouch in the tears department herself has a small memorable part near the film's conclusion. Lee J.

Aside from the difference in time frame where some of the boys have now grown to become the men of Boys Town only the Dave Morris character originally enacted by the thin middleaged Henry Hull now played by the younger yet studier Lee J. Cobb. Taken from an original screenplay by James K. McGuinness the theory of There's no such thing as a bad boy continues as Father Flanagan resumes his mission through faith in miracles while helping troubled youths with the assistance of a former delinquent himself Whitey Marsh.The sequel unfolds as Whitey Marsh Mickey Rooney newspaper editor shortwave radio operator and mayor of Boys Town arranges a welcoming home committee for Dave Morris Lee J. Cobb the pawnbroker responsible for helping Father Edward Flanagan Spencer Tracy financially in making Boys Town for him a reality. Being away a year Dave finds the only thing that remains consistent is Father Flanagan's financial problems now being heavily in debt of 200000 for the construction of extra dormitories. Good deeds continue as Father Flanagan attends the murder trial of Ted Martley Larry Nunn  in a sensitive performance now paralyzed with a broken back thanks to the brutal guard he shot in the reformatory. With the prison sentence suspended by the judge Addison Richards Father Flanagan assumes responsibility for the troubled teen by taking him to where there are no high walls or guards to hold anyone prisoner that being Boys Town. Due to Ted's bitter attitude Father Flanagan's only hope by making the boy to at least smile actually comes not from the boys but from a do belonging to the visiting Mrs. Maitland Mary Nash chairman of the State Parole Board and her husband Henry O'Neill given to him by Whitey. The Maitlands agree to offer the dog Beau Hunk  to Ted with the possibility of adopting a boy of their own their selection being Whitey. Whitey leaves Boys Town on a trial basis for the high living with the Maitlands. Changes occur when Whitey as a favor to Ted comes to Marysports Reform School to visit with his friend Miles Fenley. Because of his association with Flip Dwyer Darryl Hickman a juvenile reform school escapee he tries to help rather than being a visitor Whitey ends up as the reform school's inmate instead under the clutches of a corrupt cigar smoking superintendent Ben Weldon and brutal guard Arthur Hohl handy with the wooden club.Regardless of Spencer Tracy's second goround as the kindhearted Father Flanagan it is Mickey Rooney in between film roles of the Andy Hardy film series and Judy Garland musicals who's honored with the most screen time. No longer the delinquent introduced in BOYS TOWN his Whitey Marsh becomes more beneficial to Father Flanagan's cause and teachings. On the amusing side Rooney does a Slow Motion Wrestling Match done in slapstick violence with cartoonish sound effects in the tradition of The Three Stooges. This particular sequence was often edited from television broadcasts in the 1960s and 70s so to fit in the commercial breaks during a two hour time slot of a 107 minute movie presentation. While the thirdbilled moonfaced Bobs Watson PeeWee continues the tradition by playing find the candy in my office game with Father Flanagan it is Darryl Hickman's junior tough guy performance who draws most of the attention from the cast. As a juvenile delinquent who marvels in performing stickups talking tough and reading crime magazines he goes on with his bad boy reputation at Boys Town by taking candy from a baby the baby being PeeWee. In a cross between humor and tear inducing sentiment there's plenty more scene stealing antics provided by Hickman Paaalenty! As much as the situations provided in the screenplay might come across as contrived a moral message is brought out through some of its passages mainly that things happen for a reason and how even the most tragic results do resolve into something positive. Although there was no third installment to Father Flanagan's story of Boys Town RKO Radio did attempt its own similar theme of FIGHTING FATHER DUNNE 1948 featuring Pat O'Brien as the kindly priest who takes in and cares for homeless boys one played by nonother than the teenaged Darryl Hickman.Distributed to home video in the 1990s MEN OF BOYS TOWN can be found on DVD as a flip side package to its predecessor BOYS TOWN or through occasional cable broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies. 12".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me be clear that the film Men of Boys Town is well worth the watch if for no other reason than the rematching of the two great actors Spencer Tracy who plays Father Flanagan and Mickey Rooney who plays Whitey Marsh the Mayor of Boys Town. Mickey's role is key to the film in terms of him being portrayed as the protector of all boys who end up in a reform school. Of course there is abuse at some of these school for boys and you only have to be reminded of the Catholic Churches in Boston who eventually paid out tens of millions of dollars for their decades of abuse of young boys in their control.In this film there is one young man named Ted Martley played by Larry Munn who is beaten so badly by the guards at his reform school that he cannot even walk due to paralysis of the leg. Father Flanagan travels over a thousand miles to bring the young and disengaged Ted Martley to Boys Town where he encourages his greatest supporter Whitey Marsh the socalled ordained Mayor of Boys Town played by Mickey Rooney to show this young man that everyone deserves a second chance and that there are people out there who truly care for the impoverished youth of society to ensure they grow up with both a spiritual and moral compass.Whitey Marsh is the epitome of believing in himself and the younger boys of Boys Town so he sets his goal to make this paralyzed youth Ted Martley recognize that he does have true friends at Boys Town. Oh and of course the director Norman Taurog brings in a cute little dog who just loves to jump on Ted's lap and lick his face so much so that Ted finally comes out of his self absorbed shell and cracks his first smile while sitting up in his bed.The Men of Boys Town is aptly named as these young boys must face real challenges both in life and in death and no one can bring these emotions to life better than Mickey Rooney and Spencer Tracy. This is well worth the watch even in this century some 76 years later from its initial release. Be sure to keep a box of tissues close to you though especially late at night when your guard may be down as mine was. Tears will flow but joy and redemption is their main message.I give the film an 8 out of 10 rating.".

Lee J. Cobb took his role here and although Cobb is very likable he doesn't provide the memorable performance that Hull did. Mickey Rooney seems more mature...and isn't overacting as much here making his character much more likable but unfortunately he goes a bit too far and essentially he becomes Andy Hardy. His slow motion fighting routine is a classic and really shows just how talented Rooney was. And as the story begins we learn that a couple of years have passed and there have been improvements and additions to Boys Town. Then Father Flanagan is called to a trial where a boy who is now paralyzed has murdered a guard at a reform school. All continues well. As the crippled delinquent's sour personality begins to improve a couple comes to Boys Town to adopt and adopts Rooney and that leads to him to be placed in a reformatory himself where he learns of the torture that takes place there. Rooney and Tracy straighten that out the crippled boy walks again and the couple get their adoptee though not Rooney who graduates from Boys Town at the end of the movie.There are some good supporting performances here. The performance of young Darryl Hickman here is a hoot and not to be missed. Henry O'Neill is excellent as always as the adopting father and Mary Nash is good as his wife.I'm one of those few people who believes that this film IS better than the original. Tracy's acting is just as good Rooney's is more realistic and the story is more logical.You can get the best of both worlds here  the current iteration of the DVD has both films for your DVD shelf.".

	schema:reviewBody "A truly outstanding film that has not received the distinction that it deserves despite a firstrate cast and compelling as well as unique for the time subject matter.Spencer Tracy plays George Heisler one of seven prisoners escaping from a German concentration camp in 1936. The film traces his attempt to establish contact with the German resistance movement and along the way he changes slowly from a hardened cynic and regains his faith in mankind.This is not a bangbang action movie. The lack of overt violence is what makes gives the film a searing authenticity. This is based on a novel by Anna Seghers whose husband was indeed imprisoned in a concentration camp. True people knowledgeable about the era will find many technical errors. For one thing all of the actors including especially Tracy and Ray Collins are simply too overfed to be believable concentration camp inmates. Also the film shows the SA running the camp when I do believe the SS was running the camps by '36. I was not especially happy with the handling of the single Jewish character who is a token character and not portrayed very favorably.But this was 1944 not 1994 and this was the first film from Hollywood to depict concentration camps. Also I can't think of very many films that have more successfully captured the terror and despair of Nazi Germany and also more clearly impart a moral message. In that regard it is very faithful to the book.The performances by all even the bit characters are superlative. This was one of Spencer Tracy's finest roles and supposedly the melancholy of his performance was to a large extent influenced by word that a young friend who he knew from Boy's Town had died in combat.Cronyn and Tandy play Liesl and Paul Roeder who try to help George Heisler. What makes this a very fine drama is how even secondary and bit characters are shown to change and evolve. Watch for Helene Weigel wife of Bertold Brecht playing an old female janitor watching Roeder being taken away in a car. Weigel was the inspiration for Brecht's Mother Courage.Seghers was a Communist as are the major characters of the book and the politics of the author simmers below the surface without being explicitly expressed. Look closely at the characters playing Nazis and concentration camp guards and generally most of the characters with accents. The majority are refugees from Nazi Germany adding great authenticity to their performances.".

Spencer Tracy gave me some clue in this role why he is considered to be such a great actor you actually see his face change as he recovers from the near animal state the concentration camp had reduced him to and Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy also put in top class performances. The depiction of the concentration camp is astoundingly vivid for the time with the theme of seven crosses for either displaying the corpses of the escapees or for putting them to death being especially grim and  as the allies were soon to find out  no exaggeration as a symbol of the evil the Nazis visited upon millions who fell under their jackboot. Modern audiences may feel somewhat ambivalent about the idea of one of Tracy's dead friends from the camp acting as a voice within his soul but I think even those not of a spiritual bent ought to concede it is depicted with a light touch that does not damage the film.".

Spencer Tracy is fascinating and a superb choice. This is one of his finest performancesbecause he does not speak muchjust like Bad Day at Black Rock.Agnes Moorehead appears for a few minutes but presents a delightful character that adds to the strength of the film. I thought Russ Tamblyn was the acrobat who does not speak a single line but the IMDb records indicate that I am mistaken. Was I? Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy were a delight to watch as always. The character of Signe Hasso Toni is probably the least appropriate character in the film but one guesses that necessity for a love interest for the lead character in a film like this. For me the actors played a major part in making the film a wonderful viewing experience. But the real contributors to making the work impressive were Zinnemann and the cinematographer Karl Freund. The opening sequence showing the faces of the escapees establish the credibility of the two gentlemen behind the camera. The camerawork of Freund is always interesting but this film shows the chemistry between director and cinematographer.Zinnemann's choice of subjects to film has always made me wonder about the man.

Even though the movie contains a lot of violence and graphic depictions at least from a 1940's perspective I think the movie is fine for children to watch.

Then it slowly softens at the same rate as Spencer Tracy's character George Heisler regains his humanity.Though it is never said outright Tracy plays a Communist Party member the closest they came to saying it was antiNazi and that is why he was in a Nazi concentration camp in the first place.  The roles played Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy Paul  Liesel Roeder were that of ordinary hardworking Germans who didn't really care much for politics.  When Heisler asks Cronyn if he likes the current government Cronyn talks about how his wages are higher than ever before  ignorant to the oppression happening all around him.  In tougher times Heisler had given Roeder a Communist pamphlet and he recalls I didn't need a pamphlet  I needed a JOB!Many acts of heroism help to keep Heisler alive in his struggle to escape Germany.  Each of the characters have grown in their humanity.  For example the Roeders do not blame Heisler for the Gestapo calling on them and interrogating Paul they now know the blame lies with the Nazis.When Heisler mentions he has a debt to repay Signe Hasso Toni asks you mean you owe money?  Heisler says no.  Oh Toni says you mean to get back at the Nazis who did this to you?  Heisler remarks just the opposite my debt is to those who helped me.The quote for the summary of this review comes from an anonymous to Heisler benefactor who brings Heisler his passport and instructions.  He tells a story about ants in his deli working all day to move the contents of a sugar bowl to their ant hill.  His metaphor means you can kill the revolutionary but you cannot kill the revolution.My rating 10".

A strange plot device but very effective for this sort of film.THE SEVENTH CROSS is a propaganda film meant to solidify the people back home in the war effort against Nazi Germany. However the film is set in 1936three years before the war began. The film finds seven political prisoners escaping from a concentration camp. The whole seven crosses reference regards the Commandant's George Zucco pronouncement that each of the seven men will be tracked down and hung from these crosses in the courtyard of the prison until they are deadas a lesson to all those who would dare to consider escaping.The main character of the film is Spencer Tracy. What makes this performance interesting is that he says almost nothing through much of the film. Collins narrates and things occur around Tracy but he's so hollow and beaten by life in the camp that he just stares with a somewhat vacant look. As the film unfolds his performance opens up as wellshowing more and more of the familiar Tracy as he slowly recovers from the agonies of his confinement.The rest of the cast is quite impressive. Many exceptional character actors such as Felix Bressart Hume Cronyn and his wife Jessica Tandy Agnes Moorehead were gleaned from the MGM roster for the film. Additionally if you look at the extended list of the cast you'll see that it is hugemuch much larger than usual. It's obvious that the studio pulled out all the stops to make this a firstrate production.Overall a very successful film because unlike some wartime films this one is timeless and can be enjoyed and admired today because it is a very well made filmwith a taut script and excellent acting. As I said some wartime propaganda films don't work as well today because they are shrill and simplistic. This film has depth and has more to offer than usual.".

Of course there were no Fifth Amendment problems for Ms. Seghers as she was an unabashed Marxist and proud citizen of the German Democratic Republic.For a Marxist author she used religious symbols a lot. Before the days of the mass exterminations with the gas and the ovens the Nazis used more traditional methods of extermination individually at least in the preWorld War II days of 1936. Modern day crucifixions were the order and that's what they have in store for Spencer Tracy and six other escapees.Tracy of course proves the toughest to catch. During his escape he meets up with all kinds of people some who help and some who are ready to turn him in. By his wits and with a lot of luck Tracy survives to tell his tale. The Seventh Cross is quite the triumph for Tracy. Usually an actor who eschewed make up of any kind he made an exception here as he had to be shown weak and with a bad pallor as a result of his hardships. Director Fred Zinneman a refugee from Austria in fact was given his first A picture assignment and got great critical acclaim and was well on the way to a two Best Director Oscar career.Zinneman assembled a good group of character players to support Tracy. Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy got their first notice in The Seventh Cross. And this has to be one of the only films where Kurt Katch was not a Nazi but a member of the underground.Two things always stood out about The Seventh Cross. It seems to anticipate The Diary of Anne Frank in its message. Although they were certainly being rapidly rounded up in 1936 there apparently were still enough decent folks around to help Tracy. At the end of the film a kind of roll call is read to the audience. And wasn't that Anne Frank's message that people were essentially decent if you could reach that spark of it left in them?Also besides using religious symbolism the author went on to live in another police state this one of the making of her ideological companeros. And where be East Germany now?".

	schema:reviewBody "The Seventh Cross is a film I have a watched a number of times because it stars one of my very favorite actors  Spencer Tracy Supporting actors include Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy  real man and wife and this was their first film together. Cronyn was an Academy Award nominee for his performance here. The supporting actor of note was Ray Collins of later Perry Mason fame one of the Concentration Camp victims here who doesn't survive but posthumously continues to narrate the film.This was one of Fred Zinnemann's early directorial efforts long before High Noon. Interestingly it was one of the earliest films to deal with the topic of Nazi concentration camps.The film begins with a rather tortuous and overbearing opening score. We learn that 7 POWs have escaped from a concentration camp. They represent many factions of German society  a writer a circus performer a school teacher a farmer a Jewish grocery clerk and 2 who appear to be political activists Tracy and Collins. The first few minutes of the film belong to Collins as he is the first to be hunted down tortured and hung on a cross to die. Very little dialog other than his narration but this is probably the most dramatic of all of Collins' many screen performances. The Nazi commandant vows to find each escapee and hang each on another of the 7 crosses hence the title.The focus then shifts to Tracy who also has perhaps the least dialog of any of his screen roles...because he is a man alone. Tracy does an admirable job of conveying his terror through facial expressions. We follow his journey to his home town of Mainz where surely his former girl friend will help him...but of course she doesn't and even threatens to report him. The scene where Tracy watches as another escapee is chased along the rooftops is particularly effective...as the escapee elects to commit suicide rather than be captured. Although he feels totally alone here and there people give him a little help and unbeknownst to him a small group of old friends are plotting to help him...if they can find him or he can find them. But everyone is suspicious of almost everyone else. Who will choose loyalty to a friend over loyalty to the Third Reich? Tracy's character does escape Germany and he regains his faith in humanity...although the ending is quite abrupt.Among the supporting actors of note were Signe Hasso good and simple performance Hume Cronyn as a loyal friend good performance Jessica Tandy as Cronyn's wife also a good performance Agnes Moorehead in an odd role for her and Herbert Rudley as a loyal friend played well.This is a very well done movie and many will want it on their DVD shelf. But it is a depressing film despite the upbeat ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film stars Spencer Tracy as a concentration camp escapee named George Heisler who navigates his way to freedom through the perils of Nazi Germany. Along the way he meets many people who help him and his cynicism and fatigue fade away. Early in the story soon after he's left the camp he meets a little girl and in his mind he's sure that he'll kill her if she attracts the wrong kind of attention to him. Next he lurches into the home of his exgirlfriend frightening her. And no wonder because his face has a twisted expression on it that frightened ME  in this moment Tracy is almost unrecognizable. This man's an animal he's been through hell and he has no reason to believe that the world is anything other than a sewer. For my money this is a pretty startling opening for a 1944 movie.Not to throw definitions around too freely I'm tempted to describe this film as Nazi noir. Heisler weaves his way through German society of 1936 where it's the criminals who are in power and scuttling through the streets are the folks who are merely trying to survive in any way possible. At the back of our minds is the worrisome knowledge that things are going to get exponentially worse. Fred Zinnemann the director creates an atmosphere of claustrophobia and palpable dread where the night is filled with dark shadows and any tiny act of resistance to the Nazi regime is a colossal act of courage. There is almost no violence in the film yet the threat of violence hangs heavy in the air. Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy play Paul and Liesel Roeder a couple who are old friends of Heisler and who befriend him. Paul is politically neutral. He doesn't follow the news and one gets the feeling that he would rather not know anything about what's going on. One of the fascinating threads in the film is his growing awareness. The scenes with Cronyn and Tandy are wonderful  real chemistry is bubbling here and they seem to belong together and we all know what happened in real life. I must mention that George Macready and Agnes Moorehead are very good in small roles. There's considerable art and intelligence in The Seventh Cross and a preview of what was to come in Zinnemann's illustrious career.".

	schema:reviewBody "This one caught me by surprise. It seemed rather formulaic at first straightforward propaganda to inspire the people back home in the last years of WWII. But as it progressed it became much more a portrait of German society on the eve of the aggression that started it all. Some elements tended to the melodramatic especially the romance between Tracy and Hasso. I mean come on they're confessing their love for each other after barely spending a few minutes together? Frankly Tracy has never been a favorite of mine in his earlier roles. He always tended toward the selfrighteous the arrogant the visionary with no human frailties.The narration from Ray Collins the first escapee to be caught and killed was also on the corny side. Remember he was the first to die yet he's narrating much of the story. That may have worked in 1944 but today that's pretty dated. There are more effective ways to accomplish the same thing. Moreover the pathos in his voice was also a little over the top.The standout performances here were from Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy as a couple from the working class who are enjoying the benefits of National Socialist largess. Their situation perfectly illustrated how the Nazi social programs kept the German workers happy with subsidies and tax advantages. I'm impressed that a film from 1944 dealt with that in an honest and straightforward manner. In my opinion the standout scene is when the Cronyn returns home after being questioned by the Gestapo and finds Tandy sitting at the table in their apartment. She looks up at him and the look on her face goes from surprise to amazement to joy and then she releases all her pentup emotions and breaks down in uncontrollable sobs as Cronyn tries to comfort her. What a moving moment and what a treat!".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this wonderful little gem on Spencer Tracy day on TCM. I love the actor and have seen many of his movies but I'd never even heard of this one.Other reviewers here have done an excellent job describing the plot. What they haven't mentioned is Tracy's character's emotional flatness at the beginning of the film. Jews in concentration camps described such people as 'Musselmen.' The musselmen  those who lost the will to live and looked like corpses. from the essay Women in Forced Labor Camps by Felicja Karay from  Women in the Holocaust. These were people who had given up on life on hope who were going to die soon. So yeah Tracy probably should have been thinner but this movie takes place in 1938 and Communists got better treatment than Jews in general we know now. That losing the will to live is why the narrator in the film says he got him out of the camp when he did.Watching Tracy slowly regain his humanity as friends like the wonderful Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy and strangers like the terrific Agnes Moorehead help him is very special.It is similar in theme to the very popular relatively new YA novel Markus Zusak's The Book Thief in that both depict good Germans and a Germany where there are some who will do the right thing. Also both show that are some who will not. Both The Book Thief and The Seventh Cross have an interesting narrator device. Because Tracy's character is so detached at the beginning of the film we need the narrator telling us why we are seeing what we are seeing play across his face. I'd never thought of Tracy as a silent actor but in this and in Bad Day at Black Rock he truly is. And a very good one at that.I wish he and Buter Keaton had been in something besides It's a Mad etc... World together. That would have been something! The Seventh Cross is a very good film. Its subject matter and how it's handled its acting and storytelling make it so. Check it out!".

But if you enjoy and interested in seeing a good midWW II propaganda flick this is a really good example. It's well acted with Spencer Tracy in the lead roll with Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy acting as a husband and wife finding out what their new government really is all about. the film takes place in some of the earliest stages of Hitler's control of the country. I thought it was fairly balanced. The represents much of the population caught up in the seemed glory of this new nationalist fervor that seems to be making the country work again after a long depression. It shows what it can be like in country living if fear of the own children neighbors even spouses and lovers. But I really liked the Hume Cronyn character. he initially just wants to enjoy the steady job he now has making machine guns instead of sewing machines and just live his life. He comes to new realization about that. It's tough to have any sympathy for any German living at this time. They shouldn't have allowed this thing to  happen but this does give food for thought on individual behaviors. A good book on the average German shoulder is Blood Red Snow. After you watch this movie. Try the book. Then go to the Holocaust web site. And then you'll see what a difficult subject this is.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently viewed The Seventh Cross for the first time in many years and was favorably impressed both with the level of the acting particularly Tracy and the suspense that the filmmakers were able to generate in telling the story. Even though one suspects that a happy Hollywood ending is in the offing it's a long time in coming  and at times it seems that one's expectations will be unfulfilled.A few historical notesAlthough this is usually classed as World War II film one should keep in mind its chronology. The film was released in 1944 the novel by Anna Seghers on which is was based was published in 1942 and had been written in 194041 the film and novel are set in the fall of 1936 Seghers a German Communist had fled her homeland in 1933 to avoid Nazi persecution and later lived in France and Mexico during the war years.Shortly after Hitler came to power in 1933 the Nazi regime began to imprison thousands of Germans in concentration camps. The inmates included many Jews but most of the prisoners were held not for their ethnicity but for their antiNazi political views. Gradually the Nazis would expand their concentration camp population to include various religious dissidents Gypsies homosexuals and certain common criminals. Although the conditions of these camps were brutal and demeaning the original concentration camps were not intended as extermination camps for Jews and other undesirables. The death camps would not be introduced until late 1941 and 1942.At the time The Seventh Cross is set political dissidents of the center and left still were the dominant type of prisoner found in concentration camps. Seghers based her book on the experiences of other German refugees she met in France in the late '30s but she certainly had no direct knowledge of the concentration camps herself. However by the time her book was published many other accounts of the brutality of the concentration camps had made their way out of Germany and were widely circulated in the Allied nations. There were at least two prePearl Harbor U.S. films that depicted concentration camps  MGM's The Mortal Storm 1940 and Warner Brothers' Underground 1941.There's very little in this film that pertains directly to the Holocaust. By the time MGM got around to releasing The Seventh Cross in 1944 the socalled Final Solution was well underway in Nazioccupied Europe but the horrors of the death camps were not generally known to most people in the United States until Allied troops entered German in the spring of 1945. Seghers was Jewish but her leftist political ideology seems to have dominated her perception of Nazi persecution. Hollywood also was reluctant to focus on Hitler's antiJewish agenda. AntiNazi films made before or after the U.S. entry into the war December 7 941 stressed the antidemocratic nature of Nazism and only occasionally mentioned Hitler's racial theories. Especially prior to Pearl Harbor when many Americans still opposed U.S. involvement in the war the predominantly Jewish studio heads feared that any specific mention of Hitler's antiSemitic policies might be seen as Jewish warmongering. Their fear of being perceived as stressing Jewish interests rather than American priorities in the war carried over after Pearl Harbor.Although many people tend to see World War II movies as all of a type films made toward the latter part of the war including The Seventh Cross tend to be less propagandistic and more thoughtful whether they focus on the war itself or on the causes and ideologies that brought on the war. In some ways The Seventh Cross can be seen as a movie that sought to prepare American and other Allied viewers for the postwar world. There were some people in the Allied nations in 1944 who would just as soon have seen Germany razed to the ground and all Germans of whatever political stripe exterminated or at best reduced to peonage. Although the overt message of The Seventh Cross is the restoration of a man's faith in the goodness of human nature the subtext is that the good German the antiNazi German did exist and was worth saving. The Seventh Cross is no doubt rather dated but the filmmakers do a masterful job in conveying the main character's sense of desperation and helplessness as well as the fears of even the innocent in a police state. In an age when the Nazis have become pop culture comic figures it is good to remind one's self what fascism really means. The Seventh Cross is not a bad reminder.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has often been commented that the Hollywood motion picture got a lot grimmer and bleaker during the years of World War Two as events round the globe and the fact they were being filmed as they happened brought out new cynicism and a willingness to portray the darker side of life. This is after all supposedly how film noir got started. But to a large extent this trend had its beginnings not in the gritty gangster movie but in pictures that dealt with wartime subject matter directly.Although it is set some years before the war began The Seventh Cross is incredibly frank and accurate about the cruel and domineering nature of Nazism. But this is not just some gungho bashtheGermans propaganda piece and nor is it as misanthropic as film noir. Far from it The Seventh Cross dares to suggest unusually for a picture made while the war was in progress that there are many decent thoughtful Germans amongst the bad. It also makes the very good point that what makes a dictatorship work is not just the evil intentions of a small minority but also the naivety and indifference of a great many more people. Predictably the movie removes the direct references to the hero's socialist politics and replaces them with a dose of Christian rhetoric but the story's warm humanist message remains intact.A few problems indeed the picture's only significant problems lie in the structure of the screenplay. Much of the story is told by a voiceover which is not necessarily a bad thing but in this case tends to disarm the on screen narrative. For example Spencer Tracy is effectively mute for the first twenty minutes because the voiceover a different character is doing all his talking for him revealing every thought process but giving us nothing of the man's character. And for a lead role he comes across as disappointingly bland. But perhaps even this fact has a silver lining as it allows all the minor characters  some of them crucial to the overall work despite only having a minute or two of screen time  to shine through.Which makes this a good point to talk about the actors. The Seventh Cross features a bevy of excellent supporting players. Some of these such as Agnes Morehead and Felix Bressart play simple walkon walkoff roles in spite of their stature at the time. But this is in many how it works actors of that calibre are able to make an impression in a short space of time which is exactly what the story requires. Best of the bunch is certainly Hume Cronyn who gives us his usual simple niceguy persona and then shows us what happens when reality comes crashing in. It's a performance with realism dignity and great emotion. As you might guess from the previous paragraph Spencer Tracy is not wellserved by this screenplay and is not called on to do much more than look sullen and mutter the odd word or two. But at least an actor like Tracy can pull that off with some degree of depth and presence whereas a lesser player would have just been wooden.As for director Fred Zinnemann much is often made of his background making documentary shorts but I feel his experience in tense thrillers which many of his early feature were played an equal if not greater part in shaping his approach especially to later gems such as High Noon and Day of the Jackal. As time went on Zinnemann would learn to reconcile the fast pacing of the thriller with his love of beauty and his intensely intimate style the kernels of which can be seen here. The Seventh Cross contains a fair few pointofview shots putting us in the hero's shoes but there are a number of other tricks too. Take for example the scene where Tracy blags is way into town carrying a couple of farming tools. There is a lengthy tracking closeup of his face as he trudges along while the noises of the stormtroopers and the barking of dogs goes on all around. This puts us right there with his fear of being caught and his need to be unobtrusive and has a far stronger psychological impact than if it actually focused on his pursuers.The Seventh Cross is from its opening shot of the row of crosses with a tiny sun trying to peep through the mist an incredibly bleaklooking picture. There is something very painful in seeing the picture's message of hope amid all the darkness and squalor  it emphasises the fragility of that hope and the true desperation of life in Europe at that time. And in some way this is a very Europeanlooking picture. By this I don't mean that it imitates European production styles but that it is very hard to think that the cast and crew would not have set foot outside the US in making it. This is partly thanks to some devoted production design and partly due to the large number of Germanspeaking refugees in bit roles. But it is also in some way down to its portrayal of Nazi Germany as a real place populated by real people  a society that had become sick twisted and nightmarish to live in but one in which could still be found that spark of human decency that can never been extinguished entirely.".

	schema:headline " Decent Movie Offers A Realistic Portrayal Of What Life In Nazi Germany Might Have Been Like";
	schema:reviewBody "Spencer Tracy headlines a fine cast as George Heisler an escapee from a Nazi concentration camp in 1936 who has to depend on help from old friends to make his escape successful all the while not really knowing who he can trust and being actively sought out by the Gestapo. The sense of fear and paranoia that's developed by the movie is quite ominous. Like Heisler as the viewer you can never really be sure who can be trusted. Nazi Germany is portrayed accurately! as a dangerous place unsympathetic to anyone who might be even remotely opposed to the regime. There's a sense of hopelessness here right from the start. Heisler is one of seven escapees  six of whom are quickly recaptured. Heisler himself feels totally alone unsure who to turn to for assistance. He finally connects with an old friend Paul played by Hume Cronyn  whose wife Liesel was played by Jessica Tandy. Not knowing that Heisler is a fugitive Paul and Liesel take him in and as they slowly discover what's going on they become his hope and his lifeline.There are some major weaknesses to this unfortunately which prevent it from being a firstclass film. Tracy's role is unfortunately limited. The first half of the story especially is actually narrated more than acted  the narration being offered by one of Heisler's fellow escapees who died and the movie implies is watching over Heisler as he tries to stay out of the Gestapo's clutches. The movie would have been well advised to have taken better advantage of Tracy's considerable acting talents. The addition of a romance completely out of left field between Heisler and a local waitress in the movie's last half hour seemed bizarre and totally out of place. Probably because of the sudden focus on the quasiromance Heisler's ultimate escape comes across as surprisingly and disappointingly easy and undramatic.Aside from the believable portrayal of the bleakness of life in Nazi Germany the movie is probably most surprising for offering at the same time a rather hopeful portrayal  the point is repeatedly made that not all Germans are soulless Nazis and there are many individual Germans who take great chances to help Heisler. That was a bit surprising to me since the movie was made during the height of World War II in 1944 and as a result one might have expected a more negative portrayal of Germans than was actually offered. This was a good movie  it could have been a great movie if not for the weaknesses I mentioned above.".

Interesting technique of having Ray Collins' character narrate the movie postmortem years before the more famous Sunset Boulevard did it. Spencer Tracy gives a terrific performance even though his character really doesn't speak much especially in the first hour. The supporting cast is excellent with Hume Cronyn a standout.

	schema:headline " Superb historic film with classic acting";
	schema:reviewBody "Several other reviewers discuss the plot of The Seventh Cross and a little bit about Anna Seghers author of the book on which the film is based. My comments will be on some aspects not as much discussed. Most obvious is the historical significance of the book and this movie. The story takes place in 1936 and was written by Seghers in 1940 after she had fled Germany for Mexico. As others noted this is one of a very few films made by Hollywood that mentions concentration camps. The Mortal Storm in 1940 was the first that I can recall. It starred Jimmy Stewart Margaret Sullavan and Robert Young. Seghers is the penname of Netty Reiling a woman of Jewish descent born in 1900. Her home was Mainz which is the place where much of The Seventh Cross takes place. Her Communist background is irrelevant to the story except for two things. First  the prisoners who are the subject of this story had been members of the Communist party in Germany. Communists Catholic priests and political opponents were the first groups to be put into concentration camps by the Nazis. Second  Seghers herself had been arrested by the Gestapo after she wrote her 1932 novel Die Gefhrten The Companions. I don't know any more details about her arrest or imprisonment. She obviously was released by the authorities. But then she waited to flee Germany until after the fall of France to the Germans in late June 1940. From 1933 through 1939 some 475000 Jews had fled Germany. Aside from the interest this bit of information may be to other viewers I mention it because it points to the daring and risk that Anna Seghers took in remaining so long in Germany. Of course had she not done so we may never have gotten the wonderful story she wrote that is the basis of this movie. What Seghers gave us in her book and what the film shows very well was the condition of the German people at that time  around 1936. This is a story about some of the common people. Those who may have been led to believe or hope in the lies and empty promises of the Nazis. It is about a few of those who kept in line on the surface but were willing to fight the Nazis privately. We can see the blind fervor and loyalty of much of the population. And we can see the fear and caution of many. And we can see the toil on human emotions and the human spirit in Spencer Tracy's character after he escapes and struggles to find anyone to help him. A combination of that helplessness and fear is evident also in Jessica Tandy's character as she sits crying and wondering if her husband would return after being taken away by the Gestapo. So this film gives us a good picture of the human condition of the time  the fear by most the despair by many the hopelessness by some. And then we see the ray of hope that Tracy's George Heisler begins to show as one person and then another is willing to help him. We can come to the same conclusion  so long as there are a few people who care and are willing to risk their security and life for others there is hope for mankind. Finally The Seventh Cross stands as a truly great film on acting  the acting profession itself. The performances by every single character are excellent. They show in their actions expressions and words the full range of emotions  believably. Just concentrate on Tracy's Heisler alone. The role has few spoken lines  it may be the fewest of any star in any movie. But we see the slow transformation of that man from fear and despair to hope and optimism  almost entirely in his facial expressions and physical demeanor. Great acting indeed! And The Seventh Cross excels in all its technical aspects as well  script directing lighting cinematography sets and costumes. An excellent thoughtprovoking and entertaining film for all ages and all time. It's a good look at history that we should not forget.".

When the other six men are captured or killed Tracy knows that the entire country will be looking for him so his desperate search for help grows more difficult. Whenever great WW2 films are discussed this one here hardly ever gets mentioned which is a real shame because this film turned out to be a real gem that works on so many levels and once again features a great performance by Tracy. Zinnemann does a great job directing this film and what I loved most is the fact that Tracy's character is under constant threat of being captured and sent back to the camp. Tracy can't trust anyone and must take big risks in trying to reach out for anyone to help him and this here is perfectly captured by the director. There's a tense atmosphere running throughout the film and it's what I'd compare to a feather blowing in the wind. Tracy's performance has him what seems like floating through the air because we can feel the pain and terror in him of being caught. To make matters worse he reaches his hometown where he must try and decide which of his former friends would help him and which would turn him in. Tracy's performance is very deep and intense but it seems as if he is walking on egg shells throughout the film and floating in the air. The way he moves about is something truly amazing to watch. Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy play a husband and wife who Tracy goes to for help. Cronyn nearly steals the film with his flawless performance. The only thing that hinders the film is some of the narration which is a tad bit over the top at times.".

The Stangassingers have two sons Sepp Thomas Reyer from earlier marriage of Thomas and Toni Albert Rueprecht who are both in love with Vevi. When Stangassinger learns that Vevi is going to marry one of his sons he does everything to prevent the marriage knowing that she is his daughter.One of his ideas is bringing in an unmarried girl from a neighboring valley with Christian's help Afra Hanna Hutten who has been abandoned by her unknown mother before and has been raised by Vogelhuber Wastl Witt. She is supposed to marry Sepp.Now in a sinful village title everyone has his share of sins but if you think you can guess the rest there are still some surprises to come. The humour certainly stems from the pairing of Stckel and Aulinger a regular couple in Bauernschwnken of the day but the rle of Christian is beautiful for any comedian and tailormade for Lders.From a modern point of view the story is hopelessly outdated and humour laid on a trifle too thick but still I laughed a lot which was basically due to the burlesque character portraits. Stckel and Aulinger repeat their stage screenplay is based on Max Neal's eponymous play and cinema rles of the first filming in 1940 directed by Stckel as do Brem and Witt. The treatment of human misdemeanors and the resulting mendacity is dealt with in a funny way that had its followers in 1954.Notable are some of the original interiors including the Stangassingers' marital bed sets by Max Mellin and Wolf Englert and the traditional folklore dances which belong to the genre as much as a proper innhouse brawl.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the second of three Count Bobby movies featuring Austrian entertainment legend Peter Alexander as the title character. It came out one year after the first check out my review for that director and writer are the same again it also runs for 1.5 hours again but the action is more about Italy then about France this time. Well.. not really the action is mostly about life on a yacht. The third film is about the Wild West. Anyway in this one here the basically used all the ingredients from the first movie again. Alexander wears drag for a large part of the film and occasionally resembles Otto Waalkes while in drag. There is lots of singing again and it is one big Peter Alexander showpiece. he even stands on stage several times so it's almost like watching his stage program especially with the audience's laughters in the background. I have to say I preferred the music in the first film though. The only memorable song from this sequel for me is Bathtub Tango. One difference compared to the original is that they also included a crime story here. This was made over 50 years ago actually one year before the first James Bond movie so I guess this is what people wanted to see back then. Just like in the first film they used many plays on words including Absatzschwierigkeiten and Schirmherr this time and many more.Vivi Bach did not return from the first film so they needed a new love interest for the main character and they went with Ingeborg Schner this time. The name is correct in my opinion as the brunette looks much better than Bach in my opinion. However the film itself is fairly forgettable just like the first. Really only worth a watch for hardcore fans of Alexander's work.".

Sidney James is underused but still has fun as Gladstone Screwer admittedly an odd nameand the film does feel a little short but Carry on Again Doctor is still very funny and entertaining. Jim Dale does an above decent job taking centre stage as Doctor Nookey with excellent comic timing. Kenneth Williams is great as always and Charles Hawtrey has one of his better outings as Dr Stoppidge allowing to hiss vehemently and bitterly. The locations of the Bautific Islands are very nice and the script is filled with one liners that are witty and hilarious. Plus the slapstick finale is genuinely funny quite possibly one of the funnier finales in the franchise. 810 Bethany Cox".

Model Goldie Locks a fantastic looking Barbara Windsor comes in with only hearts on her breasts and bum and they develop a closer relationship in the hospital. Frederick Carver Kenneth Williams however is getting tired of his to us hilarious mistakes so he sends him to a hospital in Africa run by Gladstone Screwer Sid James.

When he gets back he buys the building that Carver was going to who sends disguised Doctor Ernest Stoppidge Charles Hawtrey to investigate things. Also starring Joan Sims as Ellen Moore Hattie Jacques as Matron Peter Butterworth as Shuffling Patient and Steptoe and Son's Wilfrid Brambell as Mr. Pullen. Filled with great sexy stupid and innuendo gags and a great British cast it is a fantastic Carry On. Carry On films were number 39 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons and this film was number 77 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Windsor's examination. Very good!".

	schema:reviewBody "Although some may beg to differ I find Carry On Again Doctor to be the funniest of the medicalbased in the series. There is more structure to the plot than there was in the earlier Carry On Doctor. The film being divided into three sections works very well as this actually makes it feel as though there is a beginning middle and end of a story.Most of the same actors that were used in Doctor 1967 crop up in this entry some playing almost identical characters others completely different. Jim Dale for instance virtually resurrects his accidentprone but wellmeaning character from 'Doctor' although here he is named Dr. Jim Nookey. Kenneth Williams is as supercilious as always although his character displays more of a sense of humour than usual. Even so he is typically snide and as selfserving as his part in 'Doctor'. Joan Sims proves that when called for she can be sexy and glamorous and it's nice to see her in a role where she isn't pigeonholed in the battleaxe character she would often play. Charles Hawtrey is hilarious in drag Sid James who is not introduced until at least half way through the film is in one of his most unusual roles and Hattie Jacques yet again reprises her familiar role of the Matronthough is more gentle in here conveying a warmth in her character that was absent from her part in 'Doctor'. Then of course we have the bubbly Babara Windsor whose character Goldie Locks quickly catches Jim Dale's roving eye. Their romance provides a nice subplot.Carry On Again Doctor on the whole plays very well. Whilst seemingly settling down as a hospital based comedy the first 15 minutes or so seeming like 'Carry On Doctor 2' the film then wildly steers direction when Dr. Nookey Jim Dale is sent out to the Beatific Islands on a medical mission and discovers a special weightreducing potion. Once back in England he opens a new clinic for women who wish to lose weight. Then the film settles down and sees its last half hour almost encapsulate the feel of a regular TV sitcom with the weight reducing clinic scenes with the likes of Joan Sims and Charles Hawtrey hilariously in drag staying for full treatment.Following on from 'Up The Khyber' and 'Camping' both of which were landmarks in the series this ranks as one of my own favourite Carry On's. The dialogue sparkles along with fast witty dialogue and there are some impeccably timed performances from virtually all of the regular cast  Jim Dale Joan Sims Kenneth Williams Charles Hawtrey Sid James Babara Windsor Hattie Jaques and Patsy Rolands. It generally captures the true spirit of the Carry On's yet somehow stands out as quite a unique entry in the series. Certainly many laughs to endure and is a mustsee for fans. Generally a recommended comedy all round. A classic!Ian Phillips".

	schema:reviewBody "'Again Doctor'  1969  proved to be Jim Dale's last film in the 'Carry On series for twentythree years  he foolishly signed on for 'Columbus' in 1992 . It cast him as the accidentprone but likable 'Dr.Jim Nookey' of Little Hampton hospital a man who cannot so much as use an Xray machine without causing chaos. After losing his girlfriend  the sexy model 'Goldie Locks'  Barbara Windsor  and scaring to death a woman patient afraid of men  he is sent in disgrace to a medical mission in the Beatific Islands run by the seedy Gladstone Screwer  who else but Sid James? . Gladstone has developed a weight reduction formula. Sensing a chance to make money Nookey flies home with some of the stuff. In no time at all he is running a posh clinic in partnership with the rich widow 'Ellen Moore'  Joan Sims . Disgusted by his upswing in fortunes is 'Frederick Carver'  Kenneth Williams  and his sneaky sidekick 'Dr.Walter Stoppage'  Charles Hawtrey . They conspire to bring Nookey down...Talbot Rothwell's script for this movie originated for the rival 'Doctor' series in fact it was to have been 'Doctor In Clover' until Jack Davies came along with another version. Its not as good as 'Nurse' or 'Doctor' but better than 'Matron'. There were some concerns that 'Nookey' was too similar to Leslie Phillips' 'Dr.Tony BurkeGaston Grimsdyke' and that 'Frederick Carver' might strike audiences as James Robertson Justice's 'Sir Lancelot Spratt' by another name. Dale is his usual chirpy self. Yes that really is him in its most famous scene  hurtling down stairs on a trolley while Carver and the Matron  Hattie Jacques  look on in disbelief. This scene was later used as the title sequence to I.T.V.'s 'Carry On Laughing' compilation series. All the regulars  barring Bernard Bresslaw and Kenneth Connor  are present and correct although there's surprisingly little of Peter Butterworth. He's confined to a short scene in which Nookey and a fellow doctor  Peter Gilmore  debate which illness he is suffering from.Things To Look Out For  no its not Babs Windsor's arse  nice though it is!  but a cameo by Wilfrid 'Steptoe' Brambell as a dirty old man called 'Mr.Pullen' who is receiving hormone injections on the N.H.S. and as a result keeps making improper suggestions to nurses. The 'Steptoe  Son' series ended in 1965 but Eric Rogers included a few bars of Ron Grainer's theme  the show would be revived in colour the following year . The party scene features Rogers himself as bandleader. Some of the music was first heard in 'Carry On Spying' and 'Nurse On Wheels'  a Peter Rogers comedy starring Juliet Mills as a district nurse .Funniest moment  Nookey jumps into a hammock in the medical mission only to go crashing through the floor boards!  it was not so funny for Dale though and gave him a back injury he still has to this day!

Watching Carry On Again Doctor gave me a shock roughly in the middle though  speech suddenly disappeared while music and sound effects still could be heard. What could I do but switch to the German dub which happily lasted until the very end but of course isn't the real thing...Update 20080831 the problem is not of the DVD but my player Funai PLF76  depending on how deep I put the earphone plug into its jack I hear either English mono on both sides or English on one and sounds only on the other.

I have liked her a lot since I saw her in an Avengers episode. Jim Dale has a lot of funny stunts during the film and they are all done by him. As he gets into trouble he is sent to a mission in another country and it is run by Sid James. Sid is great as always but his part is cut way too short. Jim takes back a serum that helps take off weight quickly. Sid follows him to get a piece of the profit. Turns out he took the wrong formula and it changes women into men. They all become partners in the end and Jim marries the girl he was pursuing. Solid film but I need more Sid James.".

	schema:reviewBody "Carry on Again Doctor often gets neglected as an inferior rerun of Doctor and this does the film an injustice. Gladstone Screwer is one of Sid James' best roles as he plays a genuine oddity  a man who grew up in isolation on a tropical island and who pursues women not for their beauty or youth but whether they conform to the large tribal buxomness he is accustomed to. He is shocked when Jim Dale's Dr Nookey says he wants a slim girl. There is a wonderful moment where Screwer first sees Hattie Jaques' Matron and gives her a great big whack on the backside. Do you mind?! she demands only to have him brazenly announce As a matter of fact I don't. Sid as a dirty old chubbychaser is more satisfying casting than the usual Sid as pursuer of young women.The film is a satire on slimming crazes and the final 5 minutes are truly perverse. Nookey is making a fortune out of a slimming cure which Gladstone manufactures in and exports from the tropics. Gladstone demands a partnership as does Kenneth Williams' Dr Carver who knows something fishy is going on and when Gladstone is cheated he substitutes another serum for the slimming one. It gives all of Nookey's patients a sexchange! Amongst the victims is Barabra Windsor and the film ends with her marriage to Nookie who complains as they go on their honeymoon that she hasn't shaved that morning. In the crowd we spot Charles Hawtrey looking very knowing and pleased with himself as Dr Stoppage and we realise that he has taken the serum himself and so is now a woman! The clinic is also revealed to be now owned by all of the interested parties.In a way this ending shows us an extraordinary thing. Gladstone Screwer is a gonenative colonial who sends back to England a very unVictorian transformative potential which the kind of medical colony he works in was presumably meant to eradicate abroad  the film claims that polymorphous perversity is an unexpected byproduct of colonial Capitalism. The film sees in a Visionary way how Puritan Capitalism contained the seeds of its own undoing. Yes products were imported from abroad which make the lucky few a lot of money but in the meantime everyone wants their slice of the pie aristocrats  parvenus old money  new mix as both Gladstone and Carver end as partners in the clinic with Nookey and Joan Sims' Lady Moore. What is more old ideals of masculinity and femininity have been forever eroded. That final shot of a man and a woman who are now two men riding away and being waved at by men and women who themselves have no fixed gender is a prophecy we now see being fulfilled around us all of the while.In a couple of hundred years time these strange surreal and perverse films will tell people more about how our 20th Century society worked than many a socalled serious classic.".

It also features the smartest dog in the world he does charades a kick ass song by Cheap Trick and the gorgeous Jennifer Runyon ghostbusters  Charles in charge I don't know which credit is more impressive along with some great race footage and hilarious dialog. This movie is simply much better than it has the right to be.All the people who complain that it is stupid miss the point. Of course it is stupid. Its moronic. Its dumb as dirt. It is also hysterically funny from start to finish. This movie reminds me in many ways of Weekend at Bernies another incredibly goofy movie that if approached in the wrong mood is virtually unwatchable. To avoid injury try not to think.

His cocky brash and freespirited attitude keeps a smile on your face the whole time he's on screen.One of my favorite parts is when Tim is jumped in the parking lot outside of the bar. He's knocked out when his friends find him. They try to get him to come to but then he starts swinging punches and knocks the crap out of one of his friends. When he gets his wits about him he saysthey got you to?  Hard to pick one moment because this film delivers laughs for 90 straight minutes. It's wellwritten and wellacted for the genre.The soundtrack is great outdated but fantastic. This movie doesn't shy away from what it is... an 80's 'B' 'Boobcomedy' as I like to call them. This is one of the best  maybe THE best. Maybe not as nostalgic as Porky's or Animal House but it's still at that level on the comedy meter.Never a dull moment. The fun runs like the river and you'll be hooked from the opening sequence. A true cultclassic that deserves another viewing if it's been a while and if you're a comedy fan whose put off finding this little gem  shame on you.HIGHLY recommended goofball comedy. 84100One of the most soughtafter outofprint VHS to never get a DVD release. These VHS tapesin good shape can go for 2550.".

It's wellwritten and wellacted for the genre.The soundtrack is great outdated but fantastic. This movie doesn't shy away from what it is... an 80's 'B' 'Boobcomedy' as I like to call them. This is one of the best  maybe THE best. Maybe not as nostalgic as Porky's or Animal House but it's still at that level on the comedy meter.Never a dull moment. The fun runs like the river and you'll be hooked from the opening sequence. A true cultclassic that deserves another viewing if it's been a while and if you're a comedy fan whose put off finding this little gem  shame on you.HIGHLY recommended goofball comedy. 84100One of the most soughtafter outofprint VHS to never get a DVD release. These VHS tapesin good shape can go for 2550.";

	schema:reviewBody "When grouping movies like this together a catch all like '80s teen sex comedies or boob comedies or t'na flicks is usually used. More often than not they're labelled as comedies which really seems to be more out of force of habit or courtesy on behalf of the viewer than anything else. I don't know how many times I've watched one of these movies eg. Joysticks Hot Moves Getting It On and have found myself hard pressed to identify a single moment that could be said to approach anything like humour. We assume they're comedies I guess because they're too dumb to be anything else or what is more likely they're carbon copies of other movies  Animal House Porky's Police Academy  that actually were indisputably supposed to be funny whether they were or not.Up the Creek is an exception to this rule. It actually has jokes and I even laughed a few times! That is so rare I can't even tell you. It has the problem a lot of these boob comediest'na flicks have which is that the premise of the movie doesn't actually leave much room for sex or nudity. That's the main reason we watch them right? In this one the typical missmatched group of losers is pitted against the also typical blonde upperclassmen why must they always be blonde? for a race down a river. There's the main guy who smokes thin cigars for no discernible reason and in some shots looks almost exactly like Paul Rudd. There's also of course the nerd and the main guy from Porky's who I always despised but he doesn't do much here to make you hate him one way or the other. I would have preferred if they didn't rely on yet another stock character to round out the bunch the fat guy who can't stop eating. At least he isn't repulsive like the one in Joysticks but come on. Was this ever funny to anyone?The upperclassmen  all four of them blonde  try to cheat using high tech for the time gadgets like exploding darts and remote controlled airplanes that shoot torpedoes. They have the blessing of an older rich man who of course wears his jumper sorry sweater tied around his neck.There is also another group of kooky competitors who are in the movie for comic relief army men with an over eager commanding officer who also like to blow stuff up. They aren't really differentiated from the rich guys in so doing.In the end what you have is a comedy which isn't funny enough to be watched on that merit alone and doesn't have enough boobs to be worthwhile for anyone else but at least I laughed a few times rather than retching horribly as I did with Joysticks.".

I don't know how many times I've watched one of these movies eg. Joysticks Hot Moves Getting It On and have found myself hard pressed to identify a single moment that could be said to approach anything like humour. We assume they're comedies I guess because they're too dumb to be anything else or what is more likely they're carbon copies of other movies  Animal House Porky's Police Academy  that actually were indisputably supposed to be funny whether they were or not.Up the Creek is an exception to this rule. It actually has jokes and I even laughed a few times! That is so rare I can't even tell you. It has the problem a lot of these boob comediest'na flicks have which is that the premise of the movie doesn't actually leave much room for sex or nudity. That's the main reason we watch them right? In this one the typical missmatched group of losers is pitted against the also typical blonde upperclassmen why must they always be blonde? for a race down a river. There's the main guy who smokes thin cigars for no discernible reason and in some shots looks almost exactly like Paul Rudd. There's also of course the nerd and the main guy from Porky's who I always despised but he doesn't do much here to make you hate him one way or the other. I would have preferred if they didn't rely on yet another stock character to round out the bunch the fat guy who can't stop eating. At least he isn't repulsive like the one in Joysticks but come on. Was this ever funny to anyone?The upperclassmen  all four of them blonde  try to cheat using high tech for the time gadgets like exploding darts and remote controlled airplanes that shoot torpedoes. They have the blessing of an older rich man who of course wears his jumper sorry sweater tied around his neck.There is also another group of kooky competitors who are in the movie for comic relief army men with an over eager commanding officer who also like to blow stuff up. They aren't really differentiated from the rich guys in so doing.In the end what you have is a comedy which isn't funny enough to be watched on that merit alone and doesn't have enough boobs to be worthwhile for anyone else but at least I laughed a few times rather than retching horribly as I did with Joysticks.";

They even employed two Animal House alums  Tim Matheson and Stephen Furth Otter and Flounder. It's a raunchy silly comedy where the raft race takes the background to the drinking partying and girlchasing so prevalent in this generation of college party movies.I used to recommend this movie to college guys back in the late80searly90s at the video store knowing they'd be drinking and laughing through the entire thing. This movie was designed for people who were not using their brain cells. It's just a fun movie with very little plot to follow. Grab your beer sit back and let loose. If you're watching this movie for any other reason than listed above you'll be disappointed. VERY similar to Strange Brew and their awesome followers. It's a blast!! I bought this movie a few years ago on DVD when I found out it was available. Thank goodness since I'd already worn out two VHS copies over the years. Now it has JUST been released on BluRay. I'm waiting for my copy in the mail. I do understand there is a new retrospective on the BluRay with some of the cast and casting director. That alone is worth the price. If you love silly stupid early80s TA films with zero plot and just a fun ride this is one of the best of that generation.As a real movie this can't rank more than a 3 or 4 maybe a 5 simply because of the wellknown cast. But as one of my favorite movies of alltime no kidding! I'd rank this a 9 out of 10. Now if Chuck the Dog SPOKE his lines instead of using charades we'd be talking a 10 out of 10. I mean a line has to be drawn somewhere. ".

	schema:headline " Assault on Precinct 13  French Style";
	schema:reviewBody "For some people the words 'French' and 'Action Movie' will do nothing but produce guffaws. Pay no attention they know nothing about the lengthy history of superb French Action Films. The French actually produce some good movies from time to time. They are not all pretentious 'Arthouse' flicks which involve lots of shagging and boring dialogue. JeanPierre Jeunet gave us Delicatessen and 'The City of Lost Children'  he then made 'AlienResurrection' but we forgave him when he delivered 'Amelie'. Then there is Luc Besson who gave us 'Subway' 'Nikita' as a warm up then the fabulous 'Leon' 'The Professional' in the US and the superb 'Fifth Element'. If you check the production companies involved on those last two you will find that they are entirely French only US distributors were involved. Besson has sortof disappeared from movie making for a while concentrating on producing and writing cheapo European action films like 'The Transporter' and 'Taxi' 12 not the lame US remakes. The reason for this lengthy preamble is to point out that not all French films are dull and illustrate the fact that actually the French have a lot to teach a jaded Hollywood in how to make action movies. Which brings me to 'The Nest'. I watched John Carpenter's fantastic 'Assault on Precinct 13' when I was probably 15 and bored one evening. I didn't know anything about Carpenter the film had no recognizable stars and I had no idea what was going to happen. Needless to say the film is excellent. It was the first time in my cinema going life that I felt not just wonder when watching a film but also claustrophobia oppression and genuine fear. 'The Nest' is a total remake of 'Assault'. It doesn't hang about though its setup is maybe a little longer and a smidge widerranging than Assault's introducing three groups of characters so quickly that you genuinely have no idea what they are up to. Sami Naceri the star of the hugely daft Taxi films is best known as a comic actor yet plays successfully against type here why isn't he a star on the same level as Jean Reno by now?Pascal Greggory has the looks and presence of a hitman but is actually a security guard Nadia Fares looks like a catwalk model but utterly convinces as the military enforcer. The lesser characters which isn't really fair as this is a purely ensemble piece of work all inhabit their characters completely their complex relationships spark off believable dialogue that never once slips into clich. It is this commitment to reality that underlines 'The Nest' and makes it so successful. Almost the entire film takes place in a single warehouse which is similar to 'Assault' except that Carpenter's film had a number of locations within the police house. The Nest has three areas  a Boiler room a security desk that has a clear view over the entire warehouse and the warehouse itself. Although this lessens the claustrophobia somewhat it is hugely successful in putting all of our characters in peril at once. Another twist is that in 'Assault' the characters can retreat through to another room of the building. Early on in 'The Nest' it becomes clear that their only area of retreat has already been compromised by the enemy. The warehouse almost becomes a character itself as the film becomes more and more desperate the lights are removed and the shadows glower and threaten. Only bullet holes let in any more light leaving shafts of light to taunt the stars with the hope they may get out of this alive. This realism which isn't entirely there in the plot TBH extends to wounds. A character is shot in the thigh early on in the film and spends the rest of the film limping painfully about. Other characters are injured throughout the events and stay injured they don't suddenly find the ability to fire guns after being shot in the shoulder. This is gritty filmmaking and helps make 'The Nest' so successful. It feels real you don't know what characters are going to make it or not. This leads to genuine tension. We may have seen the story before wounded character stays behind to protect his friends scared character finds the inner strength to confront the enemies head on but its presentation here feels exciting and if not exactly fresh new. Another major lesson that Hollywood should learn from this film is the way it looks. There are some magic shots in here  a standout is an exact remake of Charlie Sheen's airlift from the Jungle in Platoon !  which not only looks great and is genuinely unusual but also adds greatly to our understanding of the character involved. 'The Nest' is not original it is also not high art. It is an extremely solid action picture that is unusually exciting and tense. The director FlorentEmilio Siri conjures up desperation hopelessness and genuine evil from his group of talented character actors as well as successfully recreating Carpenter's feeling of an unstoppable army out to get them. The idea that the villains are insectile and swarming around outside highlighted by the lowlight headgear they all wear is interesting and well illustrated. Siri got the gig directing Bruce Willis in 'Hostage' which is interesting as I would genuinely rate 'The Nest' alongside Willis' 'Die Hard' as examples of how to do an action movie well. It really is that good.".

	schema:headline " Most intense action movie in years";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching THE NEST I was reminded in quite a few ways of DIE HARD which I consider to be the archetypal action movie. Very pure of focus very lean and taught and incredibly intense. It's been a long time since a movie kept me on the edge of my seat like this one.The premise is very simple. A group of special forces soldiers are escorting a mafia head to trial when they're attacked by his men and take refuge in a warehouse. As luck would have it a gang of thieves choose the same night to rob the same warehouse and they get caught in the crossfire.Once the groups of characters are introduced it's not long before the bullets start flying... and flying and flying and flying. It's almost nonstop action for the rest of the film and easily outdoes HARD BOILED for bullet count. I'm sure some people will find this very boring so if intense adrenalininducing action isn't one of your things then skip the rest of this review and the film. The rest of you skip the rest of this review and go rentbuyacquire this film. Hollywood only wishes it could make an action film this pure or this exciting these days.As regards purity since I've mentioned it twice this means that the film focusses on building intense action and doesn't let itself get distracted with other concerns except in a few cases. The characters are given just enough development to let us know who they are and pretty much no back story. One character in particular seems like he must have a story to tell but all we learn is that he was once a fireman. There was surely more to him than that but it's kept a mystery. Maybe that's a good thing but I'd have liked to know a little more. A few times the movie teases you into thinking there's going to be a twist and you say to yourself Ha I see what's coming later but the plot remains refreshingly twistfree. It doesn't need them so it doesn't have them. Pure.It's just a shame that Hollywood's marketing machinery has such an iron grip on the world's cinema distribution that junk like Alien vs Predator will be seen by millions of people and a movie as good as THE NEST will remain inexplicably classed as Indie or Arthouse even in its home country.".

The characters are given just enough development to let us know who they are and pretty much no back story. One character in particular seems like he must have a story to tell but all we learn is that he was once a fireman. There was surely more to him than that but it's kept a mystery. Maybe that's a good thing but I'd have liked to know a little more. A few times the movie teases you into thinking there's going to be a twist and you say to yourself Ha I see what's coming later but the plot remains refreshingly twistfree. It doesn't need them so it doesn't have them. Pure.It's just a shame that Hollywood's marketing machinery has such an iron grip on the world's cinema distribution that junk like Alien vs Predator will be seen by millions of people and a movie as good as THE NEST will remain inexplicably classed as Indie or Arthouse even in its home country.";

Do industry folk believe that foreign action films won't travel well or be able to compete with similar Hollywood product? If so I'm surprised THE NEST didn't change all that. Maybe it went straight to DVD here in the US. Whatever the reason this superior example of tight twisty action filmmaking is worth recommending to anybody interested. Boasting a great plot better than average writing and acting and knockout direction the film involves four sets of peopletwo of them lawbreakers the other two law enforcers whom chance and a little coincidence bring together with frightening violent bloody and surprisingly believable results. Most of the action is confined to one huge warehouse and the director manages to eek out every bit of surprise suspense and clever logistics from this unusual location. I have not seen as good a film of this type since the original Die Hard.An ensemble piece using a terrific group of actors the movie waits until its close to list its cast. I was so involved by the logistics and fast pace that I failed to recognize several of my favorite French actors Benoit Magimel The Piano Teacher The King Dances Pascal Greggory Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train and Sami Bouajila The Adventures of Felix. Director Florent Emilio Siri has a new film coming out next year The Hostage on the basis of his Nest I can't wait.Note the DVD comes in its original French language with English subtitles and with an English dubbed alternativewhich I have heard is badly done. This is NOT a dialogheavy movie most actions films aren't so try it with the subtitles. I didand was hooked from start to finish.".

Nonstop action realistic violence meaning when someone catches a few bullets heshe stays down and the most important thing in an action film good villains with absolutely no conscience.

The one and only rescue attempt made in the truck is put to rest within a matter of seconds in a hail of bullets something you don't see quite often in a typical Hollywood blockbuster.There are no heroes no guns for glory. It simply tells the story of a group of people thrown into the same merde fighting to survive. Whatever remains of the bravado is quickly put to an end as you see how high the odds were stacked against them  the continuous legion of gunmen assaulting the factory in droves.

	schema:headline " A fantastic action film";
	schema:reviewBody "A French action film that more than earns its place in the genre. It pays homage to American action films and the Alien quadrology with its score more reminiscent of a horror than an action film. The plot is simple a gang of excons intend to rob a warehouse of a large stash of IT equipment. A multinational police armed escort of a dangerous Albanian human trafficker interrupt their efforts when they are forced to divert and take refuge in the warehouse after being chased by cohorts of their prisoner who are intent on springing him free. Trapped inside the warehouse the gang and police unite to stave off and survive the external attack from the Albanians.The homage to the Alien films runs throughout from the opening credits where an image of white light holes that we see later during one of the shoot outs merge to form the title of the film as did the light in the universe at the start of 'Alien'. The Albanian thugs clearly represent the alien attackers and wear masks with red lights that reminded me of the cybermen from Dr Who which makes them look like aliens. There are lots of details in the film that seem to echo the Alien films too many to list. One of my favourites is the way the Albanians call to the prisoner and he answers them from within the warehouse much as the alien soldiers call to the queen within the film 'Aliens'. There is also a dominant female lead Inspector Labourie played by Nadia Fares who like Ripley is maternal courageous and ruthless in her quest to survive.What this film brings to the action genre is intelligent imagery and a new brand of antihero. The film's title in French should read as 'Hornets' Nest' and not just 'The Nest'. The film begins with one of its antiheroes Louis relaxing in the sunshine whilst a documentary plays on his TV. The documentary is the story of the 'Tarantula Hawk' wasp which in French is called 'Pepsis Heros'. This wasp is described as being a parasitoid that ensnares Tarantulas as hosts for its larvae to use for food eating the spider alive from within. Pretty gruesome stuff. The imagery is ambiguous because initially one expects the spider to win against the insect but it falls prey. Throughout the film it is not clear who is wasp and who is spider the ambushedtrapped people in the warehouse or the external attackers? Is the danger without the wasp entrapping the spider the Albanians attacking the warehouse or from within where the wasp larvae eating their way out the trapped turning on the attackers? The intelligence in the imagery is that as the film progresses 'good guys' die and their success is uncertain keeping the audience gripped to the last.Of the handful of protagonists there are two antiheroes Louis a warehouse security guard and Santino one of the excon gang who eschews guns for chewing gum and whistling. Both are thoughtful and resourceful yet have an aura of mystery that keeps the audience unsure of them and their allegiances throughout. We see their bravery and their fears as well as their vulnerability to harm and death. Unusual in action heroes of any type.I can't recommend this film enough and although it's great to discover a hidden gem it deserves more accolade than its present IMDb rating gives.".

And the mercenaries always shown wearing the night vision masks are frightfully reminiscent of the pig masked killers in the old classic American Werewolf in London!

Everybody has to fight for their lives. Whoever remembers Carpenter's Assault to Precinct 13 will find certain familiarities in the setup but this is as far as it goes.After the magnificent setup where a few but perfectly staged scenes almost without dialogue used to present the main characters the action begins and does not stop until the movie ends. If you know little about French cinema is very important to note that some of the best actual French actors are in this movie so with such fine acting you will be caring about the characters even when you hardly know them.Siri the director in order to make things more terrifying present the enemy  like a plague using night vision artifacts to cover their faces. Like insects or animals they have no feelings do not talk and kill everything that cross it path.  In an early scene a father and his son two innocent bystanders are killed the kid's murder is only suggested but still proves the point.The action scenes  about 60 of the movie and the FX  are on a par with any good American action flick but in this case the reality coefficient is a lot higher. There are no superheroes Rambos  or Diehards here just people trying to survive and very few of them are able to live by the end. Neither are superfluous romances even when two of the characters are women they are both fighters gratuitous gore or humor well that could be good.Many people will be disappointed by the abrupt end.  The movie ends suddenly but if you analyze the situation subtle spoiler follows outnumbered and with almost no bullets the only other choice by the remaining survivors was to commit suicide.As expressed before even when very well orchestrated action sequences and explosions this movie will hook you more on the dramatic level than in the spectacular.  Probably not commercial as Hollywood films but better done and worth seeing for sure.".

Every action scene is very good shot. The Nest loses some point on the originality. It steals a little from Assault on Precinct 13.

I've experienced fantastic coincidences that if put into fiction would be scorned. And I'm not against a director using a similar idea as another it's the best form of flattery. But I know some would be upset by this apparent double whammy. So be warned.Here's the scene a group of six robbers raid a warehouse to steal computers and such like. Shortly after they get down to their job they're interrupted by a special police armored car that busts into the warehouse because it's being pursued by a large  like I mean very large  group of Albanian Mafiosi who want to bust up that tin car of a car and bust out their Big Boss who's being held prisoner by a small band of reeeeeeel tough cops who just don't see it the mob's way.Well you guessed it the six almost harmless robbers join forces with the special coppers to stand and fight the real bad guys. And all because the coppers want to keep that Big Boss safe to go to court the next day. Stand by your man with a difference...Which of course results in some harsh words and harsh action between the coppers and the robbers at first but as Machiavelli said long ago The enemy of my enemy is my friend. So hell on earth continues for most of the hundred minutes of the story.There are the usual heroics the stock coward who gets his reward and there are those who rise to the occasion in the face of insurmountable odds  particularly the night watchman whose knowledge of the layout provides a crucial turning point in the battle.And what a battle it is I don't know how long it took the special effects guys to set up each scene or partial scene but I reckon the actors had long coffee breaks between takes. There's more than enough action for the freaks in this one. Little wonder Hollywood enticed Siri to direct Hostage a story with a similar again theme of being trapped inside with bad guys outside.The only actor I recognized was Sami Naceri whom I last saw in Taxi a riproaring and blistering ride around the streets of Marseilles. He's a funny guy and worth catching.For me it was quite entertaining and believable while also managing to stay on the better side of parody  despite the six robbers whistling the theme tune from The Magnificent Seven 1960 on the way to the robbery...Recommended for all except the kiddies.P.S. I never liked Assault on Precinct 13 anyway.".

Jason had a very simple relationship with his impossibly wealthy Grandfather Howard Red Stevens. He hated him. No hearttoheart talks no warm fuzzies just cold hard cash. So of course he figured that when Red died the whole reading of the will thing would be another simple cash transaction that his Grandfather's money would allow him to continue living in the lifestyle to which he had become accustomed. But what Red left him was anything but simple. Red instead devised a plan for Jason to experience a crash course on life.

	schema:reviewBody "Jim 'You Don't Have to be Blind to See' Stovall is an inspirational writer who in 2001 published a little book by the name of THE ULTIMATE GIFT in which he transposed many of his motivational teachings into a novel form a story of how a tape of a dying man can alter the life of a crassly moneycentric young grandson leading him through trials and challenges to teach him the meaning of life. Now THE ULTIMATE GIFT comes to the screenDVD and before making the groaning judgment that here is yet another insipid little tale about learning life's lessons and gaining some spirituality in the process try watching this two hour traversal of well acted and well scripted Cheryl McKay and well directed Michael O. Sajbel input. There is a lot more to the film than the grinches might think! A wealthy man Red Stevens James Garner has amassed a fortune turning his personal life into a shambles in the process and producing a family of greedy ruthless gluttons  with one exception one son rebelled and lost his life to dreams despite the aspirations of the father. Red has just died and the will is read by Red's longtime partner and lawyer Ted Bill Cobbs and his devoted assistant Miss Hastings Lee Meriwether the family is outraged at the results of Red's division of his fortune and the one person who is left to learn of the will's content is Red's egocentric grandson Jason Drew Fuller. Through a taped interview just prior to his death Red outlines the twelve lessons Jason must learn if he is to inherit anything. And here begins the episodic journey during which Jason learns about poverty compassion friends death and spirituality that changes Jason into a full human being and creates a character who gives back more than he gets.Along the way Jason encounters workethic Gus Brian Dennehy a little girl Emily dying from leukemia Abigail Breslin whose sharp wit and tongue manifest wisdom that leads to the bonding of Jason and Emily's mother Alexia Ali Hillis and host of other character actors in the various parts of the world where Jason's journey takes him. Yes the plot is predictable and yes the tenor of the piece borders on soap opera at times but the end result is an examination of life that is told with enough fine humor and realistic dialog that it works. If viewers pass by this DVD because they fear it is just another sappy lecture they will miss the pleasure of entering the realm of tender communication delivered with style and sincerity. And we all need that especially now...Grady Harp".

Not that being Christian means that a movie has to be bad  it just usually seems to be the case. Not so much here however. There were just three or four times where I felt my muscles tighten up as I mentally prepared for emotional cheese but to my delight they managed to pull out of it every time without leaving my intelligence insulted. It was a fun and cute story with believable characters and strong performances all around. It was clean enough that you could take the whole family to see it yet interesting enough that the parents will not only stay awake but you'll actually find yourself caught up in a sweet and sometimes tearjerking story about redemption and the pursuit of true joy. Christianthemed films have come a long way and I look forward to what the future holds as they continue to get better. At this point it's safe to say that The Ultimate Gift is among the best in Christian films on the market today. Definitely worth checking out.".

It has a message about a young man who has to find out there is more to life then money that being apart of a family who loves you is the most important thing in life. Finding the ultimate gift is like finding your place in the world what are you here for? What is your purpose? There is an incredible amount of value in this message and it is something people of all ages can learn from. The acting of Abigail Breslin is yet again incredible I think even better then Little Miss Sunshine she completely steals the show. Brian Dennehy is very funny and James Garner is wonderful as well. This movie has all the aspects of a great film sure it's no Godfather but its still and incredible flick. In my showing of the film people where laughing and crying the whole way through Highly recommended.".

It has a message about a young man who has to find out there is more to life then money that being apart of a family who loves you is the most important thing in life. Finding the ultimate gift is like finding your place in the world what are you here for? What is your purpose? There is an incredible amount of value in this message and it is something people of all ages can learn from. The acting of Abigail Breslin is yet again incredible I think even better then Little Miss Sunshine she completely steals the show. Brian Dennehy is very funny and James Garner is wonderful as well. This movie has all the aspects of a great film sure it's no Godfather but its still and incredible flick. In my showing of the film people where laughing and crying the whole way through Highly recommended.";

Drew Fuller Black Sash Charmed and Army Wives was brilliant I think that he really showed his range in the film. Abigail Breslin was great and she and Drew had great chemistry as did Drew and Ali Hillis whose great performance I think was lost in the shuffle.

When Red dies Jason shows up late for the funeral and makes a scene when he does show. But Red has prepared a gift for Jason's inheritance unlike anything he leaves to the rest of the family. Indeed Red leaves the rest of his selfabsorbed and greedy Stevens family merely money. However Jason's gift must be earned and so Jason sets off on the quest. The quest for what Jason initially has no idea. In essence Jason's quest is the quest of the aspiring knight who must slay his dragon to prove he is a man. Consequently some may find the plot contrived or even hackneyed. But as with all fables it is the struggle that matters not the circumstance and what this movie shows is the very real struggle of all young men to find meaning in and a purpose for their lives. For some reason this kind of sentimentality is lately acceptable in war movies but rarely elsewhere. Thus it is refreshing to see in a context if minimal violence. When Jason finally gets his gift he has become a man that Red could be proud of and who can be proud of himself. This is a deeply moving picture and a well constructed one.

An important thing to keep in mind though is that these Fox Faith films are thankfully not preachy.

It isn't perfect but which movie is?? but it has a good story and good family values.SPOILERS FOLLOW. The gifts work for Jason and he becomes a caring person who appreciates the value of hard work and giving back to society. Emily had been in treatment for Lukemia and did not survive.

He was very good in it so I was quite keen to see it. Then I saw that Abigail Breslin was in it and I thought Well I definitely have to see it now! I am so glad I did! It was such a beautiful and heart worming story and Fuller and Breslin are fantastic together. I have always thought it is such a clich when people say Oh this movie made me laugh and it made me cry. But I must say that this film actually did make me laugh here and cry there! I actually think this film is my favourit movie and thats saying a lot seeing as I say I have a lot of favourit films and I am a film student. This is a must see!".

	schema:reviewBody "I regularly attend the 5asermon Church of AMC much to my wife's and kid's consternation. Well today I definitely got my money's worth. I saw the first Sunday showing of The Ultimate Gift at my local AMC here in Northern Virginia and I enjoyed it immensely. It's a great story with a wonderful cast. Big thanks to Fox Faith for getting it to the multiplex.This is an engaging and highly watchable film. In a matter of minutes I was completely immersed in the plot and invested in the characters of the story. While a few where caricatures I could relate to most of them as real people with real problems and blessings.As I was watching Jason learn from the gifts that his grandfather was giving him I couldn't help but think of my own father who is wise and gentle and generous and loving. I'm lucky that he gave me some of these gifts in real life instead of from beyond the grave.All of the performances in this film were rock solid. Big thumbs up to the casting director. Drew Fuller was superb as someone you want to hate but end up liking. The beautiful Ali Hillis also delivered an excellent performance. I expect that her agent will be getting more than a few calls over the next few weeks. Abigail Breslin's performance was likewise outstanding we already know that her agent's phone is ringing off the hook.I encourage anyone taking the time to read my comments to seek out this film. It's really good. If you have kids say 8 or years old and up you should consider taking them to this movie for the lesson it teaches in a highly entertaining way. Younger kids will probably be bored.One more thing  this film may not last long on the big screen. I was in a 100 person auditorium with 2 other people this morning which is kind of sad. I think Fox should have put a little bit more into the publicity machine on this one. I also noted that my local AMC didn't have it on the big board of show times at the box office which I found odd. Perhaps they were trying to kill the movie in its first week due to low sales by purposely keeping it off the marquee. If so that's really a shame because this is quite a nice little film that deserves an audience.cheersSnake".

	schema:headline " Ultimately Disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "Rotten Tomatoe's 33 rating is on the money. I caught a blurb about the film including mini synopsis to wit Grandfather dies and leaves challenges rather than  to his errant playboy grandson. Finally I thought an adult 'coming of age film' with a nice twist and good potential. In the end good potential does not carry the day.This is a faith based film not that there is anything wrong with that where Grand Daddy James Garner has a postmortem plan to make a mensch of his long estranged errant young adult playboy grandson. A plan to instill maturity family values and a large dose of moral clarity. We are not talking about a run of the mill grandson. Rather Jason already has such wealth that he has no problem spending 25000 a night for a Paris hotel room. Hence it is quite understandable that Jason showing little concern storms out of the willprobate office when he learns when Grand Daddy has not left him any outright money in his will.It became obvious early on that viewing this film required that I constantly suspend my disbelief system. When a possible 'future' bequest is mentioned Jason's curiosity takes hold long enough to take first class seat at least he thought it was first class to Texas to pick up the secret  bequest. Upon landing in Texas his hopes are more than dashed. Not only is there no money but he is offered a chance to work for the first time in his life without an inkling of any reward he would actually receive for the work. This awkward setup typifies the problems with this script. It quickly gets worse. First Jason fails to turn right around and head home as we would expect him to do and then he learns the nature of Grand Daddy's first of many 'gifts.'We are to believe that Grand Daddy has spent weeks months or longer fine tuning his plan to transform Jason by a variety of clever nonmoney 'gifts.' The first gift the gift of work will set the tone. Surely it will by some kind of work aimed at building Jason's moral fiber right? Perhaps building homes for the poor a la Jimmie Carter working in a soup kitchen being a hospital volunteer a senior home volunteer andor delivering meals to the ill and elderly? Not at all. This well thought out job requires Jason to awaken daily at 45am for a full month and spend each day at hard labor digging fence post holes on a vast ranch. We are to believe Jason buys into this when he could be savoring that 25000night Paris hotel suite.When Jason takes his girlfriend out for an expensive dinner and his credit card is denied he assumes as any of us would that there was a glitch. His long time gold digging girlfriend should have little choice but to pay the bill. After all Jason's spent countless thousands on her this is his first ever credit card glitch and she has no real reason to believe he is detached from his great wealth. Instead she storms out in a huff and tosses their relationship leaving Jason to deal with the unpaid bill several hundred dollar bill.And quite the immoral lesson that leaves Jason enjoying his several hundred dollar meal without paying a cent while the restaurant owner is stiffed and left to take the loss.How exactly are Grand Daddy's cronies able to instantly turn very wealthy Jason into a penniless propertyless Jason? Gone in the bat of an eye are all his cars property money etc. Another lesson at the expense of legalities? I loved Emily as Little Sunshine but scripts that have young kids endlessly playing 12 going on 30 bug me. As did Emily's incessant lecturing to Jason vis a vis This is how your love life is going to be....DO YOU HEAR ME JASON....DO YOU HEAR ME?As for Jason and Emily's mom Alexia there is little chemistry in this equation which is consistent with our inability to determine what if any feelings they have for one another during most of the movie.Jason stumbles forward always with little or no real incentive. When he needs a place to stay for the night he cannot find even one of his scores upon scores of hanger on friends willing to 'invest' even a single night on the very real assumption that Jason will bounce back and quickly be reunited with his fortune. And what a great investment that living room sofa for the night would have been!There are billions of reasons to stay tuned for Ultimate Gift 2 Jason  the Lure of the Green Poultice.".

It's about a valley that because of its inaccessibility escapes some of the ravages of that very brutal conflict.17th century Europe was the century of the great religious conflicts between Catholic and the many Protestant faiths. The Catholic Hapsburg Holy Roman Empire was gradually losing its grip on more and more of the various little domains that made up their empire. More rulers and the populations of those small kingdoms were converting to either Lutheranism or Calvinism. Of course the rest of Europe was concerned as to who would come out on top and from 1617 when the conflict first started Denmark Sweden Poland France Spain just about everybody got involved one way or another. Religion was the key factor but hardly the only one. France because her prime minister Cardinal Richelieu feared the Hapsburgs more than Protestantism allied themselves with the Protestant rulers.The war itself was fought mostly in Germany not Germany the nation but Germany the geographical expression just a place where the German language predominated. The German people weak and disunited were just prey for the other invading powers.The looting and pillaging you see here is exactly what was going on in 1641 when scholar Omar Sharif who had lost his entire family and home to the war is now reduced to being a wandering beggar and stumbles into this valley which has escaped the struggle. Unfortunately following him in is Michael Caine with a company of mercenaries. But Sharif talks Caine into doing winter quarters there instead of just sacking the place and moving on as per the norm for the day. An uneasy alliance is formed between Sharif Caine and his soldiers head honcho in the town Nigel Davenport and priest Per Oscarsson.The peasants here are hardly a noble lot Sharif's very education makes him a figure of suspicion. Yet they're just ordinary folks trying to survive in a world that they must think is coming to an end. It would have not been out of the ordinary for them to believe that what they were seeing was Armegeddon. The Thirty Years War is not something that is taught in American schools. I think because the United Kingdom was not involved in it. they had a nice struggle going between the crown and Parliament in the first half of that century and what became the original thirteen colonies of America were all being settled by various immigrant groups. The Last Valley is a tremendous educational tool for anyone teaching European history. We don't see any of the great figures of the war what we do see is a glimpse into the peasant life of the period that once seen is unforgettable.James Clavell who later wrote and directed Oriental epics like Shogun and Taipan wrote and directed The Last Valley. He and the rest of the cast and crew should be proud of being involved in a cinema masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " Whoa!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was at the store and spied this unknown 1971 flick amongst the DVDs it looked like my kind of movie especially with Michael Caine and Omar Sharif so I naturally wondered why I had never heard of it. I made a mental note to check out some reviews on the internet. The acrosstheboard high ratings piqued my interest so I decided to pick it up the next time I saw it.The first thing that made a favorable impression was the outstanding opening credits sequence. Many reviewers mention John Barry's magnificent score as a highlight and they're right. This credits sequence innovatingly depicts the theme of the Thirty Years War  members of essentially the same religion at each other's throats.THE STORY During the horrible Thirty Years War in Europe 16181648 a band of mercenaries led by the merciless Michael Caine The Captain and a drifter attempting to flee the horrors of the war discover a hidden vale  the last valley untouched by the war. The drifter talks The Captain into wintering in the peaceful valley rather than pillaging it and rapingkilling the villagers. This setup itself is a hint that this is no ordinary war flick.WHAT WORKS Parts of the film have a dreamy surreal atmosphere particularly the beginning and ending this is reminiscent of the incomparable Apocalypse Now. Michael Caine is outstanding as The Captain a character so hardened by the horrors of war that he no longer even has a name he's just The Captain. Caine would perform a similar role in the underrated The Eagle Has Landed in 1977 a stunning performance. The Captain's answer to everything was to simply kill but now in the valley he has found peace and the warmth of love. Omar Sharif also perfectly depicts the disillusioned drifter Vogel his reaction to the horrors of war has always been to run but in the valley he also finds peace and love and even  maybe  a family? The depth and ultraseriousness of the story including the dialogue of the characters touching on issues of war loss God religion ignorance superstitions love hope loyalty duty redemption etc. truly separate this pic from an ordinary waradventure yarn.It's also very interesting to observe how people lived in a regular hamlet 400 years ago in backwoods Europe. It was not unusual for people back then in such circumstances to live their entire lives within 10 miles or so from where they were born. Such people would likely be undereducated superstitious innocent ignorant and narrowminded all at the same time and the film realistically portrays this.WHAT DOESN'T WORK There are parts of the film that aren't pulled off very well. Some of the dramatic stagings and dialogue come off awkward here and there. These aspects perhaps needed more finetuning and this explains why critics originally panned the movie and why it fell into obscurity for thirty years a fitting curse for being the only movie to ever address the Thirty Years War eh?.Some have criticized the film for being antichurch or even antiGod. Actually the film's about the pursuit of God truth love and happiness in the face of the ultimate horror  war. And not just any war a war that lasted three decades wherein innocent civilians  men women children  family members  were needlessly slaughtered. The repugnance and terror of war caused The Captain to become a ruthless atheist as he declares in one potent scene and tore the heart out of Vogel as revealed in another. But the last valley untouched by the neverending conflict has given them both hope again.SPOILER ALERT Originally The Captain was going to slay Vogel as soon as he met him but after wintering in the valley he sets Vogel up as the leader while he leaves to attend to the business of war. He obviously had a change of heart concerning Vogel. In any event he returns to the vale wounded his only sanctuary from the evils of battle and plague. His dying words to Vogel are Vogel if you find God tell him we created... He was no longer an atheist in the strictest sense he now even hoped their was a Creator and WANTED Vogel to find truth love  happiness. But it was too late for him. Or maybe not? END SPOILER FINAL ANALYSIS Despite the obvious flaws the film gets a huge 'A' for effort in my book. The Last Valley is a special picture. It successfully creates a small world of people some 400 years ago in a secluded vale in the paradisical wilderness of the Alps. A world you can get lost in for 2 hours. The originality of the story and its inherent profundities not to mention the fine cast performances and surreal aspects lift the film above a simple adventure yarn. It's unorthodox enlightening thoughtprovoking and ultimately moving. If you enjoy films like Apocalypse Now and Runaway Train films that boldly attempt to go far deeper than the runofthemill actionadventure flick then be sure to check out The Last Valley. You won't be disappointed. In addition it's a film you'll continue to glean from in future viewings. But since this is a dialoguedriven picture be sure to use the subtitles so you can understand the heavily accented dialogue. You'll get much more out of it.GRADE A".

	onyx:emotionText "I was at the store and spied this unknown 1971 flick amongst the DVDs it looked like my kind of movie especially with Michael Caine and Omar Sharif so I naturally wondered why I had never heard of it. I made a mental note to check out some reviews on the internet. The acrosstheboard high ratings piqued my interest so I decided to pick it up the next time I saw it.The first thing that made a favorable impression was the outstanding opening credits sequence. Many reviewers mention John Barry's magnificent score as a highlight and they're right. This credits sequence innovatingly depicts the theme of the Thirty Years War  members of essentially the same religion at each other's throats.THE STORY During the horrible Thirty Years War in Europe 16181648 a band of mercenaries led by the merciless Michael Caine The Captain and a drifter attempting to flee the horrors of the war discover a hidden vale  the last valley untouched by the war. The drifter talks The Captain into wintering in the peaceful valley rather than pillaging it and rapingkilling the villagers. This setup itself is a hint that this is no ordinary war flick.WHAT WORKS Parts of the film have a dreamy surreal atmosphere particularly the beginning and ending this is reminiscent of the incomparable Apocalypse Now. Michael Caine is outstanding as The Captain a character so hardened by the horrors of war that he no longer even has a name he's just The Captain. Caine would perform a similar role in the underrated The Eagle Has Landed in 1977 a stunning performance. The Captain's answer to everything was to simply kill but now in the valley he has found peace and the warmth of love. Omar Sharif also perfectly depicts the disillusioned drifter Vogel his reaction to the horrors of war has always been to run but in the valley he also finds peace and love and even  maybe  a family? The depth and ultraseriousness of the story including the dialogue of the characters touching on issues of war loss God religion ignorance superstitions love hope loyalty duty redemption etc. truly separate this pic from an ordinary waradventure yarn.It's also very interesting to observe how people lived in a regular hamlet 400 years ago in backwoods Europe.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie made during a time when writers novelists like Clavell and Crichton were allowed to make their own films. What you have are literate probing plots and stories sometimes failed by low budgets orlack of experience. With LAST VALLEY there's an otherworldly quality to Clavell's work steepled in strict historical fact Clavell postulates a fantasy valley where humans live hidden from the brutality and horror of war they are genetic angels of a sort but those in control are wise to the ways of a world ruled by knife. A band of soldiers lacking a country orhome to call their home caught in the hurricane of this war stumble into a seeming Elysian Fields and begin to infect it with pragmatic survival and certain doom. The ways of human beings as a mass descend on the slightpopulated community.People criticize the film as dark equating realism. Fact is Clavell shows a contrast between the world Michael Caine as the Captain knows and is scarred by and the hidden land in which beautiful women and children are protected fed and safe. Caine's Captain has been a wanton butcher in the war the murderer of women and children. Yet he only understands the quality of this paradise after he has nearly destroyed it.The most telling sequences are those in which these men from outside the hidden land knowing the damage they are causing to this one place where beautiful women can live unraped and men as equals are forced to leave. The women in love with them wish to accompany them into the horror the men know. Caine in particular leaves his lover under a false sense of security believing she will be safe. His heartbreaking understanding of this woman's loyalty to him bred in her by a hidden land where love can be expressed devoid of force and tragedy comes only in the end his last touch with this lover is with a glove made of armor outfitted for the killing he will do once he leaves the valley and rejoins the war.There is probably the great performance of Caine's career up on screen in this film. Outside of GET CARTER you'll never see Caine inhabit a role more fully. Even if the scope of the story gets away from Clavell at the end and could have benefitted from the expanded format of SHOGUN say this is a bigtime view of a great actor in Caine and a literate script from Clavell that will without doubt remain fixed in the mind.".

The acting the action the atmosphere the camera work and the sublime scenery that surrounds the village is enough to make you want to book yourselves a ticket to Bavaria or Austria. The captain Michael Cain is a tragic hero. He's a man who has been shaped by the war and turned in to a brutal and ruthless soldier who has the respect of the men that follow him and eventually the locals. The Last Valley is a sophisticated war movie and a real treat for all you intellectuals who love European history. Why this film is so hard to find I will never know but once you discover it you will immediately fall in love.The fact that I can not find a bad comment on IMDb about this movie should speak volumes to those of you who are still deciding whether to go and rent or buy this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vogel a teacher treks through early 17th Century Germany . Stopping at a village it comes under attack by a mercenary force . Narrowly escaping with his life he comes across a village in a valley  Resting there he awakens only to find himself captured by the mercenary band . He is given two days to negotiate with the village elders and the villagers and mercenaries come to an uneasy alliance I first saw this movie perhaps as much as 30 years ago and despite forgetting its title do remember the cast names and the amount of violence it contained . This is a relatively brutal and violent film for its era  not so much gory but containing a brooding and nihilistic mood  worthy of the time its set in . I had little knowledge of the 30 Years War so had a quick look on Wikipedia and was shocked that it had as many as 8000000 casualties . The Great War of 191418 led to 10 million war deaths but you've got to put this in to perspective that war involved of millions of combatants from standing armies armed with the most effective weapons of slaughter ever devised at that point in human history . It says a lot about the horrors of the 30 Years Wars if millions of people were being killed by personal weapons like axes and swords . Worse too was the fact that no matter what none of the sides fighting would appeal to anyone on the side of secular democracy or humanism What this film does very well is point this fact out with the mercenary band led by the unnamed Captain being very pragmatic and ulterior because to give in to religious dogma would be to spell disaster though this doesn't make his character any nicer . Of course this means you're watching it from a 20th Century viewpoint with the voice of reason of Vogel being far too reasonable and anachronistic to be an entirely credible character from the period but it does paint a grim picture of the past with plague  famine feudalism and worst of all religious conflict blighting civilisation and I wonder how many people watching this film in 2013 were constantly reminded of Afghanistan ? As we all know Michael Caine has a very checkered career but 1971 was something of a vintage year for him with GET CARTER released at the same time . We don't get Caine's grating cockney tones and whilst his Germanic accent sounds more Dutch than German it never falls in to parody which is what easily could have happened . The supporting cast are also more than competent featuring a host of well known Brits like Davenport  Blessed  Gothard  Hogg  Shepard and Hallem but the stand out performance is Swedish actor Pers Oscarsson as Father Sebastian whose dogma is always in conflict against the pragmatic unbelieving Captain and it's this abrasive character interaction that makes the movie a must watch Some things don't work entirely and the story has a rather strange structure where a power strugglerevenge subplot that should be the natural climax taking place far sooner than it should . Indeed my memory cheated on this point and thought this where was the film ended on my first viewing of it . There's also a relatively unnecessary subplot about witchcraft but upon rewatching the film  This movie demands to be seen more than once  was slightly startled that perhaps this character may indeed have had second sight and might not have been an unnecessary subplot . But these are minor problems and apart from the excellent cast  intelligent subtext we also have fine cinematography alongside a haunting score from John Barry in a film that strangely flopped when it was released in 1971 and appears on TV stations very rarely".

It stars Omar Shariff as a wanderer who happens upon this idyllic valley hidden from the rest of the world and a bearded but still handsome Michael Caine as the head of a bunch of mercenaries who've seen their share of fighting and massacre.James Bond composer John Barry does the score and there's an early prototype of Moonraker's Space March as the main war theme though Space March is more melodic to my ears. I know Barry can do no wrong supposedly but it does seem to be that he and Bond were a perfect match. In other films his signature style is often distracting and the romantic theme of this film used repetitively and sometimes inappropriately is intrusive and pretty corny.Caine has an early protype too  the Ve ALL love you Freddie German accent he would adopt 15 years later in the comedy Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. It's pretty iffy and unintentionally comic at times he's the only one who bothers with a German accent perhaps to take away the London wideboy. You're only supposed to sack the bloody church! The film didn't quite grab me. For a start it's odd that Omar Shariff should be fleeing a plague pit and soldiers for only 2 minutes before stumbling upon this idyll. The valley doesn't seem too hidden to me and if it is how come the other soldiers found it at the same time? The happy and lovely aspects of the village passed me by as the inhabitants  especially the women  had that neurotic German temper and look characteristic of the Luthran era if you believe historian Kenneth Clark's take on it. The Lost Horizon did all this much better.Still it's a noble and unusual idea just let down by unintentionally risble moments. It only really picks up when there's a bit of discord which runs counter to the film's message.".

Michael Caine gives a very good performance as an the captain an authoritative and detached veteran of bloody war burned out and ready to embrace a better way of life when he finds the idyllic little valley. I should say mostly ready because the plot revolves around his dilemma of violent and ugly past vs. potentially pacific future. Omar Sheriff is very good as the scholar who carries a passion for a better world being the source of encouragement to the captain's yearning for what the valley represents.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a rather under looked interesting and powerful film. The movie takes place during the Thirty Years War as it rages through 17thcentury Germany. The Last Valley indeed is an oasis of peace a hidden valley protected from the outside world's wars and plagues. However all of this changes when Vogel a onetime school teacher now on the run played by Omar Sharif and his gigantic dark and deep and eyes wanders into the peaceful valley. It doesn't take much longer until Michael Caine's ragtag and exhausted army arrives as well.To me the film's strong point is the pairing of Caine as the fierce captain and Sharif as the philosopher type. For instance one of the film's most stunning sequences is one in which Sharif tells of losing his entire family and home at Magdeburg. Caine's response is quite fascinating as he goes on about the war and his own personal touch he gave to Magdeburg and how such violence and pillage was a response to such event occurring to one of his towns or cities or valleys. I was born in war. The other fascinating idea that the movie dwells on is the subject of religion religious fanaticism and witchcraft. Yes you read that right...with craft.You see good old Sharif talks Caine into doing winter quarters in the valley instead of just sacking the place and moving on as per the norm. An uneasy alliance is formed between Sharif Caine and his soldiers the head honcho in the town Nigel Davenport and the local Catholic Priest priest. Per Oscarsson Part of the uneasy alliance apparently consists of the local women sleeping with Caine's mercenaries..including one such blond virgin Madeleine Hinde who apparently will have a free ticket into heaven if she does the good deed. Or that is what the Priest claims. Blind religion for it's own sake. Vogel and the Captain you see are above the religious controversies that come to the forefront throughout the film they are presented to the audience as freethinkers at every opportunity the former is a humanist the latter a cynic.Perhaps one of the strongest scenes of the film is the sequence in which the brunette beauty Erica Florinda Bolkan  whom Caine's character won in a dice game religious allegiances are uncovered. You see she is revealed to be a practicing Satanist and such doesn't go over very well in the village. QUOTE But you have taken the Holy Sacrament all your life. I took nothing more than a piece of bread and a sip of wine.All in all the film clearly depicts the realism of war and fanaticism. It delves into what is the best in humanity and abhors that to which is our worst.Great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superficially about the 30 years war in Europe in the early part of 17th century this insightful film portrays much about human personality and relationships. Much of human thought is influenced by thought disorder loose associations and delusions. This thought disorder often goes unrecognized as it is shared by many others and thus regarded as realitybased. The people in this film except for the main characters of the Captain village leader and wandering teacher are a study in this human tendency to construct ideas based on thought disorder. This makes for a more fascinating film that adds to the enjoyment of the fine story depicted. Caine's laid back performance is brilliant. Sharif does his Dr. Zhivago thing as modified to fit this story. This is a classic that one can enjoy in repeted viewing every 5 to 10 years.".

This thought disorder often goes unrecognized as it is shared by many others and thus regarded as realitybased. The people in this film except for the main characters of the Captain village leader and wandering teacher are a study in this human tendency to construct ideas based on thought disorder. This makes for a more fascinating film that adds to the enjoyment of the fine story depicted. Caine's laid back performance is brilliant. Sharif does his Dr. Zhivago thing as modified to fit this story. This is a classic that one can enjoy in repeted viewing every 5 to 10 years.";

A man who has seen too much killing yet has retained some of his humanity. This film is a great study of the political and religious impact of warfare and the complex relationships between the social classes as a result. The screenplay tackles bigotry and religious issues in a way that few films if any had before it. This movie was ahead of it's time and is accompanied by a beautiful film score by John Barry. A rich rewarding movie worthy of repeat viewing and a great history lesson from a little known period of European history.".

I can only assume that this review was made by someone they normally send to see Jim Carrey films as it's inconceivable to me that anyone who appreciates intelligent cinema of this era would not be impressed by this totally neglected film. Following the similarly excellent Play Dirty of two years earlier Caine and Davenport combine again in war time this time the 30 Years War instead of WW2 to produce an ethereal yet at the same time disturbing impression of civil war in early 17th century Europe.Caine and his band of soldiers arrive in a secluded valley that appears untouched by the surrounding war miraculously so in fact. The inhabitants attribute this blessing to a shrine of the Virgin Mary at the top of the valley which the protestant element in Caine's troop want removed. This in turn inflames religious tensions within the troop as interestingly the soldiers come from both sides of the religious divide around which the war initially started and internecine warfare ensues. Thrown in with this are the peasants who though apparently Catholic appear to have no great allegiance to any side and merely want to be left alone. As a background to this Omar Shariff provides the quasi mystical presence of the philosopher who like Caine is haunted by the destruction of his home city though for different reasons to Caine who was part of the army responsible. Regardless Shariff's character remains loyal to the Captain with transcendental grace.My first impression was that the director had just seen The Devils but in fact this film was made before that. Having said this if you take away the period and religious content the feel is perhaps closer to something like Once Upon a Time in the West in terms of music and cinematography with the latter serving to enhance the heavenly quality the valley is clearly meant to possess. I also thought of Aguirre Wrath of God but again I believe that was later. All in all then a much neglected effort.".

Behind him come a band of soldiersmercenaries led by The Captain Michael Caine. They decide to settle there in this land of plenty and ride out the winter forcing themselves onto the villagers. Vogel becomes a middle man a somewhat of an enlightened neutral observer not too far on either side between the soldiers and the villagers. The film I feel is really about pointing out the pointlessness and evils of both war and religion. Its shows how religion makes men do insane and inhumane things that they'd usually never do and hence causes war and that ultimately nobody really wins. In fact I'd say this film makes one of the strongest atheist statements I've ever seen on film. The acting is top notch by both Michael Caine and Omar SHarif. The filming was done in Austria in Tyrol which provides for stunning scenery which they take full advantage of in the film. John Barry known much better for his work on the Bond franchise has done one of his works of all in this film. You can still hear hints of that strong brass section that has become so associated with Bond ripple through the main theme. Good film well worth the watch.".

Smith delivers a flawless comedy performance that ironically won her her second Oscar this time for Best Supporting Actress. Caiine is just as effective in this bittersweet tale. Visitors from New York stars Jane Fonda as a workaholic New Yorker who has flown to California to retrieve her daughter Dana Plato who flew away from home to move in with Fonda's ex Alan Alda. Fonda's character is a little on the unsympathetic side but she and Alda make their scenes work. Visitors from Philadelphia stars Walter Matthau as a man in town for a convention who tries to conceal from his visiting wife Elaine May that there's a passed out hooker in his bed. This episode is pure slapstick with little substance but Matthau makes it bearable. The other episode Visitors from Chicago stars Bill Cosby Richard Pryor Sheila Frazier and Gloria Gifford as two couples vacationing together who get involved in some silly travel situations. This is definitely the weakest of the four playlets and looks like it should be in another movie of its own. A wellmounted but spotty effort at best California SUITE is worth the rental for the glorious performance of Maggie Smith alone.".

Yes her segment is perhaps stripped down just the age old EastWest Coast argument but it becomes a very human story about 2 people who were once in love. So great to see such a female character like hers on the screen and Jane Fonda is so skilled at introducing pathos whilst still being able to somewhat distance the viewer. It really is ultimately a very touching episode. The CaineSmith segment is also tremendous fun with Dame Maggie doing her Margo Channing bit. The Oscar she won for this tributes her comic skills here which have perhaps been underused in her career. The wonderful Elaine May also stands out in a true farce with Mr Matthau but The PryorCosby section is plainly embarrassingly bad. It feels as if it was written by a poor sitcom writer and there are enoguh embarrassing sitcoms from America polluting the world's television.

I must say though that Michael Caine and Maggie Smith did great work. They are a nice couple and really fit together very well. In my opinion their scenes are the best of the movie. I love their funny and sarcastic conversations  it's entertaining and one of the reasons I actually watched the movie until the end. I'm just a little disappointed that they don't show up as often as I'd like. It would've been more interesting that way. Of course there are lots of other big names in that movie e.g. Walter Matthau Alan Alda and Jane Fonda but I must really underline Maggie Smith's and Michael Caine's good performances.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite a talented allstar cast California Suite which was based on a hit Neil Simon play is a wildly uneven film. The episodic story traces several unrelated couples from across the U.S. that check into a Beverly Hills hotel. Like a comedic Grand Hotel the film cuts between the stories although the editing makes no comments ironic or otherwise between the episodes. Actually the often foolish selfcentered characters make California Suite more a Ship of Fools in the sunshine than a Grand Hotel under the palms. The original play was a followup to the more successful Plaza Suite and demonstrated Simon's shakier take on the West Coast than on the East. For the most part the hotel guests speak and behave like the transplanted or visiting New Yorkers that they are.Jane Fonda portrays the ultimate New York snob and her bitchy banter with exhusband Alan Alda only underscores her arrogance and intolerance of anything that exists west of the Hudson. Alda is a New Yorker's stereotype of a Californian with pastel sweaters and perpetual tan. While a few amusing lines pass between the terminally mismatched couple Fonda and Alda's episode is more grating than funny. However the New York couple display NoelCoward wit in comparison to the wasted talents and misfires in the scenes that involve Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby as vacationing doctors. The premise of two couples that arrive to find a reservation for only one has promise. However director Herbert Ross should have studied Chaplin Keaton and Lloyd before he devised the broad unfunny physical stunts that will leave viewers grateful that both Pryor and Cosby survived the mess and moved on to better material.However the film does have some fine moments between comedic experts Walter Matthau and Elaine May. When Matthau arrives in LA a day early his brother surprises him with a prostitute who passes out from too much tequila and cannot be awakened in the morning. Of course Matthau's wife the alwaysdelicious Elaine May arrives and the comedy moves into high gear. The best episode in the film however involves an English actress Maggie Smith and her bisexual husband Michael Caine. The couple arrives to attend the Academy Awards because Smith is a Best Actress nominee. While Smith has some of the bestwritten lines in the film her role also has a depth and poignancy that goes far beyond the cardboard characters in the other episodes. Although Caine is equally fine Smith's role is showier and she won a deserved Academy Award for the part. The film's special irony is that the part of an Oscarlosingactress won an Oscar for the actress who played her.California Suite is one of those films in which a few superior scenes make it worthy entertainment and the SmithCaine episode pulls the film several notches higher than it otherwise deserves. Add the sparkling MatthauMay scenes and there is at least onehalf of a good movie. Although the FondaAlda episode is bearable and occasionally amusing the PryorCosby scenes are often labored and unfunny. However with a strong finger on the fastforward button there is a good hour of comedy and fine performances to be had in this inconsistent film.".

Walter Matthau stars as Marvin Michaels from Philadelphia who's sex crazed brother Harry Michaels has set him up with a high priced hooker prior to his wife's arrival. Finally there's Chauncey Gump Richard Prior and Willis Panama Bill Cosby two Dr.'s and their wives who arrive from Chicago and immediately start bickering over accommodations. Alda and Fonda are great as former married partners. Neil Simon gave them extremely good lines of dialog and it makes for a firm Tatate conversation. From Simon also came the rapid rapier exchange between Maggi Smith and Michael Caine. The playwright also created a superb character in Walter Mattau as he portrays a helpless husband before his accusing wife. It is with laughter that Prior and Cosby are able to create such antics as to leave the hotel with a promise of revenge on their inlaws.

You think it sounds interesting or you think it's a riot. To say this is a complete success in entertainment would be stretching a bit...almost a lot. Right off the bat Alda and Fonda start in going back and forth on the past and Fonda is so antagonistic it's almost unbearable to even get through their skit. It lasts over 10 minutes. Walter Matthau's skit gets a little old as he tries to hide the body of a passed out hooker from his wife who's he's expecting any minute. He overslept of course. But Elaine May is good in a memorable role.Cosby and Pryor's story actually starts with interest but tires with their constant griping and by the end of the movie all of their fun ideas have turned into broken bones bruises and casts. You get the feeling that black viewers would be offended by the way these characters are portrayed.The only saving grace is Caine and Smith who ironically was so good in this otherwise blah movie she not only received an Oscar nomination but she won. But she is great in everything so is Caine. They should have scrapped the rest of the footage and made a short film of just these great actors. Those who watch this for them especially Maggie will enjoy their performances. But will otherwise be bored stiff.Those who watch this for Matthau will be minimally pleased. Those who watch this for Cosby and Pryor will be insulted or just plain disappointed of the waste of their talents or BOTH. Those who watch this Fonda or Alda will be talked to death.Nevertheless I have to give Caine and Smith two thumbs up or two stars each. Therefore it gets a 4 out of 10 from me.But if you're in a town where there's a California Suite run don't walk to an Economy Lodge.".

Anyway Michael Caine  Maggie Smith play a rather disjointed couple coming from New York to attend The Oscars. Jane Fonda  Alan Alda are no longer together argue constantly about custody of their daughter. Bill Cosby  Richard Pryor's wives come to play tennis and chill but chaos ensues when they find out there is only one room vacant. Walter Matthau has too much to drink and sleeps with a prostitute. The stories are all interesting enough but none of them are all that dynamic. Matthau has some great comic sequences but i'd have to say Cosby  Pryor were the least interesting. It wasn't all that funny. The best is a tie between Caine  Smith's and Fonda  Alda. If it wasn't for a cast this would have been very mediocre. 610".

	schema:headline " Four separate stories from the mind of Neil Simon";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1971 the movie Plaza Suite was written by playwright Neil Simon. It featured three separate stories that all took place in that famous hotel in New York. In 1978 Simon did it again with California Suite. This one has four separate stories and takes place at the lush Beverly Hills Hotel. I prefer California Suite over Plaza Suite because I think it's funnier and has an allstar cast. Jane Fonda and Alan Alda star in the first segment which is the only weak part of the film. Fonda and Alda play a divorced couple from New York who debate on who gets to keep their teenage daughter. This portion of the film is more serious than funny and in the process doesn't really work. Fonda and Alda give good performances but I was mostly bored with this story. The second segment is far and away the best part of the film. Maggie Smith and Michael Caine play bickering Brits in town for the Academy Awards. Smith plays an actress who's nominated for an Oscar and Caine is her companion. These two great British actors play off each other beautifully and what a honor to watch them at work. I would have liked to see more of this part of the film. It's wonderful and very funny. Interestingly enough Smith won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role her. Isn't that something? The third segment is pretty funny too if not as funny as the second segment. Walter Matthau plays a guy from Philadelphia in town for a big event in his family no it's not the Oscars and thanks to his goofy brother Herbert Edelman from The Golden Girls ends up in a compromising position and tries to hide it from his soontobe arriving wife Elaine May. The four segment is funny too but at times feels like torture. Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby play a pair of doctor friends from Chicago vacationing in L.A. with their wives and their trip turns into a nightmare when alot of things go wrong and the two men start to get at each others throats. All in all California Suite is a pretty entertaining comedy and I enjoyed it.  out of four".

The film directed by Herbert Ross entwines the four stories that were presented separately on stage thus the film has no real climax conclusion or resolutionit just ends. This film like so many others wastes Richard Pryor's genius and the segment Pryor shares with Bill Cosby is an embarrassment. The scenes between Jane Fonda and Alan Alda couldn't be less interesting in fact the only interesting thing is that the late Dana Plato plays their daughter. Michael Caine and Maggie Smith are watchable as a couple in a third skit though hardly worthy of the Oscar Smith received. For me the film belongs to Walter Mathhau and Elaine May. Particularly funny is a scene of Matthau trying to put stockings on a passed out hooker. And this is one of the rare instances where Elaine May's distinctive comedic style has been put to good use on film but 1 out of 4 does not make a worthwhile movie. Fonda fared better in Simon's Barefoot in the Park67 as did director Ross with Simon's The Goodbye Girl77. Say goodbye to this one.".

Sure it's slapstick in the extreme it gives us an idea how The Out of Towners may have looked if confined to Plaza Suite which it was intended for but there's something quite cool about two very different masters of stand up Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby going up against one another clean vs. dirty?.

When Jane Fonda Alan Alda Maggie Smith or Michael Caine are on the screen the film is magical for me. Jane gives a really good performance as an Ice Queen and I understand Alan more and more as their scenes progress. Maggie Smith and Michael Caine are the real stars in this movie. If the producers thought they had a better chance of getting Maggie an Oscar by making her a supporting actress they got what they wanted but I really believe it was a leading performance. I did my first spit take ever when Maggie and Michael were discussing the guacamole he was eating. When she asked what the disgusting green slime he was eating I started drinking a soda and when he answered I'm not sure but it tastes like they ran the front lawn through a blender I lost it. And yet at the end of their story when Maggie Smith asks Michael to not close his eyes to let it be me I was truly touched. I found out several years later that that line was the inspiration for one of my favorite Country songs Don't Close Your Eyes sung by Keith Whitley. The other two stories in the film I didn't care for The Walter Matthau story was too much like a Sixties leering sex farce and the Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby story was actually embarrassing to me. I really felt like I was watching an scene out of a film from the 1930's where AfricanAmericans took roles beneath them as it was a way to make a living. That is just one man's opinion and I am not trying to offend anyone. So the title of this review is the was I really feel.".

Even worse their wives are totally ignored! A real mixed bag here. The best joke comes from what happened after the movie. Smith won an Oscar for her acting here and her character in the movie didn't get the Oscar! Also why Smith got the award is beyond me. She's good but this is hardly an Oscar worthy performance. So all in all it's OK. I give it a 7.".

I was a little disappointed with Alan Alda's performance as the sunny divorcee who argues with his wife over who gets custody over their teenage daughter. He can't handle Neil Simon as well as I thought...In a way it sounded as though he were reading his lines. Jane Fonda was hardedged and a little rough in this one...A real firecracker who's selfish and tries too hard at NOT being caring or maternal. All you want her to do is get off the screen. But here's where the REAL talent comes in...Michael Caine and Maggie Smith. Caine plays a homosexualbisexual who's married to actress Diana Barrie Smith. The best lines in the movie come out of this duo. They're funny and touching with an extremely complex relationship. Maggie deserved the Oscar for this one. She's brilliant! She delivers her lines with pure wit. Her drunken scene is worth watching alone. Bill Cosby and his little group also provides some laughs and Walter Matthau as the cheating husband is TERRIFIC...especially his reactions to everything that happens to him. Definitely rent this one even if you don't buy it. Trust me you'll want to rewind.".

But here's where the REAL talent comes in...Michael Caine and Maggie Smith. Caine plays a homosexualbisexual who's married to actress Diana Barrie Smith. The best lines in the movie come out of this duo. They're funny and touching with an extremely complex relationship. Maggie deserved the Oscar for this one. She's brilliant! She delivers her lines with pure wit. Her drunken scene is worth watching alone. Bill Cosby and his little group also provides some laughs and Walter Matthau as the cheating husband is TERRIFIC...especially his reactions to everything that happens to him. Definitely rent this one even if you don't buy it. Trust me you'll want to rewind.";

I think most folks crave for the kind of problems the characters face in this photoplay.Beyond that and the incessant 1970's ez listening flute music which I absloutely hated then when it was popular and hate even moreso today it's a decent film.

This is actually the first that does not have Kfer in the title. It is not worth seeing at all if you are looking fro a film that has quality acting or strong writing. Zehetgruber Borghese and Giller all played in film number 3 already and they return for this one. But there is nothing new to the table here. The good thing is that the series has hardly gotten anything worse the bad thing is that the reason for this steadiness is that it was an entirely forgettable franchise very much from the start. I actually do not need to make a recommendation for this one as I am sure you have already seen previous films if you consider watching this one. Still I personally did not enjoy the watch and I am baffled by how many films this series has but it is very similar to the Schulmdchen series not in terms of content of course that people back then did not mind the bad quality if it gave them the occasional absurd laugh. A fifth film should follow a couple years later but with this fourth film the franchise was already almost over. The only good thing may be that this series of films apparently inspired the maker of Knight Rider for his project. At least that's positive for Knight Rider fans which I would not call myself either. But back to this one Thums down. Not recommended.".

Pierino will go to any length to torment his tormenters.  For example he walked past the school director with an invisible dog leash.  The director asked him what he was doing.

The director thought the invisible dog leash was Pierino's prank until he turned around and saw some doggie droppings that Pierino had placed in the hall.Pierino cannot stand his teacher so he drives her up the wall until she quits.  Then a new teacher comes in who has Pierino head over heals in love.  But does that mean he becomes a model student?  Well not quite.A knowledge of the Italian language is required to understand the humor in this movie.  It is a shame that there isn't a translated version of this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "If you're familiar with lowbrow 70's Italian sex comedies and why would you be? you might know that the most lowbrow of the bunch were the the insegnante series where Edwige Fenech plays a ridiculously sexy schoolteacher and the liceale series where Gloria Guida plays a ridiculously sexy high school student. While both of these series were done by the same group of directors i.e. Mario Laurenti Michele Tarantini Marino Girolami strangely the insegnante never met the liceale onscreen thus passing up a golden opportunity to for a stern Fenech to administer a good sound spanking to a petulant Guida. What both of these series DID share however was the dubious comic stylings of Alvaro Vitali who sometimes played a teacher but usually played the oldest and goofiestlooking high school student in the history of public education.For better or worse this particular film is the Alvaro Vitali show all the way. Neither Fenech nor Guida is in it. Vitali here has apparently been sent back to junior high school so all his classmates are basically children. And what we have is basically a 70's Italian forerunner to Adam Sandler's Billy Madison. Pierino Vitali's character is a literal manchild who likes to play pranks on and insult everybody around him. He has a flatulent grandfather a doting mother an uptight older sister and a harried restaurateur father. He goes to school with children but he's also mature enough to root around in the bushes with a willing high school lass and to fall madly in lust with his incredibly sexy substitute teacher he keeps arranging accidents for the regular teacher to keep the substitute coming back. Here though he has some competition from the studly male phys.ed.teacher.Vitali is not as annoying as he can be and occasionally he is genuinely funny in this. Michaela Mitti who plays the sexy substitute is a thirdrate Fenech or a secondrate Guida when it comes to being a comedienne but she definitely has a firstrate body like the two more famous actresses. Generally though while this movie has a lot of adult humor it doesn't have as much sex or nudity as some of the other films in the insegnanteliceale series. It's actually pretty appropriate for a 13yearold audience or at least for those who are 13yearsold at heart. Incredibly this has gotten a recent Englishlanguage DVD release so while it's certainly not my personal cup of tea and I can't exactly rave about it it's pretty easy to see at least and as good as place as any to start if you just want to get a taste of goofy 70's Italian sex comedies.".

There are beautiful women who are just lining up to sleep with the good guy. The Fourth Protocol is not one of these movies and thank goodness! It is one of the most realistic cold war spy movies out there. Despite it's age1987 it is relevant to today's world. There is nuclear terrorism and real looking spies. Michael Cain plays a British agent and is too busy looking for Russian spies to be sexing up fine Russian female agents. In fact he has a family. He is excellent as the seasoned agent who uses his mind and not gadgets to track down the Russian spy played by Pierce Brosnan. For those of you who saw Brosnan in Tailor of Panama and found it refreshing to see him play a creep secret agent will be in for a real treat in The Fourth Protocol. Brosnan plays Petrofsky a young hot shot KGB agent who tries to slice and dice his way to the top. I mean Petrofsky is a flat out cold blooded killer. He makes the guy in Tailor of Panama look like a saint. He has a conscience but he doesn't let it get in the way of his mission to explode a nuclear weapon on a US Air Force base in Great Britain in order to make it look like the US had a nuclear accident. Petrofsky was the right man for the job he would blow up two or three thousand people just like that. If he wasn't a KGB agent he could surely find work as a serial killer.The story moves along quickly and sometimes a bit too quickly. However it doesn't detract from the movie. The movie looks more like a cop movie in the way the investigation unfolds. When they finally find out what's going on there is a good action sequence that doesn't go over the top. It just serves the purpose in this movie. Other things I liked was the scene where they constructed the bomb.I would recommend this one to anyone who likes spy movies and are tired of the James Bond rigmarole. Rayvyn".

Brosnan is good the plot is sufficiently tricky to be interesting and Caine delivers the kind of reliable excellent performance that you can count on at least when the movie isn't total junk  he only seems to phone it in when the movie is entirely hopeless. The ending is a little abrupt but I can't find any fault with it other than that. The cast is uniformly strong too. Maybe people underrate the movie because the movie is lowbudget. It looks like a British TVmovie and maybe it was but I find it easy to get past the production values when the acting is good.I've seen it twice and it holds up to a second viewing.".

A great story and very believable spies that remain hidden from each other and no excruciating scene where the bad guy reveals his plot to the good guy. Would have been interesting to see what would have happened if the operation had turned out differently or the ending for that matter!Of course one of the best things about this film is the acting as previously stated by other people. Caine brings his character to life and is very believable in the role of John Preston the agent who cares and will bend the rules to make sure things get down. Brosnan is similarly good his character will stop at nothing to complete his mission he is a stone cold killer and this is portrayed well he doesn't let anything get in the way of the mission.All in all a very good little film much better than some of the tripe we get from Hollywood and with one of the finest British casts i've seen in some time.".

I haven't read the book however I used to own The Fourth Protocol computer game for the Commodore 64 and was vaguely familiar with the basic storyline.I can't pinpoint what exactly it is I like about this movie but I did enjoy seeing Michael Caine as a British agent tracking down the nuclear bomb. I could probably watch a whole series of films based around his character. I also liked some of the other characters and I think it had a good cast of actors. The workings of government agents was very compelling to watch but it was good to see that the film wasn't overwhelmed by ridiculous gadgets and stuck to the drama involved.The 80's technology in the film also had an element of nostalgia about it. This film reminds me of a bygone age of the BBC Micro and Ford transit vans. In fact I love watching the film just to see the various parts of England as well.I liked the fact that its a rather 'quiet' movie but I do think it needed to be reedited. Some parts of the film just skimmed through major plot developments without giving them time to breath and other times the film would show a character hopping from various locations in England without giving a sense of the travelling in between. Watching this film would give the impression that England is only about 10 miles wide! Some elements of the film really needed to be fleshed out a bit more.This isn't the sort of movie I would go to a cinema to see its more of a Friday night in movie that I would watch on TV. I would only recommend it to someone if they were diehard fans of this genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frederick Forsyth's bestselling novel is here brought to the big screen with an allstar cast but despite occasional moments of excitement it is not a film that genuinely gets the blood pumping. While the intricate buildup of detail and suspense made the book absorbing in the film it merely creates a cold dry and rather plodding atmosphere. The film has an oldhat feel to it for it pursues a storyline that has been done to death over the years. If you think about it we've seen stories like this countless times Rod Steiger plotting to blow up Parliament in Hennessy Edward Fox plotting to assassinate De Gaulle in Day Of The Jackal Bruce Dern planning a terrorist attack on the Superbowl in Black Sunday Steven Berkoff wanting to decimate an American air base with an atomic bomb in Octopussy. This time in The Fourth Protocol it is the turn of Pierce Brosnan to carry out yet another despicable plan against the civilised world. Genre addicts will probably enjoy the film but for the majority of us it's a tired case of more of the same.Secret agent John Preston Michael Caine leads a raid on the apartment of an idealistic government bureaucrat George Berenson Anton Rogers. In Berenson's safe Preston discovers some topsecret documents containing sensitive information about NATO activities in Britain. When confronted Berenson claims that he has been passing the information on to a South African contact but to his horror his South African contact turns out to be a Russian spy who has been forwarding the information to Moscow. As highranking Secret Service official Sir Nigel Irvine Ian Richardson tells Berenson you've undermined NATO.... perhaps irretrievably. Meanwhile in snowbound Russia deadly and highly decorated soldier Major Valeri Petrofsky Pierce Brosnan is briefed to carry out an audacious mission that could bring NATO to its knees. Petrofsky comes to Britain posing as a hardworking unmarried model citizen and promptly buys a house that backs onto an American air base. Gradually he sets into motion his chilling plan which involves triggering a nuclear explosion from his house disguising his act to appear like a terrible accident that occurred at the base thus strengthening the calls for NATO to be disbanded. Preston races against the clock to stop Petrofsky before his deplorable plan becomes a devastating reality.The cast perform decently enough though there seems to be a certain degree of indifference or perhaps unenthusiasm from some of the stars. Ian Richardson probably has the best of it he has a suggestive sinister tone of voice and shifty eyes that make him perfect for these cloakanddagger roles while Caine makes an amiable enough hero and Brosnan a fairly believable villain. Others fare slightly worse like Ned Beatty as a Russian official with an overprominent American accent and Julian Glover as a badtempered Secret Service bigwig whose attempts to evoke anger would barely trouble a child let alone his adult colleagues. John Mackenzie directs adequately but unremarkably allowing the jigsaw pieces of plot to slot into place in a bythenumbers fashion. The very concept of a nuclear strike within Britain is quite disturbing and exciting on its own terms but the film never really sets the pulse fluttering. Some might argue that this kind of lowkey realistic approach provides a worthwhile contrast to the extravagance and excesses of a James Bond movie and they'd have a point but there's something just a little too mechanical and familiar about The Fourth Protocol for my liking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frederick Forsyth is one of the greatest thriller writers to have picked up a pen with THE DEVILS ALTERNATIVE probably his best book concerning Ukrainian dissidents  a hijacked supertanker  a Kremlin power struggle and a hero whos a middle aged Scotsman . Sean Connery would have been perfect but many Forsyth novels probably wouldnt make good movies since the plots are complex and theres often a myriad of characters with long back stories  information overload on how the KGB operate etc . THE FOURTH PROTOCOL unlike THE DEVILS ALTERNATIVE has a fairly simplistic plot which makes it an ideal story to be adapated into a screenplay but theres a drawback  The story is predictable !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! THE FOURTH PROTOCOL centres around a nasty Soviet plot to win the cold war by exploding an atomic bomb at an American base making it look like an accident caused by the Americans leading to unilateral nuclear disarmament and the break up of NATO leaving those dastardly commies to invade Europe . The plot had actually been used before in the James Bond movie OCTOPUSSY and in many ways this does feel like a mind bending spy movie with Harry Palmer  Michael Caine   taking on communist traitor James Bond  Peirce Brosnan   bizarre to say the least but as strange as it seems it is somewhat compelling  even though the climax is very predictable with the good guy trying to stop the bad guy detonating the bomb There are a few problems with the screenplay though . We have several scenes that dont really add anything to the plot like the scene where Caines character smacks a couple of skin heads  . Very admirable though it adds nothing to either plot or character development since we know hes already a good guy  no need to prove it . I  also couldnt help noticing a rather ridiculous scene where the baddie decides to cut the throat of a possible witness  wouldnt this draw attention to himself ? Wouldnt the victims blood splatter all over his clothes ? And why would the witness need to be killed ? Its not like hes going to run to police and say  I tried to get off with a man in the gents toilets and I saw him recieve a radio from an airline pilot . He must be a KGB agent or something  Like most Forsyth stories theres a lot of characters  Maybe too many  and theyre played by familiar British character actors but few of them make an impact with the exception of Ian Richardson and Anton Rodgers who both appear in the best scene of the movie where an intelligence chief confronts a traitor . If you think acting is a doddle think how youd react if a director said to you  Okay  you play a dogmatic patriot  youd do anything to stop the world being over run by communist tyranny and youve done your level best to stop this happening . But then this character has found you out and worse hes just told you that youve been helping these nasty evil reds all along  how would you play the scene ? Richardson and Rodgers are superb in this scene even if it doesnt really have anything to do with the main plot A fairly good thriller even if its not tightly plotted and you know where its heading".

	schema:headline " A Good Example Of The Cold War Spy Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the bestselling novel by thriller writer Fredrick Forsyth The Fourth Protocol stands out as one of the last of the breed of Cold War spy thrillers. Set amongst the issues of 1980's Cold War tensions the film is the story of a KGB plot to detonate an atomic bomb in the UK near a US Air Force base causing the deterioration of NATO as a result if UK security services don't stop it first. With good performances and a fine script that make up for some of the films shortcomings The Fourth Protocol is a good example of the Cold War spy thriller.The films has good performances throughout. The cast is led by Micahel Caine and Pierce Brosnan. Caine is British agent John Preston a bit of a loose cannon himself who stumbles upon the plot and has to face his superiors skepticism before he can stop the plot. Brosnan is KGB agent Valeri Petrofsky who masquerading as James Ross is the man with the atomic bomb. The supporting cast is like a whose who of fine character actors including Joanna Cassidy Ned Beatty Julian Glover Michael Gough Ray McAnally and Ian Richardson. Sadly the actors playing Russian characters struggle with their accents at times but for the most part the performances work and help the film rather then hinder it. For the most part the film has good production values. The direction of John Mackenzie coupled with the cinematography of Phil Meheux the production design of Allan Cameron and the costumes of Tiny Nicholls mean the the film has a very realistic feel to it. For the most part the editing of Graham Walker helps as well especially in the sequence where the bomb is assembled by the Brosnan and Cassidy characters. Unfortunately there's moments where the editing is rather haphazard with scenes of Petrofsky on his motorcycle then packing his car then on his motorcycle again. Another example is the sequences involving the McWhirter couple played by Matt Frewer and Betsy Brantley with Petrofsky which while a fault of the script admittedly should have been cut from the film as they serve no purpose and slow down the film's pace. Even with the issues with the film's editing the production values hold up well.The film also has a fine script as well. Frederick Forsyth adapts his own bestselling novel with help from writers George Axelrod and Richard Burridge. The script remains fairly faithful to the original novel though there are some significant differences such as the amount of time spent investigating soviet agent Jan Marais at the beginning for example. This helps the film plot wise as it focuses the film more on the tense buildup to the possible detonation of an atomic bomb on British soil. The film nicely contrasts the arrival of the bomb's components from Petrofsky's side with Preston's attempts to derail the plot. The script also reveals a world of crosses doublecrosses and triplecrosses as the plot keeps getting more and more complicated as it goes on. The result is a wellwritten thriller.With good performances good production values and a wellwritten script from noted thriller Fredrick Forsyth The Fourth Protocol is a good example of the Cold War spy thriller. Even with editing issues the film is a wellpaced and tense story of Cold War intrigue and a story of how things might have bee. Even more surprising is that despite its being entrenched in 1980's Cold War politics the films dealing with the ongoing threat of nuclear terrorism means it has relevance over two decades later. Thus the film remains a tense if somewhat dated thriller.".

Just substitute Islamic terrorists for Russian ones. Caine was brilliant and doing his 'laser' style acting in all the close ups. Something he doesn't bother with in his many pot boilers. I have to agree with some of the other posters. It really should have been promoted as Harry Palmer's midlife crisis. He would have developed just like this. The hero in the book reads like an exPara version of Freddie Forsythe. Caine makes the role his own and adds his own interpretation. Another of my favourites Pierce Brosnan acts his heart out too as the stone killer Petrofsky. The Ian Richardson and Anton Rogers scene has to be a career best for both of them. Only a side plot but absolutely brilliant.".

	schema:reviewBody "A good film indeed but not so much of an exciting experience to watch it and those who know Frederick Forsyth's works as novelist are highly familiar on how gripping and thrilling his characters and situations are. But the thing that disappointed me the most is that Forsyth wrote the film script and what I saw wasn't so interesting to make me feel great about it.Well the story isn't news again we have a plot where Soviets want to destroy the CapitalistAmerican system this time the target is an American base in England. Now the British intelligence has to find the terrorist before something bad happens. The villain however is one man and one man only a deadly KGB spy Pierce Brosnan who has the mission of exploding an atomic bomb on a American military base. The man on his track is the charming agent John Preston Michael Caine very good who has to fight the bureaucracy of his boss Julian Glover to finally solve this situation.The problem I had with the film is the awfully number of characters and tiny little situations where I couldn't understand clearly what was happening some of the characters motivations as well wasn't good presented. The lack of some great action sequences also bothered me a little but the ones developed were very interesting the scene where Michael Caine jumps out of the car then runs to a moving train and Barry's crazy chase with the van almost hitting the people. The cat and mouse game of The Day of the Jackal is inexistent here except for the final moments here's a writer making a copy of himself. The whole situation is so similar that is beyond belief. The appeal of The Fourth Protocol lies in the incredible cast assembled that not only includes Brosnan and Caine but also Ned Beatty Ray McAnally Joanna Cassidy quite effective as Brosnan partner Michael Gough and others.It's not a case of great performances but all of them have decent parts to play with. Surprisingly strange is the fact of a great director like John Mackenzie specialist in creating thrilling moments in films like Deadly Voyage and Infiltrator both TV movies seemed a little lost with this script since it's hard to feel some thrill with everything presented except when Pierce is killing his victims he's a real stone cold kind of a guy. If the drama is quite hard to follow the suspense only works for limited moments. But seeing the general picture as a whole you still can have a decent movie with some good surprises. To me one random moment that marked me in this film is when Michael Caine beats two racist punks on the subway that was really awesome. I don't know why it's really in the film but it's a great moment to be seen. It could've been special but it also could've been way worst just one step in false and this could be a reunion of wasted talents. Gladly this didn't happened. Fans of Cold War flicks will enjoy it but be prepared for lots of confusing things. 610".

A Soviet agent is sent to the UK to stage a nuclear accident that could be blamed on the Americans and set off a chain reaction of events to unbalance this standoff.The Fourth Protocol is based on a novel written by Frederick Forsyth. I have never read it but have read others by this author. His style focuses on the intricate detail of the spypolitics of his thrillers while his characters contrastingly always seem to be really cardboard with very little recognisably human about them. With this in mind it's not too surprising that The Day of the Jackal was his most successful book seeing as the very blankness of the central character was an actual important plot point. But usually this weakness in characterisation is more noticeable. The Fourth Protocol is a quite typical Forsyth spy thriller in that it has a fairly detailed plot and paper thin characters. Michael Caine phones it in as a Harry Palmer type spy who doesn't play by the rules. It's a quite weak and clichd character and to be honest Caine doesn't bring much to the table with this one. Pierce Brosnan on the other hand is pretty good as the cold Soviet killer. Like in Day of the Jackal it's this villain who is the more interesting when set alongside the dull heroes meaning that its actually the bad guy whom we want to succeed which I'm sure could not have exactly been the original intention. Unlike Caine Brosnan is playing against type and certainly makes better work of what he is given and is certainly the best thing about the movie. On the whole this is a pretty standard spy film with nothing very distinctive about it. Despite its generic nature it is quite enjoyable though.".

He encounters the case of a dead courier delivering a nuclear device component.This is a second tier level espionage movie. Brosnan is good as a freezing cold spy and Caine is fine as the operative. It's a fine movie existing somewhere below the best of the genre. It doesn't have the gritty realism of the best murky spy mysteries. The limited action is fine but not good enough to be an exciting action thriller.";

Here a Soviet agent Major Valeri Petrofsky has been tasked with a mission which if successful could spell the end of the North Atlantic alliance his mission is to assemble a small nuclear bomb inside the United Kingdom and detonate it next to a US airbase... with the intention that everybody will believe it was an accident involving weapons on the base. Against him there is John Preston a British agent who stumbles upon the plot when one of the people bringing in one of the bomb components is killed in an accident.While there are a few plot holes it is possible to suspend ones disbelief as this is a fine thriller with great performances from lead actors Michael Caine and Peirce Brosnon who play Preston and the ice cold Petrofsky respectively. The action keeps up throughout the film from the start when traitor Kim Philby is killed to the end where Preston struggles with Petrofsky to prevent him detonating the bomb. That first scene was a bit of a problem for me however as it involved the killing of a real person who was very much alive at the time of the film's release I think it would have been better to have had a renamed fictionalised version of him. Having recently watch Michael Caine play a similar role in the 1965 thriller 'The Ipcress File' it is great seeing that he can still be believable in such a role twenty years later.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bummm! or Feindliche bernahme or Das wahre Leben or Life Actually really? is a German 100minute movie from 2006 so this one is already over a decade old and here we have the second full feature film by director Alain Gsponer. I personally prefer some of his more recent stuff. Anyway this one here was written by Buresch und Pacht who are right now more in the headlines for their work on Jugend ohne Gott. But this one here from over 10 years ago includes many fairly famous German actors like Noethen Riemann Herzsprung Bruch Khler Feifel and others. For me personally it may not have had the best approach to begin with as I think Herzsprung and Riemann are among Germany's most overrated actresses in my opinion. In the battle who would be worse here Herzsprung clearly gets the edge. Riemann was fairly mediocre and forgettable but she wasn't bad really. Herzsprung however had a really baity character at her disposal but she went way over the top and missed all the right notes. But seems like cutting your hair really short is enough these days for a German Film Award plus a bit of sexual references like seducing a teenage boy. As for the title the parallels between metaphoric explosions in the characters' lives and actual explosions mostly caused by the son felt a bit shoddy and never as impactful as it couldshould have been. The ending is full drama again with tragedy about to happen and while the final shots were good it did feel a but for the sake of it instead of really authentic storytelling. And this description also fits the film as a whole I'd say. It's not the problem that there aren't really any likable characters in here I guess but that those who are in it never feel interesting and deep enough from the perspective of telling a memorable yet authentic story and this is clearly what the film tries but there is just too much obverthetopness that sacrifice realism most of the time. It's not a failure though I guess there are some okay moments but it really isn't enough all in all and that's why I give the movie a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

If you're looking for pure comedy you may find that it drags in moments. However this is the last time you'll get to see Paul Newman with that devilish Eddie FelsonBen Quick light in his eyes he was made for the part as a selfappointed and selfstyled Judgephilosopher that dispenses justice to just about everyone that wanders through his town whether they deserve it or not. And Judge Bean also showcases IMO the best villian of all time in Bad Bob a murderous long haired psychotic albino come to lay ole' Beano to rest. Victoria Principal is so cute you just want to well you'll see. Anyway it's very funny but it is a love story. I found that rather distraction 30 years ago but I didn't get it.

A very broad and dark performance by Newman who manages to find the pathos and integrity of this western charicature.  It's a nice companioncontrast to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

Ironically despite the phenomenal boxoffice success of movies like THE STING 1973 and THE TOWERING INFERNO 1974 the Seventies werent particularly distinguished for Newman as an actor and his performance here is arguably his best work of the decade!The film is generally elegiac in mood especially during its last act when the Old West is all but vanquished in the name of progress and episodic in nature with a plethora of stars turning up for just one sequence or scene Anthony Perkins as a preacher Tab Hunter as a convicted murderer Stacy Keach as an albino badman who terrorizes the town John Huston himself as the owner of a sideshow attraction an amiable beerguzzling bear which eventually comes in handy to the Judge Roddy MacDowall  who has the largest role of all is an ambitious lawyer hes subsequently appointed mayor and eventually becomes an oil tycoon Anthony Zerbe as a mugger and Michael Sarrazin  whose participation extends merely to sharing a photo with Jacqueline Bisset as the Judges daughter! The latter then provides undeniable eyecandy along with Victoria Principal radiant in her film debut as Beans Mexican lover and Bissets own mother  while Ava Gardners Lilly Langtry only shows up at the very end after Bean himself who worshiped the celebrated actress has died Ned Beatty is also quietly impressive as the most loyal of Beans gang who actually prefers tending bar to performing his duties of deputy!.The bestfunniest bits are Bean assuming control of the town after a nearlynching Principal shooting repeatedly at a whore a potential rival for Beans affections and being thrown to the ground with the force of each blast Beans entire gang shooting in unison at a drunkard who dared take a potshot at Lilly Langtrys portrait Keachs cartoonish demise and Bean and Gangs epic Last Stand. As had been the case with BUTCH CASSIDYs Oscarwinning Raindrops Keep Fallin On My Head the film features a recurring song motif in Marmalade Molasses And Honey music by Maurice Jarre lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman  which also ended up nominated but is nowhere near as memorable as that Burt BacharachHal David classic though Jarres score in itself is quite good. For that matter neither is Hustons film up to the George Roy Hill masterpiece  though its certainly better than the talky Robert Altmandirected Buffalo Bill pic.By the way William Wylers THE WESTERNER 1940 had been another film which centered around Judge Roy Bean played as a semivillain by Walter Brennan that characterization had led to his third Oscar.

If you'ver ever watched Northern Exposure a good comparison might be Barry Corbin's Maurice Minnifield. That being said the real Judge Bean pales in comparison to the legend that has built up over the years. That legend is what Huston concerns himself with and it serves him well. The film is very episodic in nature and for the first half it does not disappoint. Paul Newman's first scene where he's beaten left for dead and returns to wreck vengeance on every last one of his attackers sets the tone for the rest of the film. This is high mythology tall tales at their best you get the impression that this is how we Texans really wish our history readcolorful eclectic ruthless at times and occasionally downright bizarre. From beer drinking bears to albino bandits it's certainly interesting.That being said the film definitely takes a melancholy tone as civilization comes to Langtry. With it comes the disdain for such colorful characters as Bean who seemingly has no place in the new modern world. It's sad but makes for an especially poignant ending. Newman's Judge is a blustering wonder other standouts include Anthony Perkins Ned Beatty Roddy McDowell and a very young and fetching Victoria Principal. Also making cameos are Jacqueline Bissett Stacy Keach Ava Gardner and even the director himself.All in all a funny touching film.".

From beer drinking bears to albino bandits it's certainly interesting.That being said the film definitely takes a melancholy tone as civilization comes to Langtry. With it comes the disdain for such colorful characters as Bean who seemingly has no place in the new modern world. It's sad but makes for an especially poignant ending. Newman's Judge is a blustering wonder other standouts include Anthony Perkins Ned Beatty Roddy McDowell and a very young and fetching Victoria Principal. Also making cameos are Jacqueline Bissett Stacy Keach Ava Gardner and even the director himself.All in all a funny touching film.";

It does weaken when it moves into the mythological part in the final halfhour and could've been cut a good twenty minutes without much damage. Still there is a lot to like here.Newman is very real and successfully captures the outsider determined to make his world the one others should want to live in. For me the most touching moment occurs when Ms. Langtry a stunning Ava Gardner visits the shrine to her memory left by the late Judge.Like some of his other later work this one doesn't seem sure where to end and is left sort of abandoned rather than finished.

This has to be watched on a clean DVD copy to really be understood.Paul Newman plays his role so very convincinglyI sometimes forgot it was he being Judge Roy Bean. It seemed like a whole other person had taken over Paul's mind. His vengeful shootout in the whorehouse is not your standard western shootem up. Unlike in those filmshe hits everyone he shoots and it's camera angles make it all the more real.There's so many other great players in this movieI haven't the room to discuss them all but they do range from great to good. Victoria Principal played a her role so well as a Spanish girlI mistakenly though she was Judge Bean's daughter later in the film. I don't see how someone finds her performance shallowher character is a woman from a tiny village in Texas. It's a wonder she knows English at that time.Stacy Keach's brief moment in the film is witout a doubt the funniest scene. His long hair and goofy black clothes make him look like the Edgar Winter of cowboys! I disagree that Ava Gardner seems to old to be Beans object of fascination. Bean was in his late 30searly 40s at the start and Miss Lily not much younger. She visits his town after Bean is goneso it's perfectly fine.The overall story is quite riveting and doesn't need to be history book perfect to tell it. The old west from near the end of the 19th century had always had inconsistencies and exaggerations in it's stories and legends. The great point made here is where does upholding the law begin  end? At what point does it go from being just thatto being sadistic and out of control with power? Roy seems to go very far beyond drunk with power. He has his human moments in this movie which actually are moving but mostly he's a man who has placed himself above anything and others. The only thing I'd say that is quite out of place here is the very saccharine song sung by Andy Williams in the playful scene between NewmanPricipal  the bear. Nothing against Mr. Williams' singing but it's a bit laughable in a movie that's mostly dark with comedic interludes. So for the great look of the filmthe actingthe story and the direction of John Huston who plays 'Grizzly Adams' in the filmI easily give this 10 stars.I don't care about the factsjust how good each player acts.

The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean is a misunderstood masterpiece because it is a man's love story set in a sprawling unforgiving and wild environment.

The entire story is an unkempt tale with a plethora of twists that serve to amuse and mark time rather than add pathos. But this was the West's oeuvre of desperation. Huston employs the storyline characters and pace to reiterate a distinct lack of order constantly nothing about this tale was to be tidy. All abstractions were to reflect chaos except a man's uswerving elevation when he keeps his focus on a true love greater than himself.Bean never meets the object of his affections the famous Nineteenth Century American performer Lilly Langtry but carries a torch from afar for over three decades. All of his deputies in one form or another are flawed characters. The reformed whores who become the deputies' wives are seen as mendacious and the Judge clumsily but hilariously challenges them and looses.His long disappearance and reappearance to retake the mantle of righteousness against a bustlingly but exploitive corporate oil barons is a reassertion of his innate sense of justice. It also serves as a tool for Newman Huston and Milius to prod American Big Business especially the oil companies.This rambling tale comes together only when Ms. Langtry portrayed by aging Ava Gardner arrives at Langtry Texas and reads the letter the Judge wrote on his last night. The tone is subdued but in an elegant Nineteenth Century prose conveys a timeless affection that provides the only 'bow' that this package gets and it is very good.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS. I love this movie to pieces. I think that it tells the wonderful tale of how one man tamed a piece of land in his own unique way. I think that Paul Newman's acting is wonderful as well as the rest of the cast. The music is also very haunting and beautiful. One of the wonderful aspects of this film is the development of Langtry. It started out as a whorehouse soon buildings developed around God fearing folk came to settle. It was all going good until Frank Gass moved in and turned the townspeople against the Judge even though he was the man that began the town.To pick a favorite part in this movie is impossible because I like the whole thing. But I'd have to say that the development of the town is my favorite aspect. It started out as a whorehouse the Judge tamed it hired marshals. Soon buildings began springing up like wild flowers. The town was good and the Judge was the ruler. Of course when Frank Gass came to town that little man tried his damnedest to knock the Judge out of his seat of power. It's sad to say that he succeeded. After Marie Elena dies and the Judge rides off into the sunset I love the part when Tector explains the developmentdecline of the town 19001920. Frank Gass is now powerful and owns the oil in Langtry and is threatening to kick Rose and Tector out of the Jersey Lilly. The Judge comes back to town round up his now worthless marshals and fights to protect his home. Eventually there it a big fire that destroys the whole town except the Jersey Lilly. It's continuity the Circle of Life if you're a Lion King fan.One of my other favorite scenes is when the marshals' wives who were all once former prostitutes force the Judge to apologize for calling them whores. This scene shows the hypocrisy of women in the 1800's. When we were first introduced to these characters one was willing to give the Judge her favors for free. About three years later when Victorian rules became part of their lives they're willing to gossip about Marie Elena carrying the Judge's child while not being his wife. Just like Tector said There's nothing worse than a reformed harlot. The Judge's obsession with Lilly Langtry throughout the film is very well resolved in the last scene in the movie. The part when she reads the Judge's last letter is nearly heartbreaking. I must admit that I have almost cried near the end.I would like to add that the song Marmalade Molasses and Honey was most deserving of its Best Original Song nomination at the 1973 Academy Awards. Unfortunately the song lost to The Way We Were and let's face it Andy Williams can't compete with Barbra.In conclusion I have come to realize that many of my favorite movies have been ridiculed and picked apart on this web site. I love this movie and I would suggest it for anyone who loves westerns.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS. I love this movie to pieces. I think that it tells the wonderful tale of how one man tamed a piece of land in his own unique way. I think that Paul Newman's acting is wonderful as well as the rest of the cast. The music is also very haunting and beautiful. One of the wonderful aspects of this film is the development of Langtry. It started out as a whorehouse soon buildings developed around God fearing folk came to settle. It was all going good until Frank Gass moved in and turned the townspeople against the Judge even though he was the man that began the town.To pick a favorite part in this movie is impossible because I like the whole thing. But I'd have to say that the development of the town is my favorite aspect. It started out as a whorehouse the Judge tamed it hired marshals. Soon buildings began springing up like wild flowers. The town was good and the Judge was the ruler. Of course when Frank Gass came to town that little man tried his damnedest to knock the Judge out of his seat of power. It's sad to say that he succeeded. After Marie Elena dies and the Judge rides off into the sunset I love the part when Tector explains the developmentdecline of the town 19001920. Frank Gass is now powerful and owns the oil in Langtry and is threatening to kick Rose and Tector out of the Jersey Lilly. The Judge comes back to town round up his now worthless marshals and fights to protect his home. Eventually there it a big fire that destroys the whole town except the Jersey Lilly. It's continuity the Circle of Life if you're a Lion King fan.One of my other favorite scenes is when the marshals' wives who were all once former prostitutes force the Judge to apologize for calling them whores. This scene shows the hypocrisy of women in the 1800's. When we were first introduced to these characters one was willing to give the Judge her favors for free. About three years later when Victorian rules became part of their lives they're willing to gossip about Marie Elena carrying the Judge's child while not being his wife. Just like Tector said There's nothing worse than a reformed harlot. The Judge's obsession with Lilly Langtry throughout the film is very well resolved in the last scene in the movie. The part when she reads the Judge's last letter is nearly heartbreaking. I must admit that I have almost cried near the end.I would like to add that the song Marmalade Molasses and Honey was most deserving of its Best Original Song nomination at the 1973 Academy Awards. Unfortunately the song lost to The Way We Were and let's face it Andy Williams can't compete with Barbra.In conclusion I have come to realize that many of my favorite movies have been ridiculed and picked apart on this web site. I love this movie and I would suggest it for anyone who loves westerns.";

Like several other posters I think Victoria Principal really stood out forgive the wordplay in her role. As far as guest appearances Stacy Keach notwithstanding I think Anthony Perkins had the best one as the preacher. The look on his face always suggested one of those comical lecherous evangelists which is odd since nothing else about the character suggested that. And he took that comical evangelist VOICE that everyone knows so well from other stories and made it his own.  He also had one of the best lines in the movie  since he was describing Roy Bean in the AFTERLIFE he finished by saying I have not seen him since that day so I suppose he has gone to hell. And as far as larger roles Ned Beatty and Roddy McDowall who could play ALMOST the same role REPEATEDLY and still be very entertaining. I didn't really like the whole ' 20s part of the story apart from its view of the oil industry! but I've always liked the Lily Langtry part at the end with Ava Gardner.".

I call he says to end the hand and promptly lays down HIS cards.  Is this storytelling at its best or filmmaking at its sloppiest?  By this time in the film you know this is just sloppiness.Director Huston labors valiantly and too obviously to make still another film about the Western code of the gun becoming obsolete at the turn of the century.  Railroads and telegraph coming in servants of regional and national companies rather than mom and pop entrepreneurs administrative systems of government and law enforcement rather than marshals on horseback and circuit court justices law books and defense counsel rather than kangaroo courts and quicktempered frontier justice.Where will there be a place for men like Judge Roy Bean who built towns by stealing capital from those that the selfrighteous disapproved of and then doing away with their protestations by hanging them on little or no pretext.  He was a form of Robin Hood only he robbed the helpless criminals to finance the sanctimonious with a 40 commission for himself.But just as we settle into a style that MIGHT have developed into something despite the plot's drawbacks Huston decides it's a Disney family comedy and dumbs it down with a lovable beer drinking bear that knows exactly who to gore and slash and who to kiss and cuddle.No it's a romance.  With scenes right out of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID 1969 you can practically see the boys out with Ms. Katharine Ross on a bicycle only this time its Victoria Principal and it's a seesaw and a swing instead of a bicycle.  But the cuddle positions and camera angles are the same.  Oh my grief.No it's an extended anecdote about how brave men of the outdoors can't handle married life.  The oncedangerous oncefeared members of Paul Newman's posse become impotent castrated henpecked husbands socially and then even politically inept at the hands of their devious scheming wives. The wives were originally wholesale priced whores delivered to town in bulk and married off at gunpoint by the Judge to lower the stress levels within his jurisdiction.  A decision that backfired to say the least.And so it goes.  For probably 20 or 30 minutes too long.  Until Director Huston seems to wake up and realize that he had a story to tell  alas not a new one nor did he have a new angle.  He tries to rescue things by dumping the plot into the hands of Newman's never seen now 20year old daughter.  I leave it to you to watch for blunders in the final resolution.Here are two example.  A lightframed woman shoots off a .45 with no kick whatsoever.  And another camera angle reveals that she is not even in the scene.  She was either spliced in post production or filmed on another soundstage.  Either way she had no idea where to look so that her eyes could track the action.  NOW THAT is not good storytelling.I rented this film to round out my John Huston experience and I am still a devoted fan.  But I sure think he was out to lunch on this one.  You can't lay all this at the feet of the dated style of 1970s filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're looking for a factual account of Judge Roy Bean this is not the film. One has still to be made for veracity. You won't find it in the old television series that starred Edgar Buchanan as the judge nor will you find it in the old William Wyler western The Westerner that got Walter Brennan an Academy Award for playing Roy Bean.But if you're looking for good rollicking entertainment than this is the film for you. I have to believe that Paul Newman must have loved making this film because it allowed him to be colorful outrageous and overact like a ripe Virginia ham. John Huston as director doesn't hold him in check in any way and the results are grand.In fact the real Roy Bean 18251903 lived a good deal longer and had a longer career than what is shown here. He was probably more of a hell raiser than what Huston and Newman give us. He had more children than the one daughter played by Jacqueline Bisset towards the end of the film. Huston did incorporate some of the legend it is true that he had a stiff neck as a result of a hanging attempt. Please note that the real Bean did die in 1903 so the whole last 20 minutes or so of the film is pure fabrication. But it's great stuff.His obsession with fabled actress Lillie Langtry is also part of the Bean legend and it is true. They never did meet but it is a fact that Lillie as played here by Ava Gardner did visit Bean's town now named Langtry Texas after Bean's death here and in real life.Victoria Principal made her screen debut in The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean as the woman who nurses him back to health after some unfriendly bandits nearly lynch him and who becomes his wife. It's hard to believe that this is the same woman who played a much different Texas female in Pamela Barnes Ewing on Dallas.Huston assembled a good supporting cast for Newman besides those I've mentioned Anthony Perkins Tab Hunter Ned Beatty Roy Jenson Bill McKinney are some of them. My favorite is Stacy Keach as the crazed Albino killer who challenges Bean. His demise at Newman's hands is the image I carry most from this film.I think when you see The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean it will be the same for you.".

They never did meet but it is a fact that Lillie as played here by Ava Gardner did visit Bean's town now named Langtry Texas after Bean's death here and in real life.Victoria Principal made her screen debut in The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean as the woman who nurses him back to health after some unfriendly bandits nearly lynch him and who becomes his wife. It's hard to believe that this is the same woman who played a much different Texas female in Pamela Barnes Ewing on Dallas.Huston assembled a good supporting cast for Newman besides those I've mentioned Anthony Perkins Tab Hunter Ned Beatty Roy Jenson Bill McKinney are some of them. My favorite is Stacy Keach as the crazed Albino killer who challenges Bean. His demise at Newman's hands is the image I carry most from this film.I think when you see The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean it will be the same for you.";

Vincent Canby in New York Times however just after the 1974 premiere of the movie stated LOVE AT THE TOP which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse is a 1973 French comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteenfifties English comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessingand possessed byambition. Yet the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that LOVE AT THE TOP is not concerned with the English class system...January 27 1975Having left the evaluations up to single individuals of course the test of time has done its just job. What may be said with certainty after more than 30 years is that we can hardly find such movies like LE MOUTON ENRAGE where decadence appears innocent where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic where feelings occur so manipulative. For Romy Schneider's fans it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see not only because she gives a unique performance as she did in all of her roles at the heyday of her career 9 years before her sudden death but because she is particularly attractive here. It is not TRIO INFERNAL where the so to say 'forced escape' from and the mockery of Romy's sweet image haunted for years by saccharine Sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role. She plays Roberte a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story's lead playboy Nicolas Mallet Jean Louis Trintignant. It is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons. This movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of Romy and she is given some of her very best scenes. Romy's sex appeal is unforgettable here.Another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception. Immoral as it may seem the director makes a perfect use of contrast conventions vs pleasures innocence vs decadence genuine lust vs instrumental affair. Nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest may find attractive or disgusting yet his are the features the viewers must treat seriously more to say they are the ones we all must accept. That is why one is led to a peculiar gently wild erotically unique world of the main character. Although he sleeps with lots of women there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for Nicola Roberte Groult Romy Schneider and MariePaul Jane Birkin. He manipulates them makes love to them cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money yet he perceives them differently. Yet despite all of this 'adult maturity' he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toycar on the table  a sort of 'detailed insight into male mind...' in a comedylike way of course.Finally there are very good performances which makes LE MOUTON ENRAGE slightly underrated. Not only the aforementioned Romy Schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role but young Jane Birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young inexperienced streetwalker Marie Paul Jean Louis Trintignant makes it possible to see Nicola in the right way. This artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by Camille SaintSans the tune that will ring in your ears for long. Therefore apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors slow action sometimes possible clichs noticed by some viewers the merits should be found significant. LE MOUTON ENRAGE in sum is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life. It is worth seeing as a moment in Romy's career a prelude to strong eroticism a chain of contrary emotions of love and hatred appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm... But aren't we humans 'viewers' movie buffs built upon such contrasts?".

She ends up adoring him for it and he discovers his strange powers over beautiful women.Encouraged by his scheming friend JeanPierre Cassel a crippled unsuccessful writer he uses his seductive powers to seduce the wife of a business associate Romy Schneider and embarks on a campaign of shady land deals and political intrigue.This movie works best if you take it as a satire or absurdist comedy. The character's strange power over incredibly beautiful woman is especially ludicrous. Most men would volunteer their left testicle to sleep with Jane Birkin and their right one to sleep with Romy Schneider they would then be left castratti if they went on to seduce the likes of Florinda Bolkan as a bisexual political power brokerand Estelle Blain as a vapid movie star as Tritigant's character does here. In one of the funniest scenes the hero has to in order to close a deal either sleep with a wealthy woman who is older than God or marry an 18yearold heiress. Hilariously the young girl is eager to jump into bed with him but refuses to consider marriage so he has to make the ultimate sacrifice.This is definitely a very black comedy which takes a lot of tragic and violent turns at the end but in typical French i.e. decidedly nonHollywoodfashion it refuses to provide a tidy moral at the end or make its hero too sympathetic. As for the literal translation of the French title The Angry Sheep I'm still trying to figure that one out.".

The fashion style and beauty of both Elsa Martinelli and Ursula Andress are a joy while Marcello works his casual nonchalance and easy timing as the Italian sophisticate at ease with multiple meanings.

Nolan  George Clayton Johnson's 1957 science fiction novel. So successful was the stylish film of his short story that Sheckley himself published a full novelization of THE 10TH VICTIM in 1966.Most stylish examinations of a future strangely like our own only cooler date faster than yesterday's fish but with the long overdue 2009 DVD release of the film it's amazing how still up to date and modern this violent romantic comedy from some angles it is a thriller but a thriller raised to new levels because of a wicked sense of humor actually seems  although in 1965 the film makers could not imagine an Italy that allowed divorce or an economy so bad that a million dollars would seem like a million lire.The Piero Piccioni jazz score still dazzles  if an adapter could find a live equivalent for the cinematic finale to the movie the film's weakest point this could be the basis for a great modern musical. Cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo's use of New York the ruins of the old Penn Station and the World Trade Center construction site and Rome the Colosseum Temple of Venus among other sites ground the story while setting up its eroticism for the performances Director Elio Petri gets from a uniformly wonderful cast.It isn't just the iconic first murder Ursula Andress pulls off during the credits as Jacques Herlin recites The Rules of The Big Hunt with her killer brassiere it's the shrewd juxtaposition of the computer matched hunter and victims and social issues that are a constant undercurrent and overlay in the film as we watch Andress and Marcello Mastroianni perform their particular humorously overplanned dance of death. We're not long into this delicious film before we realize how it set up and surpassed all the so called reality shows polluting television today. Voting someone off the island or out of the house or off a talent competition is just another form of The Big Hunt with all of us guiltily salivating at the vicarious thrill of victory and agony of defeat. As well as the film itself holds up there's a second layer of interest on the film for those willing to go beyond the usually preferable UNdubbed version the performances in the original Italian are wonderful. If you turn on the fine English language subtitles AND the unusually well done English language DUBBED soundtrack on the DVD it's fascinating to note that they don't match! Sometimes the literal translation of the subtitles is dramatically better but surprising frequency the dubbing script  geared to fit as tightly as possible to the movement of the actor's lips  is superior. Taking both in enjoying the subtle and sometimes not so subtle differences actually improves an already wonderfully layered film.This is a must see for discerning fans of classic science fiction romantic comedy or just plain intelligent film making and story telling willing to go beyond the usual.".

So what will they do  how will they get their points to win the game and how will they settle with each other.It is a pretty movie  among other things I recall Marcello's hair was blond in this film. Very unusual and striking he usually is wearing dark sun glasses and the affect makes him rather threatening looking.Despite the grimness of the situation it is a black comedy  on par with John Huston's PRIZZI HONOR two decades later. But Huston's film ends with the lovers both Mafia hit men having to confront each other in a real battle to the death. It is not a televised contest that ends with a killing.There are some great moments of mayhem  we see Marcello at the start working as a valet for a man who is an equestrian. He helps the man get dressed for a ride. The man has just put on some well polished boots Marcello had been polishing them when we see him. The man is suspicious but when Marcello leaves the room the man preens himself before a mirror  he clicks his heels and is blown to smithereens.THE TENTH VICTIM was set up as a science fiction tale of the future.

The concept of the televised contest has reached the screen with such reality shows as THE APPRENTICE and SURVIVOR.

	schema:reviewBody "According to film lore actor Marcello Mastroianni was so impressed with a shortstory by sciencefiction author Robert Sheckley that he sent it to director Elio Petri. The result was a groundbreaking Italian film that alternately shocked and amused audiences of 1965and which like the 1976 NETWORK proved prophetic re the rise of reality television. Set in a future imagined in terms of minimalist 1960s fashion and design movements THE 10TH VICTIM LA DECIMA VITTIMA presents us with a world that has sublimated the human race's hunger for violence into a game known as The Big Hunt. Register as a member and you become predator and prey with each player seeking to survive while killing ten others in order to win fame fortune and national acclaim.American Caroline Meredith Ursla Andress is particularly celebrated andafter dispatching her ninth victim via her boobytrapped brais eager to win the grand prize by taking out her tenth Italian Marcello Polletti Marcello Mastroianni. But an advertiser promises her even bigger bucks if she can turn it into a television ad for his product creating a situation in which Caroline cannot simply kill Marcello at will she must do it at a particular place and time where the cameras will be rolling.In order to accomplish this Caroline decides to seduce Marcello with both her body and the lure of cashwhich he badly needsfor a television interview. Marcello is no fool and even as Caroline plans to blow his head off for benefit of television he's signing his own advertising deal to accomplish her death by crocodile. But there's a further complication even as they attempt to maneuver each other into death they also unwillingly fall in love.THE 10TH VICTIM was extremely celebrated in 1965 today however it reads as slightly thin. We've become used to the idea of people who are willing to do just about anything on television and the idea of murder by game show isn't nearly so farfetched as it used to be. The film scores however in its specific ideas which range from exploding boots to a government that occasionally switches out your apartment's furniture whether you like it or not. The DVD transfer is quite nice but bonuses are limited to cast notes and the theatrical trailer. Recommended but mainly for fans of 1960s futurism who haven't lost their sense of humor! GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	onyx:emotionText "According to film lore actor Marcello Mastroianni was so impressed with a shortstory by sciencefiction author Robert Sheckley that he sent it to director Elio Petri. The result was a groundbreaking Italian film that alternately shocked and amused audiences of 1965and which like the 1976 NETWORK proved prophetic re the rise of reality television. Set in a future imagined in terms of minimalist 1960s fashion and design movements THE 10TH VICTIM LA DECIMA VITTIMA presents us with a world that has sublimated the human race's hunger for violence into a game known as The Big Hunt. Register as a member and you become predator and prey with each player seeking to survive while killing ten others in order to win fame fortune and national acclaim.American Caroline Meredith Ursla Andress is particularly celebrated andafter dispatching her ninth victim via her boobytrapped brais eager to win the grand prize by taking out her tenth Italian Marcello Polletti Marcello Mastroianni. But an advertiser promises her even bigger bucks if she can turn it into a television ad for his product creating a situation in which Caroline cannot simply kill Marcello at will she must do it at a particular place and time where the cameras will be rolling.In order to accomplish this Caroline decides to seduce Marcello with both her body and the lure of cashwhich he badly needsfor a television interview. Marcello is no fool and even as Caroline plans to blow his head off for benefit of television he's signing his own advertising deal to accomplish her death by crocodile. But there's a further complication even as they attempt to maneuver each other into death they also unwillingly fall in love.THE 10TH VICTIM was extremely celebrated in 1965 today however it reads as slightly thin. We've become used to the idea of people who are willing to do just about anything on television and the idea of murder by game show isn't nearly so farfetched as it used to be. The film scores however in its specific ideas which range from exploding boots to a government that occasionally switches out your apartment's furniture whether you like it or not. The DVD transfer is quite nice but bonuses are limited to cast notes and the theatrical trailer. Recommended but mainly for fans of 1960s futurism who haven't lost their sense of humor!

It's set in the near future but the movie isn't featuring any weird gadgets or anything like that really. It's more a movie that is being futuristic with its visual look so purely its sets and costumes as well as with its story of course.The movie is still foremost a satire on modern entertainment and once you understand that this movie will be an even better and easier one to start appreciating. The concept of the movie is that people in the near future hunt and kill each other for pleasure in a sort of a game in which both the victim and hunter get notified about their participation. With all of the themes this movie is handling it seemed like this movie was at least 20 years ahead of time. It could had been made just as easily in the '80's but also in this modern day and age it would had still been a relevant movie to have been made and released.It remains still kind of an odd movie to watch due to its uncommon approach of storytelling and the fact that the movie is often taken a more artistic approach. It therefore isn't always an easy movie to watch though as a whole the movie still remains a perfectly accessible one.I only wished the entire movie would had been as good and interesting as its first couple of minutes. I still feel that the movie now instead has some missed opportunities in it and definitely the middle of the movie is being kind of stretched out slow and not all that interesting.Visually the movie really doesn't disappoint though. It's using lots of bright color great looking sets and costumes all typical for '60's movies and some nicely directed sequences that are all set up very well and with an obvious eye for detail. Elio Petri did a good directing job with this movie.It's visually also pleasing to see Ursula Andress in this. It's also a real big role for her and it's good to see she isn't just playing a bit part for a change and also isn't just purely cast as a sex symbol.

	schema:headline " The best film of 2003";
	schema:reviewBody "Man on the train directed by Patrice Leconte is intimiste French cinema at its best. It tells the story of a chance encounter and ensuing friendship between Milan a gangster who is coming to a small French town to rob a bank and Manesquier a retired professor of poetry who has lived there his whole life. The two protagonists could not be more different and yet each one becomes fascinated by the other's life. Soon Milan tries on slippers and Manesquier is shooting a gun at soda cans. Was Milan's life wasted because he never had the strength to fill his life with the structure he so desires? Was Manesquier's life wasted because he never had the strength to escape the structured life he so loathes? Will they go all the way and actually exchange lives? The movie is extremely well directed and photographed with grainy blueish colors that support each character's melancholy. The script is tight and leaves room for silent moments which are as important to the story as the dialogue a concept unknown in Hollywood. Every word has a deeper meaning than its litteral one. In one of the best scenes of the movie the elegant poetry professor Manesquier puts on Milan's leather jacket and stands in front of the mirror saying in English The name is Earp...Wyatt Earp. But in the end what makes the movie such a gem is the talent of the two lead actors who like their characters are such extreme opposites that their screen relationship could easily have ended up devoid of any chemestry. Jean Rochefort is an intellectual and one of France's greatest and most subtle living actors. Johnny Hallyday is the uneducated overthetop rock'n roll singer and social icon who has monopolized the 1 spot in French music charts since 1960 and who has been derided by the French intelligentsia ever since. Until the movie Rochefort himself was no fan of Hallyday though he likes to say with a grin Madame Rochefort on the other hand.... They have since become friends. It reportedly took a lot of effort by Rochefort and Leconte to make Hallyday comfortable enough to act opposite Rochefort whom he saw as a towering icon. They most certainly succeeded since in the end it is the surprising subtelty of Hallyday's performance that makes the movie so poignant. Despite the botox injections and the face lifts his Mount Rushmore face looks like that of a man who has been to hell and back a few hundred times. He has such presence and charisma that you can't take your eyes off him whenever he appears on the screen. Though he plays Milan with a minimalist approach both in demeanor and delivery he manages to display the most intense emotions in a simple grin a gesture or a stare. The way he smokes Manesquier's pipe while explaining Balzac's Eugenie Grandet which he has obviously never read to a private student of Manesquier will make you chuckle. The way he looks at Manesquier when he leaves his house at the end of the movie will simply break your heart... Man on the train is a gentle tender film which asks big questions in little ways. Let's pray it never gets remade in Hollywood...".

One is a bank robber and the other is a retired poetry teacher.  The bank robber is plain tired of the excitement and the other wants excitement in his life.  The retired poetry teacher also has an upcoming triplebypass heart surgery that lends to his aggressiveness about trying out the other lifestyle.    Like many French dramas  this movie takes it's time and explores the characters and let's us get to know them.  This is so' lacking in most American films these days and therefore this is a breath of fresh air for those who are okay with reading subtitles.  While watching this movie you get the feeling that you're watching two real' people interacting despite their differences. Do they ever switch places?  Well sort of but  like other French dramas reality' is where the film stays for the most part.  The ability for the characters to understand and accept each other is just' wonderful and makes a wonderful statement about how we should all' interact and I think this is what makes this film remarkable.".

	schema:reviewBody "As we left the theatre someone inevitably said that was very French.' And so it was or at least it was a movie that Hollywood would never have made. Washedup bank robber meets retired French teacher and they become friends each hankering after the other's lifestyle. The teacher is facing openheart surgery the robber the prospect of a dangerous bank job with three unreliable associates. All this set in a really boring small town in the Rhone Valley filmed mainly in Annonoy with funding of course from the local Film Commission.Yet it works. Watching the two principals Jean Rochefort as the teacher and Johnny Hallyday as the robber is like watching Torvill and Dean  perfect synchronisation but with humour added. There's not a false move and the script is seamless  it seems quite inevitable that such an improbable relationship could develop. Somehow we don't notice the improbabilities such as the gang stealing a huge by French standards and rare BMW 740 for use as a getaway car the evening before the robbery from a car park in the centre of town and making no effort to conceal it until the robbery at 10 heurs the next day. Perhaps the relationship can be explained on the basis that Jean likes to talk and Johnny is content to listen. As they get to know each other Jean becomes quite concerned about his guest and Johnny for his part comes to admire his host. He even upbraids Jean's quite pleasant mistress for boring Jean with talk of her children's misdemeanours. The film ends in a flurry of maybe things might have been different if'. You can choose the alternative ending you like in fact though the fantasy is more palatable that reality. Unlike Hollywood French filmmakers trust their audience and it is unlikely too many viewers will feel cheated here.".

	schema:headline " Facing destiny";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a film that could be asking a question but which one? Can we change our destiny or does destiny change us? The film starts with a mysterious man on a train who comes to a small French town to meet some others for a planned bank heist and in a small shop meets an older man who is instantly drawn to him. Johnny Hallyday plays Milan who doesn't say much and the great Jean Rochefort is the retired teacher of poetry Monsieur Manesquier. Milan cannot find a place to stay and Manesquier is more than happy to have him stay with him. Both men are the opposite of each other. Milan is a tough excon type that has been down a tough road in his life and seems very tired of his life and appreciates his hosts simple life. Manesquier is a dreamer that does jigsaw puzzles and eats the same meal in the same diner every day. But he dreams of being a cowboy or a gangster type. He asks Milan if he has any tattoos and ultimately asks if he can be in on the heist. Milan is street wise and says no. During the course of the film we watch each character try and become each other. Milan borrows some old comfortable slippers to wear and wears his mustache like Manesquire. At one point he helps a young boy who is being tutored in poetry. Manesquire on the other hand gets his hair cut short like some of the younger men and has Milan show him how to shoot pistols. SPOILER ALERT Towards the end of the film Manesquire is having a heart operation at the same time Milan and his cohorts rob a bank. During the robbery Milan discovers someone has tipped off the police and they are surrounded by a swat team. Manesquire dies on the operation table at the exact same time as Milan is gunned down. The film has lots of symbolism like the ending when both trade spots and become each other even though its to late. There is on scene in the film where the bank robbers are in a stolen car at a red light and on the other side of the intersection in another car is the surgeon who is going to perform the operation the next day. When the light turns green both cars pass each other and this scene reflects what the film really is about. Two men with destinies that can't be changed passing each other in different directions. Hallyday is quite effective as the burnt out thief and he gives a performance that reminds me of a younger Charles Bronson. His quietness is the key to his character. He's seen a lot and is burnt out what more is their to say? And Rochefort is a marvel to watch. He seems perfectly cast as a retired teacher who craves excitement in his dwindling life. Listening to him ramble on with his stories adds so much to the film that you can understand why he wants to change his life. The film is shot in a hazy gray tone and there is no sunshine at all in this film. It made me think that maybe these two doomed characters were in all essence dead already and they were just to lost souls walking around in limbo until their fate catches up to them. Patrice Leconte has shown to be a good story teller and this is arguably Leconte's best film beside The Hairdressers Husband. Well made with two excellent performances make this a memorable film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well The Man on the Train takes a long time getting where it wants to go and is very French in its sense of humor and dialogue but as they say all's well that ends well. In this case it's a great ending. I had turned off this movie around an hour in bored by the dialogue and lack of plot advancement right around when Luigi arrives in town.DO NOT DO THIS! I decided to give it a last chance. From there the film gets more interesting and the ending sequence virtually wordless as we go between each man's operation is suspenseful. The interesting thing about Man is that it's not about trading places it's about two people who wade in the waters of each others' lives but never quite dive in. That could have been unfulfilling but it turns into an engaging narrative on the what ifs we all ask ourselves instead of becoming an overly contrived caper.Rochefort powerfully conveys his frustration and anger while Hallyday becomes more sympathetic as the film goes on. The ending shots of him sitting in the house by the piano are totally understandable Milan sees Manesquier's life as leisure while Rochefort sees in Milan's a life of adventure. Both of them have that grass is always greener problem and both of their lives unfortunately as unchanged lead to dead ends.

	onyx:emotionText "Well The Man on the Train takes a long time getting where it wants to go and is very French in its sense of humor and dialogue but as they say all's well that ends well. In this case it's a great ending. I had turned off this movie around an hour in bored by the dialogue and lack of plot advancement right around when Luigi arrives in town.DO NOT DO THIS! I decided to give it a last chance. From there the film gets more interesting and the ending sequence virtually wordless as we go between each man's operation is suspenseful. The interesting thing about Man is that it's not about trading places it's about two people who wade in the waters of each others' lives but never quite dive in. That could have been unfulfilling but it turns into an engaging narrative on the what ifs we all ask ourselves instead of becoming an overly contrived caper.Rochefort powerfully conveys his frustration and anger while Hallyday becomes more sympathetic as the film goes on. The ending shots of him sitting in the house by the piano are totally understandable Milan sees Manesquier's life as leisure while Rochefort sees in Milan's a life of adventure. Both of them have that grass is always greener problem and both of their lives unfortunately as unchanged lead to dead ends. I suppose you have to be the risktaker for a while in order to enjoy the leisure and maybe you have to have been stuck in a dull life to enjoy the risks. It seems as if neither has ever known the other side and so ends life with regret about what could have been. Let it be a lesson to us all!";

	schema:reviewBody "Patrice Leconte's L'Homme du Train is an odd compelling little film a bit of a teaser because it has one of those dual endings 'It could happen this way or it could happen that way.' The heart of it is a character study of the two aging men the younger the grim looking rakish Milan Johnny Hallyday new in town just off a train and taken in by a tall older gentleman M. Manesquier a retired schoolteacher whose specialty was poetry. For a short time they share the big elegant crowded house Manessier inherited from his mother. The pall cast by the grimness of the town is a third character in the piece. Johnny Hallyday is that famous French rocknroll sort of singer with the iceblue eyes who still fills big halls and at 59 still has a sexy edge like Keith Richards. Manesquier is played by Jean Rochefort veteran of many roles but lately most known abroad for being cast as Don Quixote in Terry Gilliam's doomed effort. Rochefort is tall suave but vaguely comic in a Tatiesque way and a Quixotic way. The contrast of the two men speaks for itself and Milan in fact rarely speaks while Manesquier rambles on pleasantly about anything and everything from his early masturbation habits to the annoying mannerisms of the bread shop clerk.Were you a good teacher? Milan asks. In thirty years I didn't molest a single pupil the old fellow answers a remark that stuns rather than amuses. The film proceeds by little incidents. A sweet but stupid boy who comes to be tutored in poetry Manesquier's bravery in confronting a boorish patron in a bistro is rewarded when he turns out to be a former student. I still read a little poetry thanks to you the loudmouth says having recited lines he remembers from 1982. It comes out that the older man is going in for a heart operation on Saturday morning and the younger is in town to rob a bank at the same hour. Manesquier tries on Milan's tassled leather jacket gives him a pair of slippers gets a haricut like his. Milan who's clearly been around and survived some very wild moments plainly envies the teacher's comfortable peaceful existence of welcoming occasional visitors doing jigsaw puzzles and playing the piano. In exchange for the slippers Manessier gets a lesson in firing pistols.There are promises of excitement. The vaguely planned robbery at least offers the menace of ugly cohorts. A suspenseful walk into his property suggests Manesquier is being robbed it's only the gardener.Fourteen years separate the men but both are alone and aware of growing old without attachments or hope. An odd note is Manesquier's mistress whom Milan scolds for chattering about her child He wants tenderness and sex not news of your brat. The old man seems too amiable and sexless to maintain a mistress. Nor is there a scintilla of sexuality between the two men. Both hesitate about their scary rendezvous with destiny Milan doesn't guarantee his quirky accomplices that he'll show up for the heist and Manesquier balks at going in for the operation and quarrels with his prim sister when she comes to help him pack for the hospital. They're both stalling as if lingering and chatting together in the comfy old house was the last good thing they'll ever have. They were right. In the event both die. Milan is gunned down by a mass of snipers who could have tipped them off? Manesquier's heart stops in the early stages of the triple bypass. But then the film shows us their eyes peeking out and slips to an alternative where the two men change places the older one goes off on the train and the younger pockets the housekeys  unnecessary anyway since neither the gate nor the front door are ever locked. In fact Leconte's heart isn't in his story there are a number of inconsistencies in the telling of it and all he really cares about is the mystery of the bank robber the garrulous vacuity of the retired teacher and the moments of poetry and nostalgia that link them together. The fact that they are both de facto retirees and dead men makes the substance of the story vanish into thin air. It had its moments. A surprise encounter is always a good way to begin. But a fudged finale is a bad way to end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Man on the train directed by Patrice Leconte is intimiste French cinema at its best. It tells the story of a chance encounter and ensuing friendship between Milan a gangster who is coming to a small French town to rob a bank and Manesquier a retired professor of poetry who has lived there his whole life. The two protagonists could not be more different and yet each one becomes fascinated by the other's life. Soon Milan tries on slippers and Manesquier is shooting a gun at soda cans. Was Milan's life wasted because he never had the strength to fill his life with the structure he so desires? Was Manesquier's life wasted because he never had the strength to escape the structured life he so loathes? Will they go all the way and actually exchange lives? The movie is extremely well directed and photographed with grainy blueish colors that support each character's melancholy. The script is tight and leaves room for silent moments which are as important to the story as the dialogue a concept unknown in Hollywood. Every word has a deeper meaning than its litteral one. In one of the best scenes of the movie the elegant poetry professor Manesquier puts on Milan's leather jacket and stands in front of the mirror saying in English The name is Earp...Wyatt Earp. But in the end what makes the movie such a gem is the talent of the two lead actors who like their characters are such extreme opposites that their screen relationship could easily have ended up devoid of any chemestry. Jean Rochefort is an intellectual and one of France's greatest and most subtle living actors. Johnny Hallyday is the uneducated overthetop rock'n roll singer and social icon who has monopolized the 1 spot in French music charts since 1960 and who has been derided by the French intelligentsia ever since. Until the movie Rochefort himself was no fan of Hallyday though he likes to say with a grin Madame Rochefort on the other hand.... They have since become friends. It reportedly took a lot of effort by Rochefort and Leconte to make Hallyday comfortable enough to act opposite Rochefort whom he saw as a towering icon. They most certainly succeeded since in the end it is the surprising subtelty of Hallyday's performance that makes the movie so poignant. Despite the botox injections and the liftings his Mount Rushmore face looks like that of a man who has been to hell and back a few hundred times. He has such presence and charisma that you can't take your eyes off him whenever he appears on the screen. Though he plays Milan with a minimalist approach both in demeanor and delivery he manages to display the most intense emotions in a simple grin a gesture or a stare. The way he smokes Manesquier's pipe while explaining Balzac's Eugenie Grandet which he has never read to a private student of Manesquier will make you chuckle. The way he looks at Manesquier when he leaves his house at the end of the movie will simply break your heart... Man on the train is a gentle tender film which asks big questions in little ways. Let's pray it never gets remade in Hollywood...".

The movie is extremely well directed and photographed with grainy blueish colors that support each character's melancholy. The script is tight and leaves room for silent moments which are as important to the story as the dialogue a concept unknown in Hollywood. Every word has a deeper meaning than its litteral one. In one of the best scenes of the movie the elegant poetry professor Manesquier puts on Milan's leather jacket and stands in front of the mirror saying in English The name is Earp...Wyatt Earp. But in the end what makes the movie such a gem is the talent of the two lead actors who like their characters are such extreme opposites that their screen relationship could easily have ended up devoid of any chemestry. Jean Rochefort is an intellectual and one of France's greatest and most subtle living actors. Johnny Hallyday is the uneducated overthetop rock'n roll singer and social icon who has monopolized the 1 spot in French music charts since 1960 and who has been derided by the French intelligentsia ever since. Until the movie Rochefort himself was no fan of Hallyday though he likes to say with a grin Madame Rochefort on the other hand.... They have since become friends. It reportedly took a lot of effort by Rochefort and Leconte to make Hallyday comfortable enough to act opposite Rochefort whom he saw as a towering icon. They most certainly succeeded since in the end it is the surprising subtelty of Hallyday's performance that makes the movie so poignant. Despite the botox injections and the liftings his Mount Rushmore face looks like that of a man who has been to hell and back a few hundred times. He has such presence and charisma that you can't take your eyes off him whenever he appears on the screen. Though he plays Milan with a minimalist approach both in demeanor and delivery he manages to display the most intense emotions in a simple grin a gesture or a stare. The way he smokes Manesquier's pipe while explaining Balzac's Eugenie Grandet which he has never read to a private student of Manesquier will make you chuckle. The way he looks at Manesquier when he leaves his house at the end of the movie will simply break your heart... Man on the train is a gentle tender film which asks big questions in little ways. Let's pray it never gets remade in Hollywood...";

The story is like some many of these films incidental to the action but I really enjoyed the mix of fantasy and scifi. The alien is cool looking. The rock monsters are slightly underwhelming it's the way the walk but they're fun nonetheless in a Bmovie kinda way. Alan Steel ne Sergio Ciani is agile even if he's more beefy and older looking than Steve Reeves or Mark Forest. The film transfer I saw was bad but even so I had fun watching it. I could see that it was very colorful film in its original state and I'm certain that if this film had a decent transfer people would be pleasantly surprised by how much fun HERCULES AGAINST THE MOON MEN actually is.There are several good moments in it including the nicer dicer scene when Hercules or Maciste is trapped within a giant contraption which looks like the jaws of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Cool scene. I thought the film moved at a good pace and was never dull. The actress who played the Queen was a pretty good villainess. She looked like she came straight out of an anime. The actress who played the sister had a massive rack which would make Dolly Parton jealous. The only weakness in the film would be the soundtrack. It's not really impressive.Peplums like this one are often derided and dismissed for showcasing too much muscle. First of all so what? Secondly films like this were made first and foremost for kids. Kids back then and today are impressed by big burly guys. Just look at the success of the ber trashy WWE today which shows more skin than any of these sometimes overlooked action flicks. Third of all Sword and Sandal films are probably the most underrated genre ever. Without these films there wouldn't have been a Ridley Scott's Oscar winning GLADIATOR or the current box office smash 300.Just watch HERCULES AGAINST THE MOON MEN for what it is just a fun colorful action movie which happens to have some beefcake and cheesecake thrown in for good measure.".

As a filmmaker myself I know how EXTREMELY DIFFICULT it is to go out on location and get anything even half decent on film so just by that the Italians have done a great job. The action set pieces are really quite well done and the acting is believable and passable even from Alan Steele who I think makes a great Hercules. The special effects are very good for their time especially the giant rock monsters. The Queen is an excellent evil schemer with perfect vulpine qualities not to mention a very beautiful face and sexy figure. I could look at her all day long. If you compare this film or any of the Italian horror films made around the same period Nightmare Castle for example or the excellent hammer Horror Ingrid Pitt vampire series they are far superior in all aspects to anything that Hollywood was churning out at the time or now. Most of that stuff was cranked out by the Corman machine and fell far short of the quality of Hercules Against the Moon Men. The sequences are filmed well with steady clear and precise camera work and they are edited together nicely. I admit that the sandstorm sequence is perhaps a little too long but it is no where near as agonizing to sit through than the entire Transformers movie out recently. Perhaps the only criticism I have for Hercules is the inconsistency of his strength  any man powerful enough to raise a rock monster over his head and toss it aside would be unstoppable and most certainly unable to be fought against by guys with swords. But I loved the fight scenes anyway and Alan Steele really looks like he's grinning and having a great time as the unbeatable hero. I love this film as much now as I did when I first saw it as a little boy growing up in England.".

	schema:reviewBody "While this film made a very funny episode of MST3K I am reviewing the film itself not the MST3k version.Giacomo Gentilomo and other Italian directors of the 1950s and 1960s made Hercules the James Bond of classical times. Smart impossible to defeat and always pure of heart Herc always got the goods and the girl. Sergio Ciani AKA Alan Steel plays Hercules this time. A former stunt double for Steve Reeves Ciani does as well with this role as any of his predecessors. It has been noted that Ciani was shorter than the other Hercs in the series. While this is apparent in the film it's worth noting that he was a mere two inches shorter than the largerthan life Reeves.I found this film to be much more entertaining and polished than it had a right to be. The directing editing and cinematography were fine and the only pacing disaster was the seemingly endless sand storm. the film's art design was superior to the rest of the series. It is not surprising that Director Gentilomo became a fulltime professional fine artist shortly after making this film.In Moon Men Hercules must face the evil power of the moon and the supernatural creatures who came to earth on a meteorite and use human sacrifice to wield mysterious power. In addition he has to face a powerful and powerhungry queen allied to these creatures and the evil influence of Uranus. As ridiculous as this plot is it is at least creative and offers some innovative opportunities for very different fight scenes sets and subplots. The script is about as straightforward as it gets and the English dubbing is actually pretty good.Silly but harmless. An extra star for the costumes and creative use of effects.".

While this is apparent in the film it's worth noting that he was a mere two inches shorter than the largerthan life Reeves.I found this film to be much more entertaining and polished than it had a right to be. The directing editing and cinematography were fine and the only pacing disaster was the seemingly endless sand storm. the film's art design was superior to the rest of the series. It is not surprising that Director Gentilomo became a fulltime professional fine artist shortly after making this film.In Moon Men Hercules must face the evil power of the moon and the supernatural creatures who came to earth on a meteorite and use human sacrifice to wield mysterious power. In addition he has to face a powerful and powerhungry queen allied to these creatures and the evil influence of Uranus. As ridiculous as this plot is it is at least creative and offers some innovative opportunities for very different fight scenes sets and subplots. The script is about as straightforward as it gets and the English dubbing is actually pretty good.Silly but harmless. An extra star for the costumes and creative use of effects.";

I enjoyed the scifi twist it made things out of the ordinary. I should add that the love interest for Hercules is pretty hot although she takes a lot of abuse in this film. The special effects and costumes were well done for the most part. The aliens looked cool as did their boss a sorcerer with a gnarly gold mask covering his face. There were lots of borrowed bits like dripping blood on a petrified witch in order to bring her back to life. That came from Black Sunday with Barbara Steel. The dungeons were nice with all their clever traps for Hercules to fall into. I found this movie to be very entertaining and much better than rated here. When compared to others in the genre this one scores a solid 8. Check it out!".

	schema:headline " Wow...that sandstorm sequence was rather long wasn't it?";
	schema:reviewBody "Time for another Hercules adventure as he must battle the people of the moon! Only it is not Hercules that is featured in this particular film but rather a hero by the name of Maciste. In the 50's and 60's there were not only like 15 films featuring the Greek hero Hercules but also like 15 films featuring this hero too! There is a whole lot of films featuring bearded heroes with super strength suffice to say. This film would be repackaged as a Hercules film for its American release because the viewers here are not as familiar with the character of Maciste but seeing as how he is basically just an Italian version of the Greek hero it is not really that big a deal. Though it is kind of funny how people complain and moan about the amount of sequels made today when there were sometimes two Hercules films released in the same year and then you add the Maciste films to the mix and you could see three films featuring a Hercules type character at your local cinema. The Maciste character is played by a guy who was a stunt double for Steve Reeves and he sort of looks the part but he is the smallest of the Hercules I have seen. He does okay and the film has its moments but gets bogged down during what should be an epic showdown to close the film.The story has a kingdom that requires its citizenry be sacrificed to the people of the moon who lurk in the cave of death. People in the kingdom tire of this tradition and so they seek the legendary hero Maciste or Hercules if you prefer so that he might aid them and help them defeat this threat once and for all. Unfortunately the queen of this land is evil and works with the moon people and thus tries her best to stop Maciste from completing his goals. She also plans to sacrifice her own sister to the horrible abominations in the mountain.This made for a good episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 but I am surprised they did not say anything regarding the fact this was not a true Hercules film. I guess I can understand as it is not as obvious that this was not really a Hercules film. Now that film that was packaged as a Sinbad film they did was obvious as nothing about it remotely resembled a Sinbad movie. This one features the strong bearded hero and features an evil queen who falls for the hero so it pretty much is like most of the actual Hercules films. Though Crow summed up the looks of this Hercules the best by calling him Super Bob Vila!This one has its moments but the whole film bogs down near the end during the climatic sandstorm sequence. I am pretty sure they were just trying to pad the film but there are plenty of films that do not have a long running time why they felt the need to show us the queen running through the storm then Hercules running through the storm and then the people in the kingdom running through the storm is beyond me. Did I say running? I meant stumbling. All this time showing us this and the actual fight with the moon people is over in the blink of any eye! This one featured a lot more action up to the point of the sandstorm though and would be more tolerable if that scene had been trimmed down significantly and the fight at the end made to look more epic.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the other reviewers remarked that Alan Steele had 2nd string written all over him. That's actually a fair summary of the quality of HVTMM. That doesn't mean the film isn't good silly disposable fun. However a couple of things might annoy the viewer enough to keep him from enjoying the film for what it is. It all depends on how high your 'irritation' threshold is set. For onethe dubbing job as usual for these things makes you want to poke your own eardrums out with a screwdriver. Where do they get these ESL voice actors and why do they mix their voices in such a screwy way? I could get better voice quality and overtones on a wax cylinder recording!The soundtrack has similar problems for instance at one point AlanHerc is riding cross country on horseback on a rescue mission with no enemies yet in sight and the orchestra is thundering along with such an overblown frenzy that in the MST3K version Tom Servo has to yell out WHOA!! SERGEI!!! KEEP IT DOWN!!!!!For a third the director has an unfortunate tendency to linger on closeups of Herc's heaving sweating pecs a few seconds too long there are definite overt juvenile homo eroticgay overtones here more so than most Herc films. I mean Steve Reeves flexed and posed constantly in his films but the camera never fixated on his oiled left pec and nipple for 20 seconds at a time. Or maybe I just have a dirty mind.But there are some enjoyable action sequences here. The guy playing Herc is pretty loose and athletic even if his build is much rawer and less polished than Reeves he throws badguy soldiers around as if they were made of paper mache he runs up flights of stairs rides horseback jumps off boulders picks up things and throws them etc. with convincing energy and enthusiasm AND he looks as if he's having a good time while he's doing it. This is in distinct contrast to some of the later HercMaciste films where the lead actor is basically a pretty boy Ken doll who can barely get out of his own way.And the casting choice for the evil Queen was great  the actress has a brittle vulpine quality perfect for the character and she radiates greed hunger and lust without saying a word. She's a complete ham of course but she is completely suitable for the part  you don't doubt for a moment even with tineared dubbed dialog being stuck in her mouth that she would sell her own sister down the river and enslave all of mankind just so she can ...um I guess rule the world or chain Herc to her bed or keep herself in blue eyeshadow or something. Yes the sandstorm scene does drag on for a bit  I think the director was going for a sense of overwhelming elemental power and destruction being channeled by the Moon Men against the villagers and it starts out doing that pretty well however he ended up spending so much money and time on special effects for the sequence that he and the editors felt they had to use every last bit of film they shot in order to justify it. But once Herc gets into the mountain there's three nice little bits in a row that serve as a nice payoff to the endless sandstorm sequence Herc matches his strength against the rock monsters the sister is rescued and the Moon Queen reverts back to a corpse with a chilling scream of anger and finally the Queen gets her comeuppance as she whines and complains in a manner worthy of her character. The MST3K version of this film is hilarious but if you find the original in a bargain bin somewhere for 2.50 and you like to collect swordandsandal epics for viewing on a lazy Sunday afternoon Hercules Against the Moon Men would be a good choice.".

	schema:headline " A fastpaced adventure apart from that sandstorm sequence";
	schema:reviewBody "A delightful adventure romp which mixes in traditional mythology with some scifi themes but loses its way somewhat towards the ending. Probably the biggest problem is that it looks like the filming ran short of the expected running time and lots of stock footage and the infamous interminable sandstorm scene was clumsily inserted to make the movie last longer. They succeeded but sitting through these sections is a real bore. Thankfully they are only part of the movie and the rest is a lot of fun to sit through.The opening scene witnesses a miniature meteorite crashing into a mountain and causing chaos. Moving forward hundreds of years we learn of a race of aliens living in the mountain who require sacrifices to stay alive. They also happen to be astrologers who predict a coming catastrophe through which they will inherit the earth and mankind will be wiped out. A local village is forced to supply sacrificial victims because evil queen Selena is in cahoots with the aliens and has been promised eternal life if she helps them. Luckily an elder has called in hero Hercules to sort out the problem.Here Alan Steel enters the picture as Hercules. Steel was one of the many actors to star in these peplum movies but is one of the less wellknown as he only appeared in about halfadozen titles before going on to other things. Like Kirk Morris Steel is a native Italian who seems to have been picked for the genre because of his uncanny resemblance to Steve Reeves! Certainly his acting skills aren't up to much although that's not a necessity but his hulking figure is just right for the genre. Thankfully Steel has late genre veteran director Giacomo Gentilomo to direct him and Gentilomo makes a good job of things in particular the action scenes are wellchoreographed and a lot of fun to watch.As Hercules nears the village he is pounced on by a pack of men hungry for his blood. What a welcome! He quickly fights them off before meeting up with a village elder who wants him to lead a rebellion. They hide in secret underground tunnels but the old man is impaled by a wall of spikes in a hilarious scene! Hercules himself is thrown into a pit which rapidly fills with water but manages to break out through sheer strength alone. Now apparently at this point Hercules fights off a monster a fight which is referenced a couple of times in other reviews and later in the film. For whatever reason this fight is missing in the Something Weird version I saw this annoys me pretty much because I enjoy a good monster fight as much as the next person. Having defeated his enemy Hercules proceeds to bend a few bars before rescuing an innocent prince from an assassination attempt. This prince figures predominantly in the movie but his role is unknown  he doesn't actually do anything useful just keeps getting captured and needing to be rescued! The plot develops as this point introducing a number of superfluous female characters who generally need rescuing and are impossibly busty to boot. Hercules fights off a load of guards before walking into a trap when a net is thrown over him. He's put in a closingspike trap which is kind of like one of those jungle traps they had in those Italian cannibal films except that it works a lot slower and is manpowered instead of automatic. After much straining and sweating he escapes to win the heart of queen Selena.Selena has obviously seen HERCULES UNCHAINED so slips Hercules a drink containing a potion to make him love her. Luckily he's been forewarned of this so only pretends to drink it and goes along with Selena for a time before escaping. At this point a rebellion attacks the palace and all the remaining characters flee to the Mountain of Death where the Moon Men are hiding. Then there's that dratted sandstorm which goes on for an age plus inserted weather footage of lightning and rough seas. Eventually Hercules fights off the rockmen who act as a guard throws the Moon Man yes there was only one! to his death and rescues everyone before destroying the mountain. In the end he rides off into the sunset with his new girlfriend! My favourite parts of this movie were the ones involving the Mountain of Death and its inhabitants. The Moon Man is a tall golden scarylooking dude with a skullmask and a bad temper. The rockmen are a hilarious bunch of shambling idiots who race around and crush people to death that is before Hercules arrives and starts throwing them around like dolls! Also lurking in the background is an alien queen who is revived by drops of blood like Barbara Steele in BLACK Sunday. After the plan is foiled she rots away like all good movie vampires. The special effects are limited in this movie but plentiful and entertaining with lots of explosions and roaring fire at the end. As I mentioned the action is staged well and Hercules is given lots of fighting of guards monsters traps etc. and heroic things to do uprooting trees pillars etc..Anna Maria Polani is pretty good as the evil Selena a totally ruthless and hateable character who has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  that's what I like in my villains! Jany Clair in comparison is rather insipid as Agar a slave girl who falls in love with Hercules and runs around simpering after him. This movie contains music stolen from another peplum film possibly MACISTE IN HELL which is used in the opening credits. It's a fastpaced adventure which could have been one of the best but is ruined by that pacing problem in the second half. Without the sandstorm it would have been a classic with it it's merely good solid fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Goliath and the Vampires director Giacomo Gentilomo's Hercules Against the Moon Men ranks as a betterthanaverage science fictionfantasy peplum. A swarthy robust Alan Steel aka Sergio Ciani contends with foes both supernatural and human as well as masculine and feminine. Mind you these 1960s peplum outings qualify as an acquired taste that most casual moviegoers ridicule because of the lowbudgets inferior dubbing juvenile plotting and poor thesping. Nevertheless if you enjoy this kind of farfetch nonsense Hercules Against the Moon Men represents one of the better examples of the genre. The eponymous villains look terrific when they show up about halfway through this 88minute melodrama. Moreover they appear in numbers not just two or three. The torture contraption that Hercules is placed in is elaborate and Gentilomo stages the action with aplomb. The villains are thoroughly wicked while the heroes are wholesale and virtuous.The people of the ancient kingdom of Samara suffer under the despotic rule of tyrant Queen Samara Jany Clair of 79 A.D. who has allied herself with aliens that crashed into Mount Samara one night and have taken over a mountain. They demand human sacrifices every third moon from Queen Samara and she obliges them with the children of her subjects. The Moon Men plan to dominate the world one day as soon as their Queen Selene is resurrected and they have promised Queen Samara all the riches in the world. Queen Samara's elderly adviser Gladius Nando Tamberlani of Cleopatra's Daughter who faithfully served her late father urges her to summon Hercules so her subjects no longer have to face the prospect of more human sacrifices. Naturally Queen Samara not only rebukes Gladius but she also dispatches her best warriors to ambush Hercules.When we first see Hercules the musclebound man is riding a white horse. Suddenly he finds himself beset by assailants. Uprooting a tree he wields it like a battering ram to repulse them. Gladius' daughter Agar Anna Maria Polani of 1965 Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus shows up afterwards and brings the strong man to the palace to confer with her father. Initially Hercules believes that his assailants were thieves who thought they were preying on a wealthy merchant with a fat purse. Gladius knows better. After they discuss the situation Gladius decides to escort Hercules out of the palace by a different route so as not to arouse suspicion. Gladius takes a secret passage but evil Queen Samar has eavesdropped on him and prepared a homicidal reception for them. No sooner have they entered the passage than Queen Samar's henchmen trigger a cluster of spears that impale poor Gladius and kill him. At the same time Hercules plunges through a trap door in the floor and nearly drowns in a chamber when water gushes into it. Our brawny hero smashes his way out of his death trap. No sooner has he escaped than he encounters a huge ape with fangs. Of course the ape is really a man in a ridiculous suit. Hercules defeats him in short order and breaks out.Queen Samara cannot believe the resilience of Hercules. Meantime she has to prepare another human sacrifice and plans to offer up her sister Princess Billis Delia D'Alberti of Fellini's Intervista for the next one. The princess doesn't have a clue about her older sister's plans for her. Indeed she seeks Queen Samara's permission to marry the son of one of the noblest families in the kingdom Darix JeanPierre Honor of Joy House who is just as eager to wed her. Queen Samara's men attack Darix and nearly kill him. He manages to escape but he is in critical condition. Meantime one of the Moon Men priests materializes in Queen Samara's chambers and reminds her that Hercules must be destroyed at all costs. Furthermore he explains that they need Billis because she bears a striking resemblance to their Queen Selene. Later the Moon Men priest explains to Samar about the significance of the next sacrifice. When the planet Saturn comes into conjunction with Mars and under the evil influence of Uranus then will occur unimaginable disasters. The oceans will rise and mountains will crumble and inexorably our moon will draw near the earth. After a long night of sleep we shall become the masters of the earth. Hercules sets out to save Billis but he finds himself caught in a trap. Queen Samar puts Hercules in chains and places him into a contraption that has two wings that fold inward with sharp knives on them. She has chained slaves to a huge wheel and they are beaten mercilessly. Each turn of the wheel by hand brings the knives closer to Hercules. Gentilomo does a good job of generating a modicum of suspense by showing the knives getting closer to Hercules' body. Eventually Hercules exerts his mighty strength and breaks the contraption. Rather than kill him on the spot Queen Samar takes him to her quarters where she tries to drug him. Shrewdly Hercules plays along with the Queen and fools her into believing that he is her slave. Queen Samar captures Darix once again and at Hercules' prompting plans to kill him. Of course Hercules doesn't let this happen. The wicked queen flees to the Moon Men and they kill her.The screenplay by Arpad DeRiso of Churchill's Leopards Giacomo Gentilomo Angelo Sangermano of Zorro the Fox and Nino Scolaro of Revenge of Ursus not only adheres to formula but also contains a happy ending. The action is presented in straightforward fashion without flashbacks. Alan Steel looks like he has been basted with oil to make his muscles bulge. Altogether he makes a worthwhile Hercules and Hercules Against the Moon Men is better than you might expect.".

	schema:reviewBody "The evil Queen Samara is offering up her subjects as sacrifices to the aliens that inhabit a local mountain. The aliens hope to use the blood of their victims to resurrect their own queen at least I think that's the plan. The citizens quite naturally grow weary of sending their daughters off to die and summon Hercules for help. Can Herc avoid Queen Samara's clutches and defeat the aliens of the mountain and their rockmonster minions?Hercules Against the Moon Men is by no means a great movie but it is more fun than it's IMDb rating 2.6 would indicate. Alan Steel makes for an entertaining Hercules. He plays Hercules in a little more lighthearted manner than the more iconic Steve Reeves. He is also more agile than most of the musclebound dudes who would play Herc so he's got that going for him as well. If it weren't for that Georgia clay colored bronzer Steel would be an almost perfect Hercules. Speaking of perfect Jany Clair's Queen Samara is also just about perfect  perfectly evil. She on a big time power trip and doesn't care who has to die to get what she wants. And what about those dresses? I didn't realize they had such shiny sequined evening gowns in ancient Greece or wherever they are. They look like the dresses Ginger wore on Giligan's Island. The owl headed aliens are pretty cool  even if they pose no real threat to Hercules once he gets near them. They fold like a tent in a stiff breeze. Finally there are enough fight scenes and shows of strength from Hercules to make the whole thing mildly entertaining. Two of my favorite moments have to be Herc's fight against the ape with the dental issues and Herc's escape from the spiked jaws of death. I've probably seen Hercules Against the Moon Men at least a dozen times over the years. Usually with the MST3k commentary but on occasion on its own. While the MST3K commentary is often quite funny I cannot agree with their assessment that its one of the worst movies they watched. It's too entertaining and too much fun for that. And the sandstorm scene they go on and on about really isn't that bad. Sure it probably overstays its welcome but it's no rock climbing if you know what I mean.".

He does however fight their powers and their rock men army.The film is barely mildly entertaining to watch normally  but if you watch in fastforward it's pretty funny. Watch it in fast motion when Herc is strapped to the spikes... he looks like he's almost hyperventilating. Haha.The ending really is sandy as other have mentioned. I didn't find as bad as some of the other reviews read but it is truly one heck of a sandstorm.2.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Hercules Against The Moon Men doesn't deserve a 2 out of 10. It doesn't deserve an Oscar either but it isn't THAT bad. It's not good but it is at least entertaining. I have seen plenty of bad films that often insult your intelligence and make no sense but this film though incompetent in most areasin no way feels like a slap in the face like say Troll 2 or Howard the Duck. This movie tries to be a mixture of a Mythical Epic like Clash of the Titans and 50's Scifi like The Day the Earth Stood Still. And we get the bestor best worst of both worlds. The development of the characters and their relationships are almost nonexistent yet they still try to pass it off like they are growing i.e. a girl falls in love with Hercules even though they have known each other for a total of 12 minutes. The aliens are absolutely ridiculous but they look as if effort were put into them unlike other movie monsters like the goblins from Troll 2. The acting and dialogue are very wooden but you can at least say some work was put into it unlike say the actors from Troll 2have I mentioned how much I hate Troll 2?. It doesn't try to be historically accurate or anything it just tries to be exactly what it promises Hercules fighting a bunch of aliens and that's exactly what it is and nothing more. I would say check this movie out if you wanna see a poorly done Bmovie that you and your friends can laugh at.".

While there are some interesting special effects and some fascinating action sequences reminding me of the Indiana Jones movies this is still one of those cheaply made gladiator movies that Peter Graves made fun of in the comedy movie Airplane!Certainly there are some tense moments such as the exploration of the cave where the moon men allegedly live and a scene where Hercules is placed in this giant knife filled contraption that is closing up on him. It's all about seeing Steel without his shirt on and the knife contraption is a variation of what happened to the biblical hero Samson. I don't watch these movies very often because they all seem to be of the same pattern. The dubbing is so bad that it appears that the actual Italian actors were speaking English phonetically while some unknown American actor or actress dubbed in the lines later. The sound is tinny and a musical score in the background is inappropriate and annoying. The head of the Moon Man creatures is another one of those ridiculous looking monsters and when the Queen's sister is made a sacrifice for the walking rocks they all begin to look like a chorus line of unpainted Gumby's. As for the Evil Queen the less said about her acting on screen and the dubber the better. Still these movies are a lot of fun to watch if you're in the mood to laugh at something and ultimately they are a good time filler that does not challenge the brain. Fortunately being in the public domain these cells can be purchased cheaply but I must warn you some of the prints are truly weak.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I'm watching people in gowns and togas floundering about in a sandstorm. There's no character development no plot advancement and very little dialog just people struggling to move forward against the biting wind. Not that they're making much progress I believe they pass the same fallen tree three times. Then again it might be different groups of actors all that sand makes it hard to tell who's who. I'm not exactly sure why these people are braving the storm. True the cave with the alien monsters is up ahead but with the exception of Hercules you would think that would be reason for them to go the opposite direction. I'm also not sure what the point of this scene is. It serves no real purpose and it's about as exciting as a monthly budget meeting.The whole movie is kind of like that come to think of it. No it's not all as bad as the sandstorm. But it's far from exciting and it lacks any real reason for being other than making some money off of unsuspecting kids who figured that Hercules  aliens must equal awesome. Of course these kids have it better than the ones in the movie. They're being sacrificed to the moon men so the monsters won't destroy their city. Now child sacrifice may sound like the kind of thing that has no place in a children's movie but in this case the sacrifice merely involves them being thrown into a glowing doorway cut into the mountainside.Now the people don't like giving their children to the unseen moon men but they're far too weak to fight back. So when Hercules arrives everyone's happy. Everyone that is except Queen Samara because she's made a secret deal with the moon men to become queen of the world. Later on it becomes apparent she should have asked a few more questions about how the whole world domination plot works out but for now she and her cronies do their best to prevent Hercules from reaching the moon men's lair alive.Pretty simple right? Except that the people in this movie aren't particularly bright. Hercules and his allies in the royal court don't immediately realize that the Queen is allied with these monsters. It then takes Queen Samara a bit longer to realize that her younger sister and her sister's fianc are helping Hercules. And it's not until much later that the good guys realize that the queen realizes that they know she's never mind. There's also a part where the Queen uses her magical ability to control men on Hercules. This scene becomes rather confusing because even though it's been established beforehand that Hercules is only pretending to be charmed the acting is so hammy as to make you wonder.The poor acting may have something to do with the fact that the star Alan Steel was a professional bodybuilder rather than a professional actor. Oh and Alan Steel isn't his real name. It's actually something Italian. Yes Hercules Against the Moon Men was made in Italy with an Italian cast and has been poorly dubbed into English.Is there anything else to say about this movie? Let's see Ah in one scene Hercules escapes a dungeon by bending the iron bars but later he's helpless against a net made of ordinary rope. Also let it be noted that the leader of the monsters bears an uncanny resemblance to a gilded statue of Woodsy Owl. Finally let me say that I was deeply offended by the skirts in this movie. The men's were shorter than the women's. I'm not sure what this production needed more a new screenplay or some pants.".

Now as far as this movie was concerned I will just say that it had a good plot adequate acting and some nice cinematography. Likewise the dubbing from Italian to English was also quite good.

	schema:headline " The eternal sandstorm! I guess that would make this a 'gritty' movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "That sandstorm left the biggest impression on my psyche where this film is concerned. Whenever I think about it images of blowing sand obscure the plot line and the corny acting. Deep hurting! Deep hurting!Basically I guess these guys in stupid masks play moon men who came down to Earthhow this is never made clear and live in caves on this mountain. They demand human sacrifices from the country of Samar or else they'll...ummm...what? I was never sure about that one. Anyhoo the Queen of Samar is actively supplying sacrificial fodder for these things and their living rock guardsyou'd have to be made of stone not to laugh at those bad costumes! so that she can have tons of power and stay young and beautiful always. Again it was never explained how the moon guys were going to give her these things. That would probably be because they always intended to betray her and she was just too stupid to see that.The desperate people of Samar call on the 'mighty hero' Hercules to save them from the moon men. This is one thing that has always bothered mefor centuries Hercules has been considered a hero. But the truth is this guy was a total jerk. Oh wait a minute..Never mind that's pretty much the definition of a hero anyway. So the well oiled and waxed Alan Steel rides into town as the eponymous Hercules and promptly blows it. He can't even save this old guy that he's withor maybe he just didn't want to and the geezer gets whacked by a wall of blades.

	onyx:emotionText "That sandstorm left the biggest impression on my psyche where this film is concerned. Whenever I think about it images of blowing sand obscure the plot line and the corny acting. Deep hurting! Deep hurting!Basically I guess these guys in stupid masks play moon men who came down to Earthhow this is never made clear and live in caves on this mountain. They demand human sacrifices from the country of Samar or else they'll...ummm...what? I was never sure about that one. Anyhoo the Queen of Samar is actively supplying sacrificial fodder for these things and their living rock guardsyou'd have to be made of stone not to laugh at those bad costumes! so that she can have tons of power and stay young and beautiful always. Again it was never explained how the moon guys were going to give her these things. That would probably be because they always intended to betray her and she was just too stupid to see that.The desperate people of Samar call on the 'mighty hero' Hercules to save them from the moon men. This is one thing that has always bothered mefor centuries Hercules has been considered a hero. But the truth is this guy was a total jerk. Oh wait a minute..Never mind that's pretty much the definition of a hero anyway. So the well oiled and waxed Alan Steel rides into town as the eponymous Hercules and promptly blows it. He can't even save this old guy that he's withor maybe he just didn't want to and the geezer gets whacked by a wall of blades.

I noticed it along with a few other MHC videos when I was at the video store and since I had a rentonegetonefree coupon and like suspense I decided to check it out.First and most important I liked it!  Knowing it was a TV movie I didn't go into it expecting Citizen Kane.'  I haven't read the book and I'm embarrassed to say it but I didn't figure out the ending.  Yes I'm pretty dense so I guess you have to take that into account.  It's definitely one of the most heinously clichfilled movies I've ever seen but I really don't think it matters.  It's entertaining.The story as told in the movie is of a now collegeaged woman named Laurie who was kidnapped and molested when she was a little girl.  She has now developed multiple personalities to cope with it and when an English professor she is close to is killed she's the main suspect.  Her sister and a psychiatrist try to help her.  The weakest part of the movie is the return of the couple who kidnapped Laurie.  Maybe this part of the plot is covered better in the novel because what's here seems to have some gaps.  It was still interesting but it's one of those things where I wonder if the director had to trim the movie down and cut out the part that explained what the hell the deal was.Other than that I thought the acting was pretty good.  I liked Andrea Roth as the older sister and Kim Schraner as Laurie was good at doing the multiple personality thing except for several moments of probably unintentional complete outofcontrol cheesiness.  But I think they fit right in.  The movie's biggest bonus is that the psychiatrist is played by Michael Shanks from Stargate SG1 who I didn't realize was in the movie when I rented it The video box gives Nastassja Kinski top billing and she is in very few scenes.  He actually has a pretty big role in the movie which is fine with me because as I was watching I realized he's almost goodlooking enough to make me pass out.  In fact I'm now in favor of human cloning.So if you like suspensemystery have a rentonegetonefree coupon and want to give your brain a break and drool over Michael Shanks for 90 minutes I recommend it!".

She just didn't have much to do.Michael Shanks as the psychiatrist has the shining role in this film.  I had never seen him in anything before but came away thinking he is one to watch.  I believe the actress with the lead role was Kim Schraner.  NOT one to watch.  Her performance was standard and cliche. Someone should have told her Playing someone with a multiple personality disorder does not mean you need to slam your two palms on either side of your head every time a new 'alter' appears.The plotline with the tv evangelist was a little murky.  I still do not entirely understand what happened with that.  I guess you had to read the book.  For me Mary Higgins Clark writes great suspense but with cardboard characters.  With the exception of Michael Shanks the cast of this movie largely fulfills that prerequisite.  I exempt Nastassja because her part was so peripheral.An average but quick paced tv melodrama.".

This is the first time in my admittedly limited viewing of Bollywood films that I've encountered a star doing her or his own singing. However checking her other film credits she did so fairly often. She did hardly any dancing in this film though and sang a couple of numbers seated at a piano. I also seemed to detect a Latin influence in the music particularly in the rhythms. I'm reminded of an even more pronounced influence of Latin music i.e. the nightclub scene in Shree 420. All three of her suitors in this film are good guys but I won't spoil the ending by divulging who does or doesn't get the girl. However both my viewing companion and myself were disappointed by the ending of the film  which is not to say it was inappropriate for the time and melodramatic moral tone of the film. The least sympathetic character in the film is the domineering older sister and I was hoping that Raj would have a final showdown with her years later when he returned. Despite the serious situations in the film the young Raj Kapoor manages to fit in some of his trademark high spirits. I would have to say this was not one of his finer films.".

	schema:reviewBody "DASTAN 1950 could have been a truly haunting classic had its director Abdur Rashid Kardar approached it with the fatalistic style of his brotherinlaw Mehboob Khan fyi Kardar's wife Hindi film actress Bahar Akhtar was the elder sister of Mehboob Khan's 2nd wife Sardar Akhtar the original Mother India in Mehboob's AURAT1940. This film is a Hindi remake of the 1948 Hollywood film ENCHANTMENT starring David Niven Teresa Wright and Jayne Meadows. Comparing the two films DASTAN is actually the slightly better of the two films. However DASTAN was designated to spotlight the legendary Hindi film heroine Suraiya she sang her own songs ! In spite of this almost prodigious talent for a screen heroine Suraiya is overshadowed by the overwhelmingly stunning screen presence of Veena a Hindi film star in her own right. Veena born Tajour Sultana in Quetta Balochistan was the most beautiful actress in the history of Hindi cinema second to none. Veena was a screen siren like no other in that her bewitching looks combined with her powerful voice and modulated style of delivering dialogues made her leading men come across as boys. And this film is no exception...Even with big name heroes of that era Raj Kapoor Suresh real name Nasim Ahmad and Al Nasir Veena's real life husband. A real oddity of casting has Al Nasir playing his wife's brother in this film in Indian culture especially of that era this would have raised some eyebrows. When Suraiya's character 'Indira' has her climactic scene in which she stands up to Veena's 'Rani' Veena owns the scene just by the glare in her eyes. Veena was too powerful a screen presence for any of her costars throughout her 40 plus year acting career. This film is highly recommended in it's own right but a must see to behold the Hindi screen siren Veena. DASTAN was the 3rd highest grossing film of 1950 earning over Rs. 65 Lakhs just behind SAMADHI Rs. 75 Lakhs and BABUL Rs. 70 Lakhs in the year 1950 6575 Lakh rupees would be like Rs. 650750 Crores in 2015. Photographs of Veena available via the internet do NOT do her justice. Viewers would have to see her films in good quality prints to grasp Veena's beauty. DASTAN is one of them...While AFSANA 1951 costarring Ashok Kumar  Pran NAJMA 1943 costarring Ashok Kumar  Yakub and HUMAYUN 1945 costarring Ashok Kumar  Nargis are notably some others in this latter film Veena's character portrayal summed up her entire screen persona She was hard enough to kill you and soft enough to disarm you...".

That is when you make up a story involving real life characters. The book this movie was based upon was writing a few years back by Melvin Van Peebles. The story is nothing more that a fictional account dealing with real life people. It's a movie. Not a documentary. So please keep this in mind when watching it. But the dramatic elements and acting were quite good. I enjoyed it as a drama. If you want to learn about the Black Panther Party this is a good launching pad. From here I suggest you go to your local library and study up on these revolutionaries who tried to make some decent changes to the poor communities but were sabotaged by the F.B.I. and their army of rats and snitches.I thought it was a bold step for Mr. Van Peebles to try and make a mainstream movie about a group of local heroes who have been buried by the mainstream and the far right. Stars Kadeem Hardison Bokeem Woodbine Joe Don Baker Courtney B. Vance Chris Rock Bobby Brown and Angela Bassett. Directed by Mario Van Peebles.

	schema:reviewBody "1960's inner city America.  Tired of noneffective prayer meetings vigils and pleas to God a group within the black community decide to take more direct action.  Taking the principles of Malcolm X the group study their rights and begin to bear arms and take a stand against the inequality and the brutality towards their community.The subject is worthy of a film and is an interesting piece of civil rights history but this film is not the one to do it.  The blame for much of this much sadly rest with Peebles in his role as director.  If Spike Lee and Denzel Washington could be seen as the black Alist then Peebles must be very much a Clist star and his films are often worthy of B or C grades. This is the problem here the film is not great as a film.  It is told in a simplistic fist raising way that takes away from the impact of it as reality.  The focus on Judge's involvement rather than the story of the movement itself turning the film into more of a action film than one of historical interest.This is a shame as even embellished with problack slant the subject would have been interesting.  As it is the fact about whether this was true or not didn't matter to me because I didn't get the impression of history I got told a story of a man who tries to act as a mole for the group while some militant group spreads throughout the country.  It's a real shame  cause that's not the story I was hoping to be told.If Peebles is a Clist member then the rest of the cast comes across like very much a second rate version of Malcolm X.  Hardison is a poor comic never mind requiring him to do a dramatic role.  Chong is OK as Huey but he isn't really well served by a film that doesn't pull back well enough and see what the panthers grow to become and the finally' bit at the end doesn't cut it.  Generally the cast feel like they wouldn't be out of place in a TVM and their performances mostly reflect that.  Again it is a shame but it's hard not to blame the material for their inability to rise above it.Overall this film was a major letdown for me.  I was expecting or hoping for a film that had some historical context and would have the force and impact of Malcolm X.  Sadly I was expecting too much from it and this would have been better enjoyed as a thriller that happens to be set in the middle of a Panther cell rather than anything else.".

	schema:headline " simplistic but a thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Panther's depictions of the Black Panther Party for Self Defense and the opposing white establishment are perhaps a bit simplistic nevertheless it made the movie no less thrilling.Mario Van Peebles uses television footage from the civil rights struggles in the 1960s to demonstrate why the Black Panther Party came into existence. The scenes of police brutality and the Party standing up to the police were shot well and enable the viewer to grasp the fear as well as frustration of the times.  Whether or not the film portrays an accurate account of history and the reasoning behind the creation of the Party is debatable.  Of course no film is completely historically accurate and most producers writers and directors have their own agenda when making a film.  However all that being said it is not difficult to believe that the 'white' establishment behaved either exactly or near to the way it is depicted in the film.  We need only read our history books newspapers and watch footage some of which was shown in the film of the 'white' establishment's appalling actions during that period and indeed for centuries before that to determine that the depictions of overt racism and inhumane treatment dished out by the police and others in the film were not far fetched.One other fact to consider is that the Panthers were considered an enemy to the established order and therefore the propaganda surrounding the history of the Party depicts them as worse than they actually were.  The film I believe breaks those negative images down. It goes beyond the headlines of the time and depicts the problems facing black Americans then and indeed to some extent now.  Indeed the most impressive aspect of the film is how it portrayed the need for the Black Panther Movement.  One finds it difficult to advocate violence however when one's life is on the line and those who are meant to protect are the perpetrators then the right to defend oneself is the right of every person.  The most powerful message this film sends is that the Panther Party was the result of a need not simply a desire.The film may not be 'completely historically accurate' however it does present a different view of the Panther Party and its objectives one that is long overdue.  This film is a must see!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Black Panthers were a fascinating but enigmatic force of the 1960s. Here was a militant organization of black youths that captured the imagination of blacks in the 1960s who had grown impatient with Dr. King's stance of passive resistance. They brought with them the ideal of protecting their own and encouraging young blacks to have pride in themselves. Having said that I have no doubt that a great movie about The Black Panthers is yet to be made.Mario Van Peeble's 'Panther' is not that movie. It's a bloated confused epic more intent on silly conspiracy theories then on facts. It purports to give us and inside look at how the party was founded and how the FBI brought it down but it wastes time on silly plot devices involving the Mafia.The movie's first fatal flaw is that it is narrated from the point of view of a fictional character named Judge. That makes it hard for the viewer to get a foothold in the story. The opening scenes are very effective showing how Bobby Seal and Huey Newton met in a coffee shop one day and began to plan their strategy. I would like to have seen more scenes between these two then maybe I could have made my own assessments about them. We never really get to understand them or what fueled their fire. This movie is more interested in theatrics then in historical accuracy.The movie uses the preposterous theory that J. Edgar Hoover dumped drugs into the black neighborhoods in order to bring about its downfall. The ending scenes are just plain stupid a shootout in a warehouse with the FBI as they duck behind boxes. It seems easier to drag out an action scene then it does to create good drama. These scenes seem like a copout. In reality the party was brought down by pressure and by a conflict of ideas.'Malcolm X' the best film of 1992 was about personalities and worked because we saw the change in Malcolm from the street hood to an inmate and ultimately a national leader. 'Panther' keeps us at arms length. We never understand the people that we see on screen. Who were these men? What were they fighting for? What motivated them? What went on personally between them that brought them down? These are questions that Peebles apparently doesn't know how to answer.".

The same goes for Bokeem Woodbine's character in this movie. The only flaw is that they leave out a few key elements that lead to their downfall but other than that I have no real gripe with this film. I thought that Mario Van Peebles did the best he could with the material he was given but we have to understand that movies are edited just like books are edited so certain information that might have made a difference in the story are left out causing some scenes in the movie to be a little vague. You can always read about the Black Panthers if you want to know more about them. This movie is worthy of being in your collection despite the little flaws.

As a resident of Oakland it was absolutely factual that drugs were put into the community to destabilize it. COINTELPRO had insurrectionists cast into the Black Panthers as well as Campus student movements. The FBI sought the downfall of Martin Luther King and celebrated on the day of his assassination. Not all parties were in cahoots but he was thought of as a communist agitator. Funny how no major motion picture of him was done following JFK isn't it? Some aspects were quite fictitious the Judge character and the shootout in the warehouse as well. The Panthers were considered an enemy to the established order and it was seeded with inside people to ferment internal conflict. The film may not be completely historically accurate but it does portray the need then and now for a Black Panther Movement. The concept of Government conspiracy isn't new see Operation Mongoose Operation Northwoods Watergate IranContra etc. this was a flawed but intriguing film about an organization that sought to improve the conditions of the community.

Eh ? Novel ? By definition novels are works of fiction so if the screenplay is based on a novel that means its not a true story Something else I noticed in the credits were some bizarre casting choices with well regarded actors like Joe Don Baker and Angela Bassett appearing alongside non actors like Chris Rock and Bobby Brown and as can be expected the performances are very hit and miss . In fact the casting matches Mario Van Pebbles directing perfectly since one moment it feels like a farcical comedy and the next moment a polemical diatribe on race and a moment later a docudrama . I doubt if this was Van Pebbles intention  but I will give him credit since he probably upset everyone regardless of race by painting nearly every single white person as being racist while nearly every black person is an anchronistic home boy from the 1990s . Just as well noone thinks this is a true story . Or do they ?".

The four friends of the title are thoughtful Danilo a Yugoslavian immigrant with dreams of being a writer and a scholar Tom goodlooking and athletic who is bound for the army cautious David who has mixed feelings about staying in town and joining the family mortuary business and lovely ditzy exasperating Georgia who tries to inspire all of them with her longings for a life of Bohemian adventure. It is told through the eyes of Danilo whose story is loosely based on the writer Tesich's own life growing up in Bloomington Indiana.";

	schema:reviewBody "Behind the nostalgic music we see a young boy get off a train. He is arriving from Yugoslavia to meet his father a man he has not seen in a decade. At the train station we meet the man. He never smiles.Thus we begin our journey into Four Friends Arthur Penn's powerful and amazing film. You may ask why I began my review that way. Well  that is the way the video box describes the film. You may have figured out that the film will be the story of the boy trying to get along with this emotionless man and eventually he will peel away at his cover and expose the kindness.Well if you bought that I've got a bridge I want to sell you. You see modern Hollywood would make that film. Penn has always been an outsider and has never resorted to typical cliched storytelling. He always tells interesting stories about people his credits include Bonnie and Clyde The Chase Alice's Restaurant and the underrated Mickey One and Four Friends is no exception.A typical Hollywood film would focus on the boy who is named Danilo. But Steve Tesich's script only focuses on that for about 4 minutes and then abandons him. We meet the adult Danilo played by Craig Wasson whom you may recognize from Body Double and Nightmare on Elm Street 3 and his friends Tom David and the passionate Georgia.  The movie takes us throughout the Sixties. Now in a lesser film the events would receive the attention. But in Four Friends these events happen but Penn and Tesich is more concerned with character study than plot and I think the film is better that way. We know the events we don't need to dwell on them again.I know I haven't described much of the plot but I don't know if you can describe Four Friends. It's not one of those highconcept films that can be described in a single sentence. It's a film of many moods and textures. It's also a genuinely emotional experience. The final twenty minutes of this film moved me to tears. I'm not ashamed to admit it. Rarely does a film have such power that it can reduce me to tears. The acting is first rate especially by Craig Wasson who seems to be one of the most underused actors working today. This is such a difficult emotional performance and Wasson pulls it off. He should have received an Oscar for this. Another great performance is by Jodi Thelen who has an even more difficult role than Wasson. But she handles it extremely well and gives Georgia a certain dignity most Hollywood actresses wouldn't they'd be too scared to even try they'd be more concerned with image rather than giving a great performance that's not what acting is about. She also deserved an Oscar.Four Friends didn't receive much of a push in 1981. Maybe people just didn't have the emotional capacity to handle it. And clueless executives couldn't push it as another American Graffiti it lacks the wallop of Four Friends. So they let it die. Too bad for this is one of the very best films of the 1980s a decade where more and more slick trash was created and great art like this was without a home. I ask you to give this film a chance. out of 4 stars".

Some of the dialogue spoken between the characters is like poetry and some of it is poetry. Craig Wasson one of my favorite actors...he's a natural actor never fake plays Danilo with such passion that's it easy to believe that he is an immigrant that comes to love America. This is on my list of top 10 best films of all time. Anyone who has seen this movie PLEASE write me!

This is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was originally released. I just ordered a copy of it on DVD and paid for overnight shipping and can't wait for it to arrive. It is uplifting at times and also very dark and somewhat disturbing. It's a story of a closeknit band of regular kids growing up in the inner city and makes one feel as though they are actually sitting on the sidelines rather than watching on a movie screen or television. Hard to explain but it is something that must be experienced. The story starts at childhood and tracks the lives of the four main characters through high school and as they embark on their separate journeys in life. The entire cast did an incredible job and it's by far the best work of Jodi Thelen's career. I'm hoping that the DVD lives up to my memory and plan on watching it this Friday with a good friend.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was born in 1984. I grew up in the '90s. And one day I may grow attached to an appealingly wistful but ultimately mediocre and messy film about that decade.That's just what FOUR FRIENDS is a mediocre and messy film about the '60s that I can imagine might hold some sentimental value to a person who has been there. But sentimental value aside FOUR FRIENDS is an unfortunate misfire of a motion picture.I've seen Penn's own BONNIE AND CLYDE as well as countless other American and international films from the 1960s. I've read Joe Boyd's WHITE BICYCLES MAKING MUSIC IN THE '60S. I like some '60s musicians that it isn't even trendy to like these days. I like most things to do with that decade and that is why FOUR FRIENDS was a great disappointment to me.FOUR FRIENDS begins to reveal its problems early on. Within the first twenty minutes we hear brief snippets of narration from two different narrators and the dialogue is so badly mixed that it sounds no different from the narration.Both of these problems continue characters abruptly become narrators and then just as abruptly stop narrating. The movie focuses enough on one character Danilo a Yugoslavian immigrant played by Craig Wasson to have a protagonist but his perspective is constantly undermined by the fact that any character can chime in with narration and then just as soon be forgotten. And the sound mixing remains atrocious throughout. Dialogue is so loud in relation to background noise that sometimes characters don't appear to be speaking in their own voices It's likely that most of the dialogue in this film was recorded in a studio and dubbed. Dubbed dialogue can become convincing if it is mixed well with the background noise and even a bad synching job can be hidden by lowering the dialogue and turning up the background whoever mixed this movie must not have known that.FOUR FRIENDS bears some similarities to Fellini's AMARCORD both are sprawling portraits of an era with multiple narrators and an episodic plot.But in AMARCORD the camera remains at a considerable distance from the actors as if to say that we are seeing a portrait of a place more than a portrait of any individuals and though it does have a central character it shifts its focus regularly enough that its lack of focus on a protagonist doesn't bother us. The switching of narrators isn't jarring for it is consistent with the movie's broad focus.FOUR FRIENDS however is shot in Penn's typical closeupheavy style and the script's focus is clearly on Danilo. The film's vision is not as wide as it seems to believe in a movie called FOUR FRIENDS we really only get to know one of them and we don't even get to know him that well and the three supporting friends are inserted with such inconsistency that it's hard to say whether the movie would have benefited from less of them or more of them. It doesn't give us a complete picture of any characters within its scenes nor does it convince us that the characters have lives outside of its scenes.FOUR FRIENDS also wants to capture both the smaller picture of the lives of four people as well as the bigger picture of the '60s and it fails on this account as well. Most scenes are either too epic or too myopic in scope when Danilo gets caught up in the times it is not in relation to any characters but in relation to generic hippies and activists who walk on screen only to abruptly disappear as if to say oh yeah we forgot to remind you that this movie takes place in the '60s. The beard that Danilo wears during his college years is also highly unconvincing.In the scenes that do attempt to actually blend the personal and the societal the action is too heavyhanded to carry any impact this is the type of movie that explores the generation gap by having a grayhaired minor character engage in a random act of extreme violence that also conveniently works as one of the plots several deus ex machinas.FOUR FRIENDS wants its characters to outline an era but it fails to convince us that they even had a life outside of their formally constructed scenes.".

Jodi Thelen is radiantly beautiful and unforgetable! Why she didn't become a major star after this I will never know. The acting by the entire cast is flawless as is Steve Tisch's script. I always wanted to know how much of the story was autobiographical. But alas Steve is no longer here to answer that question. I have all but worn out my VHS copy of this great movie!

Perhaps he lived some of this if so I'm sorry to say he was inexplicably unable to dramatize any of it convincingly.In fairness he's not helped much here by Arthur Penn a talented director who's done remarkable work in the past BONNIE AND CLYDE LITTLE BIG MAN but fails to inject any energy or verisimilitude into Tesich's narrative. The cast struggles as best they can but are saddled with weak motivation and dialogue. Sympathies should be reserved particularly for Craig Wasson whose morose performance presages the impending quick fade of his leading man career as well as the embarrassingly untethered Jodi Thelen miscast as the film's extremely unlikely 'femme fatale.'It all seems longer than it is and any points made are heavyhanded and obvious.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie many years ago. Maybe I need to rent it and see it again. The gushing ecstatic reviews I'm reading here either mean I missed something very special or that only people who thought this to be the equal of the greatest films ever made bothered to write on it. My recollections of this movie are that it was a disappointingly disjointed story given that Arthur Penn was the director he had previously directed two of my personal favorites Bonnie  Clyde and Little Big Man and Steve Tesich the screenwriter. Coming of age films portraying slices of life can still have coherent plausible story lines even as they try to weave the mundane into a larger story. This movie was lacking in both coherence and plausibility. Tesich's writing so crisp and natural in Breaking Away seemed selfconscious and even pretentious here trying to weave the stories of these four into the broader revolutionary changes sweeping the country in the time frame of the film. I thought Craig Wasson as Danilo was unfortunate casting  he was wooden and unable to portray Danilo as a sympathetic character. Then again maybe that's another problem with the writing. In any event Danilo did not strike me as sympathetic just pathetic  a loser who couldn't move on from the vacuously ethereal Georgia Jodi Thelen. Good lord boy get out some  she's no prize. I'll try to find time to see this again soon and see what I missed and I will watch with an open mind but I sure don't recall anything in this movie worth gushing about  unless it's getting into a brawl with a full stomach.POST SCRIPT I finally go around to taking a look at this again. I have to say my original comments stand. The dialogue was wooden and unnatural. THe broader cultural and social references seemed in large measure extraneous to the story. Not a movie I would recommend.".

	schema:reviewBody "Were the 60s a nonstop blast of idealism hedonism and selfexploration? Were they a violent divisive cataclysm that heralded America's decline? Well this movie makes both points. And what's more it makes them brilliantly probably because it was made by one of the greatest directors Arthur Penn and screenwriters Steve Tesich in film history. Because of the talent involved you never notice how epic and improbable this story is four kids from a grimy Midwestern town think Tesich' hometown of East Chicago Indiana experience every major social upheaval of the 1960s from the civil rights movement to the Summer of Love to of course Vietnam. But what could be soapy sappy and overblown in the hands of lesser filmmakers think Zemeckis is art thanks to messrs Penn and Tesich. Some of the images are so indelible that the dialog becomes superfluous in an excellent sequence near the start of the film teens bat around a beach ball with a picture of JFK and Jackie so we know it's the 60s. When the protagonist sees the girl he loves having sex with his best friend his eyes meet hers so their estrangement is established without a word. And later in a disturbing single shot a bunch of white kids around a bonfire start pounding on a smaller group of black kids shattering the idyll forever. Still Tesich is a smart enough to understand that he's writing for an impressionistic film so he keeps his script minimal to the point of cryptic  entire relationships start and end in three lines what happens to Danilo's college roommate Louie will have you laughing and crying at the same time. After many travails and terrors the movie ends on an unresolved but hopeful note and you're actually satisfied by the slight unease since that's how life works and this film is a pretty effective albeit rather heightened approximation of how memory and experience actually function.So why weren't there Oscars galore for this picture? Why isn't it heralded as a modern classic? Well part of the problem is the cast of young unknowns all of whom are excellent but couldn't get busted in Hollywood. It's just as well  betterknown actors might have demanded longer more floridly written scenes that would have thrown the film hopelessly off balance. Another problem is the film's ambiguity  neither Penn nor Tesich seem inclined to judge their characters and modern filmgoers tend to get headaches when they're asked to make up their own minds. I know this firsthand since this is the first art film I saw with friends and we loved it so much and discussed it so long afterwards we were pretentious teenagers so we had the time that we couldn't help but rave about it to a hippiedippy couple we knew who LOATHED it for its lack of overt moralism. And finally there's the character of sweet Georgia the elusive object of desire for the other three friends. Georgia is a free spirit who idolizes Isadora Duncan and she wanders across the 1960s having all kinds of different experiences and despite some trauma she emerges more or less intact. Lots of people resent that which is why mediocre films that torture and kill adventurous women think Forrest Gump win Oscars while masterpieces like this can't get released on DVD. Find it watch it love it or hate it one way or another you will be affected.".

There is not one likable character in this film and not one of them seems to be sane. An atrocious script and a sad failure for Arthur Penn. From the grosses recorded here I seem only one of a handful of people to suffer through this in a theater and even after nearly 30 years I recall the pain as if it were only yesterday and want to return to that box office and demand my money back! How anyone could enjoy this junk is beyond me. It doesn't even qualify as a film that is unpleasant but offers a growth experience and reflects some aspect of the human condition. After all these years I needed so much to get this off my chest and express my utter outrage and contempt for a movie so bad that whenever I hear it mentioned I am overcome by nausea.".

FINALLY!!!?In a comment dated 18 June 2001 Nozz wrote Melville said that Moby Dick was only a sketch of a sketch... the book illuminated so many avenues that it never took time to explore. So too with Four Friends. ... So it's a little unfair but there's a sense of missed opportunity because everything in the movie is so good that it seems to deserve more attention.I think that's part of the pointits poignancy and bittersweet sense of loss at the end which is what makes it so evocative as so is life  small moments of apparently frivolous experiencechoicesopportunities  which will rarely if ever come again and certainly not while we are the same. We always think ofwere taught the 2020 hindsight bit but there's NO guarantee path x would have been more idealfruitfil better than path y!  One can never KNOW wo taking the pathmaking whatever choice  Talking about good things here not stupid things like OD'ing on some lame chemical or suicide!  Can't speak for today's youth  as it is indeed a different more cynical world!  but given the idealism hope and energy inherent in the 60s youth who wanted to LIVE after so much repression...... and experience everything a legacy of feeling loss was inevitable.  There's just not enough time being young.  I never grew tired of being young as long as my body was!  That's not to say manymost did not have many good times even wonderful lives and families.  But the ideals we hoped for the world certainly didn't materialize and few realized it in their personal lives I suspect at least on the braod scale we hoped.  And for that we greive for few have the choice.  Four Friends as does few films conveys that loss so splendidly and the rewards of the remaining though not ideal friendships  whose importance in our lives is timeless. And yeah it always elicits tears and longing for what could have been! Someday it will be recognized I hope for the great film it is!".

	schema:headline " Four Friends Another Best Kept Secret";
	schema:reviewBody "I first encountered Arthur Penn's Four Friends late one night on HBO. Having never heard of it I expected very little but watched because I was interested in seeing what a creation by a teaming of Penn and screenwriter Steve Tesich would be like. For the next two hours or so I sat mesmerized watching this incredible teaming of talent and the story they wove. A semiautobiographical tale of a young immigrant to America growing up amidst the turbulence of the 1960s Four Friends follows the story of Danilo an eastern European immigrant the brilliant Craig Wasson from his arrival in the United States through a decade that changed the American landscape. Accompanying Danilo on his journey are his friends Georgia the radiant Jodi Thelan in a role that sadly she has never had the opportunity to equal Tom Jim Metzler and David Michael Huddleston. Four Friends covers way too much territory for me to attempt to explain it here but if you haven't seen this film I urge you to find a copy it's just been released on DVD and watch it. You won't be disappointed. Tesich's script is wonderfully poignant  at times funny at times incredibly sad but always fascinating and honest. Penn directs with a sure hand and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we're following. The cast is uniformly superb. This film should have made a major star out of Wasson who is truly one of this country's most wasted talents. Jodi Thelan not your standard brainless Hollywood sexpot heats up the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with her character as easily as the characters in the film. Metzler and Huddleston subtle performances could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their costars but they are excellent and help anchor the film. Also superb are Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents as well as Reed Birney and Lois Smith. I have not been without a copy of Four Friends since the day after I first saw it on HBO those many years ago. It has been and remains one of my alltime favorite films for more than 20 years now. I can't recommend it enough and feel if you give it a chance you'll feel the same way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Film follows four friends from the 1950s when they're in high school up to 1981.  They are Danilo Craig Wasson a Yugoslavian immigrant Georgia Jodi Thelan a free spirit David Michael Huddleston who has no personality and Tom Jim Metzler a big strong handsome rugged guy.  All three of them are in love with Georgia but she only loves Danilo.  The film mostly focuses on those twoit chronicles their lives love and attraction to each other over the years.  It also gets into Danilo trying to win the love of his tough immigrant father.  I love this film but it's not without its bad points.  Thelan's high squeaky voice is annoying but you get used to it the story jumps around very quickly Tom and David's lives are never explained Tom shows up with a Vietnamese wife and kids and David has a wife we never meet until the end some crucial scenes are badly written and there's some obvious prerelease cutting probably to keep the film at 2 hours.But everything else is so good you can easily forget the problems.  The story is compellingyou really get to know and understand the characters and always get caught up in the lives. With a few exceptions the script by Steve Tesich is goodin fact Tesich was a Yugoslavian immigrant himself and based much of the script on his own experiences. All the acting is greatespecially Thelan and Wassonalso Reed Birney throws in a strong likable performance as Louie Danilo's college roommate.  And Lois Smith is very interesting in her role.  And look quick for Mercedes Ruehl and Glenne Headly!Basically it's a real great story about immigrants coming of age love of America and covers the 5080s perfectly.This film was unjustly maligned on its release.  The studio didn't know how to advertise it it IS a hard film to market and the critics stomped on it Pauline Kaels' review in The New Yorker was particularly harsh.  It barely played in theaters I was lucky enough to catch it in 1981 in its short theatrical run and has simply disappeared.  That's a shame.  This is a movie that is just ripe for reissue.  I'm not betting on itbut you never know!  A definite 10 all the way!".

	schema:reviewBody "FOUR FRIENDS was first billed on HBO in 82 as a sleeper hit. Having heard the term 'sleeper' when 14 back then  I was anxious to see one. !  Boy  was I surprised!  That film!  I hadn't really fallen in love with a nonspecial effects film outside of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE  much less a 'hippy flick'...but having had grown up with a couple of hippies  I understood the power behind Mr. Penn's film. FOUR FRIENDS is definitely one of a kind.  The script is so personable  and that cast!!!  Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor SO well!  He just personifies the 'writer type' to a tee  both smart and clumsy the scene at the window... and strong yet so very vulnerable.  For me  he captures what it's like to be so taken with agirl that it lasts over a decade...and I have always found solace in the character  and in the film. Throughout the 80's FOUR FRIENDS was a partner in crime to me  and I caught the movie whenever I could on HBO  even if I had to stay up until 5AM!  And still always at the end  there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters part from the viewers on the beach.  Jodi Thelen personifies that girl to the hilt  it is so hard not to be charmed by her.  This movie really stands the test of time.  Every once and a while I check out my video of it...or show a friend...and it STILL gets a solid reaction.  I've known women who absolutely fall in love with Georgia!  So many levels..!  Just an incredible little 60's piece of humanity.  Very special very magical. I recently found THE NOVELIZATION of FOUR FRIENDS by Robert Grossbach  and it's even more detailed that the movie!  Actual dates of events etc. A real find!  And what's more  haha  I found the novel while thumbing around in a used book store...in Omaha NE of ALL places!!!  Guess you have to have an eye for her!  When I was in L.A. in 92 working as an extra  I went into a ruddy lil memorbilia shop  and there were a TON of stills from the film!!!  Unfortunately  I was broke and couldn't indulge...but boy those photos of Georgia and the guys all together just went right through me! I met director Joe Sergant on the set of SKYLARK in Emporia KS in summer of 92...and we spoke about FOUR FRIENDS  very cool! Also...working at a video store in Omaha in 98  waited on a female who was a relative of Jim Metzler..!  Told her to pass the word on that there was some kid in Omaha who was just fanatical about the film  and had gotten the utmost out of it. Once again  the movie captures everything that's in Danilo's character's heart...great great work  one of mssrs Tesich and Penn's finest efforts.  Steve Tesich is sorely missed.  An incredible writer. Isadora Duncan!!!C.".
