Lin Ching Hsia and ChiuWai in particular shine and deliver the first ferocious confrontation of the movie by showing us two terrific kungfu moves the Sea can't be Measured and the Toad ShenKong.Once we have met all the characters the second part gathers them together in the enclosed space of an inn so we see them interact. Hysterically funny is Joey Wang who may be Leslie Cheung's sweetheart but apart from that bears very little that can be referred to as sweet. Highly entertaining are also KaFai and Jacky Cheung who try to win the resistance of their loved ones with their musical talent.Finally the third part shows the ultimate confrontation. The ending may actually be the only flaw of the movie and I personally agree with the character interpreted by Leslie Cheung who at one point states too ridiculous!.However apart from the bizarre ending this is an excellent movie... but be prepared for many surprises! And if you thought the crossdressing of Ranma and Final Fantasy VII are extreme be ready to change your rankings as far as extravagance is concerned! 910PS The DVD from AhMei allows selection of Mandarin or Cantonese language with EnglishChinese subtitles burned on the movie but other than that no extra feature is included at all.".

But to the film's credit every time I was losing interest they do something so silly I was laughing again. The energy is so high that the hit and miss nature of the whole production isn't much of a problem. The martial arts are done for comedy's sake and are really sped up.This is one of the most extreme examples of wacky HK comedy. Not used to HK comedy? You might be advised to skip this one at first.

I had such a stomach ache from laughing so hard and I could feel the tears welling up.The most memorable 'sketches' are Jacky Cheung vs Tony Leung in the forest this one is long and just hilarious from beginning to end and the dancing and singing number with Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung Ka Fai. There are other funny moments throughout but if you get the humour then these two scenes will kill you. The 4 above mentioned actors give the funniest perfomance.One thing that has to be said is that I watched a Cantonese version which had Chinese and English subtitles. If these English subtitles are the only translation available then I feel sorry for anyone watching with those as they are truly dreadful. Some of the lines are literally translated resulting in nonsense and others I have no clue what script they are translating from. Shame really as the delivery of some of the lines is just too funny especially from Tony and Jacky. Brigitte Lin has also got to be the most beautiful woman in the film and Leslie is cute cute cute.The only weakest link to me was Veronica Yip who's popularity at the time had recently risen due to baring all in some movie or other. Hence her appearing in a movie with all these huge stars. I have no complaints with the other actors. Carina Lau is one of my favourite actresses. She does a good job albeit in a slightly kooky role.

It has slapstick crossdressing genderbending confused identities ridiculous costumes over the top martial arts battles and some cultural references I didn't get. Don't try to figure out the plot or story line there isn't much of either one of those. But there are a number of laugh out loud moments I think the movie might be much funnier in Cantonese the English subtitles seem to work well here. Spoiler here one of the funniest moments in the movie is when one of the characters starts singing to the melody of the intro of the William Tell overture that cracks me up every time I see it. So there you have it this movie is the winner of Best Use of the William Tell Overturewith lyrics I can only imagine how much funnier it is in Cantonese.".

It has slapstick crossdressing genderbending confused identities ridiculous costumes over the top martial arts battles and some cultural references I didn't get. Don't try to figure out the plot or story line there isn't much of either one of those. But there are a number of laugh out loud moments I think the movie might be much funnier in Cantonese the English subtitles seem to work well here. Spoiler here one of the funniest moments in the movie is when one of the characters starts singing to the melody of the intro of the William Tell overture that cracks me up every time I see it. So there you have it this movie is the winner of Best Use of the William Tell Overturewith lyrics I can only imagine how much funnier it is in Cantonese.";

He then offers to mentor a rich selfassured high school student. In the end the student more or less ends up mentoring Bill and helps him to change his views on life.I thought the chemistry between Logan Lerman the kid and Aaron Eckhart Bill was fantastic! they both did a great job with their role and stole the whole show. These roles were out of style for both actorsI've never seen Eckhart do comedy and Lerman's character was much more rebellious than usual. It just shows the talent of both actors especially the versatility of Lerman. The rest of the supporting characters were slightly underdeveloped.The style of comedy in this movie is more...old school in my opinion. It's not slapstick or nonstop laughter but the comedy is interweaved throughout the film with several vary funny scenes and oneliners. I would say the film is geared toward audiences from the mid 20s to mid 40s. However I am a 16 year old female and I enjoyed the film.The plot does get lost a bit and some characters are underdeveloped but overall it's a good independent film. Is it the best or funniest movie you'll ever see? Probably not. But it delivers a style of comedy not found often these days and if you connect with the style and the story you will definitely like this movie.".

Aaron Eckhart is the drowning man desperately trying to save himself and this film while the insipid script and lifeless direction of Meet Bill keep dragging him down.Bill Aaron Eckhart is less a character and more a collection of characteristics. He's got a pot belly and a bad haircut. He has his job only because he married his boss' daughter even though his boss treats him more like an intern than an executive. He's got a gay brother and a serious candy addiction. I guess this mix of common and quirky traits is supposed to make the audience empathize and identify with Bill but he's really just an annoying and selfpitying shmuck.Bill is unhappy with his life and dreams of trading in his job at his fatherinlaw's bank for running his own doughnut shop. Then two things happen. First Bill is roped into being a mentor to a high school kid Logan Lerman. Second Bill finds out his wife Jessica Elizabeth Banks is cheating on him.Let me digress for a moment. The high school kid in Bill doesn't have a name and is in fact listed in the credits only as The Kid. If you ever write a screenplay on behalf of everyone who might ever read it I beg you to please please please give all of your characters actual names. You might think it's cute and clever to have one just be called The Kid or something but it's not. It's stupid and aggravating. People whether close friends or relative strangers call each other by their names all the time and it's both very noticeable and irritating when a script goes out of its way to avoid that. I don't care if you think the character being nameless has some thematic significance. It's just dumb.Returning to the movie Bill freaks out when he discovers Jessica is sleeping with a cheesy local news anchor. He beats the guy up and gets thrown in jail. Bill also moves out of his own huge house and into his gay brother's equally huge home. He hangs out with The Kid who tries to help Bill loosen up and enjoy life. Bill also takes up swimming and keeps trying to finagle his way into owning that doughnut shop. There's also a sex tape a big party where everything goes wrong and a pointless subplot where The Kid keeps hitting on this lingerie store clerk Jessica Alba. Not that hitting on Jessica Alba is pointless but it serves absolutely no purpose in the story.The things that happen in this movie either don't make sense or you don't care about them if they do. How does a dorky loser like Bill end up with a woman who looks like the incredibly appealing Elizabeth Banks? There's no explanation of what Jessica could have ever seen in him. Bill obviously gets paid a lot of money for very little work has a huge house and a smokin' hot wifeand we're supposed to care that he's not satisfied with all that? When we find out Jessica is cheating on Bill there's no emotional impact to it because if you were married to a pathetic nonentity like Bill you'd probably cheat on him too. There's absolutely no reason or explanation for why The Kid makes such enormous efforts to attach himself to Bill and try and help him out like an overexcited hybrid of Ferris Bueller and Jiminy Cricket and The Kid is so theatrically irreverent that you just want Bill to smack him. The story also connects Bill's growth as a human being to him shaving off his body hair which is just odd.This movie is completely uninvolving even though Aaron Eckhart is working as hard in this film as I've ever seen any performer work in anything. He does everything but drop trou and show us his Little Eckhart to make us laugh or feel ANYTHING about Bill. All of his efforts however are smothered by the relentlessly limp work of these filmmakers.Unless you enjoy watching a drowning man being thrown cement blocks there's nothing in Meet Bill for anyone to enjoy.".

That fact alone is actually surprising to me as my viewing habits tend to lean towards dramas and this is anything but. In fact festivals this year have been weighed down by heavy films that are about as dark as they come. Bill could not be more different and what a refreshing change and muchneeded uplift is this allout unabashed comedy. Codirected by the husbandwife team of Bernie Goldmann and Melissa Wallack who penned the script Bill has all the elements required of the genre characters to whom we can relate a clever storyline and laughs aplenty.Aaron Eckhart Any Given Sunday Erin Brockovich Thank You for Smoking is Bill smack dab in the middle of a life becoming alltoo familiar. His job is falling apart he begrudgingly works for his irascible fatherinlaw his marriage is going to pieces his body is going to pot and perhaps most horrifying his hair is rejecting his head. Bill needs a change fast and is notsovoluntarily signed up for a mentoring program at the local high school.

Discussing their characters in depth would be too revealing and my policy is to allow the reader to find a synopsis elsewhere if desired. Ultimately the partnership between Bill and The Kid is what drives the story and the chemistry between Eckhart and Lerman is central to the success of the film. And it works. The Kid is smart streetwise sexy or so he thinks and has the selfconfidence of someone thrice his age. In short he's everything Bill aspires to be. It's a rolereversal device that's at the heart of many classic comedies and Wallack's brilliant writing makes it work.Despite being an independent film read low budget Bill has the look of a Hollywood movie. The design is bright and the sound and editing give it a crisp bouncy feel. Best of all the cinematography with Peter Lyons Collister at the helm is second to none. He's one of the best in the business a classic comedy veteran and it shows.It's always hard to single anyone out in a fine ensemble cast but in both screenings I attended Lerman stole the show. He unquestionably got the biggest laughs and was the crowd favorite. I hesitate to call him a newcomer as at the tender age of 15 he already has 10 movies and 23 television episodes under his belt but he's one to watch for and has a bright career ahead of him. But this is Eckhart's film to make or break and his sense of comedic timing and puppylike ability to elicit just the right amount of empathy from the audience create those touching moments that leave the viewer wanting more. And so I attended the second screening as well and enjoyed it even more. And that's the true test of a comedy. From this writer's perspective Bill not only hits its mark but is also sure to be a winner for years to come.".

That fact alone is actually surprising to me as my viewing habits tend to lean towards dramas and this is anything but. In fact festivals this year have been weighed down by heavy films that are about as dark as they come. Bill could not be more different and what a refreshing change and muchneeded uplift is this allout unabashed comedy. Codirected by the husbandwife team of Bernie Goldmann and Melissa Wallack who penned the script Bill has all the elements required of the genre characters to whom we can relate a clever storyline and laughs aplenty.Aaron Eckhart Any Given Sunday Erin Brockovich Thank You for Smoking is Bill smack dab in the middle of a life becoming alltoo familiar.

What as the Jessica Alba character supposed to be? What was she supposed to add? The Kid character was pretty pointless also. There was an endless series of scenes that I assume were supposed to be funny but added nothing to the narrative. There is this whole subplot where we are supposed to imagine that the Kid and Alba might have some romantic chemistry but it is just ludicrous. Also one of the major plot points is Bill trying to win back his wife. However we never get a sense of why he would want to do this. After all she is uniformly terrible to him throughout the movie and he doesn't seem that into her until it's convenient for the plot. If they had taken out some of the more pointless scenes especially the one with the Kid dancing around in women's underwearwhat was that about? and spent more time exploring the relationship between the two leads then it might have made more sense. Aaron Eckhart is a very talented actor and did the best with the story he had. However there was no saving this train wreck. I would say that it would benefit from better editing but in all honesty it would have to be edited to the point of nonexistence to be improved. Largely this movie seemed like a lowrent cheap rehash of some of the themes from American Beauty without any of the depth humour or intelligence. They had the repressed husband attempting to break free the bitchy adulterous wife and drug dealing rebellious teenage boy. What a waste of time and in Eckhart's case talent.".

The critics panned the film and while I don't always agree with them this time I have to say I agree. What I don't get is that I don't see any of the comments I would have expected to see. Case in point there are several scenes with Bill a 40 year old man smoking pot and drinking with his teenage mentee. There's even a scene that implies that Bill and the kid got it on with a couple of girls in a tent together. In the film this is passed off as no big deal but watching it I was cringing. I guess I'm just surprised. I don't consider myself to be that much of a prude but it just felt wrong. Maybe I'm out of touch.Anyways the film never hits the right notes and despite a decent cast the actors all feel as if they are auditioning for different films. Bill seems to be in American Beauty his mentee seems like he thinks he's in a national lampoon film the wife in a dramedy and Jessica Alba seems like she can't wait to leave the scene and hop on the first flight out of town. Apart from Bill none of the characters are fleshed out even a little. This is particularly true for Bill's gay brother who's only role seems to be to pick him up from jail and look concerned while Bill rants. According to the notes on the film there were a lot of last minute cast changes and I'm guessing script changes to accommodate the different actors. Whatever was done the whole thing feels like it unraveled in a spectacularly bad way. I can't get the hour and a half of my life back but its not too late for you. Save yourself and avoid this flick.".

Aaron Eckhart who was amazing in Thank You For Smoking seems to be attempting a Jim Carreystyle comedic performance and it doesn't work at all.

The plot is pretty simple Bill is working for his fatherinlaw at a very successful bank and is unhappy his wife cheats on him things fall apart.The other characters seem to exist just to help Bill find out who he really is or something like that. Jessica Alba is one of these. She plays a cashier at a Victoria's Secret who befriends Bill and his young mentee. She doesn't really put any effort into her role but I don't blame her because her character was wildly underdeveloped. She has no real motivation in the film she's just there to help Bill regain his confidence. Young actor Logan Lerman plays Bill's mentee a private school kid with a bottomless allowance a disturbing infatuation with Alba's character and an inexplicable desire to spend all of his time with Bill. Craig Bierko plays Bill's gay brother who sits around trying to talk sense to him and does little else. Elizabeth Banks is OK as Bill's wife and it is perhaps the only redeeming quality of the film that she is not completely villainized. The only highlight if the film comes in the form if Kristen Wiig and Jason Sudeikis of the current SNL cast who plays representatives of a donut franchise Bill is trying to get involved with. The script is aimless the dialog horrible and the conclusion completely unsatisfying. I really wished I hadn't watched this movie by the time it ended.".

It's about a man who thinks that he has everything that a man wants out of life until he finds out that his wife is having an affair and his career is going nowhere. He then becomes a mentor for a sharp kid who helps him turn his life around and shows him how to get the most out of life. I'm usually a fan of Aaron Eckharts work but he really did make a fool out of himself in this movie. The jokes weren't that funny and the storyline went from one ridiculous scene to another. The director piled up to many different elements which made the film seem messy and not that enjoyable. None of the top actors put in an outstanding performance which is due to the terrible script so this is yet another movie that has to get the thumbs down from me. Disappointing!RoundUp Aaron Eckhart really let me down in this film alongside Jessica Alba and Elizabeth Banks who were also not that great. There were also some other big names in the film like Kristen Wiig and Jason Sudeikis but they weren't in the movie that much. I was impressed with the young looking Logan Lerman whose also starred in Fury the Percy Jackson franchise and Noah but I just found it hard to find the film slightly amusing. I'm not surprised that it made such a lose at the box office but I am surprised with the budget which must have gone towards the actors wages. Anyway it's worth a watch if you just want some noise in the background but I personally think that it was a waste of a good cast.Budget 5million Worldwide Gross 347000 Terrible!I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about a man whose goes through a midlife crisis after finding out that his wife is having an affair. 310".

The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys Art School Confidential Ghost World and more recently Juno to name a few.But this is Aaron Eckhert's show. At first 10 minutes I'm kind of skeptical about his performance. His overboard performance has a tendency to go at campy territory. But then I realized that I was wrong. Because he's just having a hell of good time playing this character and ask an audience to go along a ride with him. Aaron Eckhert's earnest performance also help filling a hole in the second act when they ran out of idea and have nothing else for him to do completely unnecessary scenes like Bill gets stoned in a department store or Bill has a double date worked because of him.It's easy to love this movie. However it isn't too memorable either and erupt ending tend to make things worst. Meet Bill have absolutely nothing new to offer.

I'd never heard of Meet Bill until I was desperately trying to find some movies to put in my Netflix queue for the week. I saw this new film listed starring Aaron Eckhart who IMO KNOWS how to pick good scripts and is a favorite actor whom I enjoy and admire. When the DVD arrived in the mail today I was not in the mood for a comedy but I slid it in my DVD tray anyway I watched about the first five minutes standing up to make an exit into the kitchen...but instead I sat down and started enjoying as well as laughing out loud at this wonderful little independent comedy. I hadn't read a synopsis so I really couldn't outguess the screenwriter where the plot was headed. Then I got the clue where we were about to go and how the movie would probably end...but NO! The movie just ended without giving any of us a clue what was going to happen. Ten more minutes...even FIVE...a paragraph ONE LINE...SOMETHING...I mean it IS a comedy for crying out loud...where's the comic ending? I'll bet there's a couple of dozen yards of film on the cutting room floor which would have pleased me and everyone else and who knows it might have been a hit. It's really a good film that leads the audience to a cliff and there's no more road. Even an alternate ending on the DVD would have been fantastic! Now I have to wonder if this is the real reason why I hate comedies? The kid playing 'The Kid Logan Lerman is gonna be a huge star. He and Aaron made a great team. He has NO inhibitions for his age and all but walks away with the movie from more experienced actors. The ending written for The Kid sucked as well. If I MISSED At this point I don't know if he and Elizabeth stayed together...what was he going to do about a job? Anyone have any ideas?".

	schema:reviewBody "Much can be said about David Lynch but I think the mistake most people make is to think that he is trying to create a coherent and straight forward narrative structure. He is working on a subconscious level in his mind. The idea comes before the reason behind the idea. In many ways this is how art should be created because any other way will feel forced and pretentious.David Lynch is not just trying to fk with you. Its not meaningless and its not pretentious. If you've ever seen his interviews he is one of the most humble and soft spoken directors I've ever seen. Justin Theroux did a Q  A after my screening of Inland Empire and he described working with lynch as light hearted and fun. The complete opposite of what its like to watch some of his films which are often dark terrifying and disturbing.Inland Empire is a sister film to Mulholland Dr. As my wife put it Watching Mulholland Dr. helped me to understand Inland Empire. They are two sides of the same coin. Lynch still seems to want to take a stab at the evils of Hollywood. His concern for the well being of actors is strong but this time instead of a new comer Naomi Watts he deals with one older actresses come back role and like Mulholland Dr. their are the evil producers behind the scenes and even the added possibility of a cursed set.I am a huge Lynch fan. I don't find his films hard to understand. I am not a very intellectual person but Lynch's themes are so simple. The visuals are to be enjoyed on their own terms especially when they seem not to fit with the rest of the film. A lot of lynch's trademarks return the dual personalities time folding in on itself gratuitous nudity and another tragic murder mystery.While this film does feel like a retread of Mulholland Dr. it also stands on its own especially since it contains a much more upbeat ending and perhaps four layers of storytellinggood luck figuring out which is which. He also continues to experiment with sound and even sings the vocals to a song in the film.I got exactly what I wanted from Inland Empire. The downside to this is that Lynch is sort of repeating himself and I hope that doesn't mean he's out of ideas or perhaps Mulholland Dr. did not yet exercise his disdain for the studio system. The film is part murder mystery and part lucid dream. It has dream logic and has a lot of fun with some of its bizarre dialog and incredible visuals. This film also has much in common with Eraserhead in that he's completely free to explore his ideas. No one is telling him to shorten the film cut out scenes or that it doesn't make sense. Its uncompromising and truly art without boundaries.My only other criticism is that the digital video is just ugly at times. When the shot is static the amount of detail in the picture can be incredible but when its hand held and moving around its grainy and looks pretty terrible. I miss the polished look of his older films but I guess that is going to be another thing that sets this movie apart from the others. I highly recommend this film to the Lynch enthusiast and to no one else. If you aren't in on the joke then I cannot imagine you leaving the theater happy after three hours of pure free from concentrate unpasteurized lynch. I went to see this with my wife and my best friend needless to say only I loved it. Take that as you will.45".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this film at the New York Film Festival followed by a Q  A session with David Lynch Laura Dern and Justin Theroux. I will try my best to recount my thoughts while they are fresh and incorporate what the film maker and actors had to say. I can't tell if it's yesterday or tomorrow and it's a real mind f This single quote from Laura Dern sums the movie up fairly well. It is also one of the self referential moments of the film that explores the audiences very thoughts while providing some comic relief. Lynch's new film INLAND EMPIRE is similar to his other work but unlike anything he's ever done or I've ever seen before. As one reviewer aptly put it it is a double reference to Hollywood and the inner workings of the human brain. Before I discuss the substance of the film I will briefly review the technical aspects. First of all the movie is not unwatchable because of clarity purposes as some critics had said although I did see it at the Lincoln Center which has a beautiful theater and top quality facilities. The digital camera works well for this film. It lose some of the cinematic flourish of film but also brings a more realistic gritty feel to it that is appropriate for the theme. The lighting and production were top quality as usual for a Lynch film and the score sets every scene brilliantly. Often times we can't tell if the sound is diegetic or nondiegetic but it makes no difference. Lynch said that he used the digital camera to give him freedom. You can see much more movement in this film than his others giving an almost voyeuristic feel. He also uses many close shots and as always obscure framing allowing ambiguity and confusion. Lynch really explores the freedom of movement and editing that is available with digital and you can feel his energy and zest in the new medium. The moments of suspense and terror are so well done  there are several scenes that will literally make you jump  that I found a Hitcockian brilliance of using subtlety indirectness and sound to convey emotion rather than expensive special effects. Of course there are other scenes that would qualify as downright freaky.The movie is completely carried by Laura Dern and not because she is in 9095 of the scenes. Her characters morph and change so often in identity and time that it is hard to believe it is her in every role. Her range and ability to work consistently over so many years and under the conditions of this film is mind blowing. It is one of the finest performances I've seen by an actress or actor. The film itself is hard to summarize. Most of you know the basic plot but this really means nothing about the film. It has no type of linear story line and the converging and diverging plot lines are connected by only the most simple threads time location memory Do I look familiar? Have you seen me before? identity and people who are good with animals. It would be a disservice to this film to try to find meaning or symbolism as I see some people already are. It is not a mystery to be solved as Mulholland Dr. was though that film never will be solved either. It is a movie that plays off of ideas color mood it presents intangible emotions that we feel and internalize rather than think about and solve. Film doesn't need a solution to make sense but it is typical for us to want solve things to have closure. This film is better if you just let it wash over you and surrender the urge to find meaning.The three hour running time makes no difference because the movie moves in and out of itself with no regard for time. Using so many scenes allows time to effect the viewer much as the characters themselves. As the characters question time and reality the audience does too. As the scenes slowly build up giving us reference we start to wonder where we saw that character who said that line before what location fits into what part of the sequence and how leading up to the Laura Dern quote I used before. It doesn't ask us to think but to feel and it does this better than any film I've seen. It plays on our emotions with intense sound and cinematography grasping fragments from dreams sliding in and out of reality exploring nightmares and asking us what time and reality really are. The film is also very selfconscious as I said before and also makes many subtle and not so pokes at the audience. It also has some truly surreal moments of Lynch humor. Explaining all this doesn't really matter because you will have to see it and take your own idea from it. I would recommend that you see it in a theater though as it could never have the same impact anywhere else. I was skeptical going into this movie after what I had read thinking Lynch had gone off the deep end. However I realized nothing you read about it will make a difference once you see it and that Lynch is in better form than ever. Ebert said that Mulholland Dr. was the one experiment where Lynch didn't break the testtube. With INLAND EMPIRE he throws the lab equipment out the window. His freedom in making this movie both with medium and artistic control is unparalleled in anything he's done. He finally made a movie for himself and his vision without any kind of apology or pretense.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Lynch the visionary director who created unforgettable films revealing darker realms of life such as Elephant Man and Blue Velvet and who brought to mainstream TV a deeper aesthetic and consciousness with the Twin Peaks series unfortunately went overboard with Inland Empire writing and directing the worst film of his career.Inland Empire is arguably Lynch's most ambitious effort a meandering threehour dive into a nightmarish dream world where all his previous themes and obsessions convey. There are enslaved women Blue Velvet Twin Peaks women in trouble Mulholland Drive supernatural entities in other realms Twin Peaks Lost Highway Mulholland Drive dissociative fugues and alternative realities Lost Highway Mulholland Drive. As expected of a Lynch movie the cast is top notch starting with Laura Dern and it even includes Jeremy Irons as a movie director. But the direction and the script fail to give us something of depth or a remotely compelling entertaining story therefore this Lynchean nightmare becomes endless pointless and ultimately boring. Each shot of drearydilapidated Polish buildings or empty and dark Hollywood sets become endless. Every time the character are hurting or menacing the camera does a closeup distorting their faces or they behave histrionically as in the worst of the Mexican telenovelas. This is simply poor direction. These closeups and long shots among other cinematic pyrotechnics are Lynch's filler to disguise the emptiness of Inland Empire Although both films are similar in plot and style Inland Empire suffers compared to Mulholland Drive. Lynch deserved the Oscar for that brilliant film which is memorable for its character development along a dark psychic ride elements that are missing in Inland Empire replaced by a cheap thrills posing for art and profundity.The plot is vintage Lynch but it is the most convoluted longest and silliest of them all. Lost Girl an enslaved woman in Polish hotelpurgatory watches shows on a psychic TV a sitcom with supernatural rabbit people scenes from a Polish film that never got finished because the leading actors were murdered and the life of an American actress who starts in the remake of the Polish film. Nikki Laura Dern the actress begins an affair with her leading man and freaks out entering an alternative reality becoming Sue the white trash character she is playing in the movie. Sue is having an extramarital affair with Billy a rich man and lives with Smithy in the house of the movie set. Sue is psychically connected to enslaved prostitutes who teletransport themselves from the snowy streets of Poland in the 1940s to present day Hollywood Boulevard. The prostitutes talk about men love and TA and suddenly burst into dance for no reason  they do a killer number with The LocoMotion which is unfortunately too short. Sue's husband Smithy who is Polish leaves for Poland to work with a circus. Sue goes to see Billy and Billy's wife beats her. Sue becomes a whore working Hollywood Boulevard with the danceloving spacetimejumping whores. The Phantom an evil supernatural man who has Lost Girl enslaved in purgatory kills an early incarnation of Smithy who was Lost Girl's lover. The Phantom hypnotizes Billy's wife who is the reincarnation of a Polish woman who was stabbed to death with a screwdriver by the original actress in the Polish movie. The rabbit people are also wise older Polish men and have a sance with Lost Girl and they bring Smithy to talk to Lost Girl. The old men give a gun to Smithy to kill the Phantom. Sue gets stabbed with a screwdriver on Hollywood Blvd. by Billy's wife and dies. That is the end of the movie and it is a wrap. Nikki is congratulated by the director but she ignores everybody and walks away from the movie set remaining as Sue. She goes to the house where she finds the gun Smithy was given by the old men. She goes through some dark corridors and finds herself in the Polish hotelpurgatory where the Phantom is and as she shoots him his face becomes Sue's own distorted face. The Phantom dies and all the women are free and Lost Girl reunites with Smithy and her son. Then Nikki is back in her home and all the women have a big a party and some women shake their booties to a Nina Simone song. They are in a kind of good place not purgatory. It is not clear whether NikkiSue was an invention of Lost Girl who had been the real murderer and was in purgatory or whatever in the final analysis it does not matter because the movie is empty and lacks any redemptive qualities.It is hard to understand why some of the critics and audience fail to realize that this is a very bad film poorly written and badly directed. Lynch is a true artist and has done some remarkable films for which he should be praised alas Inland Empire is a disjointed tedious nonsense mess filled with pretentiousness. If you want to waste three hours of your life with a superficial mindtease filled with pseudo transpersonal psychology and collective unconscious references see it at your own risk.".

The film is suffocating dark and endless yet paradoxically contains some of the director's funniest and lightest scenes. I was frightened uneasy overwhelmed and moved. My emotions were thrown into disarray several times during which I lost all sense of appropriate reaction. Do not expect the mystery of this film to be solved but expect it to be finished. Do not expect your head to understand the resolution but expect that your heart and intuition will.If you cannot decide whether to see this film or not I implore you to get up and go. Whether or not you enjoy it you will never see a film like this again. I also implore you to see it IN THE CINEMA. Do not wait to see it on DVD because the experience won't be half as extraordinary.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie this past Monday morning at the NYFF New York Film Festival but I'm sure you probably knew that already and I have to tell you I'm at a loss at how to even begin writing this review. I gave it a little time to sink in and I'll just try my best to give you something.For one as you probably already know the movie is three hours long. It's one of those three hour movies where you really start to feel it about an hour and a half in. Now I'm all for a movie of that length and sometimes even longer than that but really now this movie should get cut down at least by a half hour. It's something that Lynch should consider but it doesn't sound like it's going to happen at the time of this writing. I don't mind watching a film where the director refuses to hold my hand and lets me work the details out for myself but watching this and trying to make any sense of it at all was like walking around in a dark forest with a blindfold on. After three hours of watching something like this it does get tedious I'm sorry to say.I read a review somewhere describing the film as impenetrable. I can't think of a better word to describe it myself. If you were to ask me what this movie was about I really wouldn't be able to tell you. Now that's to be expected from a Lynch movie usually but this movie is probably the most abstract thing he's done Eraserhead notwithstanding. The movie seems to be more about the feeling itself you get from watching it rather than having any kind of real story to speak of. This feels very experimental especially considering the fact that it was shot on DV.I personally hope that Lynch doesn't give up on film completely because I think that while DV proved as an interesting choice in making this film I think that very few people can give you beauty on film like Lynch does.The movie is loaded with those signature Lynch moments of menace that seem to treasure slowly approaching the corners of long hallways where something horrible may be waiting. Lots of tense dark scenes with eerie music that suddenly becomes an assault on the senses. If you think of the diner scene near the beginning of Mulholland Drive you'll know what I'm getting at. Now that I think about it the film reminded me of Mulholland Drive in that it seemed to have it in for the falsity of Hollywood at times. I got that out of it at least.The acting was superb. Laura Dern plays what feels like four or five different roles and her range is simply astounding. I've grown to appreciate Justin Theroux over the years and his character in this film is somewhat similar to the one he played in Mulholland the cocky ladies man type but I really liked him in this. Also this movie contains many of Lynch's old cast members and it was always fun to see who would pop out next.What I really liked about the film was the soundtrack. It's full of Angelo Badalamenti's dark work and there's a couple of great songs in there as well. I downloaded Beck's Black Tambourine after hearing it played in the film. I will definitely pick up the soundtrack for this one if it is ever released.There were surreal beautiful moments that I should at least mention. There was a scene near the end involving a lighter that was really moving for some reason. There was also a kind of spiral time warp loop thing similar to when Bill Pullman answered himself on his house intercom in Lost Highway. You'll see what I mean when you watch the film but it was definitely one of the better moments.I love David Lynch I love just about everything he's done but in all honesty this isn't a movie I'm necessarily dying to see again. I really want to tell you that I loved the film but I honestly can't. I do appreciate the effort. This is a film unlike anything I've ever seen before that much can be said. It's just as weird as anything else he's done and if you're looking for a good dose of Lynchian madness believe me when I say that you don't need to look any further. There are many of those strange moments where characters say strange things or act strange in general and wouldn't you know it even a musical number or two sneaks its way in. I appreciate the man and I appreciate the fact that he makes daring original work. But this was borderline frustration.I guess all I can say is that I liked a lot of it but at the same time I really felt like I was wading through mental molasses trying to grasp what unfolded before me. There really is no sense in trying to make sense of this film but there's obviously some sort of story or message that Lynch is trying to get across that I couldn't get to and I think that's why I'm slightly put off. I didn't mind letting it engulf me in its strange universe but I think the length of it made it a little tough to appreciate fully.I didn't even mention the family of bunny rabbits. Or the random visits to Poland. Or the Locomotion dance number. Or the screwdrivers. But you can see all of that for yourself and make of it what you will.RATING  out of .PS I really tried to write an honest review of the film. I sincerely hope that at the very least I was able to give you an idea of what to expect.".

	schema:reviewBody " SPOILER ALERT!!!  Lynch's latest moved me tremendously. I was a big fan of Mulholland Drive and as one poster here asserted that earlier film helped me to dissect this latest Lynch masterpiece. Lynch himself might think it improper or uninteresting to discuss what this film conveys but Inland Empire is such a significant work of art it seems criminally negligent not to its depth and honesty as profound as it is.In every case Lynch portrays women's sexuality as powerful and without a shred of judgment even if they are promiscuous or prostitutes. Lynch acknowledges life's consequences but without moralizing in any way. Laura Dern's actress character is a true heroine an everywoman and bold protagonist.The character watching the TV screen throughout the film is the actress in the first version of the film being remade by Dern and Justin Theroux. That actress was killed making the film by her jealous husband after he discovered her affair with her costar and she now sits in limbo crying from sadness and guilt another theme in recent Lynch films brilliantly realized in the feverdream death hallucination of Naomi Watts' spurned suicidal starlet in Mulholland Drive. The film was never finished or remade because it was subsequently thought of as cursed and the odyssey of Laura Dern's character purges that curse.After consummating an affair with Theroux watched by the suspicious jealous eyes of her cold threatening husband. Dern becomes haunted by the suffering spirit of the murdered woman and all women judged and abused for their sexual choices. I loved the scenes with the women who slept with the actor comparing notes  and with a real sense of solidarity there is no cattiness or competition between them they even admire each other's breasts. They are also stuck in a cramped limbo their yearning embodied in their hipswinging yet robotic and joyless Locomotion boogie.Dern's dark odyssey is her experiencing the actresses' pain the women's collective pain  which she seems to choose to do her character constantly revealing determination strength purpose. And the women heap their burdens on her trusting her to save them. There are so many examples of this  the Mary Steenburgen character talking about a debt that needs to be repaid by the man who lives in the strange little house the Japanese street girl confiding in Dern's dying character about her junkiewhore friend with the monkey the strange confession of Dern's white trash woman who climbs the stairs. It all concludes with Dern's suffering a horrible lingering death. Then triumphant at the end of shooting the film she refuses to accept the kudos directed at her her victory incomplete if just for herself. She rises from the dead to find the first actress in the room watching the events unfold and kisses her as if to say I have endured this and now you are free. The woman's face brightens she ceases crying and reunites with her husband and child. Then during the marvelous closing credits Dern is celebrated by all the beautiful women who are now dancing quite joyfully as she sits on the sofa beatifically observing the fruits of her efforts as the women sing about POWER.Dern is portrayed as almost Jesuslike in the themes of sacrifice will compassion. She willingly endures an odyssey of horror that leads to her death to save them all whores unloved wives and spurned starlets alike.David Lynch is a tremendously sensitive soulful and brave artist who is just getting better and better. He understands that its not enough to just tell a story he has learned to make us truly feel the story. Three hours was necessary. The bunny people are there just like the homeless manmonster of Mulholland Drive to set the stage for a suspension of the laws of logic and linearity to invite absurdity and magical unrealism into our awareness so that we can experience pure emotions like a sense of triumph catharsis compassion empathy unconstrained by the expectations imposed on us by conventional narrative. This movie made me cry it made me feel so much! What an achievement. Bravissimo David Lynch!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this during a period of extreme emotional stress probably the best possible mode. It was also surrounded by my listening to Big Fish Lynch's book read by himself. The contrast is astonishing Lynch's banal aphorisms in the book with rich multilayered cinematic literacy in the film. Yet another lesson in relative articulation and the notion that an artist often is the worst authority on himself.Let's have no mistake this film is important. I place it on my list as one of the two films of 2006 that you must see.There's a lot to say about this. I think I'll let others comment on Dern's attunements and the general notion of the story having to do with guilt and sexual desire.I'll comment only on two aspects which struck me. The first was how Polish this movie is. Its Polish within the story of course a good half of the action involves Poles. The plot device is a Polish curse that somehow bends time and causality. And there are some Polish locations as well.But the thing is shot using Kieslowski's mannerisms. Its a peculiar style that to my knowledge no one else has used. It focuses on two motions that of the environment as space which governs and changes. And that of the characters in motion but situated in the spaces. With Kieslowski he literally splits these in the writer's mind by having his writing partner handle the noir bits the controlling fate and he handling the independently sprouting human seeds within. Lynch handles both sides by imposing schizophrenia.But its Polish in other ways too. The actor as Golem. The environment as interleaved worlds each creating the others by being. Its a Kabbalistic concept. Both are characteristically Polish usually associated with Polish Jews but more deeply Polish. You can see how Lynch understands this because he quotes The Saragossa Manuscript a Polish film about interweaving of kabbalistic worlds and the causal confusion that it brings.The second thing is how he exploits this merger of folded narrative  where actors write new worlds layered emanations where worlds spawn others  not parallel but linked in generative fate geometric cosmology in which each act creates symmetries we encounter elsewhere.He does all this by elaborating on the symmetries of cause. Ordinarily something causes something else never backwards. Here it IS backwards forwards sideways  all the eight dimensions that an advanced student of the Maharishi knows... causal symmetries that have a geometry that doesn't quite merge with the geometry of causality. Oddly the story does make sense if you simply relax the causality a bit  its much more accessible than the Twin Peaks meander.I guess I should say that this is after the manner of the structure of Finnegans Wake. Its not as elaborate of course. It didn't take 17 years and the deliberate intent of conflating all metaphors. But it is placed in a dream logic a softening of the walls and hinges of what we make up as the logic of real life. Its Joycean through and through and not  as some would say  surreal as if anything not real is bent reality.I know of a few filmmakers who can work with these notions Medem Greenaway Madden Ruiz. This is the most delicate and focused I've seen in a long long while. You really must spend time with it. You must.Here's a serious piece of advice though. See Lynch's Rabbits episodes first separately ideally a week or so ahead. Take them in as a standalone piece a remarkable piece of film. Some of it is in this film excerpted extended reshot and literally entered by all the Dern characters. But you'd be better having that anchor before starting this tempestvoyage.Ted's Evaluation  4 of 3 Every cineliterate person should experience this.".

She really blew me away.This film  like all of Lynch's endeavors  is certainly not for everyone. It's vague bizarre jumps all over the place and at times is deeply frightening one of the few films in a long time to actually give me nightmares but in my opinion it's also truly beautiful almost serene. If you like a linear clearcut story then don't see this film. If you appreciate nonlinear surreal dramahorror however then by all means go see it.

Lynch proves that all he needs is a simple DV camera to show the world the entire range of human emotions and the human experience from the happiest to the darkest moments we must go through to achieve salvation and cleansing of the soul. This film is not so much about a particular story or narrative as it is about analyzing exploring and creating a visual palette for ideas about traveling to and from the past present and future as it relates to our constant journey back and forth into our own psyches and our collective unconscious. Each of Lynch's films explores the mind in terms of Jungian philosophy focusing particularly on The Shadow however Inland Empire goes further in this direction than any film previous to it. If Mulholland Drive was 25 a dark and surreal suspense thriller ghost story and journey into the nether regions of the mind and 75 classical yet not necessarily structural or connected narrative Inland Empire is 10 straight narrative and 90 raw psychological horror ghost story.The journey is long and hard but at the end you will be rewarded with the kind of peace and serenity that can only come from a meditation this long deep and powerful. I was filled with only inner bliss as I left the theatre and slept like a baby completely at peace. This is David Lynch's most powerful film and speaks volumes on the many unexplored topics of how this medium can communicate terrify and heal in ways we have not yet even begun to understand.".

The film is harrowing and creepy and Laura Dern is incredible in her performance. I never thought she was capable it. Fans of Lynch will love it especially those who think Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway were his best. Average filmgoers will most likely be bored it's 3 hours long or think it is Artsy crap. Lost Highway is probably his most comparable film based on structure technique and bizarre elements although it would not be entirely fair to use Lost Highway as a basis for judgment. One of the only things that keeps me from giving it a higher rating is that there are a couple scenes which seemed to drag on a little longer than necessary. Inland Empire at first is reminiscent of some of Lynch's older short films because of the way it is filmed. It is gritty shaky and even gives a documentary feel at first. While it is still not his best it's among them and it's what Lynch fans have come to expect and love.".

	schema:reviewBody "i checked the 'Contains spoiler' box with ironic intent this movie has no plot to 'spoil'. 'show business' is only an oxymoron to those who don't understand that unless there's a dialectic between what the audience wants escapism without real consequences and what the artist wants to convey that heshe has a unique vision that must be taken seriously what you wind up with is meaningless navelgazing.if there's too much control by the suits you wind up with Home Alone XX. with just the right balance between suits and a visionary artist you may get masterpieces such as Blue Velvet Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive. however once the lunatics are in charge of the asylum all too often the result is an incoherent mess like Inland Empire. Woody Allen has made a career of dramatizing insights derived from Freud. analogously the tapestry that connects Lynch's work is the mad interplay among the Jungian themes of Shadow Self Anima and Animus  but however much or little dreams may illuminate our waking reality dreams that have no referents besides other dreams if that merely obscure rather than illuminate.after a beginning that suggests we may be in for another fascinating closeup of the Munchlike horrors lying just beneath the surface of the Norman Rockwell reality we still cling to when our guard is down in a movie house all too soon we find ourselves sitting through 3 hours of boring nonsequitors.the scary scenes don't scare the sexy scenes don't arouse. because one of the most fundamental drives of the human psyche is to find meaning something that artists of the absurdist school might pause to ponder the viewer's attention winds up being riveted on Lynchian tics like light bulbs and overapmplified sounds of the background noise on a long distance phone call or is it the sound of bathroom plumbing?  who knows or cares?. the unintended result is that it feels like a parody of Lynch done by Mad TV. it's too loud too lacking in any subtlety and just plain too ugly for SNL.one of the less commented upon features found in all of Lynch's films from Blue Velvet on is that they are visually gorgeous. Inland Empire looks like a videotofilm transfer shot on a cheap camcorder. indeed from what i've read it WAS shot on a cheap camcorder. it's sad and disappointing to see a great artist lose his way. Let's hope Lynch is back to his otherwise superb form in his next film.".

'show business' is only an oxymoron to those who don't understand that unless there's a dialectic between what the audience wants escapism without real consequences and what the artist wants to convey that heshe has a unique vision that must be taken seriously what you wind up with is meaningless navelgazing.if there's too much control by the suits you wind up with Home Alone XX. with just the right balance between suits and a visionary artist you may get masterpieces such as Blue Velvet Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive. however once the lunatics are in charge of the asylum all too often the result is an incoherent mess like Inland Empire. Woody Allen has made a career of dramatizing insights derived from Freud. analogously the tapestry that connects Lynch's work is the mad interplay among the Jungian themes of Shadow Self Anima and Animus  but however much or little dreams may illuminate our waking reality dreams that have no referents besides other dreams if that merely obscure rather than illuminate.after a beginning that suggests we may be in for another fascinating closeup of the Munchlike horrors lying just beneath the surface of the Norman Rockwell reality we still cling to when our guard is down in a movie house all too soon we find ourselves sitting through 3 hours of boring nonsequitors.the scary scenes don't scare the sexy scenes don't arouse. because one of the most fundamental drives of the human psyche is to find meaning something that artists of the absurdist school might pause to ponder the viewer's attention winds up being riveted on Lynchian tics like light bulbs and overapmplified sounds of the background noise on a long distance phone call or is it the sound of bathroom plumbing?  who knows or cares?. the unintended result is that it feels like a parody of Lynch done by Mad TV. it's too loud too lacking in any subtlety and just plain too ugly for SNL.one of the less commented upon features found in all of Lynch's films from Blue Velvet on is that they are visually gorgeous. Inland Empire looks like a videotofilm transfer shot on a cheap camcorder. indeed from what i've read it WAS shot on a cheap camcorder. it's sad and disappointing to see a great artist lose his way. Let's hope Lynch is back to his otherwise superb form in his next film.";

	schema:headline " Is it brilliant or rubbish? Well for my money it is both and worth seeing regardless";
	schema:reviewBody "Whenever I saw Mullholland Drive I enjoyed it because it was such an experience but yet had much for me to try and figure out  as hard as it was to do so. Funny then to watch Inland Empire and think that in the future if it continues this way that we will look back on Lynch's earlier films as his preweird period which is strange when you watch Wild at Heart Blue Velvet etc. However this is the place we now find ourselves with Inland Empire a film that not only shuns narrative tradition but behaves as if such a thing has never existed. And to watch the film well you just need to accept this and deal with the fact that if you have even a slight grasp on the story then you should consider yourself lucky.If you can accept this then the film is flawed genius however if you cannot accept this then the film is a shambles that will make you hate it almost as soon as you realise you will not be able to get to the bottom of it just by watching it tonight. The funny thing is that both camps are right in their comments on this film because it is at once brilliant and terrible  Jonathon Ross summed it up surprisingly well when he said it was a work of genius  I think because the impression left on me was just this.On one hand the film is almost impossible to follow and it is not just a glib remark to say that this does make Mullholland Drive feel like an episode of Eastenders in regards accessibility. The plot starts out as a mystery but pretty much disappears into a series of semiconnected fantasy ? sequences where characters complete switch worlds and identities terrifying characters loom large but yet are invisible to the viewer and a sitcom featuring rabbits is watched by a girl crying in her room. There is little here to help the viewer and there is simply no foundation for you to put one foot one and say right no matter what happens I know I am on firm ground here the film doesn't pull the rug from under the viewer  there is simply never a rug to begin with. To many viewers this will be the end of discussion but for my money I already suspected this would be the case and what I actually came for was the experience.In this area the film is both brilliant but yet flawed. It is brilliant because it literally does feel like you are falling through worlds of dreams. Lynch manages to shoot his scenes with the air of them being slightly or totally unreal. The effect is completely unnerving and an example of the power of cinema that he can move the viewer into such a place mentally that even a static shot of three people dressed as rabbits is quite terrifying. It is a skill he is famous for and he shows no sign of losing it. As an experience I found it engaging to a point and unfortunately that point was not 180 minutes. It is ironic to praise the film for its freewheeling experience but yet criticise it for being undisciplined but yet here we are because it does feel very much like a film where Lynch needed someone to say look you need to make it as tight as it is exhilarating.Nobody said this I think and as a result it outstays its welcome at times and the dips are just that much more pronounced. Fortunately it is not consistent but it does come and the conclusion of the film is worth staying for. Not narratively you understand even though the threads do come together but some terrifying scenes give way to closing credits of beautiful women dancing to Nina Simone's Sinnerman does it make sense? Well no but again it is all about the experience and in this regard it is fairly consistent. Another reason for seeing it is a performance from Laura Dern that only begs the question why she didn't manage to get an Oscar nomination. OK it was a tough year for actresses with Cruz Mirren Dench and Streep filling out the list but for my money Dern is as good if not better than all of them. Lynch plays out so much confusion and emotion in her face with this making some scenes a story without a single word being said. Given how hard it is to understand what is happening in the script it makes Dern's convincing performance all the more impressive. Below her nobody is as good but everyone does suit the material and Lynch's approach.Of course aside from Dern the star is Lynch and his fans will come to this way the same Bruce Willis' fans come to a film because he is in it. His direction editing and cinematography is masterful which only really leaves his writing. Superficially he does fall down but yet he also produces a flow he understands as well as some brilliant specific moments  a line where a black homeless woman says It's OK you dying is all is a wonderfully insightful remark that is all the more impacting for the throwaway delivery of it a matteroffact summary of life on the streets in a tiny part of a bigger film.Overall then this is an impressive film that is as brilliantly bewildering as it is frustrating. Some will find meaning but the vast majority will be best served to treat it as an experience rather than a film as one would expect from any other director. Even on this basis it is not perfect and is easily too long to sustain but in this regard it is still worth seeing. Not sure if it is entirely enjoyable but for sure it is an experience I'm glad I had.".

There can be no evaluation of any specific interpretive approach. There must be such an approach whether conscious or not. Lynch would likely disagree. He's right  and some of the disappointed reviews expressed here by his fans are nice examples of why this is so. I am sure he would also understand and agree with my rebuttal  Who cares it's fun When fans either gush about the brilliance of a piece of work or resort to namecalling pretentious hipsters?? the film is like most works of art not going to allow much of a middleground. A lot of smart and wellwritten reviews here on IMDb treat the technical aspects of the film. This review is not about HOW the film was done but rather WHAT the film does. If you haven't seen the film try this review on. If it doesn't fit then I can't recommend seeing Inland Empire. If you do keep reading get it into your head that there is no spoiler here really. The interpretation offered below is not even an opinion it is simply a facile creative construct I use heuristically for talking about the film after my first viewing.If you have seen this film you will probably view the interpretation below as too simplistic  that is if you got it. That's fine. I do not care but feel free to send me a note if you want to discuss it. Keep in mind  as I stated above  I am simply using this interpretation as a means for discussion. Don't take it too seriously I really don't care to defend this. Laura Dern should win two academy awards for Inland Empire  for Best Actress as Nikki and for best supporting actress as Nikki's role of a lifetime  Susan. But she won't get nominated because this film will be systematically ignored by the mainstream. Why bring up acting talent so early in the review? Because this inherently nonlinear film though it is more linear and plot driven than Eraserhead Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway offers one of many possible possibly an infinite number of linear interpretations  the film iscould be about acting and losing one's identity in a role. It could all be going on in DernNikkiSusan's head as she comes to grips with what she is doing in the three levels of reality portrayed. If this particular interpretation were chosen the free association between the roles played by the Polish actressvictimperpetrator of the film 47 and that played by Dern's actressvictimperpetrator in Blue Skies create a metatext which though unseen and unexplicated throughout the film nevertheless identifies its subject as the disassociation and power of performance and creativity in the production of fictionrealitydrama. This interpretation is suggested by all of the many seemingly out of place and jarring details in the film  the usual red herrings Lynch throws at us to suggest that there may be some linear subtext in all of the sensual experience offered by his sumptuous immersive films. scenes from the Polish film reenactment of the film by Susan  possibly in her dreams or fantasiesThe placement of the Polish actress into a couple seemingly disparate and unconnected roles which in fact make the creation of Blue Skies and the folklore surrounding its predecessor 47 unite at a different interpretative level The rabbit people performing within the television with an incoherent but suggestive script and an absurd laugh track and especially their audience key to this interpretation because of its chronological placement in the narrative and the identity of the viewer. Nikki's opening and closing scenes and Grace Zabriskie's foreshadow which identify closure for the metaplot. The seemingly anachronistic white noise and recordcutting scenes and soundcues which occur at crucial transitions between the alternative realities inhabited by Nikki's disassociated personalities.If any of you find this interpretation compelling and would like to hear more about it feel free to send a note. It is in my opinion just as worthless as any other interpretation of art  probably better left unexpressed and unexplained. But if having something linear to talk about helps you you are welcome to further pursue it. Do not mistake this interpretation as an opinion. I have no opinion concerning the plot of this film. For my part I completely understand the film through andor without the interpretation above. Which pathway to the palace is it Alan Smithee's House on the set? I might chose whether through the back alley or the front entrance to the studio as the interpretation above offers  I get it  just as I always get Lynch more than most directors. For fellow admirers of Lynch IMO This is a more coherent film than Eraserhead a more upbeat and enjoyable film than Lost Highway a less commercial film than Mulholland Drive though it does bear some thematic resemblances largely because both films are overt selfreferential interpretations of American media culture. You might talk about it for hours afterward but this discussion will mostly only help you to know the people you attended it with better. Let it pour through your mind and soul. No profitable comparison to Lynch's more linear films can be made although on a second viewing of IE I may wish to spend some time thinking about the connection between the exploitation themes in Elephant Man and this film. Of course the directing camera work and especially the sound design are flawless. Goes without saying.".

	schema:headline " An vastly inferior companion piece to Mulholland Drive";
	schema:reviewBody "Inland Empire is an interesting premise with an absolutely horrible execution. I've liked some of David Lynch's movies Mulholland Drive was brilliant Blue Velvet was good Eraserhead was okay and I've seen a couple of other of his movies that were not bad. I was eager to see Inland Empire but by the time I saw it I was disappointed and quite frankly bored to tears.As I interpreted the story if one wants to call it a story it was about an attempted remake of an unfinished Polish film which allegedly was cursed and the new leading lady now gets to the point where she can't discern the difference between her life and what is being filmed for the movie and what happened in the unfinished Polish film and we the viewers are not intended to know the difference either. But that interesting premise is watered down to nothing in its ungodly three hour running time good acting notwithstanding. There are too many non sequiturs the rabbits from an earlier project the girls dancing while the Locomotion or what ever the hell it was was blasting the seedy alleyway conversations behind the AXXON N door the lengthy scenes of people brewing coffee far too many close ups of ugly people whispering to each other and on and on like that for three hours to honestly say that there was any point to any of it. The camera work looked like something out of a direct to video horror movie filmed on a 100 digital camera which doesn't help matters. Eraserhead looked good because of its low budget filming it added to the atmosphere not so in Inland Empire. Lynch overuses the quiet whisper immediately followed by screaming or loud musical score to the point of absurdity here. When that gimmick is used in every other scene it loses its effectiveness and merely becomes annoying. Almost all of the characters meander through bizarre living rooms Hollywood sound stages and crumbling Polish factories without anything to draw the viewer into what is taking place. Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' was brilliant it had suspense and was intentionally funny often times simultaneously Winkie's anyone? with great acting by all involved and well photographed on the streets of Hollywood. Despite not making sense on first viewing there is a somewhat discernible plot which only becomes apparent in time and after watching it repeatedly and it also leaves many things to think about afterward and makes the viewer want to go back and watch it again. Inland Empire had none of these. Mulholland Drive starts off almost making sense but then two thirds of the way into it Lynch pulled the rug out from under the audience's feet to perfect effect. Inland Empire never gives anyone a chance to grasp at any thread of a plot it never gives the viewer anything more than badly photographed images. No suspense no humour nothing. Initially I didn't understand Mulholland Drive but it stuck in my mind and I wanted to go back and watch it again to figure it out. I don't understand Inland Empire and don't want to understand it either. I don't have too much of a life but still I can't talk myself into sitting through this three hours of digital vomit again just to try and figure out if there is anything to it.

	onyx:emotionText "Inland Empire is an interesting premise with an absolutely horrible execution. I've liked some of David Lynch's movies Mulholland Drive was brilliant Blue Velvet was good Eraserhead was okay and I've seen a couple of other of his movies that were not bad. I was eager to see Inland Empire but by the time I saw it I was disappointed and quite frankly bored to tears.As I interpreted the story if one wants to call it a story it was about an attempted remake of an unfinished Polish film which allegedly was cursed and the new leading lady now gets to the point where she can't discern the difference between her life and what is being filmed for the movie and what happened in the unfinished Polish film and we the viewers are not intended to know the difference either. But that interesting premise is watered down to nothing in its ungodly three hour running time good acting notwithstanding. There are too many non sequiturs the rabbits from an earlier project the girls dancing while the Locomotion or what ever the hell it was was blasting the seedy alleyway conversations behind the AXXON N door the lengthy scenes of people brewing coffee far too many close ups of ugly people whispering to each other and on and on like that for three hours to honestly say that there was any point to any of it. The camera work looked like something out of a direct to video horror movie filmed on a 100 digital camera which doesn't help matters. Eraserhead looked good because of its low budget filming it added to the atmosphere not so in Inland Empire. Lynch overuses the quiet whisper immediately followed by screaming or loud musical score to the point of absurdity here. When that gimmick is used in every other scene it loses its effectiveness and merely becomes annoying. Almost all of the characters meander through bizarre living rooms Hollywood sound stages and crumbling Polish factories without anything to draw the viewer into what is taking place. Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' was brilliant it had suspense and was intentionally funny often times simultaneously Winkie's anyone? with great acting by all involved and well photographed on the streets of Hollywood. Despite not making sense on first viewing there is a somewhat discernible plot which only becomes apparent in time and after watching it repeatedly and it also leaves many things to think about afterward and makes the viewer want to go back and watch it again. Inland Empire had none of these. Mulholland Drive starts off almost making sense but then two thirds of the way into it Lynch pulled the rug out from under the audience's feet to perfect effect. Inland Empire never gives anyone a chance to grasp at any thread of a plot it never gives the viewer anything more than badly photographed images. No suspense no humour nothing. Initially I didn't understand Mulholland Drive but it stuck in my mind and I wanted to go back and watch it again to figure it out. I don't understand Inland Empire and don't want to understand it either. I don't have too much of a life but still I can't talk myself into sitting through this three hours of digital vomit again just to try and figure out if there is anything to it. I feel like I should take another shower after having watched Inland Empire and then watch Mulholland Drive again.  out of ";

	schema:reviewBody "Releasing this film into the world was a crime against humanity. David Lynch should be tried in the Hague. It wasn't so much a film as it was a 2 hours and 50 minutes bout of emotional vomit onto the screen. Dark disjointed and incoherent. The sound recording was physically painful to hear. Half the dialog was either whispered or mumbled contrasted with screeching and roaring background noises. And don't look for help understanding the words from subtitles unless you speak French. It had two sets of French subtitles and none in English or any other language. This may have been done as a favor to hearing impaired nonFrench speakers. Many scenes were too dark to see anything at all. In a film of this length the DVD came with no scene selection.really It did however come with a video calibration feature which allows the viewer to fine tune his picture so he can see the dark intentionally blurred and black and white scenes just as the the director intended. I may now understand what it would be like to have a very bad LSD trip while in a mental institution and suffering from Botulism. The talent of Jeremy Irons Harry Dean Stanton and many others was completely wasted with no plot or meaningful dialog. Laura Dern did demonstrate great acting ability in a series of disjointed scenes. Shame it was wasted in this stream of unconsciousness. I would like to see her do more actual movies. I have followed David Lynch's work starting with Eraserhead and have kept watching because his films are strange and different. I think he reached back into his Eraserhead bag of tricks here but this time pulled out a turd. The difference is that in Eraserhead the characters suffered. Here only the viewer suffers. We all would have been better off if he had just colorized Eraserhead. This film was so bad that it retroactively ruined most of his previous work. At this point I would say that only Wild at Heart and Twin Peaks are worth watching. Every copy of the rest of David Lynch's films should be destroyed. Not turning this thing whatever it was off after 10 minutes was one of the worst mistakes of my life. Worse than dropping out of college. Worse than not marrying my high school sweetheart.".

He discovered the handheld camera. Cool. He's created the most cutup story ever. Cool. But a somehow he doesn't seem to be able to combine the two b he seems to have little confidence in it himself. Some of the shots work like the dancing scene. Some shots work with the hand held. But sometimes he uses his old filmic language with the handheld and it DOES NOT WORK. It gives the impression that what you're seeing is actually the evolution that Lynch's style has undergone in the past 5 years without him being able to take position. Emblematic to that problem is the fact that Rabbitsparts are included which include Mulholland Dr actors and which dates from 4 four! years earlier filmed in his moving painting style.In short I had the impression that Lynch has evolved and that this would have been a great film if he'd been honest to himself and keep only the radically new bits instead of keeping everything in leading to an inconsistent hodgepodge.Maybe it's telling that in last year's DVDissues of Lost Highway or was it MDr? he actually explains part of his storytelling technique.

Or something like that anyway. There's lots of wandering about in dimly lit rooms subplots and sequences that seem to have little bearing on the supposed plot and a whole lot of boredom. In fact this is one of the most boring films I've had the misfortune to sit through. It's as if Lynch goes out of his way to alienate most of his viewers.I certainly won't be in a hurry to watch any more of his work  aside from THE ELEPHANT MAN which I remember being very good.";

I respect them so much I will not embarrass them by giving out their names but they know who they are and they're going to the cinema to see Nuri Bilge Ceylan's IKHIMLER next week and because of their taste in film I think I'll stay at home because in my humble opinion INLAND EMPIRE is one of the worst pieces of dung ever committed to celluloid I'm not a great Lynch fan but I did enjoy THE ELEPHANT MAN and WILD AT HEART had its moments as did ERASERHEAD despite  or because of  its bizarre atmosphere . If you liked these movies you will hate INLAND EMPIRE . If you disliked these movies you will absolutely despise INLAND EMPIRE . If you loved these movies you will possibly only merely dislike INLAND EMPIRE !!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!! The problem with the movie is that it feels like it's being made up as it goes along . That's because the movie is being made up as it goes along ! We start off with a man and woman their faces obscured speaking a Slavonic language about to have sex . We then cut to a situation comedy starring what can only be described as  Rabbit people  which is being watched by a weeping woman . The story then cuts to movie star Nikki Grace being cast in a film that was previously abandoned during the production stage because the male and female lead were murdered  Hey Theo I think I know where this might be heading . Nikki finds herself caught up in a dangerous situation ala classic Hitchcock  Yeah well that's where I thought it was heading but then .... well I don't know what happened because everything started going haywire . Nikki finds herself caught up in a kind of metaphysical universe with another visit to the rabbit people I thought I'd missed something so popped out of the cinema for a cigarette just to see if my confusion was caused by a lack of nicotine . I returned and instantly thought I'd walked into the wrong screening because the story now involved whores dancing around to a pumping soundtrack of Little Eva . More cuts to Nikki in a metaphysical universe  more cuts to the rabbit people sitcom . After two hours of this esoteric crap I decided that I'd had enough and decided to catch the last bus home . Sure as hell I wasn't going to endure a very long walk or an expensive taxi ride in order to catch the end of this vanity project And I made the correct decision because when we discussed the movie the next day everyone agreed on one thing  None of us knew WTF it was about . It's never revealed who the rabbit people were or who the weeping woman was  though I would hazard a guess it was possibly someone who spent 4.20 for a ticket to watch this garbage which I can honestly say is the worst movie I have ever seen in a cinema . I wasn't all that keen on the last movie I saw in a cinema  OUTLAW but at least it had a story no matter how contrived and underdeveloped Nick Love's screenplay wasINLAND EMPIRE may work as a drug movie  The audience were suspiciously quiet as in they might have been smoking a certain brand of tobacco that can't be bought in shops  or as irony in that the writer director is called Lynch which is exactly what I wanted to do with anyone who financed this rubbish . People may defend the movie by saying it's an enigma wrapped up in a mystery but take it from me it's excrement wrapped up in manure".

I still remember the brouhaha over the casting of Matthew Broderick as Shaw and I see that even now some IMDb posters single him out for fault in Glory. Sorry but I disagree. One should remember that the real Col. Shaw was a young man in his mid20s  hardly a grizzled old veteran  despite his high rank. Broderick actually does bear a resemblance to Shaw and shouldn't be criticized for his boyish looks. I felt every nuance of the burden he carried and thought Broderick did a wonderful job.Denzel Washington's powerful acting may never again have a showcase like it did in Glory. His beauty rage and pride scream in every frame. His Oscar for this breakout role was highly deserved. Trip's character is really the distillation of what this film is all about the black man's heartrending battle for worth recognition and dignity. As far as I'm concerned no one BUT Washington could have played Trip. Thank God for Denzel!Morgan Freeman is the film's human core. His quiet compassion and leadership keeps the soldiers focused. His one angry confrontation with Trip proves he has the goods to back up a field promotion to Sergeant Major.Freeman an appropriate reminder of where surnames come from is the father figure the regiment desperately needs in a time of death and crisis. The men look to him for his calming wisdom and reasonable fair demeanor.Films like Saving Private Ryan raised the technical bar for battle scenes.The fighting scenes in Glory are unfortunately it's weakest element. The staging and choreography are mediocre at best. And other than a scene where the 54th Massachusetts is given a hero's flanking onto the battlefield beaches of South Carolina these shots don't emotionally engage the viewer. Still in the end Glory isn't about big noisy battles. It's about the transcendence of the human spirit in the face of bigotry bad treatment and almost certain death. It's about a watershed moment in our bloody history that elevated us all and must never be forgotten.Glory is indeed glorious.".

	schema:reviewBody "To be quite honest I had low expectations for Glory. It was just another boring day at school sitting in my history class drawing random drawings in my notebook. Suddenly my teacher says we're going to watch a movie. I wake up from my dreamy state and I decide I'll give it a chance. He loads the VCR tape into the machine and I fix my eyes upon the screen.I will put Glory into a few wordsthis is what every war movie strives to be and beyond. Glory tells the story of a Civil War colonel Matthew Broderick who leads the war's first allblack volunteer regimen into battles and discovers along the way he has to confront the moral question of racial prejudice within and outside of his regimen.So as I'm sitting in history class watching Glory I immediately begin to perk up. From the explosive first scene I was fully awake. My luck skyrocketed when I discovered two of my alltime favorite actors in the film Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The movie progressed and I found myself becoming yet more and more drawn into the filmnot just watching it but actually EXPERIENCING every ounce of war prejudice and moral questions that face the characters in the movie.What's even more is that you find yourself becoming attached to ALL of the charactersevery single black soldierin some strange way so strange that when these men fall in battle you feel a jolt of power inside of you that is converted to emotional sadness in your mind.The final scenes in Glory are mesmerizing. No more than thatutterly spectacular. The final battle scene at Fort Wagner is so amazingly shot you will think you're actually there fighting along with the black regimen. You're not in your seat watching the filmyou feel like you're there! The final battle scene is so spectacular it will easily remain one of the most memorable battle scenes I've ever witnessed in all of film. After watching Glory you will find yourself truly moved in all ways possible. You will almost feel like a new person.All of this paired with a beautiful score by James Horner Glory is simply one of the best war movies of alltime. Anyone who misses this film is missing out one of the most powerful moving and memorable experiences a movie can bring you.I'm so glad I found myself in history this year.".

	schema:headline " A terribly underrated film which deserved better";
	schema:reviewBody "With one of the best ensemble casts of all time this ranks as one of the best war films of all time. With a collection of great black actors like no other everything seemed to work well in this film from the cinematography to the acting. Edward Zwick created a masterpiece which in any other year would have swept most of the major awards. Sadly this did not even make the AFI Top 100 so inferior movies could squeeze in. In my opinion the likes of Born on the Fourth of July and Driving Miss Daisy were vastly inferior to this film during the 1990 Academy Awards. I mean how the heck were films like Dead Poets Society and My Left Foot nominated for best picture when  this one wasn't? sure they were good films but c'monMatthew Broderick completely surprised me with his performance as well as Cary Elwes. And one cannot forget the likes of Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman giving great performances as soldiers weary of being the Union's lackeys. While the historical accuracy may not be perfect as least this was a tribute to those who helped emancipate the slaves during the Civil War.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an ambitious film and is successful in everything it sets out to accomplish. Glory does not rely on the visual aspects to accomplish its perfection but rather it relies on the emotional to convey its message and humanity. This is a film that managed to get some of the best actors of our time as well as withdraw from these actors their best abilities. While the film does show the realities and horror of war especially when it involves good people thrown in it captures the viewers attention by making us empathetic as opposed to simply sympathetic. The score of the film is done by the brilliant James Horner which compliments the film but at times envelops the film completely. Director Zwick shows the various levels of humanity one scene can display the blunt bravery of these men and yet the next scene reminds us how scared and how human these men are. I wish I could write a paragraph on each actor but I must mention Matthew Broderick Morgan Freeman Denzel Washingtion Andre Braugher Cary Elwes and Jihmi Kennedy. The characters of this film are wonderfully welldeveloped and the relationships between these men adds a dimension that is rarely seen in modern films. Each performance is Oscarcalibur overall this is a film that should now be ranked as a classic for all time. Simply amazing.".

Who didn't wince and watch in horror when Shaw and his regiment were blown to bits during the Antietam scene which I would guess it was the West Woods portion of the Antietam battle???  Who didn't feel uplifted when the 54th cuts down the Confederate cavalry charge which foolishly thought it would be no problem to break the lines of an inexperienced and black regiment?  And finally who didn't watch with solemn pride the dramatic climax of the Fort Wagner assault.This movie shows that even though the men were treated as even below second class citizens by their own country and army they still had the integrity and honor to fight the best they could for the Union  and eachother.  That's why those men in the 54th and every other black regiment stood out from the rest.  They must have known of America's potential even before America did and fought to develop that and win black people the dignity and respect they always deserved but never got.

Matthew Broderick Ferris Bueller's Day Off Godzilla stars as Robert Shaw a white man in command of the regiment. Cary Elwes The Princess Bride Kiss the Girls is his second in command. Denzel Washington The Siege Courage Under Fire is magnificent as a runaway slave in the 54th.  The alwaysgreat Morgan Freeman Seven Deep Impact is superb as a spiritual leader of the soldiers.  In my mind the film has no faults.  Broderick has been the main criticism by some people. I have to disagree.  Broderick though a bit younglooking gives a wonderful performance.  Cary Elwes has been an underrated actor his whole career.  The same goes for Glory because his great supporting performance was widely ignored.  James Horner delivers a haunting score which adds so much to the movie.  A must see.".

Even as I sit here for what must be the 206th viewing I marvel as acutely as I did in the very first viewing that this tale has the compelling and overwhelming power to touch aesthetically viscerally profoundly and emotionally my sense of prideinjustice soul. Even if this were not a true story I would still recommend this movie to everyone with awe and reverence. And even as I watch there is gooseflesh and damp eyes. As there always is...Based on the letters compiled and only two reference books including One Gallant Rush by Peter Burchard which I proudly own this tells the tale of the heretofore largely unknown 54th Massachusetts Infantry the first AfroAmerican regimen in American history during the Civil War. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw was a 26year old bright eyed Bostonian who was chosen by favor to lead the first colored regimen at the apex of the Civil War. Matthew Broderick portrays Col. Shaw as accurately as possible bringing the youth and zeal of the real Shaw to grand light. He was truly overwhelmed by the thought of leading the troops but idealistic and optimistic enough to give it everything he had and to make his family and title proud. Broderick never loses sight of the simple fact that Shaw was humble and grateful for every advancement he was given. Although in reality the 54th was compiled of mostly free black men from upper New England Denzel Washington is cast as the runaway slave Trip who brings his grudges and injustices to the troop. He portrays a slave who is on a personal mission to hurt those who have hurt him if you know about the history of slavery one can hardly blame him but in the process hurts himself all the more until by rote he learns to channel his hate into determination and by his actions is humiliated and beaten down to the point that he can only rise up like a griffin and prove that he is as much a soldier as the rest of them. The 'whipping scene' in which you see him go through that exact process every emotion known to a man culminating in a quiver of the cheek a single tear escaping and eyes that shred plea hate mourn haunt. That Denzel could convey that with a role that could have easily been a stereotype deserves more praise that I can type. Morgan Freeman is a man of quiet yet profound dignity that carries him in every role he plays and this time as Rawlins is no exception. He is a victim of prejudice but still carries his own as a man. He is there for his men as a leader even before being officially decorated but he is not above reaching out to Shaw to help his men simply because Shaw is yet another white authorityhe helps the cause no matter the colors. And that cause is so much more than the War which I will explain further below...The score by the wunderkind James Horner is Majesty in every literary definition of the word. I know that if I'm ever stressed and need a release all I have to do is pop in a CD of this score listen for only a few minutes and I will be sobbing. In my humble opinion he has yet to top himself with his work in this picture. From the subtle ache of a single horn to the swelling of the Harlem Boys' Choir and their keening voices that beg us to remember forever.I won't break down the actors directing or anything individually any more than I have because that's not the intention of this film. It's not a star vehicle but rather hundreds of people coming together to tell a story they believe in. And as such deserve to be praised as a whole which only proves how well they've done their work. But some scenes cannot escape the psyche...The morning after they've been read a proclamation stating that they will be put to death black and white if caught bearing Union arms and there they stand as a unit for roll call not one man deserting at attention for duty prouder and taller than ever...The aforementioned Corporal Punishment scene which by the way was the same punishment white officers would suffer if they deserted as well...The charge on Fort WagnerShaw finally returning to the seashore he so loved all his life for what he knows in his heart is the last time feeling home again and yet feeling already a walking spectreRawlins with a divine inner pride in his eyes marching toward the fort as Thomas looks to the others and Trip with no longer the mad lashingout force to kill but the aggravated determination to winthe company as a whole marching into Fate with a gallant unified step...The true meaning of hero is in the heart of a man who faces even death if it will prove himself a man not only to others but to himself. This lies true for every person in that brave pioneering regimen black and white. They didn't just die for their country or their rights but for their own personal honors and faiths as human beings who are deserved of dignity. The likes of which this country will never see again but must not fall into obscurity. At the heart and in my heart this is not a story of men but what it means to be a man. And the sacrifice it sometimes takes to become one and prove yourself one. We as a Nation as Earth should thank the 54th for that beautiful lesson. This pristine film will guarantee it so.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Gould Shaw Matthew Broderick a young officer in the American Civil War is singled out for heroism at the bloody Battle of Antietam. Promoted to colonel he is commissioned the commander of the 54th Massachusetts infantry  a regiment made up entirely of black soldiers. With the help of his friend Cabot Forbes Cary Elwes and a loudmouthed Irish drill sergeant John Finn Shaw whips his recruits into a fine unit. However he learns that his superior officers  namely crooked department leader General Harker Bob Gunton and Colonel Montgomery Cliff De Young his racist brigade commander  have no intention of letting his troops into action. However they finally do get a chance winning a skirmish with a Confederate patrol and then leading an assault on Fort Wagner one of the Confederate forts protecting Charleston South Carolina. The attack fails Shaw is killed and over half the regiment with him  but the 54th Massachusetts earns its place in history.If nothing else Glory deserves credit for shining the light on one of the most overlooked chapters in American history. While thousands of white men died for the Union in fruitless charges from Fredericksburg to Shiloh white leaders throughout the North were reluctant to arm blacks for a variety of reasons  they couldn't fight they would incite the border states to leave the Union white soldiers wouldn't allow it  but finally it occurred. The 54th Massachusetts was not the first black regiment raised nor was it the first to see combat in the Civil War  but it was arguably the most important. After its attack on Fort Wagner even the most bigoted white politicians had to admit that blacks were just as good as whites. By war's end over 100000 blacks were in uniform and black troops of the Union XXV Corps were the first to enter Richmond after its fall to Union forces in April 1865. This is movie is a perfect tribute to the men of the 54th and to every black soldier who overcame the odds to prove themselves worthy.The cast is amazing in this film with Matthew Broderick giving a bravura performance as Shaw. Shaw himself is only in his twenties but is forced to become the leader of some 700 men most of them older than him and train them to be good fighters. Shaw is doggedly determined to prove himself and other than one or two overlong speeches Broderick does a marvelous job despite a ridiculous Boston accent portraying this heroic figure. Denzel Washington got a welldeserved Oscar for his role as Trip the bitter black soldier who struggles to find himself while serving in the regiment. Morgan Freeman as usual is amazing as Sergeant Rawlins the gravediggerturnedsoldier who becomes a father figure to Shaw's ragged men. Jhimi Kennedy and Andre Brougher are also solid as other black soldiers while Cary Elwes John Finn Cliff De Young Bob Gunton Jay O. Sanders Richard Riehle and Alan North are all fine in supporting roles.Edward Zwick's direction is stellar catching the feel of Civil War times with splendid detail. The battle scenes are spectacular with the final assault on Fort Wagner one of the most heartpounding action scenes in any war movie. Kevin Jarre's screenplay is exceptionally wellwritten and a world apart from the more witty script he would write for Tombstone several years later. And James Horner's haunting score is an instant classic.While it can be argued that the unsuccessful assault on Fort Wagner had little importance to the overall Civil War it did have massive importance for America's black community and showed that they too had a place not only in the military but in society as well. Glory is a fitting tribute to men who are overshadowed by the glories of Gettysburg and Chickamauga but are just as deserving of recognition for their extraordinary heroism.Nine stars.".

While thousands of white men died for the Union in fruitless charges from Fredericksburg to Shiloh white leaders throughout the North were reluctant to arm blacks for a variety of reasons  they couldn't fight they would incite the border states to leave the Union white soldiers wouldn't allow it  but finally it occurred. The 54th Massachusetts was not the first black regiment raised nor was it the first to see combat in the Civil War  but it was arguably the most important. After its attack on Fort Wagner even the most bigoted white politicians had to admit that blacks were just as good as whites. By war's end over 100000 blacks were in uniform and black troops of the Union XXV Corps were the first to enter Richmond after its fall to Union forces in April 1865. This is movie is a perfect tribute to the men of the 54th and to every black soldier who overcame the odds to prove themselves worthy.The cast is amazing in this film with Matthew Broderick giving a bravura performance as Shaw. Shaw himself is only in his twenties but is forced to become the leader of some 700 men most of them older than him and train them to be good fighters. Shaw is doggedly determined to prove himself and other than one or two overlong speeches Broderick does a marvelous job despite a ridiculous Boston accent portraying this heroic figure. Denzel Washington got a welldeserved Oscar for his role as Trip the bitter black soldier who struggles to find himself while serving in the regiment. Morgan Freeman as usual is amazing as Sergeant Rawlins the gravediggerturnedsoldier who becomes a father figure to Shaw's ragged men. Jhimi Kennedy and Andre Brougher are also solid as other black soldiers while Cary Elwes John Finn Cliff De Young Bob Gunton Jay O. Sanders Richard Riehle and Alan North are all fine in supporting roles.Edward Zwick's direction is stellar catching the feel of Civil War times with splendid detail. The battle scenes are spectacular with the final assault on Fort Wagner one of the most heartpounding action scenes in any war movie. Kevin Jarre's screenplay is exceptionally wellwritten and a world apart from the more witty script he would write for Tombstone several years later. And James Horner's haunting score is an instant classic.While it can be argued that the unsuccessful assault on Fort Wagner had little importance to the overall Civil War it did have massive importance for America's black community and showed that they too had a place not only in the military but in society as well. Glory is a fitting tribute to men who are overshadowed by the glories of Gettysburg and Chickamauga but are just as deserving of recognition for their extraordinary heroism.Nine stars.";

The movie has an excellent cast which includes Mathew Broderickonly three years after he was in Ferris Buellers Day Off Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman.I first saw this in my eight grade history class when we were learning about the Civil War. This movie has a great score and it really captures the feel of the Civil War through its battle scenes. For those of you who only watch war movies to see people getting their heads blown off this is the wrong movie for you. This movie focuses on the characters and what they're going through. Despite having a long running time the result of this movie is an entertaining and well made war movie.You should only buy this movie if you really like it because it gets a little bit slow the second time you see it. Either way I'd say you should watch this movie to see what quality war films are all about.".

	schema:reviewBody "Classic Civil War film with an interesting screenplay written by Kevin Jarre  based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the novel Lay This Laurel by Lincoln Kirstein . Robert Gould Shaw leads the US Civil War's first allblack volunteer company fighting prejudices of both his own Union army and the Confederates . The story is based on the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry the first formal unit of the US Army to be made up entirely of African American men as told from the point of view of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw Matthew Broderick  its commanding officer during the American Civil War. Captain Robert Gould Shaw leads a company of Union soldiers from a Massachusetts Infantry Regiment in an attack on Confederate troops at the Battle of Antietam on September 17 1862. His regiment suffers heavy losses Shaw is wounded and later loses consciousness. He is awakened by a black gravedigger named John Rawlins Morgan Freeman and sent to a field hospital. While receiving medical attention Shaw is told that President Lincoln is on the verge of passing the Emancipation Proclamation freeing slaves in rebel held territory. While on leave in Boston Shaw is promoted to Colonel and given command of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry the first allblack regiment . Shaw was approached by his father Peter Michael Goetz while in camp in late 1862 to take command of a new AllBlack Regiment and writes a letter her mother Jane Alexander . He accepts the assignment  and asks his friend  Cabot Forbes Gary Elwes to be his secondincommand . At first he declined the offer but after careful thought he accepted the position. Shaw's letters clearly state that he was dubious about a free black unit succeeding but the dedication of his men deeply impressed him and he grew to respect them as fine soldiers. On learning that black soldiers would receive less pay than white ones he inspired his unit to conduct a boycott until this inequality was rectified . Their first volunteer soldier is another of Shaw's friends an educated black man named Thomas Searles Andre Braugher. Later on  join other AfricanAmerican soldiers an utter allstarcast  Morgan Freeman  Denzel Washington and a tough Sergeant Major Mulcahy John Finn. At the ending  Shaw volunteers the 54th infantry to lead an assault on Fort Wagner. After nightfall he leads the men in a charge upon the fort. Numerous soldiers in the regiment charge up the parapet and die in the fighting too .This wonderful film with an enormous attention to period detail is full of thrills  with battle scenes are truly breathtaking  historical events and moving scenes . Intelligent in its storytelling drama  it turns to be a thoughtprovoking and powerful story with several emotive moments . The picture's strength belongs to the powerhouse secondary casting with topnotch performances from Morgan Freeman  Andre Braugher  Jihmi Kennedy  Cliff De Young  Bob Gunton  Richard Rhiele  Donovan Leitch among others . Epic and stirring final battle carried out by Shaw volunteers the 54th infantry to lead an assault on Fort Wagner . Colorful cinematography by the British Freddie Francis  a magnificent cameraman and also filmmaker . Special mention to the marvelous soundtrack composed by James Horner in conjunction with the Boys Choir of Harlem  one of the best of the cinema's history . Lavishly produced by TriStar and stunningly directed by Edward Zwick .The film deservedly received Academy Award nominations for Best Editing and Best Art Direction. It won a number of awards from the British Academy Awards and the Golden Globes. Denzel Washington won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his splendid portrayal of Trip  the proud and upright soldier . Rating  Above average  two thumbs up  it's long overdue and moving tribute to the AfricanAmerican soldiers who fought for the Union cause in the Civil War . This is an admirable effort with true social significance that results to be surprisingly entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of Col. Robert G. Shaw Matthew Broderick and the 54th Massachusetts Coloured Infantry one of the first black regiments to see action in the Civil War. The production values to 'Glory' were extremely well done in all areas. The acting was faultless leading and supporting cast showed continuity throughout the film. Matthew Broderick's role sometimes irked me because I suppose he was young and unprepared of his leadership. Several times in the film his position was tested he had to prove himself and stand firm on his commands which at times seemed naive and harsh. As the film progressed you saw his character become stronger with the help of his black mentor John Rawlins Morgan Freeman. The first time I watched this film I know I judged his character unfairly watching it again I found a more subtle and hidden meaning to his personality.The script enables some very convincing characterizations especially for the four main AfricanAmerican actors. The story is based on notes written by Col. Shaw himself.he tells of the racial bigotry on both sides. Unfortunately as most Hollywood films go not all of the storyline is correct apparently Col. Shaw didn't write about 4 bonded friends. Nevertheless the main focus should be on the event and the men who participated in the Civil War and for those who gave their lives in the hope of freedom. Quite a realistic film 'Glory' might not display the level of impact as some of it's predecessors .but it serves as an account to which certain men are prepared to give their all for what they believe in. 'Glory'to me was a film not just about war but a deeper meaning between men who bonded and gave themselves dignity and pride a selfworth in the face of adversity and possible death. The adversities these men had to overcome were many basic requirements the average white soldier would take for granted. For instance shoes uniform equal pay..every possible avenue Col. Shaw took he was faced with resistance to assist his infantry. Even the absurd order which was passed down to deter the men even further saying any coloured prisoner of war caught would be put to death and any white officers leading an infantry of coloured soldiers would meet the same fate. The Union whether or not it took their plot seriously had no intention to allow a black infantry to participate in any battles. Col. Shaw in his quiet demeanour persuadedblackmailed his fellow officers to permit his regiment the right to fight. Hypocrisy was certainly rife in the ranks of the Union did the attitudes of the South herald somewhat in the hearts of most white men of both sides???The final battle scene shows the determination and strength these men had within.and their conviction to themselves and to their fellow man. I took particular interest in the final footnotes after the film had finished. The notes capped off the final scene to say the 54th had lost over half it's numbers in the assault on Fort Wagnerthe Fort was never taken. As word spread of their bravery Congress at last authorized the raising of black troops throughout the Union over 180000 volunteered. President Lincoln credited these men of colour with helping turn the tide of war. Makes you wonder who actually was the enemy..the Union the South or both?For me 'Glory' rates.8.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "I find it sad that noone really knew about the 54th Maschusetts till this film came out. I certainly had no idea about the 54th and never knew there were black soldiers fighting in the war which to me is shocking. Those soldiers may not have taken Fort Wagner but they were brave and didn't flinch from the duty they volunteered for no matter the treatment they endured by their own side.The film has many multilayered strands that are explored in this movie. One this had never been done before black soldiers fighting in the war and they had a lot more to prove than the white soldiers. Totally unfair. Two they had death threats from the Confederate Army who said they would not capture them but kill them on sight. Three the racism they faced in their own army. The Northerners liked to think they were better than the Southerners because they didn't have slaves and they would never treat them the way the Southerners did but they were just as bad as the South and this is shown in the film when the black soldiers are denied boots uniforms they are used for manual labour and don't see any fighting and are given less wages than the white soldiers. Then we have the stories of soldiers where we see them grow into completely different people to when the film started. The actors are in one word brilliant. I can't stop raving about them. I wouldn't like to say more because I can't put into any other meaningful words how well they fit into the characters.Colonel Robert Gould Shaw Matthew Broderick finds himself overwhelmed with the responsibility of getting the men up to the task but at times finds himself doubting his abilities. There has been made mention Broderick's age and acting in this film but he was the perfect actor to play the role. For one he looks like Shaw and for another he was about the age Shaw was when he was given command. He plays Shaw just right not too understated and not too over the top.Rawlins Morgan Freeman is the wise man who is like a father figure to the soldiers who rely on him and also Shaw looks to Rawlins for his advice on the men.Trip Denzel Washington starts off defiant. He wants to fight in the war but he also is scarred by his past as a slave and doesn't trust Shaw or any other white man. I didn't think I would feel any compassion about him as he is nasty to some of his fellow soldiers but I grew to like him very much and you see a softer side to him near the end when he admits to his fellow soldiers they are the only family he has now. I like to think at the end he trusted Shaw because he picks up the colours which he said he didn't want to do when asked by Shaw earlier in the film.Thomas Andre Braugher is a free black man who has lived in the North for most if not all of his life. He has never been a slave but is well educated and finds himself an outsider in the regiment because he has had an easier life then his fellow soldiers but you see him grow up in this film he starts off as a little boy but by the end of it he is a man who can face anything.Major Forbes Cary Elwes knows that there is noway the Army will let them fight and you can see how he genuinely cares for these men. He and Shaw find it hard to establish a different type of relationship with Thomas then they are used to as before they were friends.This is a very emotional film to watch. It has many highs and lows and you have these foreboding feelings in the pit of your stomach when Shaw volunteers his men for basically a suicide mission to Fort Wagner. You know that these men you have watched from the beginning and have rooted for will die and it is hard to watch when it happens. The scene that particularly upsets me is when these brave courageous soldiers are dead they are just chucked into a mass grave and the most moving scene for me is when the dead bodies of Trip and Shaw are thrown together in the mass grave. That had me in tears the most.The 54th got praise for what they did at Fort Wagner and after but they were treated very badly they were not invited to the parades to welcome the soldiers back at the end of the war and there was no help given to them to recover from it either. It does highlight that racism occurred in the military not just in this war but in other wars before and after the American Civil War where people of different colour were treated as if they were not even human.Love the film but if you're a girl you will need tissues by your side.".

I felt empowered when Thomas became the first draftee for the 54th. I was excited watching the regiment destroying the Confederates during their skirmish. I felt Thomas' pain when he was shot for the first time. I was proud of Pvt. Trip when he was asked to be the flag bearer for the regiment. And I cried when the regiment was decimated during the battle of Fort Wagner.This movie sent me through such a range of emotions that i couldn't help but love it and I'm sure anyone else who watches this movie would feel the same".

I felt empowered when Thomas became the first draftee for the 54th. I was excited watching the regiment destroying the Confederates during their skirmish. I felt Thomas' pain when he was shot for the first time. I was proud of Pvt. Trip when he was asked to be the flag bearer for the regiment. And I cried when the regiment was decimated during the battle of Fort Wagner.This movie sent me through such a range of emotions that i couldn't help but love it and I'm sure anyone else who watches this movie would feel the same";

All I can say is that he makes the film work for me. WhetherBroderick under played the part or not I couldn't imagine any otheractor being more appropriate for the part. Not only were his looksand age ideal for the individual he was recreating but hisperformance gave Gould the personality he needed as someonewho was idealistic young and somewhat callow yet ultimatelydisplayed great maturity and fantastic courage. While Denzel Washington's performance was far more forcefuland aptly so I honestly found Broderick's character the mostcompelling in the movie.By the climactic battle I felt great empathy for each of thecharacters especially Col. Shaw. I guess I feel that by playingShaw as a quiet rather than grand presence Broderick is able tomore successfully highlight the extraordinary bravery and moralfibre the man showed in his willingness to sacrifice everything forhis men and their cause. Though you could clearly see that hedreaded his duty he carried it out unflinchingly. Thats whatleadership is all about. I like heroes who show their humanityinfinitely more than those hollywoodised cutouts that actors likeBruce Willis often play. I've never actually seen Ferris Bueller's day out. A lot of people whowrite about Glory say that its hard not to see that characterwherever Broderick goes. I'll be interested to see Ferris Buellernow that I've established Broderick in my mind as a Civil warofficer. I'll be happy to here anyones comments on the subject.".

When Matthew Broderick galloped up to the shoreline before the last battle and looked out into the ocean and the approaching sunset I just lost it. Through his eyes you can see a man looking out at the sunset for the last time in his life and with a foreshadowing knowledge that he would not live to see the sunrise again.

It is highly entertaining moving realistic and downright transcendent in its beauty. Every actor does his job marvelously from the amazing portrayal of Trip by Denzel Washington to the steady inspiring character that Morgan Freeman creates perfectly to the babyfaced Colonel Robert Gould Shaw played with sincerity and intensity by Matthew Broderick down to the minor role of the buttkicking Irish drill sergeant who abuses his black recruits physically and verbally calling them You Mexican African whores! and other lovely epithets. That latter actor incidentally wanted so badly to be a part of the film that he offered to work for free!I'm frustrated when I recommend this movie to friends and others and they respond with I don't like war movies. Sure Welles's Citizen Kane is a movie about business and Chaplin's City Lights is about panhandling not true?But like those two wonders Glory tells its story perfectly complete with great characters that you love beautifully realized photography and action and a deep emotional wellspring that leaves a viewer lifted high above and beyond the TV room sofa. It is in my Top Five and it is one of those films I just have to see every year or so like the Lord of the Rings trilogy or Bridge on the River Kwai or The Godfather movies. If you aren't thrilled to the depths of your being during the last ten minutes of this movie then you don't have a pulse.It's just a great film and if you've never seen it do! It won't disappoint and it will be etched in your memory forever. It is a masterpiece.".

Some historical liberties may have been taken but it is an outstanding story of courage bravery camaraderie and honor as well as the horror that was the War Between the States.  From the opening scene to the last the cinematography and the battle scenes are spectacular. Simply remembering the scene where the Confederate troops emerge from the smoke and haze in the forest during one of the battles scenes runs chills up and down my spine. I could actually feel in my own gut the fear and bravery of the soldiers of the 54th who held the line during the Confederate charge. Amazing.The title Glory is most fitting and says it all.

Denzel Washington Morgan Freeman and Mathew Brodrick made the film a remarkable work of art. Glory was a strong film and i think it is arguably the best civil war movie yet to be made. The ending was excellent and original. The movie was seen through the eyes of Mathew Brodrick otherwise know as the white commander of the 54th regiment Robert Shaw and how he feels for his black soldiers it was truly moving. Most Civil War Movies are long and drag some extent but Glory got to the point quickly. The action in the film was limited to three war scenes but that is not a bad thing. I was hoping for a little more action but i guess i was satisfied with what little war violence was in it. In conclusion Glory was a magnificent movie and i would recommend it to anyone wanting to have an educational experience or just wanting to see a good movie".

And even some of the discrimination the soldiers faced in the battalion. Also the characters are all very dynamic and have a nice character arch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a matthew broderick fan or someone who is a fan of war movies.".

Because most movies about the civil war don't ever really talk about the fact that slaves did go and join the union after the emancipation act. And even some of the discrimination the soldiers faced in the battalion. Also the characters are all very dynamic and have a nice character arch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a matthew broderick fan or someone who is a fan of war movies.";

	schema:reviewBody "Minispoilers within...This is an Elvis movie that I always thought was undeservedly overlooked and a cut above most of his others.  On present viewing I can see that it's a little bit soapier than I remember  some of the incidental music doesn't help there  but it's still a rewarding film to watch.  Besides it's Elvis dude and he's cool and complete with the sideburns that he'd abandoned between 1958 and 1968.  Shot in the spring of 1969 Change Of Habit was Elvis' last scripted film.  It's a definite change.  His roles had been quite different than the typical 1960s 'travelogues' since 1968's Stay Away Joe a film with potential that missed the mark for the most part and this one includes such atypical fare as an attempted rape a man punching a woman mild bad language and racist epithets brutal violence and talk of drugs.  It's the most sociallyconscious Elvis film since 1960's excellent Flaming Star.Elvis' acting is good throughout for the most part though sometimes I get the feeling that he's relieved to be almost free of the movie contracts. Still he proves once again that he had what it took to be a very good actor.  Less than a month before work began on this film Elvis completed a set of legendary recording sessions in Memphis that eventually resulted in a host of gold records Suspicious Minds that tore up the charts and even topped them and a bunch of other songs that remain lesserknown but among the best that Elvis ever recorded.  The sessions presented him with a new challenge and he more than rose to it.  On July 31 he rose to the next challenge when he opened in Las Vegas beginning his first real live performances since three 1961 charity concerts and eventually leading to him resuming touring.  This film project paled by comparison.  Still the result's worthwhile.  Some of Elvis' dialogue isn't all that convincing but he was always good at saying a lot with a look and he does so in this movie many times.  He also was always thoroughly capable of being convincing in moments of anger and he gets to show that off in this film too.  Then there are the moments of pure Elvis spoken and not some of which may be adlibbed and some of which you'll see in documentary footage of the man unscripted.  Weirdos man.  Weirdos is just one.Elvis plays a doctor from Shelby County Tennessee i.e. Memphis relocated to the bad neighborhoods of New York as the head of a free clinic.  Some scoff at the premise but hey why not?  It's possible.  He's got the bedside manner for sure and is very effective in the 'rage reduction' scene in which he and Mary Tyler Moore's character successfully returned a young girl from autism.  A group of psychiatrists checked this film out before release so the details are supposedly pretty accurate.Did I mention that Elvis looked cool?  Well he couldn't really help it because he really WAS cool.  He wears 'normal' clothes for one of the very few times in his movie career and it's actually kind of surreal to witness. It's a 'natural' Elvis though I'm not sure how natural that was for him.Mary Tyler Moore as Sister Michelle is definitely a departure from the usual leading lady in an Elvis movie and the chemistry between the two is not totally convincing though we probably all know of some pretty offbeat pairings in real life.   When she revealed her nunness to Elvis nice reaction from Elvis by the way and said that she was with the Little Sisters of Mercy I half expected Elvis to rip into his 1961 classic Little Sister.Ed Asner has a small role as a policeman and does a great job with it particularly during the showdown with Sister Barbara Jane Elliot who later starred in several soapopera series at the Ajax Market.  A year later he'd reunite with Mary Tyler Moore for her longrunning TV show.  Barbara McNair is also good as a black nun who's basically back in the kind of setting from which she once escaped and has a couple of wannabePanthers remind her of what they see as her obligation to her race.  Keep an eye out for Darlene Love with her group the Blossoms in the Rubberneckin' and Let Us Pray scenes  she played Danny Glover's wife in the Lethal Weapon movies but in 1968 the Blossoms were backup vocalists on Elvis' 'comeback' TV special she was also reportedly romantically involved with Elvis.This isn't a songdense movie.  The title track played over the opening is one that's not been widely released and it's a pity that more people haven't heard it because it includes great lyrics and is a catchy and strong tune. The next song is Rubberneckin' a partlyundubbed version of the master take recorded earlier in Memphis not for this film  I haven't yet read of how Universal managed to negotiate its inclusion and here we see snippets of Elvis playing this great song.  Later in the movie Elvis does a simple children's song called Have A Happy and he closes the film with a rather nice popgospel song Let Us Pray.  Elvis also taunts us with a version of Lawdy Miss Clawdy one of the coolest songs that he ever did but all he does is show off his piano playing and hum it a bit he also whistles it earlier in the film.  Darn.The ending with Sister Michelle waffling between choosing Jesus or Elvis complete with cuts between Elvis' face and that of the crucified Messiah is just a tad awkward and we're left with the question unresolved.  Make up your own ending I guess.  Then again Elvis' character is named John Carpenter.  JC.  And we all know what Jesus was supposed to have done for a living before he began preaching.  Carpenter right?".

	onyx:emotionText "Minispoilers within...This is an Elvis movie that I always thought was undeservedly overlooked and a cut above most of his others.  On present viewing I can see that it's a little bit soapier than I remember  some of the incidental music doesn't help there  but it's still a rewarding film to watch.  Besides it's Elvis dude and he's cool and complete with the sideburns that he'd abandoned between 1958 and 1968.  Shot in the spring of 1969 Change Of Habit was Elvis' last scripted film.  It's a definite change.  His roles had been quite different than the typical 1960s 'travelogues' since 1968's Stay Away Joe a film with potential that missed the mark for the most part and this one includes such atypical fare as an attempted rape a man punching a woman mild bad language and racist epithets brutal violence and talk of drugs.  It's the most sociallyconscious Elvis film since 1960's excellent Flaming Star.Elvis' acting is good throughout for the most part though sometimes I get the feeling that he's relieved to be almost free of the movie contracts. Still he proves once again that he had what it took to be a very good actor.  Less than a month before work began on this film Elvis completed a set of legendary recording sessions in Memphis that eventually resulted in a host of gold records Suspicious Minds that tore up the charts and even topped them and a bunch of other songs that remain lesserknown but among the best that Elvis ever recorded.  The sessions presented him with a new challenge and he more than rose to it.  On July 31 he rose to the next challenge when he opened in Las Vegas beginning his first real live performances since three 1961 charity concerts and eventually leading to him resuming touring.  This film project paled by comparison.  Still the result's worthwhile.  Some of Elvis' dialogue isn't all that convincing but he was always good at saying a lot with a look and he does so in this movie many times.  He also was always thoroughly capable of being convincing in moments of anger and he gets to show that off in this film too.  Then there are the moments of pure Elvis spoken and not some of which may be adlibbed and some of which you'll see in documentary footage of the man unscripted.  Weirdos man.  Weirdos is just one.Elvis plays a doctor from Shelby County Tennessee i.e. Memphis relocated to the bad neighborhoods of New York as the head of a free clinic.  Some scoff at the premise but hey why not?  It's possible.  He's got the bedside manner for sure and is very effective in the 'rage reduction' scene in which he and Mary Tyler Moore's character successfully returned a young girl from autism.  A group of psychiatrists checked this film out before release so the details are supposedly pretty accurate.Did I mention that Elvis looked cool?  Well he couldn't really help it because he really WAS cool.  He wears 'normal' clothes for one of the very few times in his movie career and it's actually kind of surreal to witness.

	schema:reviewBody "If I thought about it long enough I could probably come up with a more surreal casting decision for a movie but since I just watched Change of Habit my mind has gone a bit blank. I would never have considered Elvis Presley and Mary Tyler Moore opposite each other in a conflicted romance but that's what you get here when Moore puts on or should I say takes off her nun's habit and goes to work with Barbara McNair and Jane Elliott at Dr. John Carpenter's ghetto clinic. The trio are secret agents from the Little Sisters of Mercy a term used in the picture which I didn't make up but wish I had.But you know after what I thought was a false start with Presley's rendition of 'Rubberneckin' the picture settled in with a surprising portrayal of social issues that was just beginning to see treatment in film back in the Sixties. The topic of racism was broached with Sister Irene's McNair description by one of the elderly neighborhood busybodies as 'black as the ace of spades'. Over the course of the picture the good sister decides to break out of her 'safe' role as a nun to become a community agitator on behalf of the barrio folks taking on the Ajax Market and the usurious Banker Robert Emhardt. She wins tenuous approval from the self styled Black Panther types who earlier challenged her 'blackness' before they knew she was a nun.On the flip side however I had to wince at the suggestion of Dr. Carpenter's 'rage reduction' therapy as a way to cure autism. Even though the session with Presley and Moore attempting to instill love in the little girl Amanda was touching the miraculous 'cure' was something quite out of the Old Testament and did little service to the decades long search for treatment of this serious affliction.For old timers like myself the picture is a fairly fascinating period piece taking me back to the time of my teenage youth in the Sixties. Thirty cents for three ice cream cones in the park was a major shock to my system while viewing it today along with eighty nine cents a pound for beef stew and boneless chuck at the Ajax. Rheingold and Piels Beer were on prominent neon display in the local bar can you still get those today? And shades of Woodstock did you catch the priest at the chancery office exchanging peace signs with Sister Barbara? Perhaps the biggest kick I got out of watching the picture was fast forwarding a year ahead to 1970 with a couple of precursors to the popular 'Mary Tyler Moore Show'. Didn't they use Miss Moore's pass from the touch football game in the park at the start of that show? And how about Ed Asner showing up as the neighborhood police lieutenant to make peace at the street festival? All pretty cool but there WAS one reference that wound up leaving me to scratch my head  has anyone else ever heard of noodle ring?".

The Catholic Action Committee considers his work valuable so they send him some nurses to help out  but they don't tell him that his nurses are nuns! Apparently these sisters feel they can really reach' the people better if nobody knows their status including their employer. This of course leads to all kinds of comedic opportunities romantic entanglements and melodramatic soulsearching as our ladies confront the real world they have forsaken.Although this is certainly an Elvis movie  complete with needless song  dance routines and women fawning helplessly at The King's feet  the main character is the lead nun played by Mary Tyler Moore. Naturally she is the woman Elvis falls for and poor Mary must fend off his advances as she wrestles with her own feelings for the good doctor. The other two nuns get a fair amount of screen time one is black and must face criticism of being an oreo' from local Black Panther types who are at least sympathetically portrayed the other finds herself drawn toward social activism and is given many Hail Marys for finding Elvis attractive.One thing I'm really not clear about is the relationship between this movie and the Mary Tyler Moore Show.' Ed Asner Mary's future boss appears as a leftleaning nice' policeman. One of my video guides mentions the show as being a spinoff of this film but I don't recall Mary being an undercover nun! Maybe it's been too many yearsOne very disturbing aspect of the film is a scene that celebrates Rage Reduction Therapy' also known as Holding Therapy' a controversial treatment for Autistic children. It is based upon the idea that Autism is a form of acting out' for children who for whatever reason carry a lot of anger inside of them and cannot feel normal love. The treatment is for someone in some cases a parent in others the doctor to hold the child and assure her that she is loved while she rages yells kicks cries etc. Somehow after the trauma ends the child is supposed to open up and want to communicate in a normal manner. The whole thing is just as disturbing to watch as it is to imagine but somehow it works  for Elvis anyway. Somehow I suspect that if it had been this successful in the 70's we wouldn't be facing the current epidemic of autism. Ultimately I would recommend this film to Elvis completists Mary Tyler Moore fans and lovers of late 60's cheese only. It is fun in a way and safe for the kiddies although some of the social issues dealt with may be a bit mature for the very small but certainly no Girl Happy.'".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched CHANGE OF HABIT for the first time on January 8th to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Elvis Presley's birth. It's quite a change of pace for the star an attempt to mix social commentary with an Elvis musical. It doesn't quite work largely because the script and the direction products of the old Hollywood studio mindset clash with the young performers and the ideas in the story that were clearly in sync with the tenor of the times. Had they gotten a younger more innovative director it might have worked. But that can be said about so many of Elvis's movies.The basic premise is sound. The three nuns in the film played by Mary Tyler Moore Jane Elliot and Barbara McNair have clearly defined professional skills and a strong commitment to using them to help the disadvantaged. The women are unquestionably sincere and quite admirable and courageous. Their characters provide the emotional core for the story of a free clinic operating in a multiethnic ghetto neighborhood. From a production standpoint the casting direction and some of the background work offer an authenticity quite rare in a studio product of the time. Despite being shot largely on the Universal Studio backlot the New York street set the street life portrayed has a rhythm and level of noise and aggression that wasn't often convincingly captured in studio productions. There are a large number of black and Latino performers in the cast and not a single one of them looks like they stepped out of Central Casting. A cute Puerto Rican actress Laura Figueroa plays a 17yearold street girl who has the hots for Elvis. One of the black militants who confronts Barbara McNair's Sister Irene is played by JiTu Cumbuka who went on to quite a number of important roles in blackthemed films and TV shows e.g. UP TIGHT TOP OF THE HEAP Roots. There's even a street fair with a Latin band that resembles events I used to attend in the South Bronx back in the day.The one significant false note in the casting is the inclusion of two stock old white lady characters played by Doro Merande and Ruth McDevitt who stick their heads out of the windows regularly to cluck their disapproval as if they'd been held over from the Frank Capra road company. Hollywood veteran Regis Toomey who was actually in a Capra movie MEET JOHN DOE is on hand as a grumpy old parish priest who antagonizes the nuns but to its credit the film refuses to soften the character or make him one of those stock Irish priests with a kind word and a useful homily for every situation. Instead he's presented as a man fearful of his parishioners and clearly out of step with the times. In another interesting casting touch Ed Asner turns up as an enlightened beat cop who speaks Spanish to the street's residents. Cult favorite Timothy Carey THE KILLING plays a surly butcher who regularly cheats the customers.There are some alarming elements on display though. In one scene the doctor played by Elvis takes a young autistic girl of about five or six into his arms and manhandles her in a bout of tough love urging her to get her anger out. To a modern viewer it looks an awful lot like child abuse. As another comment here points out this was an attempt to dramatize a nowdiscredited treatment method called rage reduction therapy. At one point Elvis tries to dissuade the nuns from working in his clinic with a jawdropping line that has to be heard to be disbelieved The last three nurses who worked here couldn't take it. Two of them were raped one even against her will. Later an attempted rape of one of the nuns at knifepoint by a disturbed patient is brushed off quite casually. Maybe they assumed it wasn't against her will. Also this has to be the only Elvis film where you hear the words faggot bitch and nigger. And it was rated G to boot!While Mary Tyler Moore does an excellent job as Sister Michelle who is torn between her love for Jesus and her love for Elvis I can't be so generous in assessing Elvis' performance. He's quite charismatic despite the inappropriate hairstyle and wardrobe but he holds back in every scene. With a better script and direction the role of an embittered Vietnam veteran who carries out his moral obligation to a dead soldier by becoming a doctor to help the poor could have been a breakout performance for the singing star. Instead Elvis comes in reads his lines with a minimum of involvement and refuses to express the emotions that the character must surely be feeling. What happened? Why didn't he step up to the plate and knock this one out of the park? He had it in him. Instead this was his last acting job. All I see now is sad wasted potential. It hurts.".

At one point Elvis tries to dissuade the nuns from working in his clinic with a jawdropping line that has to be heard to be disbelieved The last three nurses who worked here couldn't take it. Two of them were raped one even against her will. Later an attempted rape of one of the nuns at knifepoint by a disturbed patient is brushed off quite casually. Maybe they assumed it wasn't against her will. Also this has to be the only Elvis film where you hear the words faggot bitch and nigger. And it was rated G to boot!While Mary Tyler Moore does an excellent job as Sister Michelle who is torn between her love for Jesus and her love for Elvis I can't be so generous in assessing Elvis' performance. He's quite charismatic despite the inappropriate hairstyle and wardrobe but he holds back in every scene. With a better script and direction the role of an embittered Vietnam veteran who carries out his moral obligation to a dead soldier by becoming a doctor to help the poor could have been a breakout performance for the singing star. Instead Elvis comes in reads his lines with a minimum of involvement and refuses to express the emotions that the character must surely be feeling. What happened? Why didn't he step up to the plate and knock this one out of the park? He had it in him. Instead this was his last acting job. All I see now is sad wasted potential. It hurts.";

I first saw it as a teenager and was captivated by its gorgeous color and beautiful cinematography.According to Jasper Sharp of Japan Cult Cinema Still today the film looks as stunning as ever with its opening battle scenes partially shrouded behind billowing veils and banners and the majestic flight of the troops from the burning imperial palace providing some of the most remarkable images as well such memorable set pieces as a horse race and Moritoh's tense night time confrontation with Wataru and Kesa at the film's climax.Appearing around the same time Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon 1950 Kimisaburo Yoshimura's The Tale of Genji Genji Monogatari 1952 and Kenji Mizoguchi's Ugetsu Ugetsu Monogatari 1953 Kinugasa's film is part of what is often termed The Golden Age of Japanese Cinema.Adapted from a play by the twentieth century writer Kan Kikuchi based on a story from the Heian period 7941185  the same era in which Rashomon and The Tale of Genji are set  Kinugasa's film opens in the midst of the spectacular battle of the Heiji War.A revolt against the Emperor has been put down and Moritoh Kasuo Hasegawa a brave warrior is granted any wish he desires. Moritoh asks for the hand of Kesa Machiko Kyo but this request proves impossible to grant since Lady Kesa is already married to Wataru Isao Yamagata. Moritoh refuses to take no for an answer and becomes obsessed with obtaining Kesa as his wife even if it means threatening the life of her husband to achieve his ends.This film held my interest but I found the plot predictable and the acting exaggerated Moritoh looks more ridiculous than frightening. According to Sharp Kinugasa himself was fully aware of his picture's dramatic weaknesses and blamed intervention from his producer an underdeveloped script and a rushed working schedule due to a release date fixed in advance.Perhaps this could have been a truly great film but to me it is simply a very good film that falls short.".

What an accomplishment! It had the ingredients of a truly great film  complex characters that are developed fully and efficiently great storytelling with attention to details and good acting  a little stylized but keep in mind that that impression might be due partially to Westerners unfamiliarity with Japanese culture and partially to how the definition of good acting has evolved.I love the film's nobility and moral rectitude. Those were the days when and we were in a culture where doing the right thing was the expected norm. It was seen in Moritoh's loyalty at the price of  at least it seems at the time  expediency which was preceded by Kesa's unflinching sense of duty and willingness to lay down her own life. This is the beauty of Kesa's soul that Moritoh found out alltoolate he failed to see which manifested itself as bookends in the plot but is in fact the moral center of the movie. Such ideals are no longer frequently or fully embraced these days. Look at how we glorify criminals in shows like The Sopranos and Thief. I also liked how the plot falls together Kesa's readiness to sacrifice herself at the outset of the story made her selfimmolation at the end of the film ring true. The little details remember the talk of chestnuts when Moritoh first saw Kesa with her aunt? We saw later on those very chestnuts hanging on the swaying trees during Moritoh's unfortunate night time visit. When Wataru and Kesa took what turned out to be their last walk in the garden under a full moon it was all peace and serenity. The very same setting is transformed sinister and ominous just moments later with the moon now hidden by clouds as Moritoh slowly emerges out of the darkness in the background  a truly masterful and memorable scene in the history of cinema.The theme of folly pervades the movie we see a lot of it just from one character Lord Kiyamori  and he's a top dog and a leader! His son had to advise him to act quickly to quash the uprising when we first see him. He then failed to reward Kesa who is every bit as deserving as Moritoh of recognition. Even if you chalk that failure up to be culturally driven we have his Jephthahlike stupidity and arrogance in giving Moritoh pretty much carteblanche in his wish for a reward. What's more we have his incessant and insensitive teasing  instrumental in precipitating the tragedy in that it made the proud Moritoh all the more determined to have Kesa. Was Wataru cowardly foolish or both when he threw the race? Lest you missed it there's the cruel irony of Moritoh's comment after his brother's treachery resulted in his execution My brother was a foolish man. Well you proved to be no Solomon Moritoh.I thought it was a little frustrating to watch Kesa's helplessness when Moritoh blackmailed her. Surely there's another way out woman! But I suppose that's part of the tragic theme all the characters had strengths as well as tragic flaws. At the risk of secondguessing the director of a great movie I felt that he could have kept the identity of the person in bed a secret until the moment of truth but I'm sure I need to remind myself that this is not meant to be a thriller. I'd like to watch this movie again maybe along with a movie it reminds me of Kurosawa's Ran.".

It is outstanding in its color presentation of the country of Japan and the photography and character studies received great awards and acknowledgment The story involves a married woman Machiko Kyo Lady Kesa who is a very beautiful lady who is desired and lusted after by another man. This man does not care about her being married and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. However there is more to the story and it depicts conditions in Japanese households and their way of living and thinking. Machiko Kyo appeared in The Teahouse of the August Moon'56 and starred with Marlon Brando. This is a worthwhile film to watch and enjoy. A truly great Classic Film.".

It is also the first film I ever saw that depicted medieval Japanese culture in all its glory. The beautifully photographed compound of the shogun is by itself worth the price of admission. There are many interior shots showing beautiful rooms with sliding screens that figure in the plot. Now I would dearly love to see Gate of Hell again but apparently it is not available on DVD. Criterion here is a worthy quest for you!!".

Unfortunately she is already married and the samurai's request cannot be fulfilled. He is steadfast in his desire and tries forcibly to take her from her husband. The elements of many cheap thrillers exist in that scenario. Gate of Hell doesn't do too much to distinguish itself although it's certainly not a thriller. Basically the whole film is an excuse for its admittedly great climactic sequence where the samurai invades the home of the woman and her husband at night. I really like how this sequence ends but there are some questions left unanswered  annoyingly so. The husband even asks them aloud and there really isn't a satisfactory explanation. Other than that sequence most of the rest of the film is kind of tedious. Fortunately the absolutely beautiful cinematography  was this Japan's first film in color?  always manages to be impressive. The costume design actually won an Academy Award a much deserved one if I may say so myself. It also won an honorary Oscar for Best Foreign Film the year before that category was made official. Furthermore it was the first Japanese film to win the Palme D'Or at Cannes. 710.".

Not lurid like a slasher movie but very carefully matched against one another. A crimson banner rises into a crisp blue sky. Damme the Japanese and the Chinese have a taste for things like colors and composition.Morito's bull headedness come across as overdone. It's a weakness in these kinds of films. The bad guy tends to shout and rave loudly. Not always. The sword fights are graceless quick and bloodless. Kurasawa handled them with more style.It may be a little test of endurance to get into it at first. The opening has a narration explaining some of Japanese history that turns out to be of little relevance to the main plot. The story has nothing to do with politics.

It was made in 1953 about events in the 12th century in Japan  but the themes of love and sacrifice hold true for all places and all times even into the present day.It's very tempting to see the main character as a victim of female oppression and repression. However what I got was the incredible will of Kesa the main protagonist in the film. She might speak and walk softly but her heart and soul are made of the strength of iron from inside. The basic plot concerns itself with a general Endo Morito who for his part in suppressing a rebellion against the government is offered anything he chooses by his lord as a reward. What he desires is Kesa a ladyinwaiting to the Empress. However Kesa is already married to Morito's colleague Watanabe Wataru. Watching Kesa and her husband interact it's quite clear that she loves him dearly and he loves and cherishes her as well.However Morito becomes more and more obsessed with possessing Kesa for his own. His and Watanabe's lord puts some pressure to entice Kesa to leave her husband and have him divorce her and accept Morito as her new groom. She resists wishing to remain faithful to her loving husband.Morito ends up at the house of Kesa's aunt and he threatens to kill Kesa's husband and her aunt if she does not yield to his desires. It is at this point where Kesa decides to die for her husband to save his life and honor. She pretends to assent to Morito's demands the plan is for Morito to come at midnight and kill Watanabe in his bed. He leaves and Kesa gives her aunt a keepsake and bids her sadly farewell.Later in the evening there is a truly poignant scene where Kesa exchanges sake with her husband. She plays the koto and Watanabe asks gently why is your song so sad? She says it's nothing. She cannot tell him of her plans but she knows that his life will be saved. Kyo Machiko as Kesa has expressions that are full of unspoken emotion. She quietly arranges to exchange beds with her husband and take his place. And she calmly lays down her life for her husband Morito steals into the house and slashes her with a sword thinking that she is her husband and that Kesa will at last belong to him. He is horrified when he finds out what has actually happened  he has murdered his beloved.".

The eyecatching color of this film is the first thing that pops into my mind when I think of it. Some scenes look so fresh and tidy that they look like they're much more recent than 1953 especially the outdoor scenes. Whether it's the stunning paintinglike portrayal of nature or the flashy clothes of the characters the color work is an eye treat and some shots you could even hang on the wall because they're so beautiful.Some may say that the plot is predictable but I had no problems with it. It's set up as a Greek tragedy and it's obvious that someone is going to die tragically in the end according to some viewers it may be a very loose adaptation of the story of Lucretia but it never gets predictable and some parts manage to be very suspenseful such as the horse race between the two rival samurai or the final confrontation between Morito and Wataru when Morito decides to live a life of sorrow.The movie has only one drawback and that is the scene when Kesa is introduced and we hear this cartoonish angelharp sound effect which lasts only for two seconds but is kinda goofy. Still it's a very minor thing. The main theme is very catchy and epicsounding and while we're talking about music the scenes when Kesa plays the koto are also very welldone.Unfortunately Gate of Hell is not that well known and it's sad that people aren't that familiar with it as they are with the works of say Kurosawa. Kinugasa's masterwork definitely needs more love.".

The color and pattern sense of 12th century clothing and home dcor and the use of light and shadow one was more likely to see in a bw film than in most Technicolor films of the early 1950's.The story is based on a contemporary historical account of the Heiji Rebellion of 1160 and its aftermath intertwining images from a picture scroll depicting the rebellion with the live action of the movie. The plot centers on the lives of three people caught up in what would have been a love triangle if the lady in question had agreed to it. Instead she is the victim of Travis Bickellike stalker who won't take no for an answer. May not be for all tastes not as much chambara sword fighting as some people like in their jidaigeki historical dramas and a little over the top on the melodrama but still worth seeing especially from the technical standpoint of benchmarking a great job of color film restoration.

NonItalians may find interesting the fact that Vittorio De Sica was himself an unrepentant gambler in real life as well to the point that if I'm not mistaken his dead left his family saddled with debts. The film also gives a good idea of what life was like for ordinary Italians under the German occupation between 1943 and 1945. Many had to make difficult choices in a confused situation and they reacted differently. Some took sides and risks on both sides others tried to survive. Some came to accept humiliating compromises in order to save their loved ones from death consider the character of Borghesio the old retired lawyer who mortgages his house in order to gather the money that is needed in order to buy the German officer responsible for choosing the prisoners who are bound to be sent to Germany as forced labourers which often meant death or of Ms Fassio the wife who ends up humiliating herself in a desperate and vain attempt to rescue his husband and is torn between her inner contempt for the Nazis and the urge to do everything possible to save his husband. Some others tried to profit from the situation. Some others made different choices in different moments sometimes cynical parasites sometimes heroes.

Other comments set out the main lines of the plot and note the excellence of de Sica as the notgood but not allbad Grimaldi who is just trying to survive like everyone else. But it evolves in a story of one man trying to live up to the expectations of others who have had it even harder than he has. Planted in the prison to impersonate the heroic General della Rovere Grimaldi slowly begins to act like the leader that Rovere was. In one touching scene while under a terrifying bombardment he cowers in his cell only to stiffen himself to shout out encouragement to the others before collapsing in prayer and mortal dread. In this two or three minute episode we learn more about courage than from a score of action movies and thrillers. And of course Grimaldi learns something about himself too in a way and also something about General della Rovere. Toward the end Grimaldi takes on the role of the now dead general so completely that he writes a letter to the general's wife encouraging her to persevere while he willingly faces execution by the Germans to set an example to other Italians to resist. It is a powerful story of growth selfrealization and redemption in terrible conditions though there is also a hint of Italian patriotism too. The film is hard to get but I managed it a few years ago on VHS so seekers persist! It is worth the effort.".

He is not above loving people and swindling them at the same time. He does this to survive the hard times of Mussolini's Salo' Republic period.  The film is set in Genoa after the Badoglio armistice has been signed with the Allies in the south. Bertone tries to help Italians who have relatives imprisoned by the Nazis. Sometimes he can help other times he cannot but always takes their money.  When his game is finally up he is imprisoned but offered an opportunity by the Germans. He is to impersonate a revered partisan leader already killed by the Nazis in order to furnish them information on another partisan leader in the antifascist underground. It is at this point that Bertone gradually undergoes a transformation choosing patriotism over capitulation. The conman becomes a hero. Other standout performances here are given by Sandra Milo as a prostitute Hannes Messemer as the Nazi commandant and Vittorio Caprioli as an inmate barber.".

	schema:reviewBody "As great as Open City was I think I like this one better because of its element of redemption. Also I must confess I like that Rossellini has largely dispensed with his trademark neorealism in favor of a more conventional narrative style. Instead of being on location in the streets most of his shots here are on sets once even resorting to rather cheesy process shots. Otherwise his sets are so well done that I assumed for example that a cavernous prison block was real rather than constructed. Rossellini has thus created a play without being stagy. And the acting! Of course this is Vittorio De Sica's movie. De Sica was larger than life and Rossellini worked at governing the bombast. In fact De Sica's distinguished stature  silver mane and powerful build  kept me from getting right into his Bardone character as a weasel. But perhaps it was that stature that allowed Bardone to carry out his scams. And it certainly helped the plausibility of someone like Bardone's becoming someone like Il Generale.Neglected in the reviews is the wonderful performance of Hannes Messemer as Colonel Mller. Another reviewer says that Mller had fangs. In fact Rossellini makes an effort to reveal how much Mller loathes the ruthless part of his work first seeking to prevent reprisals then when he is alone expressing frank distaste after being overruled by German command. Even when he is saddled with the clich line We have ways of making you talk he is far from a caricature. Then we are brought back to the reality of Mller's SS uniform by his remorseless treatment of Jews.Concerning the controversy... Italy imposed stringent political correctness on discussion of Italy's conduct in World War II. As the excellent documentary in the Criterion Edition points out Rossellini could not have made Generale della Rovere ten years earlier when criticism of Italians on the home front was a punishable offense. The story Italians told about themselves depended on which way the wind was blowing. After the war everybody was an antifascist. Just like the French as revealed by Marcel Ophl's great documentary The Sorrow and the Pity. A climactic scene in Generale della Rovere occurs when one who sought during the occupation to go along to get along  not Bardone who by now had changed  was brought to book.An interesting note from the Criterion documentary This is a true story based on the reallife Bardone named Bertone who impersonated a Generale della Rovere. The story was first told as a novel by a prisonmate of Bertone's Indro Montanelli who escaped. Though there is torture by the Germans in the movie Montanelli says that the Germans never used torture only the Italians. To me this was a shocker making me wonder if despite the monumental criminality of the Germans in World War II the stock scenes we grow up with of the We have ways of making you talk variety are exaggerations and if so to what degree.Playing the impostor even in the face of death is a familiar story. Dickens' Tale of Two Cities comes to mind. Arthur Miller's Incident at Vichy is a similar tale. In fact I see Kurosawa's Kagemusha as a retelling of Generale della Rovere though Kurosawa strenuously denied it. Perhaps becoming the man you impersonate is simply a universal theme.Anyway this one's a masterpiece. See it!".

A climactic scene in Generale della Rovere occurs when one who sought during the occupation to go along to get along  not Bardone who by now had changed  was brought to book.An interesting note from the Criterion documentary This is a true story based on the reallife Bardone named Bertone who impersonated a Generale della Rovere. The story was first told as a novel by a prisonmate of Bertone's Indro Montanelli who escaped. Though there is torture by the Germans in the movie Montanelli says that the Germans never used torture only the Italians. To me this was a shocker making me wonder if despite the monumental criminality of the Germans in World War II the stock scenes we grow up with of the We have ways of making you talk variety are exaggerations and if so to what degree.Playing the impostor even in the face of death is a familiar story. Dickens' Tale of Two Cities comes to mind. Arthur Miller's Incident at Vichy is a similar tale. In fact I see Kurosawa's Kagemusha as a retelling of Generale della Rovere though Kurosawa strenuously denied it. Perhaps becoming the man you impersonate is simply a universal theme.Anyway this one's a masterpiece. See it!";

It's definitely a film of two halves the first half of the movie to me feeling decidedly Pasolinian. Bertone though undoubtedly a scoundrel does his best to keep people happy is a character that spreads a certain amount of charm in the world. For some people who have never known love or had anyone to look up to he provides a show his charisma is like ambrosia. Having been brought up with Protestant vales it has been a revelation to me in life how people value charm as most precious a Veblen good more prized when it is most demanding how a charming person is valued above all others even when they live in a moral vacuum.The second half of the movie is in structure a more conventional prison movie where Bertone working for the Germans in order to save his skin becomes an impostor pretending to be Generale della Rovere. Whilst pretending to be the general he begins to assume many of the general's characteristics. This part of the film is very patriotic and contains a beautiful fresco of Italian cities on the prison wall. The ideology of this part of the movie is all about recognising the efforts of the largely Communist Partito d'Azione and Socialist partisan resistance bodies who were largely excluded from the postfascist Italian government which was dominated by the Christian Democrats who many felt to have been tainted by association with fascism.Pontecorvo's movie Kap was released contemporaneously and features a similarly caricatured version of the Teutonic gaoler and slightly ebullient view of World War II that would become refined in future decades. That said Il Generale della Rovere is undoubtedly a masterpiece.".

His gambling losses are so bad that he has to swindle friends for money oftentimes he does so with the promise of freeing imprisoned loved ones and sometimes he even succeeds at doing so. One swindle goes wrong and the victim informs the Nazis of what De Sica is doing.

De Sica is no great man but he is also no spy. But initially he does what the Nazis tell him to do. This film should probably be much better than it is but it just lacks the passion of Rossellini's earlier films. Sure they were overly melodramatic but I don't think the way to fix them is flatten out all the emotions of the film. Rossellini did make a nearly perfect film after his strictly neorealistic period in Stromboli and General della Rovere a decade later is a huge step in the wrong direction. There are a few excellent scenes but nowhere near enough. It helps that it ends so well. It certainly hinders the project that the whole swindling part of the film lasts for almost half the film at around an hour. De Sica's character isn't very consistent between the two halves either. Blame that on the script though because De Sica is generally great throughout the entire film. Sandra Milo who would later costar in Fellini's 8 and Juliette of the Spirits has a small role. 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Il Generale Della Rovere was one of Roberto Rossellini's most successful films winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival commercially and there is a simple reason why. It's not that good a film. It's a rather formulaic film slathered with faux patriotic sloganeering whitewashed politics and a rather banal cinematic approach. Rossellini was along with the film's star Vittorio De Sica one of the two big name directors of what was known as Italian NeoRealism. But while 1945's Rome Open City was also a financial success for Rossellini he went almost fifteen years between that success and this one in 1959. De Sica however had more commercial and critical success in the interim.The film's plot is supposedly based on real life events that took place in World War Two after Italy switched sides leaving the Axis and joining the Allies. However there has been dispute among historians over whether the tale is true or not and just how much of the tale if true is apocryphal or the result of hagiography because it was based on a novel by Indro Montanelli. The tale follows the life of a petty conman named Victorio Emanuele Bardone De Sica who uses a bunch of assorted aliases including that of a phony Italian colonel named Grimaldi to run his assorted scams and schemes fleecing attractive women wannabe actresses and prostitutes and desperate families who are willing to pay him for information on the whereabouts of relatives who have been arrested by the Nazis. The black and white film runs for 2 hours and 13 minutes and the first 45 or so minutes follows the escapades of Bardone and watching him gamble and lose fleece his suckers and generally act in unethical ways is the best part of the film. Especially good is watching him interact with a Nazi colonel named Muller Hannes Messemer for both men are essentially the same person phonies who are out to wreak havoc in the world. The one difference is that Muller actually has fangs and is willing to use them whereas Bardone lacks the fangs and the will.This is one of those films that I can marginally recommend viewing if only because it illuminates the better work being done at the same time like Fellini's La Dolce Vita. On its own however Il Generale Della Rovere is vastly overrated and a disappointing film in not only Rossellini's canon but that of Italian cinema despite its financial success. Hollywood was not alone in this regard. Why it was so critically well regarded however is a mystery since its flaws are apparent. Then again never underestimate the power of patriotic screeds especially when the legend looms larger than the man. Damn I didn't know Rossellini loved John Ford.".

The two women could not be more different and she accomplishes the differences with bare flickers of change across her face and almost imperceptible alterations in body language.These qualities inspire me to forgive the overly schematic plot and excessively contrasting portraits of the very good and the very bad.At the end Gion Festival Music A Geisha or whatever title translation one wishes to use is not principally about the cruel exploitation of women. The film has a secret. It is a love story. And I love this movie.";

This highly contributed to his attachment to highlighting women on his films.This is another film where geishas and their lives are involved. The story concerns one geisha and her apprentice who is supposed to have the will to take the training into full practice and seriousness. Everything seemed fine when the training was in process but when it came to conclusion Eiko the apprentice had to debut as a geisha but could not bring herself to accept her chosen client. Likewise Miyoharu Eiko's trainer finds trouble when rejecting a client in love with her. Both rejected clients happened to be wealthy businessmen important to the geisha house where they worked thus finding problems from there on.While the film may not be Mizoguchi's best I can assure it is a wonderful joy to behold its cinematography. The camera positions and movements are just something to appreciate accompanied by a totally honest and credible acting by pretty much every actoractress involved.If you have liked everything you have seen from this wonderful director there is absolutely not any reason why you should not get your hands on this film.My score 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "A GEISHA is Miyagawa's late stage threnody with regard to those he has been steadily paying commiserations through his formidable cannon namely ordinary lives on the lowrung. The English title may misguide audience by implying a young geisha's Bildungsroman in the Post WWII Japan that is quite right but it only constitutes half of the story. In the beginning we are introduced to a 16yearold Eiko Wakao arrives in Kyoto's Gion district and entreats named geisha Miyoharu Kogure to take her in as an apprentice. Eiko is saddled with her own tale of woe his mother a formal geisha and Miyoharu's friend died young her father Sawamoto Shind a businessman on his irretrievable downturn doesn't want anything to do with her. So being a geisha is her only outlet in this callous world and she takes great pride in this lineofwork which is referred as living works of art intangible cultural assets by her trainer and resolves to not let anything cripple her work ethic which means she will do best to please her patrons but will not be foisted into prostitution. She knows nothing about the delicate sex politics of the demimonde so we need another character to tread into the underbelly. Miyoharu who gives us a first impression of materialistic and impassive when she rebuffs a client who cannot afford her service for three months indeed lends herself on a mothersister figure towards the young and imprudent Eiko and through her tactful mediation and altruistic deeds she manages to give Eiko a decent debut merely after oneyear of training and immediately Eiko gets the attention of the district's biggest patron Kusuda Kawazu who is habitually prefers new blood whereas Kanzaki Koshiba Kusuda's young business associate has a different taste in women and takes a liking to Miyoharu. Only if both Eiko and Miyoharu would settle for these unsavory but financesecured arrangements there would be no kerfuffle ensuing. What happens next is inevitable when Eiko violently offends Kusuda's advances and puts their livelihood in jeopardy. Some ruffled feathers must be smoothed and Sawamoto's gnarly advent to solicit money rubs salt into their affliction what alternative do they have? The ending will have its say as profound as it is poignant. What ultimately striking a chord in A GEISHA is Mizoguchi's deeply affectionate manifesto of the strength between two women they are not consanguineous yet their rapport is so transcendentally dignified and soul stirring because sometimes life could be hell but that shouldn't be the end of it no despair needed when we can hold each other's hands and solider on. Scalewise A GEISHA is on the lightweight end in Mizoguchi's yardstick but nonetheless peppered with compositional circumspection and gifted with superlative emotional repercussions predicated on a string of prominent performances Michiyo Kogure is beguilingly versatile which sounds like a lesser statement checking the scenes where she wonderfully lets on courtesy empathy scorn and compassion alternatively when facing off an equally competent Eitar Shind as the grasping repugnant Sawamoto that is some fine acting chops a callow Ayako Wakao is also wellattuned to Eiko's characteristics not a soft touch as she appears and lastly a shoutout to Chieko Naniwa who inhabits herself so naturally as Madame Okimi a woman who can commandeer the whole district on her sayso on top of her everpleasantandearnest camouflage. A GEISHA is after all one of Mizoguchi's best and rightly deserves the garland.".

This is a partial remake of his earlier 'Sisters of Gion' although the commentary in my Masters of Cinema DVD version suggests that the studio made him tone down the original script as they did not want their new star Ayako Wakao to play a 'bad girl' as was originally intended.The film is set in the mid 1950's as the traditional Gion Geisha quarter in Kyoto is under pressure from the massive changes in Japan at the time. Old traditions are dying there is greater pressure for the girls to indulge in what is essentially prostitution. Both customers and young geisha are less interested in the old formalities. A young girl the daughter of a geisha and a failing businessman begs an older geisha to take her on and train her. The girl has a funny mixture of ambition and dignity proud of her status she insists on wearing her full geisha outfit even to a regular bar while refusing to 'do what is necessary' with a rich patron. The older woman is caught between her desire to protect the girl and the economic necessities of the time. The 'sisterhood' of Gion  the older dominant Geisha use their influence and power to put huge pressure on her to call the young girl to heel.There are some indications that Mizoguchi's heart wasn't entirely in this film. It is shot quite conventionally by his standards and lacks his trademark visual skills and experimentation. But it is beautifully acted by the whole cast and the insight into the lives of the geisha at the time appears very convincing and real who can say for sure if it is or not?. It isn't quite as good as his later 'Street of Shame' but its still a fine film and well worth watching.The Masters of Cinema version region 2 version that I saw sell it as a 'double DVD' with the brilliant Sansho the Bailiff. The whole package is superb well worth buying.".

Till it reached the climax the quality of emotions got some depth. Second time i viewed it my impression got better. The first part was classic Priyadrashan movie which i don't like AT ALL. Most of his films don't leave any mark on me and they slip out of my mind. I was surprised that SRK chose him for such a story that depicts a moral and values we are in desperate need in these days. However the shooting and photography is brilliant and eye catching. I am a fan of Irrfan and Shahrukh so i got my fill of both. But the last part of the movie meant much more with adequate understanding. I actually cried a lot especially parts where Sahir recites similar stories of his youth that overlap with shahrukh's himself. I still feel more Irrfan was required more passionate and sorrowful but i guess its a priyadrashan movie anyway. watch it for the scenery watch it for Irrfan and SHahrukh.. Lara dutta does a good job too. for once two hours are not enough for the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Billu Barber 2009 138 min Red Chillies Entertainment An Excerpt Priyadarshan's film produced by Gauri Khan Billu is the story of a smalltown humble barber from a sleepy Indian village who is having a tough time making ends meet with overdue electricity bills and unpaid school tuition when a film star enters his life with an arrival of Sahir Khan mega star to town for a shoot. Interestingly a famous largerthanlife star arrives in town for a shoot sending the village into frenzy as they try to catch the glimpse of the megastar Sahir Khan played by nonother than Shahrukh Khan. Billu's povertystricken life is contrasted beautifully against the mega star until the face off of the two characters when they finally meet. This is a movie about unconditional childhood friendship cutting through age status or fame. At the end childhood love and friendship heals any wound and bonds broken relationships.What really makes the movie is the character Billu himself played by Irrfan Khan surely one of the most talented but underrated actor in Bollywood today. Some of you may remember him from Mira Nair's film Namesake which he gave superb performances as Gogol's father as well as the mean police inspector in Slumdog Millionaire. He is the emotional core of this movie. The film starts with his desperate and innocent attempt to bribe a government officer in order to get a business loan for his barber shop. While listening to his plea you can't help it but feel for him. Apparently it is believed that this role was first offered to Ashkay Kumar. I can't imagine him playing this role. Irrfan brings a certain human dignity and respect not only to the character Billu and his profession but also to the life of poverty convening so much by saying very little. He manages to make his character extremely believable and likable with ease.A surprising and refreshing character is Bindiya Billu's wife played by Lara Dutt. She should be commended for delivering a captivating and believable performance s you would not know she is former Miss Universe. This is a different role for her she usually plays the sophisticated beauty and I might add it is refreshing to see her in this role. The stage presence of both Lara and Irrfan is impressive as husband and wife. She gives the character strength with moments of depth love and respect which I find very inspiring given their poverty level.What makes this movie great its realism and depiction of rural life in India unlike other Bollywood movies with no pretension or smug. The cinematography of this movie is amazing showcasing the lush of rural India. The simplicity of the film portrayal of poverty without overwhelming the audience makes this film a delight to watch. I liked the clever way the director unfolds the story. It invites you in but leaves you to your own considerations as the story progresses. This film lets certain details out when the moments are right but not before the audience is fully involved in the somber life of small town man. You get the feeling that Billu is lying until the heartwarming climax. Billu is deeply touching not only in details of an ordinary man's life but also our shortcomings and our insecurities.This film also states that what seems trivial at any given moment in life could be important later on. Besides all this great acting thoughtfulness genuine sincerity and total emotional honesty are what one can expect from Billu without the loss of a typical grandiose of Bollywood musicals. If you want to see a movie that affirms the meaning of friendship this is your movie. Billu is extraordinary film in an ordinary town.More commentary on Isisbollywood.wordpress.comRHK Isisbollywood".

Priyanka Chopra Kareena Kapoor and Deepika Padukone make special appearances.Even though it stars Shahrukh Khan and has been produced by him and his wife this is not a typical Shahrukh Khan film but Irrfan Khan instead as he has done a very good job in his role and it suits him. Lara Dutta has also done a good job in this film as has King Khan himself. The special appearances by Priyanka Chopra Kareena Kapoor and Deepika Padukone add glamour to the story and its worth while watching and listening to the songs that they perform to  the music and the songs are worth listening to. Being a person who has had some experience in photography the cinematography is worth a mention and must say that this is good and more so where the interior is concerned and also the hills. Regarding certain aspects of movie making there is also some good comedy and comic situations. The choreography direction includes Shahrukh Khan's friend and director of movies such as Mein Hoo Na and Om Shanti Om Farah Khan.This has to be one of the better movies this year and is worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "There was a time on TV when there were serials like Tenali Rama and Malgudi Days which were innocent humorous and in the endthey never forgot to give us a sweet little moral teaching. It was a sweet thing which with time disappeared from our televisions.Cut to 2009 we have the son of television Shah Rukh Khan producing and acting in a film which attempts to bring the long forgotten innocence of the doordarshan era on celluloid.The film begins well and ends well but I feel there is something which makes Billu  a partial disappointment. May be the box office greed of the producer makes the movie nose dive from being fantastic innocent cinema to just a well tried attempt stuffed with unwanted elements.Honestly the film didn't need those many item numbers and the people who think that all the audience wants are skimpily clad bollywood chicks shaking their bodies are wrong. Terrible. But yeahKareena looks wow.Those super hero kinda animations with SRK were not needed either.Surely SRK is planning to make a sci fi film and those sfx and graphics were an attempt to test the water but hey please leave the sci fi projects to the fair skinned film makers.We just don't have that budget .I am not bashing this movie but its just that I am disappointed.I wanted it to be a simple tale with Sahir Khan playing the messiah in the underplayed mannerbut here its like Sahir Khan pretends to hide yet he is flashing a torch.Getting me? The cast is fantastic with Lara looking like a goddess and her acting is great.Irfan who has the title role is magnificent but then he is Irfan Khan and he can never go wrong in my opinion.The supporting cast is in sparkling form.Special mention to the guy who plays the guest house manager.His scene where he acts as a policeman during the shooting is one of the most hilarious scenes ever. Scenes involving Om Puri and that school manager are genuinely funny. Loved the Abhay Kumar taunt on Akshay  The locations are great the songs though unwanted are decent and the direction is like any other Priyadarshan film. Nothing special about it. Editing part is pathetic and the scenes jump from one to the other in a haphazard manner.Very unprofessional stuff indeed.The film is watchable because it is different and reminds me of those good ole days of TV.Its a sincere effort and Shah Rukh deserves a pat because they just don't make them like it anymore and at least the Khan has tried. Shah Rukh Khan playing himself minus the name is good but give me a rerun of Malgudi Days and I will forget about Billu .7 out of 10 SRK has finally moved away from his target NRI NRP NRB audiences and I am sure that this film will do great business in India because its an honest attempt at a time when cinema shows a stupid cook fighting Chinese warriors and a guy is forgetting everything after 15 minutes yet not forgetting to steal Hollywood concepts Good job srk..Just wish the producer in you didn't have box office in mind...but....".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Billu";
	schema:reviewBody "Billu Barber had already courted some controversy because some hairstylists protested that the term Barber was offensive. I don't understand it but this meant the word has been dropped and it's now known simply as Billu still after its titular character. A remake of the Malayalam film Katha Parayumpol Billu is one of those films that work because of its spoton capturing of the ugliness and greed of man.It opens quite matter of factly with Billu played by Irrfan Khan a poor barber in s small village being down to his last rupee seeking help from an official knowing that he has to offer a bribe for a loan. Naturally he gets thrown out because of his frankness and we slowly learn of Billu's immediate challenges  his barber business is down because the state of his shop is rundown there's a trendier salon opened opposite his electricity to his small house got cut because of his inability to pay and the school principal is threatening to throw his kids out of school because the school fees are not forthcoming.And little does he know that his problems will multiply with the coming of a Bollywood film crew for a shoot in their village turning his entire world as he knows topsy turvy just because he is a friend of India's megastar Sahir Khan incidentally like the credits say played by Shah Rukh Khan. This premise puts an interesting dilemma on Billu because while he is a nobody and a wouldbe bankrupt suddenly the village folk start to pay homage to him from neighbours to rivals to the town's rich miser because their degree of separation to Sahir Khan is now 2 provided they think that they had better try and bribe Billu by doing favours and giving charity to him from provision of food to an overhaul of his shop so that they can get an opportunity to meet the megastar up close and personal.To make things worse Billu's motormouth kids and a wife who thought she could now impress the neighbours start to craft stories of their association and as we all know word always get around in a misconstrued manner thus something innocently said becomes blown out of proportion. While sometimes the intent is based on perceived noble terms like accepting the school's bursary in exchange for the star's presence in an anniversary celebration making false promises puts a question mark on integrity and worse the effects are felt by Billu himself for something that he did not boast about or craft.My growing list of character actors I admire had included Irrfan Khan ever since I watched his role in The Namesake and I felt he always had this regal presence even for short roles such as that in The Darjeeling Limited and Slumdog Millionaire. Here he brought out the downtoearthness portrayal of a small village barber trying his best to etch a living and provide for his family and feeling very out of place with all the unwanted attention showered upon him. We feel his dilemma instantly as his worries come from it being a very long time since he and Sahir had met and the unassuming man that he is believes that he shouldn't impose himself on a friend from the past in fear of having his friend think that he's clinging onto the coattails of his fame or worse to want to ask for favours which many in the village expect him to do.Much of the film plays around the dilemma of how people often impose their wishes onto you just because you have the facility to possibly grant their wishes and rebuttals are often unheeded because people only want to hear what they want to hear and worse when assumptions are made. Suddenly you find enemies and casual acquaintances proclaiming themselves to be your new best friends because of the benefit they can gain from such lip service. And nothing could be worse if these impositions turn out to be from family members  the kids want to meet their idol and so does the wife played by Lara Dutta. How can one turn these requests down when one takes on the role as provider? Shah Rukh Khan looked like he had a field day playing a parody of himself the film star who happened to share the exact same filmography as himself at that too. Although in a support role his Sahir comes across as direct and nononsense and having hordes of security and minders around him makes one wonder who Billu a man amongst thousands in a crowd could somehow get him to notice if it's true he is a friend in the first place! But the role here offers the inevitable opportunity for some staple songanddance and the filmmakers don't let up the chance to pair up SRK some of his more memorable costars such as Kareena Kapoor Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone with whom he bursts onto the scene in a futuristic setting for the song Love Mera Hit Hit the start of Sahir's new movie which ironically is based on an alien's search for his long lost brother in a village.Billu turns out to be a superb balance between fun and an examination of a key negative human condition. I was pretty much entertained throughout and thanks to the all round fine performances from the cast Billu is very much enjoyable and puts itself into the shortlist of one of the fine movies of the year thus far.".

	schema:reviewBody "What could have been an excellent satire is brought down by poor writing and Priyadarshan's lousy direction. 'Billu' required some heavy editing. All the sequences with Shahrukh Khan in the first half including those horrible item numbers could have easily been left out as they provide nothing. His appearance in the second half was enough. The socalled comic scenes are typical Priyadarshan which is irritatingly loud and seriously needs toning down. The mob sequences and Billu's attempts to meet Sahir are overdone and repetitive. The ending is melodramatic which is typical of Priyadarshan films. All the songs are poorly executed and with the exception of the last three songs 'Marjane' being the best they are horrible to listen to. Shahrukh Khan plays himself. Nothing new there. Lara Dutta is decent and she looks the part. But it is Irrfan who manages to rise above the poorness of this movie. He is quite exceptional as the down to earth almost out of work barber and is the reason to watch 'Billu'. Asrani and Om Puri are good in their roles. Rasika Joshi is cast against type and she too turns in a decent performance. The rest of the cast including Rajpal Yadav are terrible which is usually the case in Priyadarshan's films. To sum it up the best thing about 'Billu' is Irrfan Khan who makes what would be an otherwise bad film to mediocrity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well... I thought it was another SRK film but surprisingly Shahrukh or 'Sahir' merely has a 15 minute role in this surpriser movie.The story goes simple out of the blue a filmshootingunit arrives in a typical village Budbuda. The lead actor happens to be Sahir Khan an oldschool friend of Billu one of the two barbers of the village owing a deteriorated barber shop with too few customers to support Billu's family. His children are chucked out of school for nonpayment of fees people are on his head for repayment of borrowed money and he has none. So when Sahir arrives and word spreads that he is Billu's close friend everyone chases Billu gifting him new things an entire new BARBER shop!! forgiving his loans using funds to pay his fees on a simple bet that Billu help them make acquaintance with the superstar. On the other hand Billu greatly fears that Sahir may have forgotten him and thus doesn't at least for some time make a single attempt to reach out to Sahir.But as his career flourishes and money begins to flow in Billu realizes that he has no choice but to fulfill the needs of the people. Every attempt he makes to reach out to Sahir fails.The film is not about whether or not Billu makes it find out for yourself. The film focuses greatly on how much of a positive and muchmore negative impact the arrival of Sahir has on Billu.The film has other aspects such as Shahrukh becoming Sahir and using this film as a medium to convey a certain messages about the filming industry and controversies caused to the people.Excellent performances by Irrfan Khan and Lara Dutta. Shahrukh has done simply and satisfying. Nothing great as he is prone to doing in films in which he is the lead actor.My heart was beating badly in the climax  such instances may be felt if you watch the film with your heart and feel for Billu and his wife.The songs are good soothing. Love Mera Hit Hit is a superb rocker. Khuda Aiyer forgive my spelling is a soothing tone and beautiful lyrics.Allinall not really a mustwatch but but something not to be missed. 810.Go SRK!".

Love Mera Hit Hit is a superb rocker. Khuda Aiyer forgive my spelling is a soothing tone and beautiful lyrics.Allinall not really a mustwatch but but something not to be missed. 810.Go SRK!";

I think the movie should have stayed simple and all the flashy songs and dances should have been spared from the movie. They were nothing but distraction from the core story.Billu Irfan Khan and Sahir Khan meeting should have been explored more. It would have been good for Shahrukh if he had played the role of Billu Barber and someone else should have played Sahir's role. Irfan Khan and Lara Dutta stole the show. the movie belongs to them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Billu Barber this year's most expected release from the Red Chillies Banner simply turns out to be an ordinary watch. Directed by Priyadarshan who's known for his Malayalam remakes in Hindi yet again fails to mark the everlasting impression on the audience. Billu Barber definitely looks like a sincere effort to make everyone like the movie. The movie starts off with low pace and just when you feel the movie is catching pacethe curtains are down.Billu Barber's protagonist BilluIrfan Khan is a petty barber from the village called Budbuda who struggles to earn every penny but still somehow manages to make a living supporting his family. He's simple humble and a character that everyone in Budbuda loves. His destiny changes when the filmstar Sahir KhanShahrukh Khan lands in Budbuda for the shooting of his film. Billu is then pestered by his children to go meet himto whom he had once said Sahir Khan was his childhood friend. Things go out of hand when the news of Billu being the childhood friend of Sahir reaches every corner of Budbuda. Billu then refuses to accept the fact that he once knew Sahir assuming that he wouldn't recognize their childhood friendship now. He's then mocked up by villagers for making such a fool of himself. The things leading up to him meeting Sahir Khan is for you to watch for yourself.Billu Barber's heart and soul is Irfan Khan. He's quite stupendous in the very first commercial movie that claims to put him as the main lead. His funny serious and emotional shades are quite perfectly done. He's bang on with his performance as always. The highlight of the movie is the acting of Lara Dutta who plays Billu's wife. This is when you actually come to know how important the script and the character are in making an actor give hisorher best. Lara Dutta is extremely good giving her career best in BB. As alwaysScreenplay and dialogues of Billu Barber are something that's a little carelessly done as compared to the previous release of Red Chillies OSO that scored almost in every department. Shahrukh Khan does his bit of acting convincingly. The actors like Rajpal Yadav and Om Puri are let down with ordinary dialogues who still try creating humor that goes totally unnoticed. The movie lacks the energy that a typical Shahrukh Khan movie usually tends to generate. The special appearances by Deepika Kareena and Priyanka is good but lets you forget as continue watching the movie. Though the money is spent lavishly on the sets the film fails to deliver the expectations of the audience. The Music of the movie is not appealing either. Billu Barber scores an mediocre rating in every department.I will go with 6 out of 10 for Priyadarshan's Billu Barber.Not a must watch. But go with no expectations and you might not be disappointed.".

The weather was so cold but watching this made my body even warmer The movie is so excellent and don't say because it is a Shahrukh Khan film it is beautiful because of the nice performances. Priyadarshan also did a great job transforming his mind point into such a great movie You can tell he has visualized the movie before filming it. Billu Barber tells the story of a simple ordinary man Bilas Rao Pardesi living in a small town with his wife Bindiya and two kids. His life undergoes a drastic change as superstar Sahir Khan visits the village for a film shoot. Everything changes. Things go from good to bad to worse to good again. The story takes an interesting turn when Billu's life collides with the superstar's. And the assorted characters right from an aspiring poetlyricist  to a stingy money lender  to the principal of the school Rasika Joshi everyone wants favours from Billu. These characters only make Billu more interesting.The music is the best part of this review. I am in love with You Get Me Rocking and Reeling then I love Mar Jaani and Love Mera Hit Hit. The music is so energetic and all the item numbers sparkle. My personal favorite is Deepika Padukone because she looks so sexy but I love Kareena Kapoor's too because she shines and also Priyanka because she glows with finesse. Ae Aa O is also a great track. The entire album is memoriable.Irfan Khan is so real in his character and we all know Shahrukh did great. In fact it is better than Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. Lara Dutta springs a pleasant surprise. She goes through her part with complete understanding. Om Puri is excellent. Rasika Joshi is too good. Rajpal Yadav is really funny in the penultimate scene when he recites a film song of an shahrukh film. Overall the movie is fabulous energetic great performances and it is recommended highly as a family movie. It will make you smile. Just like me while writing this review. WATCH IT..!".

The part of the guest house manager acting as an inspector is so overdone it becomes more annoying than funny.The only redeeming scene is the last few scenes. The movie has no soul with erratic editing and dialog. Irfan Khan is the one actor who brings some serenity to an otherwise circuslike atmosphere that seems to prevail for the most part. This is typical SRK production with not much substance but hype. Lara Dutta has acquired new acting skills that come handy for a rural housewifelike making roti's bathing under waterfalls and making ransom demands to see an overthehill film actor. The scene where she falls out of the bedday dreaming is plainly funnyMy god I had problems in the daynow at night too!".

As I was watching the film it occurred to me that ol Duke must have enjoyed being a fighter pilot as he should because he played a pilot in at least 6 films I could think of off the top of my head. Janet Leigh was not overly convincing as a Soviet but WOW is she gorgeous... WHO CARES. Still if she had a convincing Russian accent and some leather this would have been the Duke's best effort! Great film of some wonderful machines and such a treat to see them as well. I became a fighter pilot because of the F86 though I was too old to fly one... this film features them constantly. Chuck Yeager stunted for the film and broke a tail in a Sabre pressing the envelope. Overall just a nice film that was totally unlike any Wayne film I had ever seen. Normally you know exactly how the plot will go and that Good Truth and the American Way will prevail... but this one... actually makes you wonder if that is going to be the case?!?! Maybe not for the Duke you know he has a trick up his sleeve but Janet Leigh?? She is a wild card and you never know till the end who will win out. This movie was akin to finding a 20 bill in your pocket from last year... it has been there a long time and just a nice treat to come across it.".

In it he is very natural and convincing quite unlike his typically more stylized and sometimes wooden approach to roles. And his interesting interpretation of an Air Force colonel tempted by a seductive Russian spy is a real departure from his usual gungho offering. When US authorities are going to deport the defecting Russian pilot for espionage he risks losing his military career by marrying her and when it appears that she will get a long prison sentence he not only helps her escape to the USSR but by all appearances must defect himself. Say what? John Wayne selling out his country for the love of a woman? Needless to say this is not his usual on screen behavior. The result is a compelling story and a very romantic movie with Wayne and Janet Leigh rocketing through the skies in their twin jets or discussing sex and politics. These two make a very convincing young couple and the sexual chemistry and tension run high. Not only is Wayne at the top of his game but Janet Leigh is particularly appealing as the shapely Russian pilot. I particularly enjoyed the scene in which he must search her. It is sad that Janet Leigh is remembered only for the shower scene in Psycho. She ought to be remembered instead for the strip search in Jet Pilot.".

This was Joseph Von Sternberg's last film and he didn't like it either. This was made in 1950 but wasn't released until 1957. It stars off with a landing on an air force base and the pilot turns out to be Janet Leigh. The air force just want to get information out of here and give John Wayne the job. Wayne falls in love with her pretty quickly but you don't know about Janet Leigh. The air force find out she's a spy and are going to deport her but John Wayne marries her first. The air force doesn't like it but decides to send John Wayne over to Russia to get information out of them. John Wayne is good as usual and Janet Leigh is very sexy in this movie just watch the first scene in John Wayne's office you'll see what i mean.".

The plot seems as though it was made up as they went along on a few occasions I thought a reel must be missing and I don't think I'm giving anything away like there was any suspense anyway by saying John Wayne must really love Janet Leigh to stay with her after she pistol whips him. Twice. It's unintentionally hilarious but unbelievably bad. I always like Hans Conreid but he doesn't show up until the very end. All of the other actors in the film have a wooden presentation as though they brought in actual air force officers to appear in the film.

	schema:reviewBody "I waited a long time to see this movie now I have and I must say I found it better than I had reason to expect. It is a fast moving comedy with many really funny scenes. Could it be this was the first movie that made fun of the Cold War? Could it be it was shelved for years for that reason maybe the war in Corea made it inopportune to laugh about such matters? Josef von Sternberg steeped in German Expressionism would be the last director you'd expect to helm a movie that at first sight seems to be an older version of Top Gun. But things are set straight very soon as it becomes evident that this is supposed to be a comedy in the vein of something by Ernst Lubitsch or Billy Wilder. Ninotchka comes to mind and in a way  a hilarious way  Janet Leigh as the intentionally? grounded Russian jet pilot is in the footsteps of Greta Garbo here. So John Wayne as American jet pilot is a reticent rather shy Melvyn Douglas. In his part you'd rather expect Cary Grant and Wayne does seem to be slightly embarrassed throughout the movie.Vivacious Janet Leigh's physical assets are highlighted as much as possible and with great success. There is a nice striptease scene in which she gets out of her cute white overalls and each time she starts peeling off a new layer of clothing  woooosh  a jet plane is heard diving down. It's really a hoot. Soon she reappears in the American's war room in a neatly pressed Red Army uniform full of medals and fruit salad she must have stashed it somewhere in that jet plane of hers. Soon she and Wayne are off to Palm Springs so that she can see what the Commies are missing. Wayne in turn gets a whiff of Socialist reality later on as he accompanies the Russien pilot he sort of married back home. It's grim and Stalaglike of course.There is a lot of aerial footage in Jet Pilot and it is high quality material that still fascinates. A lot of elegant acrobatics is performed and filmed from different angles. But even the jets are well embedded in the comedy this movie ultimately is. One of the scene I liked best Janet Leigh escapes. She runs to a jet with its  er  engine already running pushes away the ladder and dashes of as if it were a little sports car or some getaway after a heist in a gangster movie. It's unparalleled and one of many laughs Jet Pilot offers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Soso film was held up for 7 years  before being finally released  being spoiled by an absurd story  though saved only by the impressive flying scenes . It deals with Air Force Col. Jim Shannon John Wayne is tasked to escort a defecting Soviet pilot Lt. Anna Marladovna Shannon  Olga Orlief cutepie spy played by attractive Janet Leigh who is scheming to lure Shannon to the USSR . Maj. Gen. Black Jay C. Flippen and Maj. Rexford Paul Fix assign Shannon to survey Anna  but things go wrong . Later on  they marry  but our protagonist suspects she is a spy planted to find out US secrets . Then Shannon pretends defect with her back to Russia to watch what he can find out  but they again flee . This romantic comedy packs thrills  onedimensional heroics  comicstrip dialogue  spygame  ludicrous screenplay and a lot of skyshattering scenes that are flashily breathtaking . Intimate as well as spectacular WWI airplane movie with an agreeable cast  overwhelming aerial scenes  though including a silly romance . It is one of the Greatest Air Spectacle of the Jet Age but it has a ridiculous plot that relies heavily on an ridiculous love story . This is an entertaining as well as showy Dramedy about relationship between two pilots as well as a tough commanding officer determined to improve efficiency  interwoven with nice aerial footage  it was so big it took years to make with an inestimable help from the US Air Force  still taking advantage of Chuck Yeager's 1947 supersonic flight for publicity  offered his services as a stunt pilot . This was apparently one of the first films in which the US Air Force during the Cold War was featured  including spectacular aircrafts  such as  first Bell X1  Glamorous Glennis  Boeing EB50A Superfortress  serial 460007 B36  F94 Starfire F80 Shooting Star  prototype Northrop XP89 Scorpion Lockheed T33As  B36B by a Lockheed F94A Starfire  among others . It appeared in a number of films afterward  notably Bombers B52 1957  A gathering of eagles 1963  Dr. Strangelove How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb 1964 and By Dawn's Early Light . Amiable acting by John Wayne  in real life a staunch anticommunist who shambles through the action with a permanent sympathetic grin  he plays a jet pilot in charge of Alaskian Air Force base who falls in love with a defecting pilot  a gorgeous Janet Leigh . Support cast is frankly excellent  such as Jay C. Flippen  Paul Fix  Richard Rober  Hans Conried and brief appearances by Bill Erwin  James Brown  Mamie Van Doren  Kenneth Tobey and Denver Pyle . Brilliant cinematography in Cinemascope and Technicolor by Winton Hoch  John Ford 's usual cameraman  shot on location  the filming for the Russian air base was done at George Air Force Base a World War II air base with many of its wartime structures still intact giving the base a primitive appearance . Thrilling as well as rousing musical score by Bronislau Kaper . The film was produced by RKO in 1950 which was owned by Howard Hughes although this was shot in the fifties  it took seven more years to be released because Hughes couldn't keep his hands off it . As he intended to show off the latest in aircraft technology in 1950  when this film was shot . By the time it was released to the public in 1957  the aircraft featured were already obsolete . The picture was regularly directed by Josef Von Sternberg . His commercial breakthrough was Underworld 1927 a prototypical Hollywood gangster film . With The Last Command 1928 starring the equally strongwilled Emil Jannings  von Sternberg began a period of almost a decade as one of the most celebrated artists of world cinema . Both his film career and his personal life were transformed in the making of Blue Angel 1930. Chosen by Jannings and producer Erich Pommer to make Germany's first major sound picture Von Sternberg gambled by casting Marlene Dietrich . Josef  subsequently  directed her in various prestigious pictures as Dishonored  The Devil Is a Woman  Blonde Venus  The Scarlet Empress and the greats hit  Shanghai Express  being Jet pilot his last film .".

The improbabilities pile on higher and deeper to the point that being probable is no longer even the point and you just don't care anymore.That said the true star of this movie is the period hardware some of it seldom seen anywhere else. The scene of the night interception of the Convair B36 showed an early model in flight in such detail that if you look closely you can see that the retractable weapons usually seen retracted on this rather rare machine are extended. Also other fighters of the era are portrayed including the Bell X1 that fills in for the Soviet parasite fighter that is actually the rocket plane that Chuck Yeager flew on the world's first supersonic flight. If you are an aviation enthusiast I highly recommend this movie. If you are fan of The Duke or are looking for action adventure or suspense entertainment pass this one by it's not for you.".

To conform to the site's caveat regarding spoilers I've indicated same  but there is little here actually to spoil since suspense and plot revelation are hardly among its components.Janet Leigh is about as believable as a Russian air officer and pilot as say Yakov Smirnoff attempting to play Jed or Jethro in a Beverly Hillbillies remake.Big John hardly a Gielgud or Olivier at his most serious has his tongue so far in his cheek here that he is in danger of severe jaw damage. But this is all accomplished in a surprisingly effective amusing manner as the title figure ace and Leigh's American love interest.The climax of the film pretty well sums things up. In separate jets Leigh and Wayne have landed at a Russian base. John runs from his plane to Janet's hops in and she takes off. All of this is accomplished amidst a hail of bullets from the Russian soldiers on the base. Naturally they don't hit anything.Janet takesoff and they are pursued by a horde of Russian jets they are fleeing to Vienna!. She actually asks Big John what she should do. Honestly again...honestly!!! HE TELLS HER TO TURN RIGHT!!!Well this apparently works because in the next scene they are at dinner presumably in Vienna and Janet is enjoying immensely her steak the size of one Hoss might enjoy on Bonanza.She then says something about how she'd like for the folks in her country remember she's a 1950's Cold Warperiod Russkie to become more interested in these i.e. steaks than guns.Immediately after this sage comment Big John leans toward her and plants a kiss as the film ends.Movies can't be much more fun than this.".

The story? Well that's something else.A Russian pilot Lt. Anna Marladovna Janet Leigh flees her country and lands in the USA seeking refugee status. Col. Jim Shannon John Wayne is assigned to look after her and find out what she is up to. She is allowed to fly American jets along with Shannon who shows her some new flying maneuvers. Naturally they fall in love or so Shannon believes.This is when the story becomes a little stretch of the imagination.

In an effort to find out what she is up to General Black Jay. C. Flippen and FBI agent Rivers Richard Rober arrange for Shannon and Anna to steal a jet and fly off to the USSR. He conveniently destroys the plane on landing and is taken to a bleak looking Russian camp for interrogation by Col.

Wayne was a good twenty years older than the delectable Ms. Leigh and it shows. Its also hard to imagine the young Ms. Leigh in her early 20s at the time as a world wise Russian spy who speaks perfect English who is also an ace pilot.I'm sure that Mr. Hughes relished the flying sequences in this film as they are the best thing in it. Too bad he didn't pay closer attention to the B level script.Wayne's long time friend Paul Fix appears as his second in command Maj. Rexford.Released by Universal after RKO closed up shop in 1956.".

	schema:headline " Very good Cold War spy spoof and comedy romance";
	schema:reviewBody "What a fun film this turned out to be. I don't recall it at all from my high school days in 1957 and now having seen it in my retirement years Jet Pilot is a very entertaining movie. The history of this film from its making in 1950 and delayed release until 1957 is interesting in itself. Thanks to those reviewers who added to that background.The flying sequences with all the aerial antics are excellent. Howard Hughes was known for his interest and work in aviation so his interest in producing this movie is obvious. It would be interesting to know some of the politics or other hidden details behind the film's delayed release of so many years. How much of a concern might there have been in Washington about a film like this during the early months of the Korean War then called conflict? To those whose sons husbands or brothers were in peril on the battlefields of Korea a film with humor about the Cold War could be seen as dispassionate. The world was just five years beyond the end of World War II and it was still fresh in the minds of most. The extent of the atrocities of the Holocaust was still being unveiled. Likewise the horrors and effects of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan to end World War II in 1945. Were there other reasons for holding this film back?Whatever the reason by the time of its release Jet Pilot was clearly the first tongueincheek treatment of the Cold War and Soviet Union that would reach its zenith in 1964 with Dr. Strangelove. More than half a century later the flying scenes in Jet Pilot are exciting and fun to watch. With all of the supersonic developments in aviation and all the space missions in the past half century most of us still don't move at the speed of jet fighters when traveling. So the film isn't outdated to that extent. As for plot and script I think this movie may indeed have been ahead of its time. Anyone with a sense of humor has to appreciate the obvious spoofing in this film. The idea that the U.S. would let a dubious Soviet defector fly any aircraft she wanted and have free reign to go where she wanted around military bases in 1950 is itself so preposterous that even a modernday Scrooge would have to laugh. In its day the humor of that would not have been lost and most audiences by 1957 surely would have been able to enjoy the obvious word play characterizations and humorous jabs throughout the script. John Wayne and Janet Leigh especially added to the humor with their facial expressions and sometimes subtle sometimes obvious comedic nuances. The supporting cast did likewise  check out the laid back almost nonchalant attitudes of the FBI and CIA agents. That some reviewers could not see the intentional spoofing in this film  by director writer actors and all is puzzling. Maybe some have lost all sense of humor. Anyway the film makers gave us sufficient obvious signals  Leigh's miscues on Wayne's baloney bird hatching and other idiomatic references. And then to be sure the audience didn't miss its laugh each one of those was followed with Paul Fix giving Leigh some other concocted explanation for what Wayne had said. Another laugh bigger than the first. In 1962 Agent 007 gave birth to the James Bond movies in Dr. No. Ian Fleming's and later writers' subsequent stories have continued to entertain audiences with their mixture of mystery action romance and humor for half a century. And the humor is usually in the form of spoofery. Anyone who has enjoyed the James Bond franchise of films will enjoy Jet Pilot. It's a milder form of this mixed genre. Who knows it may even have influenced the James Bond producers. Clearly all involved in this film were having fun. So enjoy it yourself.

	onyx:emotionText "What a fun film this turned out to be. I don't recall it at all from my high school days in 1957 and now having seen it in my retirement years Jet Pilot is a very entertaining movie. The history of this film from its making in 1950 and delayed release until 1957 is interesting in itself. Thanks to those reviewers who added to that background.The flying sequences with all the aerial antics are excellent. Howard Hughes was known for his interest and work in aviation so his interest in producing this movie is obvious. It would be interesting to know some of the politics or other hidden details behind the film's delayed release of so many years. How much of a concern might there have been in Washington about a film like this during the early months of the Korean War then called conflict? To those whose sons husbands or brothers were in peril on the battlefields of Korea a film with humor about the Cold War could be seen as dispassionate. The world was just five years beyond the end of World War II and it was still fresh in the minds of most. The extent of the atrocities of the Holocaust was still being unveiled. Likewise the horrors and effects of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan to end World War II in 1945. Were there other reasons for holding this film back?Whatever the reason by the time of its release Jet Pilot was clearly the first tongueincheek treatment of the Cold War and Soviet Union that would reach its zenith in 1964 with Dr. Strangelove. More than half a century later the flying scenes in Jet Pilot are exciting and fun to watch. With all of the supersonic developments in aviation and all the space missions in the past half century most of us still don't move at the speed of jet fighters when traveling. So the film isn't outdated to that extent. As for plot and script I think this movie may indeed have been ahead of its time. Anyone with a sense of humor has to appreciate the obvious spoofing in this film. The idea that the U.S. would let a dubious Soviet defector fly any aircraft she wanted and have free reign to go where she wanted around military bases in 1950 is itself so preposterous that even a modernday Scrooge would have to laugh. In its day the humor of that would not have been lost and most audiences by 1957 surely would have been able to enjoy the obvious word play characterizations and humorous jabs throughout the script. John Wayne and Janet Leigh especially added to the humor with their facial expressions and sometimes subtle sometimes obvious comedic nuances. The supporting cast did likewise  check out the laid back almost nonchalant attitudes of the FBI and CIA agents. That some reviewers could not see the intentional spoofing in this film  by director writer actors and all is puzzling. Maybe some have lost all sense of humor. Anyway the film makers gave us sufficient obvious signals  Leigh's miscues on Wayne's baloney bird hatching and other idiomatic references. And then to be sure the audience didn't miss its laugh each one of those was followed with Paul Fix giving Leigh some other concocted explanation for what Wayne had said. Another laugh bigger than the first. In 1962 Agent 007 gave birth to the James Bond movies in Dr. No. Ian Fleming's and later writers' subsequent stories have continued to entertain audiences with their mixture of mystery action romance and humor for half a century. And the humor is usually in the form of spoofery. Anyone who has enjoyed the James Bond franchise of films will enjoy Jet Pilot. It's a milder form of this mixed genre. Who knows it may even have influenced the James Bond producers. Clearly all involved in this film were having fun. So enjoy it yourself. Just don't take it any more seriously than you would a James Bond movie.";

Maybe this is a film you have to see on a screen rather than on TV but for me the flying WAS the movie. The rest was just an excuse to hang it together and promote an audience.Perhaps I should add that my dad was a pilot and when I was three he took me up and did corkscrews and dives and flew upside down and I loved it I was sworn to secrecy to never tell my mother who had made him quit being a crop duster because I was on the way. No rollercoaster has ever lived up to it and all my flying since then has been conventional. However I found later from my fellow students that few of them drove home in a normal way that night.".

There is nothing here to suggest it was directed by anything other than a studio hack. There must be a story in the fact that this film though completed in 1950 was not released until 1957. I saw this as a child and was of course transfixed by the flying scenes. It was not until a few years ago while reading Chuck Yeager's autobiography that I learned he did some of the flying at the behest of the Air Force. There are also scenes of what looks like the Bell X1 the rocket plane in which he broke the sound barrier. This film shows up on AMC quite often and heaven help me I sometimes can't turn it off as I wonder at the awfulness of it!".

It's a harrowingly accurate portrayal of Schultz who was every bit the hot tempered homicidal maniac Hoffman shows him as. It's very much along the lines of Vic Morrow's performance as Schultz in Portrait of a Mobster but Hoffman is better.

One can't forget that this was the Depression there were no jobs to be had for young Billy of Bathgate Avenue and his gang.

Also look for some really good performances in this excellent cast from Steven Hill as numbers cruncher Otto Berman Tim Jerome as lawyer Dixie Davis and Bruce Willis as the luckless Bo Weinberg.

He is constantly risking Schultz's psychotic wrath by protecting Billy telling him more than Schultz means him to know. In the end he saves Billy's life by getting him out of that steak house when he knows that everyone has turned against them and they are doomed.This film denies the viewer the vicarious thrill of reveling in mob movie violence on several counts. One is that Billy is a horrified onlooker to Schultz's violence. Never an active participant. The second is that Schultz's violence is always selfdefeating. Prohibition is over and the Jewish Schultz has been reduced to whatever scraps Luciano and the Five Families deign to leave him protection rackets and the Harlem numbers rackets. He is on the way down. It sure looks as if Luciano is perfectly happy to toss prosecutor Dewey a bone to make him happy and that bone will be Schultz. In the end Schultz's political protection abandons him notwithstanding the offer of a 17000 bribe multiply times 20. 340000. That's a lot of money.

Around a thousand.. And furthermore the presence of Drew. She's no 'moll'. She is a bored slumming wife and daughter of old money power and privilege. It is the people in her world who really pull the strings who make phone calls who have state troopers as personal bodyguards. Schultz is just a cheap hood not even good enough to meet her friends as Billy is. The ending for Billy is best. He is out of a world where he never belonged. He has a nice nest egg.

	schema:reviewBody "Having only recently enjoyed cinema screenings of the three films in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Godfather' saga 19721990 you can forgive me for entering into this particular gangster picture with inflated expectations. 'Billy Bathgate 1991' directed by Robert Benton certainly shares a few peripheral characteristics with the alltime great gangster epics  Hoffman's Dutch Schultz has the same confused worldweary outlook as Michael Corleone in his later years and Billy's interactions with fellow members of a streetgang recall Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America 1984.' But this film isn't quite epic enough to fit the bill and instead falls among the more stylish and less sprawling entries into the gangster genre works like 'Miller's Crossing 1990' and 'Road to Perdition 2002.' Viewed from this perspective 'Billy Bathgate' is a good film with a universallystrong leading and supporting cast and excellent cinematography by Nstor Almendros in his final film. Benton previously achieved success with the intimate Oscarwinning family drama 'Kramer vs. Kramer 1979' and here he brings the same keen eye for human interaction.Billy Bathgate Loren Dean whose nagginglyfamiliar face I'd previously seen in 'Gattaca 1997' is a streetkid a bright and resourceful youth who idolises the local organisedcrime boss Dutch Schultz Dustin Hoffman. When offered a place in Schultz's ranks Billy quickly becomes acquainted with the thrills and pitfalls of money guns and power. However for the bulk of the film Billy remains a relatively passive onlooker of his boss' downfall observing his ingenuity and brutality largely as one separated from danger by a pane of glass which is indeed how we get our first good look at him. Only after rejecting his naive notions of Schultz as something more than an ordinary man does Billy feel empowered to react against his boss' immoralities breaching his duties to spare the life of Schultz's strongwilled but reckless girlfriend Drew Preston Nicole Kidman. Among the film's supporting roles are many familiar faces including Bruce Willis as a disloyal crime associate Steve Buscemi as a scarfaced lackey Stanley Tucci as a rival crime boss and Mike Starr as an illfated employee.Though the general circumstances and abruptness of his assassination is faithfully reproduced in the film the truelife Dutch Schultz died on October 24 1935 at age 33. Thus Dustin Hoffman was already twenty years older than the man whom he was supposed to be playing and this certainly influenced how Schultz was portrayed as an outdated relic grappling to understand his weakening grip on The Bronx. Loren Dean is very good in the main role and it's disappointing that he hasn't been more prominent in the last decade or so. Also I hadn't realised that Nicole was such a stunning lady in the early 1990s she gave me a vague Gene Tierney vibe and took my breath away every moment she was on screen! As an aside I was amused to notice that the film's Australian VHS cover rated 'Billy Bathgate' M15 for medium violence and coarse language. How the classification board managed to overlook no less than two instances of fullfrontal female nudity is beyond me. This isn't 'The Godfather' but any fan of gangster pictures should certainly look this one up.".

	schema:reviewBody "The photography is impressive. It turns every surface damp and cold every texture abrasive. The woods of Onandaga may be dark and deep but they ain't lovely. The forest floor is layered with longfallen discarded tannic leaf remnants. The rocks around the waterfall are sharp the color of onyx. And if I were Nicole Kidman I wouldn't strip and leap naked into that black pool although I'm happy that she was willing to. The cityscapes are worse. The vast expanse of the brick walls is ugly. The apartment interiors are furnished with stuffed chairs that look stiff and uninviting. And the set designer gives us walls that  well as Oscar Wilde said on his deathbed Either this wallpaper goes or I do. The Palace chop house in Newark where Dutch and his gang are finally eliminated has a brave little neon sign over its window but it still looks like the most dismal saloon in the world. Maybe it's just in the nature of Newark to seem melancholic.Actually the movie is technically pretty well done. We can more or less follow the antics of Dutch Schultz Hoffman as he executes a betrayer Willis and adopts his girlfriend Kidman as well as a young man he takes a heterosexual fancy to Dean. There are intermittent flashbacks to Willis's murder. They're terrifying. Willis is taken out into New York harbor on a boat tied to a chair his feet encased in a tub of drying cement. And all this time we thought that the feetinthecement business was nothing more than a joke.The performances are uniformly good. Hoffman is fine as a gangster who has broken his tether and gone wild despite the warnings of his closest adviser Steven Hill. Schultz puts his philosophy something like this  If I say I'll do somethin' I do it. If I say I won't do somethin' I don't do it. And if anybody gets in my way he knows I'll kill him. Loren Dean is the openmouthed teenager from the slums who wants desperately to join the gang and winds up with a lot of money and his body parts barely intact. He's kind of cleancut looking and does a good turn without any chance for a bravura scene. Nicole Kidman is a kind of perambulating cat house a tough cookie with meltingly good looks. You're Dutch's girl Dean tells her. I'm not his girl she replies. He's my gangster. That nose of hers. There must be an Intelligent Designer after all and he's a geometrician who has had a hand in designing that nose. I'm trying to imagine Kidman playing say a nun  but I can't do it. Stanley Tucci is excellent as Lucky Luciano whom nobody but Arthur Fliegenheimer would want for a compadre.There's a shocking scene in which Dutch interrupts himself in the middle of a sentence  with a bullet. A dead man bleeds all over the hotel carpet and it won't come out. So while they're matteroffactly lugging the body around in a laundry cart they break Dean's nose to provide fresh blood and to provide evidence of an accident for the hotel staff.It's an intense movie with practically no jokes. I don't know that it adds much to cinematic history but it's a professional piece of work and keeps your interest.".

Loren Dean is the openmouthed teenager from the slums who wants desperately to join the gang and winds up with a lot of money and his body parts barely intact. He's kind of cleancut looking and does a good turn without any chance for a bravura scene. Nicole Kidman is a kind of perambulating cat house a tough cookie with meltingly good looks. You're Dutch's girl Dean tells her. I'm not his girl she replies. He's my gangster. That nose of hers. There must be an Intelligent Designer after all and he's a geometrician who has had a hand in designing that nose. I'm trying to imagine Kidman playing say a nun  but I can't do it. Stanley Tucci is excellent as Lucky Luciano whom nobody but Arthur Fliegenheimer would want for a compadre.There's a shocking scene in which Dutch interrupts himself in the middle of a sentence  with a bullet. A dead man bleeds all over the hotel carpet and it won't come out. So while they're matteroffactly lugging the body around in a laundry cart they break Dean's nose to provide fresh blood and to provide evidence of an accident for the hotel staff.It's an intense movie with practically no jokes. I don't know that it adds much to cinematic history but it's a professional piece of work and keeps your interest.";

After admiring Mr. Dean's ability to juggle four balls Mr. Hoffman gives the younger man a job with the mob. Dean begins by sweeping the floor but is quickly promoted to keeping smoking hot girlfriend Nicole Kidman as Drew satisfied under the sheets...One of the problems with Billy Bathgate is that Dean appears as a fully grown man who is being treated and often acts like he's a 14yearold kid. Sometimes he is made to appear shorter and younger but it's really a lost cause. Consequently the scenes with Dean and the other men seem silly. And even on his own topbilled Hoffman's character registers nothing but ugly.Dean is more convincing with Ms. Kidman who has a brief full frontal moment after a swim. A highlight is the Saratoga horseracing sequence with Dean Kidman and Steve Buscemi as Irving. Kidman has a husband Xander Berkeley who likes to unbutton a man's shirt on the couch and another Bruce Willis who gets to try on a pair of Hoffman's cement shoes...

With Kidman bringing all of her damaged sexuality Loren Dean brings the heat of a 12 year old boy. It's partly the character but mostly it's left on Loren's doorstep.

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a Doctorow fan for a long time and have read most of his works. His book Billy Bathgate was given to me for a Christmas present and I read it three times in a few months. I had not seen the film but again I got it for a Christmas present this year. While I enjoyed the film the book was still fresh on my mind and I found while a lot of the story was adhered to the ending in the film was not as satisfactory as the book. It seemed to 'fizzle out' when I was expecting the final ironic twist in the tale. Also because the story is quiet complex I would expect that viewers who had not read the book might find the film a little bewildering. Loren Dean was certainly not up to the titular role  he just didn't seem to be a credible character and looked almost bemused by what was going on around him in reality I mean not as the character. Dustin Hoffman was good as Schultz but did not have enough to do. Steve Hill as Otto one of the important characters in the book was excellent. Enjoyable with reservations. If you haven't you must read the book.".

Here the mob has to work hard. Violence is just right and the nudity scenes are very well done. A nudity scene always improves the movie in question. The action is also very good here there is no place for annoyance. A movie that I like a lot I have in Blu ray and I recommend it.".

Shultz Dustin Hoffman has a gang which has seen the zenith of its power its fighting to hold his place in a world where Irish and Italian politicians and mobsters are on the ascendancy. The movie opens with an initial act of betrayal and the moll Nicole Kidman is thrust upon both the man and the boy. The movie is blessed with strong performances by secondary characters played by Steven Hill Steve Buscemi Stanley Tucci Bruce Willis and a number of other actors whose faces you know but might not be able to name.Amazing because unbelievable. But it is true Billy has to survive since he is telling the story or rather the story is told from his point of view. He is the voyeur the camera the stalker the witness etc and the film is shot through his own eyes. The pleasure is essentially in the acting. This movie is always told through the eyes of Billie  his gangland tutor played by Steven Hill of Law  Order fame just one fine acting job. Some claim Hoffman is so powerful here he overshadows the rest of the cast but I think that's shallowsighted. Dutch Schultz was a overpowering man  only those that were able to subjugate themselves in his presence survived for long. That makes the other portrayals dead accurate  earns those actors  actresses their own deserved praise for this show.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

The pressure of living in a conurbation can't be emphasized enough especially in a town like HK where crossing the street on a busy day can be tantamount to swimming in jello. Such a dire predicament opens up endless opportunities for screenwriters and other cinematic cronies to wit the constant march of situational comedies coming out of Hong Kong featuring hapless individuals crushed under the weight of metropolitan survival.The Shopaholics is one of the latest such entries but by no means a member of the greatest club. It suffers from an annoying nervous tick of a plot device whereby events unfold as per what the doctor ordered and in general sustains itself just barely by falling back on surprisingly likable characters that most of us will find somehow endearing. Cecilia Cheung heads this ensemble in a role much more suited to her capabilities than being relegated to a Zhang Ziyi clone in The Promise. We must never forget the cheery youngster got her start in hit King of Comedy and here she once more pursues a light hearted streak tinged with just the slighted pinch of tragedy.As hideouslynamed Fong Fong Fong Cecilia epitomizes demoniccompulsive shopping syndrome a condition reportedly triggered when her unseen parents abandoned her postbirth at a luxury retail outlet somewhere between the LV and Burberry sections. Twenty some years later Fong Fong lives to shop residing in an apartment where nothing exists save for a bevy of designer products she never uses. As a result of her shopaholic condition Fong Fong can't hold a steady job and must seek professional help. The film never addresses how exactly someone drowning in credit card debt as a consequence of uncontrollable shopping may be able to afford therapy but that's probably besides the point in a project as intellectually forgiving as this one.Dr. Choosy Lee Lau Ching Man in yet another superfluous comedic turn accepts the task only to reveal himself as a fellow sufferer. Not shopping is his woe but rather decidophobia he can't make up his mind no matter how trivial the issue. Together Lee and Fong Fong confront their personal devils with the inevitable romantic thread popping in for a hello as the story progresses. But the modern megalopolis demands sacrifices dearer than a mere pair of miserable denizens so to complete the picture there's Jordan Chan Initial D as an eternally tormented consumer with a seriously devastating case of buyer's remorse. Irrespective of the amount this dude will regret it and painfully so. His own female complement is superb Ella Koon Drink Drank Drunk as secondary monikerdisaster Ding Dong Dong. Secondary to Cecilia and unfortunately so for Ella though consigned to the prettyface role manages to flex her thespian muscles quite nicely considering The Shopaholics's limited scope. Her problem is an acute and severe inferiority complex that has her everinadequate for whatever situation she finds herself in. Of course the lass also likes to shop.Well shopping has always been a peculiar aspect of the Fragrant Harbor and as most will attest a practical pastime in a place dependent upon rampant commercial activity. Within this framework The Shopaholics may be taken for social commentary but as the latter often ends up looking in HK movies here too it's hard making out the trees for all the receipts or spotting the moral content amid thinlydisguised promos for invogue mall APM. Sadly the film includes one of the most irritating sequences seen lately on the big screen where characters rush fruitlessly under the guidance of uberpsychologist Dr. Phoenix Luk singer Paula Tsui acting as a type of mentor for the quartet of unhappy souls. Meant to convey build up towards catharsis the fifteenminute strong bit grates worse than brick cheese while one sits there wondering why they should care as protagonists go through ridiculous slapstick routines ten times too many. But not all is lost as The Shopaholics does present four characters with real problems and authenticsounding difficulties many a member of its target audience will readily relate to. In that if in nothing else it does win a modest victory.Given better story development and less of an homage to traditional Cantonese comedy it does happen to be a contemporary tale mind you The Shopaholics might have been actually enjoyable but lest we irritate our luckily dormant regretful anxiety complex.Rating   12".

Eugene Jerome Matthew Broderick is an antihero who is typically concerned with making wisecracks rebelling against the rigid drill Sergeant Christopher Walken and talking about wanting to become a writer. Similar to the dark pathos of characters in Catch22 Biloxi Blues exposes men in the service who do not want to be there who are incompetent and basically as far from battlefield heroism as you can imagine. Mike Nichols directs and his comedic and dramatic pace is pitched perfectly for the film.The movie has quotable lines throughout. But if you are looking for a typical war movie this is not for you. There are no heros at least in the conventional sense as the story focuses upon the dusty boot camp in Biloxi Mississippi. The story does deal with sharp internal conflicts and the cultural topics addressed emerge strongly against the backdrop of one of the US's most traditional institutions the military. Although it has been over fifteen years since the release of the movie the conflict in the movie feels timely and relevant for today's world. It's the type of tight wellwritten comedy that rarely exists in current cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems strange to say this about a movie that has very few moments of high drama and virtually no moments of great excitement but Biloxi Blues has a strangely compelling quality to it. Once you begin to watch you'll stay with this through to the end. Director Mike Nichols does an excellent job of bringing the viewer into the lives of the disparate group of young men who find themselves suddenly soldiers in 1945 facing the prospect of being sent to the Pacific to fight and quite possibly die for their country. From the very beginning we want to know about these men who they are what makes them tick and most important  what's going to happen to them?There are several fine performances in this movie. Matthew Broderick is excellent he seems to have a knack for military roles as in both this and Glory as Private Eugene Jerome a young idealistic Jewish teenager just out of high school who dreams of being a writer rather than a soldier. Much of the movie is seen through his eyes as we see him come of age in many different ways. There's great humour involved as he loses his virginity with the understanding prostitute Rowena Park Overall. Eugene is simply a likable young man who we enjoy watching grow up. Corey Parker put on a strong performance in a supporting role as Private Albert Epstein who challenges military authority from Day 1. Another scene of brief humour is when Epstein presents a note from his doctor in New York asking that he be excused from having to eat army food. Also offering a strong performance is Christopher Walken as the slightly offbalance Sargeant Toomey who drives his platoon relentlessly.If you're looking for a classic war movie you'll want to avoid this. But if you're interested in a story about genuine people give it a try. I enjoyed this movie very much and would rate it as a 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "A wonderfully entertaining film. Everything seems to be in it's place. The only thing that one could grab at as being off somewhat are some of the Simon jokesfunnies which tend to sound too dated corny or ill fitted. One must take into consideration on that point that this is a film and a story of an earlier time. A period piece and a script from quite a few years ago. Because of some of the tried for laughs it seems that none of the Simon plays as they stand or the adaptations for screen will stand the test of time. A bit of re working on the scriptdialog would help immensely Even with that BIG flaw that sticks out like a sore thumb this film is wonderful. One might refer to or call these imperfections in the dialogNew York City Corn. Being form New York City myself perhaps it's just the way it plays to me but I doubt it. Most of today's viewers would have the same problem with some of the lines.The characters could not be more interesting or endearing. The scenes are right on track as one follows the other in perfect harmony. The acting and casting is superb with standouts being just about all of the main characters. Christopher Walken continues to take command. But it's also the great by play and perfect casting of his buddies of all religious persuasions that are just as marvelous. Terrific performances by Matt Mulhern Corey Parker Park Overall and of course Matthew Broderick are all great. A perfectly cast movie I would say. Everyone was terrific but what stands out so nicely about this work is that we don't want the relationship that Simon creates between our beloved characters to ever end. There is always a Bully right? Matt Mulhern is cast as the lovable honest Bologna sandwich slamming cretin. Yet he is wonderful in the part he plays and becomes my favorite. Then their is the enigmatic always unearthly Christopher Walk en who endears himself to both the audience and to his boys that he makes into pretty good soldiers.The interplay between the different characters is what makes this work so well. There really isn't a single one in the group that we don't end up liking at least to some degree. I really think this is where Simon's genius lies what makes his plays so popular so likable. We like both Oscar and Felix opposite personalities in the Odd Couple right? Well despite mostly minor bickering some major which is predictable among a bunch of guys from mostly different backgrounds and religions in Biloxi Blues the guys end up liking each other. They even end up realizing that St Toomey is a good guy. They understand that he is raking them over the coals in order to save their lives if and when they are shipped over seas during WWII The adventure really doesn't leave much out. Matthew Broderick goes through all or most of the adventures that we would expect. I found myself easily fitting into the group as the same kinds of things happened to me as I was growing into manhood. Somehow they grow together they move threw some of life's more difficult moments as young men. In the end Simon's or should I say Sgt. Toomey's bunch makes it and we love it. I kept thinking that they really didn't have a care in the world. It was of course a time of great anxt and worry as the guys wondered what in the world would ever happen to them. However I couldn't help but go along with Broderick at the end when the war is over when none of the guys is actually sent over seas to fight. He states to the affect that as he looks back narrating in talk over it was the best time of his life that he seemed to bond with every one of those guys.I was surprised to find that there is no Sound Track available of any kind. Yet the choice of songs taken from the era the WWII songs some refer to as a wonderful time for Romantic Tunes are perfectly placed throughout the film. I gave this movie a 10 despite the mentioned imperfections because it simply is one piece of great entertainment and every time I decide to watch it again it brings me home home to the comfort of those great characters that I just love to watch and hear.".

	schema:reviewBody "Biloxi Blues is directed by Mike Nichols and written by Neil Simon. It is based on Simon's semiautobiographical 1985 play of the same name. It stars Matthew Broderick Christopher Walken Penelope Ann Miller Corey Parker and Matt Mulhern. Music is by Georges Delerue and Bill Butler is the cinematographer.The second part of Neil Simon's Eugene Morris Jerome trilogy the plot centres around Eugene's Broderick draft into the United States Army during the last year of World War II. Sent to training camp at Biloxi Mississippi Eugene is thrust in amongst people from all walks of life. Here he will not only learn about life but also have it changed for him.Straight from the off I have to say that this has become one of my favourite films of all time. From the moment I first caught it back on release where I only went to see it because it was written by the guy who wrote The Odd Couple I have been humoured and charmed every year since without fail. On synopsis it seems to be yet another run of the mill coming of age picture or just another tales from the boot camp time filler but with Simon holding the pen and Nichols painting the narrative with careful nostalgic splendour Biloxi Blues is much better than it's often given credit for. A film that is that rare old beast that strikes the right balance between laughter and sentiment. It was hard to believe these guys had mothers and fathers who were worried about them Although this is primarily Eugene's story film is propelled by the bubbling concoction of a group dynamic. At training camp Eugene and the other lads have to face up to a number of challenges not just growing up into men but learning about bigots bullies homosexuals and intellectuals all while under the borderline crazy command of Sergeant Merwin J. Toomey Walken. They may all be different from different backgrounds but one thing binds them together none of them want to be there! In other hands this group would have consisted of annoying stereotypes but Simon and Nichols courtesy of the writing and the garnering of acting performances ensure this isn't the case. The audience isn't short changed with these characterisations because they are stripped down to being survivors by way of humour and naive honour. Thus it never feels false. I wasn't in on that Pearl Harbour thing One of America's most celebrated film critics said Biloxi Blues contains limp dialogue! That's something which I certainly can't begin to comprehend. For the film is an advertisement for witty retorts where often responses are used as a survivalist tool to deheat a flare up or to hide nervousness.

	onyx:emotionText "Biloxi Blues is directed by Mike Nichols and written by Neil Simon. It is based on Simon's semiautobiographical 1985 play of the same name. It stars Matthew Broderick Christopher Walken Penelope Ann Miller Corey Parker and Matt Mulhern. Music is by Georges Delerue and Bill Butler is the cinematographer.The second part of Neil Simon's Eugene Morris Jerome trilogy the plot centres around Eugene's Broderick draft into the United States Army during the last year of World War II. Sent to training camp at Biloxi Mississippi Eugene is thrust in amongst people from all walks of life. Here he will not only learn about life but also have it changed for him.Straight from the off I have to say that this has become one of my favourite films of all time. From the moment I first caught it back on release where I only went to see it because it was written by the guy who wrote The Odd Couple I have been humoured and charmed every year since without fail. On synopsis it seems to be yet another run of the mill coming of age picture or just another tales from the boot camp time filler but with Simon holding the pen and Nichols painting the narrative with careful nostalgic splendour Biloxi Blues is much better than it's often given credit for. A film that is that rare old beast that strikes the right balance between laughter and sentiment. It was hard to believe these guys had mothers and fathers who were worried about them Although this is primarily Eugene's story film is propelled by the bubbling concoction of a group dynamic. At training camp Eugene and the other lads have to face up to a number of challenges not just growing up into men but learning about bigots bullies homosexuals and intellectuals all while under the borderline crazy command of Sergeant Merwin J. Toomey Walken. They may all be different from different backgrounds but one thing binds them together none of them want to be there! In other hands this group would have consisted of annoying stereotypes but Simon and Nichols courtesy of the writing and the garnering of acting performances ensure this isn't the case. The audience isn't short changed with these characterisations because they are stripped down to being survivors by way of humour and naive honour. Thus it never feels false. I wasn't in on that Pearl Harbour thing One of America's most celebrated film critics said Biloxi Blues contains limp dialogue! That's something which I certainly can't begin to comprehend. For the film is an advertisement for witty retorts where often responses are used as a survivalist tool to deheat a flare up or to hide nervousness. In this respect Biloxi Blues pays big on revisits each time another little oneline gem registers where previously it had been missed maybe because we are too focused on the airy sound track first time around? Or most likely because we are too lost in a Eugene or Toomey facial moment.

	schema:reviewBody "The timing for my catching of this flick couldn't have been more appropriate. I caught it with a few of my squadmates on a 72hour pass at the post theater on Ft. Benning in the middle of my 12weeks of basic training and infantry school. It was the summer of 1988 Biloxi had just hit the screens and it was the hottest summer on record in 25years in the already quite sultry city of Columbus Georgia about two hours south of Atlanta. Just imagine an army base theater  that had changed very little from its WW2 days  filled with 200 Army recruits in uniform on pass watching a movie about Army recruits on pass! It was a hilarious deja vu although I suspect that such irony was lost on the majority of the individuals present that night.Anyways my favorite scenes in the movie include the following Matthew Broderick as Pvt. Eugene Jerome moving through the chow line at breakfast for the first time when the army cook slings some unmentionable godforsaken gloop on his stainless steel G.I. mess tray. The look on Eugene's face is worth its weight in gold as it was almost as if he had been insulted and violated at the same time. This is especially funny for anyone who has ever stood in a messhall chowline and eaten army food before.My next favorite scene was when Eugene makes up a game with his bunkmates one night about what they would do with the last 72 hours of their lives. What every man reveals about himself is not only telling but an ominous harbinger of what is to come. Hennesey for example asks to be with his family. The others scoff. Little do they know however that soon enough even that modest hope will seem like a pipedream to the starcrossed Hennesey.The funniest aspects of Neil Simon's mostly autobiographically inspired play though is his comedic depiction of the inevitable culture clash that invariably occurs when the New York quasiintellectualism and Jewish urbane sensibility that Eugene Jerome and Arnold Epstein are products of confronts head on the southern whiteredneck military subculture that Sgt. Toomey represents. This theme especially struck a chord with me having come down to Georgia for boot camp from Chicago that summer. It was quite a culture shock for me upon my first visit to the south. when I stepped off the bus at Ft. Benning as I quickly had to get myself accustomed to the almost incomprehensible southern accents idiosyncratic differences in attitude and weird regional expressions employed by our mostly colorful yet totally profane and predominantly redneck drill sergeants at Ft. Benning.Another aspect about this film that touched me personally is the fact that it was filmed filmed almost entirely at Ft. Chaffee in Ft. Smith Arkansas where I had trained extensively when I was in the U.S. Army. From WW1 to the early 1990s Ft. Chaffee was an active U.S. Army reservation that has since been mothballed. Being able to see scenes of Ft. Chaffee especially the exterior and interior shots of Chaffee's vintage WW2era barracks on my very rare DVD version which I am most fortunate to have always brings back some rather fond  and not so fond memories  of the times I spent at Chaffee. This movie mostly reminds me of all those days and nights I spent training in those chigger and tickridden forests doing PT around post and living in those godforsaken WW2era barracks. Hats off to a great fivestar WW2 comingofage flick!".

It doesn't offer profound insights into military life but it does allow us to laugh at it.The film the second of an autobiographical trilogy by Neil Simon chronicles a group of young men enduring Army basic training during World War II.

Absolutely no surprises here. Many reviewers have criticized this film because it didn't provide anything new. And it doesn't. But I enjoyed this film for what it was an entertaining lark. The performances were credible and breezy. Not every film dealing with the military has to be emotionally searing like The Deer Hunter or Platoon. Sometimes we dine at four star restaurants and sometimes we dine at Denny's. Sometimes we watch a movie in which a marine private shoots his drill sergeant to death and then himself as in Full Metal Jacket and sometimes we watch a movie that has an army private ordering his drill sergeant to do 200 push ups which is the case in Biloxi Blues.I laugh every time I watch Biloxi Blues particularly at the scene in which Jerome while popping his cherry is reminded by a good humored and patient prostitute named Rowena played by Park Overall to keep breathing. Keep in mind I also enjoyed watching The Hangover and The 40 Year Old Virgin. I enjoyed less Jerome meeting the perfect girl played competently by Penelope Ann Miller. I chuckled at Private Jerome during an arduous march hoping for a subway and upon arriving at Biloxi commenting that Biloxi was Africa hot and if it stayed that hot he may not be able to stay. But of course he does stay. If he didn't he would have ended up in Leavenworth along with Private Hennessey who is arrested for a crime that is no longer a crime.I suspect that Neil Simon's actual experience in boot camp in Biloxi Mississippi wasn't a light hearted romp. But then again my military experience consists of exactly one semester of ROTC. Still I think If Neil Simon can laugh at his training in the army so can we.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not the biggest fan of movies about the adventures of obnoxious boys in their late teens which is what the characters in Biloxi Blues happen to be but I actually found that I highly enjoyed this film.The cast doesn't hurt. When Matthew Broderick is the star of a film he makes everything better and he's a natural in the leading role of Eugene Jerome a decent young Jewish boy who has joined the army during World War 2. Christopher Walken is a riot as the stern Sergent Toomey and the supporting cast does a nice job as well particularly Casey Siemaszko as Gene's buddy that he hopes he never has to count on Don Carney.During the boy's stay at a basic training camp in Biloxi Mississippi a number of incidents occur such as Toomey overworking them and being unfair to the seemingly hopeless Gene and his slightly annoyingpal Arnold EpsteinCorey Parker who's performance and character take a bit of getting used to Gene being at odds with the tough guys on the squadthey read his journal and it turns out that he has written bad things about them and a kind of pointless subplot about the guys working on losing their virginityfunny until Gene actually ends up in bed.The film was based on Neil Simon's hit Broadway play of the same title and the adaption has remained faithful as the film manages not to lose any of the charm it carried on the stage. I highly enjoyed my viewing and am proud to have bought the video so I could watch it again and again.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am not the biggest fan of movies about the adventures of obnoxious boys in their late teens which is what the characters in Biloxi Blues happen to be but I actually found that I highly enjoyed this film.The cast doesn't hurt. When Matthew Broderick is the star of a film he makes everything better and he's a natural in the leading role of Eugene Jerome a decent young Jewish boy who has joined the army during World War 2. Christopher Walken is a riot as the stern Sergent Toomey and the supporting cast does a nice job as well particularly Casey Siemaszko as Gene's buddy that he hopes he never has to count on Don Carney.During the boy's stay at a basic training camp in Biloxi Mississippi a number of incidents occur such as Toomey overworking them and being unfair to the seemingly hopeless Gene and his slightly annoyingpal Arnold EpsteinCorey Parker who's performance and character take a bit of getting used to Gene being at odds with the tough guys on the squadthey read his journal and it turns out that he has written bad things about them and a kind of pointless subplot about the guys working on losing their virginityfunny until Gene actually ends up in bed.The film was based on Neil Simon's hit Broadway play of the same title and the adaption has remained faithful as the film manages not to lose any of the charm it carried on the stage. I highly enjoyed my viewing and am proud to have bought the video so I could watch it again and again.";

One of my favorite all time scenes in any movie is the scene where Jerome and Rowena are in the bedroom. I laughed out loud when I first saw it because you can so readily identify with the emotions that Jerome is feeling as he tries to figure out how to sort of lay down with her. That is a perfect example of what I mean when I say the movie really captures the innocence of youth. You will be disappointed however if you think that this is a war movie as it uses the army as more of a backdrop to highlight the coming of age story. I agree how can this movie be rated only a 6.410?".

In Ferris Bueller he was likeable but a little too confident and in Project X he started to become outright cocky and was getting to the annoying aspect of his sarcasm in which most of his films of the 90s and beyond have made his seem like a whiner instead of the almost heroic witty young looking guy we grew up watching. He was witty yet humble in Biloxi Blues and really cared for some of the other characters. We see the other characters the era and the plot development through his eyes and his journals and it is done stupendously. I hope Broderick studies this film to see what he did right.

Corey Parker who plays Arnold Epstein the intellectual Jew to perfection also played Eugene Matthew Broderick's character in a later TV production Broadway BOUND 1992 with Jonathan Silverman who himself played Eugene in BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS 1986.

It's often funny and each character is instantly memorable thanks to the wonderful performances.Mike Nichol's film is about a Jewish teen from Brooklyn named Eugene Jerome who travels to Mississippi to serve in basic training for the army during the latter years of the second World War. Along the way he has encounters with his tough sergeant named Toomey his platoon and his first love in Daisy.This role was designed perfectly for Matthew Broderick. He has many hilarious scenes and has several dramatic ones as well. Christopher Walken was just awesome here. He brings something new to the role of the tough drill sergeant. I was reminded of the bad cop good cop routine but with just one person.Overall Biloxi Blues is a worthwhile adaptation from Neil Simon's play. It's funny poignant and clever. The jokes are wellplaced and some will have you gasping for breaths. But let me say that this is not a war film because you'll be incredibly disappointed. If you're looking for one don't even bother watching this and watch Full Metal Jacket instead. I rate this film 910.".

As such the movie was written along the lines of the original intentions of Neil Simons rather than the interpretation of a third party. Even so I quite enjoyed this movie namely because of its wit and decent characters.Biloxi Blues is about a young man in 1945 who is going to boot camp to train to fight in the war. This is in the closing stages of the war so moral is very high because of the fact that they are on the winning side. The war is only in the background for the focus of the movie is not the war but the relationship between the platoon and the main character's entrance into adulthood. During the movie the main character sleeps with his first woman and also falls in love for the first time. It is his first time out of home and enters the boot camp as a nave boy but he leaves a man.Sergeant Tooley is the most interesting character in the movie. When he first walks onto the screen one immediately notices that he is different. The stereotypical sergeant walks on yelling while Tooley walks on greeting his platoon. He rarely raises his voice and actually uses other cadets to dish out punishments with the intention of turning the other cadets onto him. Thus he uses peer pressure to keep people in line. Yet as with most sergeants the cadets hate him though after he is discharged they realised how great a sergeant he really was.The main character is very witty and of course this angers the sergeant no end. His first comment on Mississippi is that it is hot Africa hot not even Tarzan can stand this hot. Or when he is asked what he would do if Japanese were marching on him he would surrender simply so he could get a decent nights sleep or even his religious holiday simply to get out of eating a horrid meal.I guess what made this movie really lively is that the narrator claims that it was based on his own experiences. Most probably it was though Simons does not use his own name in the movie but rather creates another character that is him.

	schema:reviewBody "Christopher Walken is not a chameleon he always retains his unique style no matter which role he inhabits. His great talent is to be absolutely believable however. He isn't a Bruce Willis or Michael Douglas that is to say an actor who just plays himself. Walken was outstanding in The Dead Zone spoton in his True Romance cameo and is probably one of the top four or five American actors. His performance in Biloxi Blues is in keeping with the rest of his work. Walken is always Walken but he becomes a drill sergeant and not the drill sergeant from every other war movie. Walken's drill sergeant is oneofakind. The rest of the movie is decent enough though besides Corey Parker and Matthew Broderick the acting isn't so great. When Walken appears it is like Joe DiMaggio playing for a minorleague team. This film is worth seeing for Walken's performance alone.".

This movie is completely German every character which appears in it is introduced explained and motivated. No holes in the plot no surprises no bad scenes as well. The acting is great but hey what do you expect if you throw a lot of soul and drama to a selection of Germany's finest actors.If you are not German and never lived in this country don't see this movie it will appear dull and retarded. If you are German you will enjoy it laugh a bit and feel sad in the end. Just fine for a casual Saturday evening out with your girlboyfriend.Summary of the plot the movie is set partly in Spain and partly in Germany. All scenes are essentially dialogues between two of a bunch of characters that are all somehow related to each other. The web of their fates loves flirts dramas is pulled tighter and tighter but unlike your expectations no climax occurs. So you end up with a collection of short stories which is where the script of the movie originated from To read a truly fascinating book based on the same idea try Ingo Schulzes 'Simple Stories'  much better than the movie!. Apparently Ms Doerrie made this film in order to memorate her late partner who died during the first attempt to shoot it. This is why all the dialogues circle around the everhot topic of love death  marriage. She hadn't had the courage and the understanding to do the film with two persons so instead she multiplied the problems and characters as if to demonstrate that in the end we are all alike with our problems and our solutions. Heavy stuff ! And being German Ms Doerrie offers instantly the perfect solution Stop being German and become Spanish! They got songs dances sun and know how to mourn and live...I give this film 5 points because it is so average and stubborn. I wished that once these directors dared and I could love or hate their films. Now they annoy me but decently.P.S. If you are up for a good German movie go see 'Lola rennt' by Tom Tykwer !".

	schema:headline " Not a beautiful film";
	schema:reviewBody "Bin ich schn? is a German Germanlanguage film from 1998 that has Spanish influences too as a great part of the movie is set in Spain. It runs for roughly 110 minutes and is among the most known career efforts by writer and director Doris Drrie who was in her early 40s when she made this one neither early in her career nor recent. German film buffs will find many familiar faces and names in the cast list that were probably even bigger back then than they are today like Potente big breakthrough year for her Whler Berben Ochsenknecht Schrader Dobra Zielcke von Borsody Krl Makatsch Schneeberger Berger Sander John and Petri who won a German Film Award that year for two films this being one of them probably the less decisive looking at her small role. I cannot say that this movie is among Drrie's best in my opinion. It does have some solid moments especially early on with Potente's story line but that had a lot to do with Whler's presence too and I quite like him. But the longer it went the less significant this story also became like the others while finally resulting in the singing scene by Potente's character which is when the film hits rockbottom. So yes this is never a memorable film not even during the dramatically tense moments like the scene when she cuts her wrists trying to commit suicide while with her older lover. It all feels a bit for the sake of it and staged and really rarely authentic. I would blame the material more than the actors. Maybe it was also 23 characters too many as the longer the film went the more I felt it was lacking focus. There is almost always a distinct foreign component to Drrie's films in a bit of a culture clash but here it is not really more than the setting as Spanish people don't really play a role here at all. It's all about the Germans. Looking at the tremendous quantity of wellknown and successful names in the cast here it was definitely a missed opportunity as this film is evidence that script is always king if you want to make a good film. Unknown actors can deliver with a strong script but big names rarely make a weak story work. This episodic drama that will have its 20th anniversary next year gets a thumbsdown from me. Not recommended.".

Once this is taken for granted you see some quite excellent scenes in which you are in the thick of things of the life of some more of less loose connected people. There is humour affection love lust and sadness and most of the players are very convincing. The only character that could be missed in my opinion was Linda played by Franka Potente she is playing exactly the same character as she was in 'Lola rennt' without the running. Just an irritatingly weird girl with no real or convincing acts and emotions except her singing her own flamenco song. If Franka Potente can't play a character unlike Lola I'm sorry to say I've seen enough of her by now.".

There is humour affection love lust and sadness and most of the players are very convincing. The only character that could be missed in my opinion was Linda played by Franka Potente she is playing exactly the same character as she was in 'Lola rennt' without the running. Just an irritatingly weird girl with no real or convincing acts and emotions except her singing her own flamenco song. If Franka Potente can't play a character unlike Lola I'm sorry to say I've seen enough of her by now.";

I didn't so I wasn't.Some comments have been rather scathing but I believe that New Police Story is the best Jackie Chan film to come out since Drunken Master 2 especially as far as action is concerned.The story although not perfect is more than adequate and is something of a departure for Chan. He may not be the world's greatest actor but his performance is more than adequate. Although comedy action is what Jackie does best that formula is getting tired now.Although little of the action was original bus stunt again amongst others it is much better in this film than any of his recent American financed films.Wires have been used by Hong Kong action stars for a very long time now. Jackie Chan used wires in the New Police Story but that is nothing new for Chan now either he is 50ish after all. Anyone who has worked with wires will tell you what hard work it is so it shouldn't be so easily dismissed.Overall reasonably entertaining film that most Jackie Chan fans will enjoy as long as they are not expecting a film as good as Police Story.One reviewer gave this 310 but if New Police Story is worth 310 then the Medallion for me possibly the worst Jackie Chan film should have a negative rating. I highly recommend this one to Jackie Chan fans and those who are not may be pleasantly surprised. I give the New Police Story 710.".

Does it mean that the whole franchise has changed completely? Is Jackie Chan trying to pass on the mantle? How different is it really? Well put it this way. The only thing that has changed is that it's better than the previous instalments.New Police Story tells of Wing Jackie Chan a supercop who has managed to solve the toughest and roughest cases for the Hong Kong police force. So much so that he gains a bit of cockiness. When a group of young guns led by Joe Daniel Wu start a crime spree by robbing banks and gunning down cops for fun Wing declares that he would catch the criminals in just 3 hours. However his plans bite the dust as his team are gunned down following a leak of his plans. Wing is knocked into drink and depression and rookie Fung Nic Tse come to egg him into revenge.This film follows the style of the previous Police Story series in that it is gritty and dramatic as opposed to Jackie's comedic style. However this film is very much darker than the previous ones. The usual stunts are there  including a bus sequence which reminds you of the original Police Story  but each stunt has been brought a new lease of life with some perfectionist choreography. I was impressed by Nic Tse's martial art stunts which certainly were not easy but mastered flawlessly. Daniel Wu caps off a very good year for him with a very good performance as the enemy. Credit goes to Benny Chan also who really has pulled out all the stops for this movie.This is one of Jackie Chan's best films and following some recent dismal Hollywood attempts I'm really glad that he can still pull it off particularly when there is a good script for him.One to see the old master back at his best.".

New Police Story is everything but comical it's a harsh and hardcoretothebone cop thriller with an extreme overload of violent shootouts dazzling stunts and relentless executions. The story is fairly original and adapted to the new type of crimewaves representing the post2000 era with Chan playing the cop who's up against an entirely new breed of villains bored and spoiled rich kids obsessed with video games and committing violence purely for kicks. The youthful gang members inventively rob banks even though they don't need the money have an insatiable appetite for destruction and  oh yeah  they really hate cops. When inspector Chan is a little too confident on TV about catching the thugs they set up an ambush to sadistically slaughter Chan's entire team. The pain and guilt of losing his team drives Chan to drink heavily and neglect his police work but a younger colleague slowly convinces him to solve the case and avenge his dead teammembers. Like most Asian productions New Police Story is rather long for an action film slightly over 2 hours but it's never boring or unnecessarily sentimental not even during the relatively long period when inspector Chan mourns over his departed friends and colleagues. The action sequences and stunts are downright sensational the highlight being an excessively destructive busoutofcontrol scene through the crowded streets of Hong Kong. New Police Story in an almost nonstop and adrenalinrushing series of spectacular stunts but it's also very praiseworthy for Jackie Chan's tourdeforce acting performance. This is his first film in which his acting talent is actually a lot more impressive than his fabulous martial arts skills. Especially the sequences in which his character stumbles through dark alleys at night incredibly drunk and heartbroken are harrowing and very realistic. Grim sadistic violence and real drama are very difficult themes to mix together but this film seemly pulls it off without too much trouble. New Police Story isn't intended for the fainthearted but if you like your heroes invincible your criminals ultraevil and your action rough  explicit this film comes with my highest possible recommendation.".

I wish his son should be in this movie to play one of the bad guy.The baddie here are rich bored people with nothing to do except Daniel Wu the leader of the bandit who rob the major bank for fun. In this movie i actually wanted them to win because those bad guy were so smart has you will see in the beginning. Jackie Chan acted marvelous and i won't be surprise if he getting a nomination for that. By far his best acting in a long time like the part where his girlfriend was strap in bomb and they were talking about their dying romance. Daniel Wu play another marvelous job and his acting is for sure getting better. This guy going to make many great film has time goes. The action in this movie is amazing considering Jackie Chan age and it seem like Nic Tse wanted to be the next JC cuz he done some of the stunt himself. Charlie Young who play JC girlfriend return after 7 years of no acting. She still look pretty exactly too young for JC i might add in this movie her brother was under Jackie Chan team but of course the bandit call themself xgames kill all his team including her brother. Therefore JC feel ashame for that and sour their relationship. Charlene Choi one of the twins is also in this movie but she play a very minor role but still a funny character like at the ending. She suppose to play Nic Tse character. Right from the beginning to the end this film was superb and by far the first film HK film this year i would give it 9 out of ten One nite in Mangkok come close with 8.510. Watching these kind of film make me wonder why he Jet Li and CYF don't come back to HK and make those kind of amazing films.".

In 'New Police Story' he is full of life playing a key role that initiates much of the action. Charlene Choi in a supporting role as an HK police woman also helps keep the action moving without overdoing the perkiness. If Jackie Chan wants to play serious his role as an inspector whose life has gone on the skids he has the sense not to overdo it after an early scene where he is so drunk he throws up in an alley.

The plot didn't fare much better it was too unrealistic and completely stupid at times also it didn't manage to interest me in the slightest. The actors all tended to overact far too much although Jackie was alright. The film wasn't even very entertaining i was finding myself bored at many points since the plot didn't hook me in. The only reason i sat through the film was because it had decent action sequences Espeicially the final one and the beautiful women. In restrospect i really only enjoyed the last 2 minutes of the film. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a great new Jackie Chan film let alone a good action film it will truly disappoint. Although Jackie Chan was decent in this film he didn't do anything new or exciting for my taste his acting wasn't great and his stunts are becoming less dazzling as his body ages still hes much better than i ever will be at that age. Overall i was disappointed with this film. There fore i could only give this film 45 out of 10".

A movie so intense in fact that it's hard to take seriously.I question the wisdom of this career move for Chan. Sure he's got more acting range than most people probably assume and sometimes he wants to show off those skills. That's fine but I think this comes as a too sudden change. A lot of his fans will go into this movie expecting the same old Jackie Chan they know from a myriad action comedies incl. the other Police Story movies. A lot of those people are in for a nasty surprise. Here we have sadistic cop killers who utterly ruin his life make him a drunkard and later nearly kill his girlfriend. The anguish and darkness here is palpable to the extreme!The movie doesn't have a lot of plot holes though as some are claiming. We do eventually get the explanations for the bad guys' motivations and the mysterious PC 1667 is also explained at the end. But there isn't much depth to any of the characters except Chan's a little bit. It's an action thrill ride with lots of wild stunts some less necessary than others the entire bus thing was enormously contrived why did the crook shoot at it in the first place? That scene despite being probably the most memorable action scene in the movie felt like it belonged in a completely different movie and the production values are good. The last part of the movie has some fun moments which is good.But it's all too wild too shocking too far out and it ends up just not being very enjoyable too intense! Too anguished! to say nothing of believable. So while it's certainly a spectacular departure from Chan's timehonored comedy style I can't go so far as to call it an unmitigated success much less a classic.6 out of 10.".

Today I came across it and sadly viewed it just before I wrote this review.Throughout the movie I was waiting for an ending scene where Jackie wakes up and says Woah! What a nightmare! Getting humiliated by snobby teen video game punks who made the biggest fool out of me by making me lose bets with them for the lives of my friendseg. LOADING A GUN! OH THE SUSPENSE! tried to kill my girlfriend killed my girlfriend's brother killed my friends and then I feel sympathy for these loons by the end of my dream...That was worse than the moment in Drunken Master I where I had to crawl through that stinky old man's legs after getting my ass handed to me! The plot was out right over the line unrealistic cheesy and horrible! An impersonator walking into a police building and getting officers to think he is a police officer. Unorganized police missions where you have Captain Jack telling the Channel News24 his plans while the villains listen in. Let alone not having a SWAT team of some sort not knowing the layout of the buildings and using lame hand guns for dynamic entrances. Rich kids having better technology than the police force while being better trained and having better guns. Dramatic scene where Jackie's girlfriend asks him if he loves her while she has a bomb strapped to her neck and then decides it is time to cut the cables with the scissors after Jackie leaves to get help. Jackie crying. You might as well call it all a bad dream as this movie is so surreal and unrealistic that it is near impossible to suspend your disbeliefs throughout the film. If you do watch this movie the way I did let me tell you...The fast forward button will be your best friend.I'm still laughing out loud at how horrible this movie was. It's hard to believe people invested time money and dangering themselves for this garbage.The way they showed how Jackie Chan cared for the stooges who killedinjured people close to him by the end of the movie is beyond me! This is in no way like the original Police Story where Jackie doesn't stand around and cry like a little baby but actually fights back and has no remorse! Oh yeah and they even had a SWAT team in that movie!This movie was stupid over dramatic and horrible. Not even the stunts special effects or the impressive dubbing could save it! Bottom line If your fetish is to watch Jackie get smacked all over the place for 23rds of a movie and cry like a baby while drinking his flask along with a poor plot on the side with annoying villains who you will eventually suppose to feel sorry for in the end then by all means watch this movie! If you like laughing at bad movies this movie is for you! If you're me who wants to see Jackie kick ass and show no mercy along a nice plot...Stick with the other Police Stories especially the first one!Note I deducted stars from this movie for plot poor dialog direction production and every time Jackie Chan decided it was time to cry. I gave it stars for stunts special FX and impressive dubbing for a bad movie.I hope somebody puts up a petition to change the name of this movie from 'New Police Story' to 'New Crap Story'.".

Unorganized police missions where you have Captain Jack telling the Channel News24 his plans while the villains listen in. Let alone not having a SWAT team of some sort not knowing the layout of the buildings and using lame hand guns for dynamic entrances. Rich kids having better technology than the police force while being better trained and having better guns. Dramatic scene where Jackie's girlfriend asks him if he loves her while she has a bomb strapped to her neck and then decides it is time to cut the cables with the scissors after Jackie leaves to get help. Jackie crying. You might as well call it all a bad dream as this movie is so surreal and unrealistic that it is near impossible to suspend your disbeliefs throughout the film. If you do watch this movie the way I did let me tell you...The fast forward button will be your best friend.I'm still laughing out loud at how horrible this movie was. It's hard to believe people invested time money and dangering themselves for this garbage.The way they showed how Jackie Chan cared for the stooges who killedinjured people close to him by the end of the movie is beyond me! This is in no way like the original Police Story where Jackie doesn't stand around and cry like a little baby but actually fights back and has no remorse! Oh yeah and they even had a SWAT team in that movie!This movie was stupid over dramatic and horrible. Not even the stunts special effects or the impressive dubbing could save it! Bottom line If your fetish is to watch Jackie get smacked all over the place for 23rds of a movie and cry like a baby while drinking his flask along with a poor plot on the side with annoying villains who you will eventually suppose to feel sorry for in the end then by all means watch this movie! If you like laughing at bad movies this movie is for you! If you're me who wants to see Jackie kick ass and show no mercy along a nice plot...Stick with the other Police Stories especially the first one!Note I deducted stars from this movie for plot poor dialog direction production and every time Jackie Chan decided it was time to cry. I gave it stars for stunts special FX and impressive dubbing for a bad movie.I hope somebody puts up a petition to change the name of this movie from 'New Police Story' to 'New Crap Story'.";

Like billions of others out there I was mesmerized by Jackie as a boy and still imitate the heck out of his moves even today. Anyone who disses Jackie should try to do 1 of what he's accomplished.The story was pretty good and the production slick. The tension and pace is just right for action. Some interesting themes are brought up about kids and their obsession with games as well as criticism of poor parenting. The struggling inspector played by Jackie was an interesting turn because he was less of a clown and more of a troubled soul. Maybe some people were put off by the sadness of some events in the film but they sure pulled me in. It's hard to get really raw emotion when the production is so slick and the action over the top but one scene between Jackie and his love interest really got to me and his lovable sidekick left a bittersweet taste in the end.".

Nicolas Tse a regular dude impersonating a cop gets to walk in and out of a police headquarters? even my office building has more security then that! Jackie cannot act period. Don't get me wrong he can fight and do great stunts but stick with what you are good at Jackie. He spends an hour of the movie trying force tears out of his eyes.

And where did they dig out Charlie Yung? she spoke what 2 lines during the whole movie?

	schema:reviewBody "I am a film critic that dislikes writing bad reviews. But i feel especially dishonored in writing this review as it stars my favorite actor  Jackie Chan. Don't get this wrong I'm not just disappointed in seeing my man Jackie in a bad movieThe Medallion and The Tuxedo weren't impressive this is a critical and honest review. The film tries to be dramatic without having any idea what message it's trying to convey it's slow paced and the action scenes were filmed halfheartedly. The movie seems to portray Police officers as either cowardice bullying incompetent corrupt and  or  moving targets. The villains are a group of rich bored thrillseeking youths who commit highstakes robberies and shoot cops as part of a game. The more cops the 'players' shoot the more points they earn at the end. Sophisticated entertainment? Not only are their actions glorified at least to some extent attempts are made towards the end to draw sympathy to these sociopaths on the grounds that their parents misunderstood them. This is an offense to the HKPD surely? The director has no understanding of the audience nor the slightest clue of how to film action scenes. It was once fun to watch Jackie ride on top of a bus as it drives out of control through the streets or him tear through a shopping centre but it came off bland. The authenticity of the deathdefying stunts seen in other HK flicks Who Am I? being a noble example was just not there. The majority of the movie captures him weeping over the death of his teammates with one terrible instance where he falls on his knees in true melodramaticopera style in the middle of a fight scene. This is not the hero his fans have for so long been devoted to. In fact I objected to the very casting of Jackie Chan for I would have otherwise not bothered seeing it. The fights mostly involved guns and the single bout that was worth any merit could have easily been executed by any dozen of cinema's rising martialart stars. Having said this much I should mention that this movie is part of an old franchise as the 'new' bit in the title suggests. Yet whilst I enjoyed Rocky 6 and Die Hard 4.0 this seriesreboot fails. Firstly the Jcakie character in the earlier Police Storys' was a loose cannon and shorttempered your old fashioned it's not over 'til it's over guy. Where the hell was he? I was first convinced the Englishspeaking distributors simply borrowed the title so that it would be familiar to the West but I checked it out  it was actually intended as a Police Story sequel. What a waste. It seems they gave the production to a director who knew nothing about Police Story or Jackie Chan disliked cops and gave him a low budget. The film is ridiculously slowpaced for a policeaction film it milks dramatic scenes until it loses all impact there is an absence humor charm and the exciting fight Jackie Chan is famed for. I really shouldn't judge Benny Chan for this is the only film of his I've seen but I can't help thinking it was all his fault. The heroes are disamiable and he seems to barrack for the bad guys the whole way through. The gangleader continues to win up until the very end he murders for sport kills his lover instead of taking her to a hospital and shoots his friend in front of his parents. OK I might as well give away the ending  the bad guy dies in a PoliceAssisted Suicide in slowmotion as tears runs from his eyes the same guy that laughed while he executed innocent people. After all this the satisfaction of a good revengeending is robbed from us as if Benny Chan expects the slightest show of sympathy to this massmurderer. Before panning the film further there is one thing I need to say. The pain Jackie displays mentioned above is genuine. But as he weeps on his knees in front of the camera his fans understand  or at least I understood  that his character's failure to save his friends is allegorical of the real Jackie's inability to live up to his glory days. Truly sad viewing of a superstar's fading shine. PS don't watch this.".

And they are pretty brutal about getting both. The way they go about their mayhem is pretty clever and twisted. One of the best things going in this movie are the teaming of Jackie and Nicholas Nse. Nse's fast talking smart mouthed younger cop makes a perfect match for Jackie's seasoned and serious veteran. They play off each other perfectly with touches of subtle humor here and there. I would have loved to see them paired up more as this cop duo but it's now 9 years later already and even Nse himself isn't a kid anymore.A definite winner.

Hope he never tries this type of thing again. This has nothing to do with the other Police Stories and should not be marketed this way. Every one of the Police Stories were progressively worse but the first three still hold up and the initial one is near perfect.

	schema:reviewBody "Terry Gilliam has never found it easy to make one of his downright weird films. Studio interference has almost invariably led to project delays postponements and outright cancellations with his final cuts emerging bruised bloodied and  more often than not  broken. Interestingly The Zero Theorem suffers from next to none of the scuttlebutt that usually accompanies a Gilliam film. Instead this dense complex thought provoking odyssey of human existence and unhappiness feels like pure Gilliam odd uncompromising but  at its best  almost breathtakingly brilliant.In some notsodistant sparklybright dystopian future brilliant and determinedly solitary mathematician Qohen Leth Christoph Waltz suffers through the tiny indignities of daily life. He's forced to leave the burntout church he calls home to report for work where he crunches numbers for his clueless immediate supervisor Joby David Thewlis. But all he wants is to stay close to his telephone waiting for a call he believes will help him unravel the mysteries of the universe and his existence.When mysterious head honcho Management a silverhaired Matt Damon finally gives him leave to work from home Qohen is assigned the impossible Zero Theorem a mathematical conundrum that has defeated many a mathematician before him. To keep him from going completely around the bend Management sends him company in the form of Bainsley Mlanie Thierry a nubile young woman with whom he forges an unexpected emotional connection and Management's own genius teenage son Bob Lucas Hedges.If you're looking for a plot that makes sense and progresses in logical fashion The Zero Theorem is not the film for you. In Gilliam's movie based on a loopy mindbending script by Pat Rushin plot points are more often than not metaphors for the human condition. The script can be simultaneously literal and obtuse Qohen lives in a hollowedout church a blindingly obvious symbol of the fading of traditional religion he's waiting for a call  read calling  that will free him from the humdrum banalities of a workerbee's life.But that's also where the film's genius lies. It's an explosion of philosophical ideas asking deep difficult questions about happiness humanity and hubris  often in the same scene. Few films and filmmakers would dare to so boldly confront existential issues on this scale and to this depth. The titular Zero Theorem after all requires Qohen to prove that everything is nothing that the entire universe filled with people ultimately has no meaning. Qohen's strange isolated journey hints at some answers but not anywhere near all of them.Gilliam could easily have failed on two counts the seemingly stereotypical blonde love interest and the annoyingly precocious teenage boy. But within these archetypes The Zero Theorem finds something fascinating to say. Bainsley starts out as a ditzy blonde dream girl but winds up offering Qohen plenty of soul and an elusive transient kind of eternity. Bob too is a whipsmart delight a child more in tune with the silent beats and rhythms of the universe than any number of people older and purportedly wiser than him.The film would fail catastrophically without a leading man capable of handling the tragedy and comedy of Qohen Leth  a character who in habitually referring to himself using the royal 'we'  is a metaphor for every human being that has ever been and will ever be. Waltz is more than up to the task. He is hilariously effective when called upon to wriggle into a skintight virtualreality costume and devastatingly heartbreaking in the moment when Qohen refuses a chance at freedom and happiness to stay locked into the dark nihilistic world in which he lives. There are also a pair of wonderful supporting turns  slightly larger than cameos  from Damon and Tilda Swinton. The former clearly enjoyed his time working on The Brothers Grimm one of Gilliam's most disastrous onset experiences and here he provides a grim mysterious counterpoint to Waltz's Cohen  the latter only appears to be impenetrable and tough to crack. Swinton meanwhile is a hoot as Dr. ShrinkRom Qohen's athome virtual psychiatrist fumbling through their sessions with tons of blustery false cheer.Perhaps most astounding of all is the fact that Gilliam made a film that looks so good  in its inventive kitschy way  on a shoestring budget of US8.5 million. That's pocket change for most Hollywood films and there's no doubt that everyone involved took a huge paycut to make The Zero Theorem look as great as it does. The special effects are mostly wonderful and the neoncoloured world through which the blackclad Qohen stalks practically bursts at the seams with detail and imagination.The Zero Theorem is emphatically not a film that will appeal to everyone. There are those who will find themselves incredibly annoyed by its philosophical navelgazing and others who might find Qohen's entire journey pointless and irredeemably selfinvolved. But when it comes down to it it's hard to deny the weird wacky power of Gilliam's movie. The Zero Theorem so bravely grapples with big ideas and complicated metaphors that it's hard not to admire the director's great courage and even greater ambition.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lord Management created the World. It was a world of connectivity and networks and total control. You need to be connected to this world to benefit from it and the worst punishment ever is to become disconnected The Lord management who looks a bit like Bill Gates and a bit like Steve Jobs is omniscient and omnipotent. He is everywhere but you can't see him. He blends very well into everything but his power oozes out of everything. Although he is invisible to your eyes he is the real life and soul of every party.And the lord sent his son Bob to save us. This prodigy son is always there when saving is needed showing the way to tortured spirit by injecting a brilliant mixture of wisdom energy and rather naive teenage spirit. The problem with the Lord's Son is that he is actually a rebel. He doesn't wish to be a tool like the rest of Lord Management's creation and therefore he keeps subtly inciting a form of existential rebellion.And the Lord Management wanted to test the integrity safety and sustainability of the world he created and its ability to stand against the invincible and perfect powers of death and oblivion. The Lord therefore commissions The Devil  Lucifer Known in the Movie as Qohen Leth to do that Jobusing him as a tool.The Devil Leth's job is to test if all this creation could add up to zero or collapse into nothingness once again. Leth's success would mean the identification of the conditions that could lead to the collapse of Lord management's world. His failure however would prove that the Lord's creation is perfect  sustainable and safe despite lacking any real purpose or meaning other than survival for the sake of survival or for the sake of Joywhich is the carrot the Lord dangles in front of the eyes of his tools to keep them running And the Lord decides to dangle a carrot before Qohen Leth's eyes to keep him stimulated to do his job. He decides to send him joy  which comes in the form of sex and pizza deliveries.At first The Devil Leth is indifferent to the temptations the Lord send him. The Devil Leth had tried all the joys the world can offer and has grown jaded. His path of excess had led him to the tower of wisdom. he had lost his desires his emotions his heart and the lusts of his body and became Maximum brain minimal body. Thus the Lord sends his son bob to tempt the devil to once again enjoy sex and pizza.Bob the Savior is very successful in his job. He manages to endure the Qohen Leth's intolerable negativity and lack of motive and tempts him to once again connect to the Lord's world. His success is ultimate when he finally convinces the Devil Leth to wear the red suit of desire and enter the Lord's creation once again eager for a quickie. In the End and after lots of suffering from all sides the Devil Qohen Leth becomes addicted to all the joys the virtual carnal and culinary joys The Lord offers. Leth becomes motivated and works very hard proving that The Lord's creation can never ever be equal to zero.Leth's failure to prove the Zero theorem simply means the end of his contract with the Lord. His services are not needed any more. His job is done.When Leth is fired he realizes that he was really nothing but a tool and the only real road to redemption is the one the Lord's Son Bob preaches at the every start before the journey temptation began. The only road to redemption is to disconnect from The Lord's World! To refuse to become a tool. However the price of this is the deprivation from all the Lord's .Thus the three paradoxical commandments of Gilliam's Gospel are Connectivity equals joy and also equals acceptance of the control of The Lord Management.Redemption equals freedom. Freedom equals disconnection. Disconnection equals lonelinessand death.A life is not different from death if it is a virtual life. Joy is equal to emptiness if it is no real joy.Realizing this dilemma of our existence Qohen Leth returns to his isolation. He tries to make the virtual world he created for himself more real by simply committing suicide. He allows the eternal sun fixed in its eternal dusk to final set and sink down into oblivion. When the night of death comes Leth is happy for what he experiencing is real. he even hears the voice of his beloved where they unite againin another better and hopefully more real world maybe? Terry Gilliam if this is how you see the world I bow to your genius I applaud your mind... but I am very very worried about your heart. I guess you really really need some pizza".

Well you will be the judge.If you like this movie I also recommend PI by Aronofsky Brazil Blade runner 1984 THX1138 among other great ones. Hopefully this movie will become a cult classic and show new directors that they don't require 100 million dollars to make good scifi movies.

The task is complicated by some new personal relationships when he meets Bainsley a tempting Internet stripper and Bob the 15 year old genius son of the CEO of Mancom.

Qohen is often unsure about the answer to that question.The world of the film resembles that of Gilliam's previous two dystopian satires but this is its own film and it deals with some new themes and conflicts. I'd say the themes and questions are even deeper here because Gilliam is struggling with the meaning of life itself. Anyway it all works and leads to an intriguing and visually engaging story.

	schema:reviewBody "I seem to have an accidental tradition of seeing new Terry Gilliam at film festivals. Four years ago I saw The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus at the Munich Film Festival which had an intro and QA by Gilliam my first time seeing one of my favourite directors in person. It was quite a treat. This time at the London Film Festival I didn't go to the screening he attended but it goes for any film that you see at a festival that the excited atmosphere enhances the experience. Parnassus held up on DVD and I'm sure The Zero Theorem will too securing my opinion that he can make at least one great film a decade since the 70s. Personally I'm a big fan of Gilliam's bizarre chaotic style it never fails for me and this is his best use of it since the wonderfully disorientating Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.Although the outside world can seem more like Ron Howard's vision of The Grinch as many have complained they didn't buy the retroworld Gilliam created here I loved the immaculate production design and especially the visual effects for the scenes where our protagonist Qohen is trying to solve the theorem in video gamelike scenes. This is probably his most on thenose existentialistic film yet given its direct and ambitious plot line but it's very cleverly and often emotionally done. It's like the incredibly profound reverend speech in Synecdoche New York expanded to 2 hours about each of our individual purposes in life and how that search of meaning affects our lives. Both Zero and Synecdoche thrive off that irony and they're both brilliantly executed Zero perhaps not having quite a punch in the gut effect. I loved Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds and quite liked him in Django Unchained premature second Oscar be damned but otherwise I'd only seen him in Carnage and I'm still not too confident what he can do in a nonTarantino film. It wasn't until watching The Zero Theorem where I realised how I'd never seen him play such an emotional character even if he is very reserved for the most part until a sexual awakening. Unfortunately his performance feels inconsistent. Sometimes he absolutely nails poignant characterdefining scenes and reaches heights of Basterds albeit at the other end of the scale. Other times he feels awkward over rehearsed and not in the moment. It's quite strange and rather frustrating because his good bits are so good.Perhaps it's mainly due to the writing as its mainly the attempts at slapstick that falter. The script has a running character quirk where he refers to himself as we or us as opposed to me or I and it's rather confusing as to what it means and puts an unnecessary barrier between us and Qohen when it could be incredibly easy for us to empathise with him. The side characters more than make up for his lopsided parts though. At first they can feel like one dimensional gag characters but slowly they develop in an intriguing and welcome way especially Melanie Thierry and Lucas Hedges' characters. While many of the film's jokes don't really land David Thewlis is one of the best comedic relief characters in a while and he undeniably has the best lines. Damon and Swinton make delightful appearances too.Along with its existentialism it has a fascinating theme of sex in the 21st Century with the influence of internet. Thierry's character is a paid tease 'you can look but you can't touch' though she has a heart a good one. But you still can't touch. It certainly hits a nerve for these 'more connected than ever yet more disconnected than ever' times. I would give anything to have the virtual paradise the film offers from Qohen's suit in the poster. The film attempts to have 1984like themes of government surveillance which aren't as interesting but fortunately after Brazil it feels like Gilliam's style rather than an NSA reference. Although the first act struggles in tone it certainly builds to something very rewarding. The Zero Theorem won't be for everyone but it at the very least offers an interesting answer to the big question what is the meaning of my life?810".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I must state that I've been following Terry Gilliam since the 1990s and that I have seen all of his films in retrospect. Most of them I liked instantly some required multiple viewings to completely grasp but some were quite disappointing though. In my humble opinion ever since 'The Fisher King' every new Gilliam film was either better or at least on par with the previous with the exception of 'The Brothers Grimm' which was a dud. Having said all of that I feel as if I still just wasn't prepared for 'The Zero Theorem'.I usually don't make decisions about films to watch based on reviews especially when it's a film by an author I admire but I've read some very negative reviews on this one. What most of them had in common was that 'The Zero Theorem' was a shallow copy of 'Brazil' andor 'Blade Runner'. Honestly after seeing the film I think such superficial remarks are as fair as calling 'Saving Private Ryan' a shallow copy of 'The Dirty Dozen'.Although set in the future 'The Zero Theorem' is a subtle but harsh critique of modern society much like the two aforementioned films it supposedly copies but it covers a completely different main subject. While 'Brazil' was a satire focused on a struggle between a small man and the bureaucracy 'The Zero Theorem' touches much wider ground and asks some more important questions Who are we? Why are we here? What is our purpose? What's great about 'The Zero Theorem' is that it refrains from answering and lets the viewers find the answers themselves and as such it not only succeeds to convey the message that life is too short to waste on waiting for some divine call but also touches on the very meaning of our existence more than any film I have ever seen.On the technical side the film is beautifully crafted astonishingly decorated marvelously acted and masterfully directed. This is a work of a great author in his prime and had it been made earlier in Gilliam's career it would have no doubt been remembered as his defining masterpiece. Almost thirty years after 'Brazil' it draws inevitable comparisons and is unfortunately labeled as lesser by people who obviously and sadly miss its complete point.It is hard to judge 'The Zero Theorem' just as a film because it is so much more than just a moving picture. Seeing it only for entertainment will most certainly leave the viewer dissatisfied. Watching it as an art form but also a philosophic treatise it becomes some sort of a Nietzschean abyss staring back at you it is deeper than imaginable but a fully cathartic experience as such.A full and perfect 10 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Waiting for the Call  What other reason is there to pick up the phone?";
	schema:reviewBody "Once again I find myself tired weary and insomniac struggling to find the words to describe a movie that has rooted itself in my thoughts for the better part of a week. I speak of course of Terry Gilliam's latest scifi venture The Zero Theorem 2013 which even after a second viewing tonight has left me bewildered enchanted and ultimately feeling hollow. Directed by Gilliam and written by Pat Rushin The ZipT as they refer to it in the film deals with that age old question of the meaning of life and whether or not everything is nothing or if nothing is everything.While I imagine most of you dear readers will initially be turned off by that previous line of philosophical rigmarole the first thing you need to understand about this movie and really the only accurate way to describe it is that it is a Terry Gilliam film. If you are unfamiliar with Gilliam as a director you might have heard of a little known comedy troupe known as Monty Python. Gilliam was the only American member of the legendary group though he has since renounced his citizenship and the man behind the iconic cartoons and animations. While he has an extensive and cerebral filmography I'm only going to confine myself to only referring to what has been dubbed Gilliam's Dystopic Triptych Brazil 1985 12 Monkeys 1995 and now the Zero Theorem. Gilliam's films are visually stunning and often characterized by being wildly imaginative and fantastical  generally being layered with satire symbolism and surrealism. True to his nature the ZT is a visual and intellectual feast that is today what Brazil was in 1985 a surrealist commentary of the times. While Brazil was satirizing being a cog in the soulless bureaucracy the ZT is treatise on dreams and the struggle of finding meaning in the digital world we live in. The film stars Christoph Waltz Inglorious Basterds Django Unchained as Qohen Leth or simply Q who is a reclusive phobiaridden programmer of sorts that believes that one day he will receive a phone call that will provide meaning to his life.He lives in a burnt out church that he bought from an insurance company and detests the vibrant and absurdist world he has to interact with on his daily commute to work. Preferring the solitude of his home Q begrudgingly treks to his quasicubicle at Mancom the 'big business' of the future where he 'crunches entities' basically playing a 3d version of a TetrisSudoku hybrid. He is also joined on screen by that kid from Moonrise Kingdom Lucas Hedges as Bob and a ridiculously goodlooking and often scantily clad Mlanie Thierry as Bainsley. Matt Damon also makes a few appearances as 'Management' often making a fashion statement and offering a few cryptic lines to Q. Preferring solitude Q is eventually rewarded with a home office in exchange for working to prove the Zero Theorem which essentially is meant to prove existence is meaningless and from the chaos of the big bang all of reality will eventually revert to nothingness. Pretty deep right? Well naturally Q finds the project overwhelming and is soon burnt out. Management enlists the beautiful Bainsley and wunderkind Bob to get him back on track and in the process they irreversibly change the character and nature of Q. While in my first viewing of the film I left satisfied albeit a little confused I find myself the second round feeling almost at one with the Waltz's character intent on finding meaning in everything or nothing. Every scene in this film is so very dense with symbolism and subject to interpretation that I cannot begin to imagine what really goes through Gilliam's head when he directs. At times certain things feel extremely contrived like the fact that Q lives in a burnt out church but they are all rooted in the Orwellian and Kafkaesque landscape that Gilliam so often likes to employ. Gilliam has a very unique visual style that rewards the audience with masterful set design that is complemented by what I'd call a 'Paranoid POV' type shot that is reminiscent of Carol Reed's famous crooked angle shots in The Third Man 1949. The best way I can describe this movie is as a spiritual and existentialist journey that ponders the meaning of life and the nature of reality. It's fairly obvious that Waltz's Q is absolutely insane but in that insanity he is also perceived as being the best candidate to solve these puzzles. The film features outstanding performances most notably by Waltz and admittedly I fell in love with Melanie Thierry every time she was on screen.

	onyx:emotionText "Once again I find myself tired weary and insomniac struggling to find the words to describe a movie that has rooted itself in my thoughts for the better part of a week. I speak of course of Terry Gilliam's latest scifi venture The Zero Theorem 2013 which even after a second viewing tonight has left me bewildered enchanted and ultimately feeling hollow. Directed by Gilliam and written by Pat Rushin The ZipT as they refer to it in the film deals with that age old question of the meaning of life and whether or not everything is nothing or if nothing is everything.While I imagine most of you dear readers will initially be turned off by that previous line of philosophical rigmarole the first thing you need to understand about this movie and really the only accurate way to describe it is that it is a Terry Gilliam film. If you are unfamiliar with Gilliam as a director you might have heard of a little known comedy troupe known as Monty Python. Gilliam was the only American member of the legendary group though he has since renounced his citizenship and the man behind the iconic cartoons and animations. While he has an extensive and cerebral filmography I'm only going to confine myself to only referring to what has been dubbed Gilliam's Dystopic Triptych Brazil 1985 12 Monkeys 1995 and now the Zero Theorem. Gilliam's films are visually stunning and often characterized by being wildly imaginative and fantastical  generally being layered with satire symbolism and surrealism. True to his nature the ZT is a visual and intellectual feast that is today what Brazil was in 1985 a surrealist commentary of the times. While Brazil was satirizing being a cog in the soulless bureaucracy the ZT is treatise on dreams and the struggle of finding meaning in the digital world we live in. The film stars Christoph Waltz Inglorious Basterds Django Unchained as Qohen Leth or simply Q who is a reclusive phobiaridden programmer of sorts that believes that one day he will receive a phone call that will provide meaning to his life.He lives in a burnt out church that he bought from an insurance company and detests the vibrant and absurdist world he has to interact with on his daily commute to work. Preferring the solitude of his home Q begrudgingly treks to his quasicubicle at Mancom the 'big business' of the future where he 'crunches entities' basically playing a 3d version of a TetrisSudoku hybrid. He is also joined on screen by that kid from Moonrise Kingdom Lucas Hedges as Bob and a ridiculously goodlooking and often scantily clad Mlanie Thierry as Bainsley. Matt Damon also makes a few appearances as 'Management' often making a fashion statement and offering a few cryptic lines to Q. Preferring solitude Q is eventually rewarded with a home office in exchange for working to prove the Zero Theorem which essentially is meant to prove existence is meaningless and from the chaos of the big bang all of reality will eventually revert to nothingness. Pretty deep right? Well naturally Q finds the project overwhelming and is soon burnt out. Management enlists the beautiful Bainsley and wunderkind Bob to get him back on track and in the process they irreversibly change the character and nature of Q. While in my first viewing of the film I left satisfied albeit a little confused I find myself the second round feeling almost at one with the Waltz's character intent on finding meaning in everything or nothing. Every scene in this film is so very dense with symbolism and subject to interpretation that I cannot begin to imagine what really goes through Gilliam's head when he directs. At times certain things feel extremely contrived like the fact that Q lives in a burnt out church but they are all rooted in the Orwellian and Kafkaesque landscape that Gilliam so often likes to employ. Gilliam has a very unique visual style that rewards the audience with masterful set design that is complemented by what I'd call a 'Paranoid POV' type shot that is reminiscent of Carol Reed's famous crooked angle shots in The Third Man 1949. The best way I can describe this movie is as a spiritual and existentialist journey that ponders the meaning of life and the nature of reality. It's fairly obvious that Waltz's Q is absolutely insane but in that insanity he is also perceived as being the best candidate to solve these puzzles. The film features outstanding performances most notably by Waltz and admittedly I fell in love with Melanie Thierry every time she was on screen. The future Gilliam portrays is both unique and at the same time frighteningly absurd although ultimately a distorted reflection of the world of 2014. Whether or not you find something meaningful from this film it is the type to linger in your thoughts long after you've left the theatre. My friends will understand me as I excuse myself to go search for my own Shell Beach and for all others I recommend you stop whatever you're doing and watch The Zero Theorem followed by Dark City 1998.Read this and other reviews on DriveInZeppelin's website";

	schema:reviewBody "There's a black hole swirling at the bottom of Qohen Leth's Christoph Waltz soul. He's waiting for a phone call from God explaining the point of it all. Because at the moment it seems like existence is an erroneous quirk in the cosmic standard of nothingness. Everything will return to nothing so why make something of life? Love in the form of romance Melanie Thierry as Bainsley friendship David Thewlis and parenthood Lucas Hedges provides Qohen with the answers but he's too absorbed in his work on the Zero Theorem to accept it.There are elements of David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis in Qohen's philosophical quest in the oddball characters he meets along the way and his perennial absence of feeling. And in the Zen imagery of a nude Waltz spiralling through the void there's a bit of Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. Both of those films were more coherent and emotionally engaging than The Zero Theorem although Terry Gilliam's film grows on you once you accept that it's not Brazil Part II. There are definite touches of Gilliam's 1985 masterpiece here particularly the awkward marrying of archaic and ultramodern technologies. But don't expect a script of Tom Stoppard wit swerve and clarity.Waltz is a fantastic presence  which is necessary because most of the story plays out in his home an echochamber of a converted church whose baptismal font now serves as a washing up bowl. We see him at work attempting to order the universe via a 3D game block game fighting against entropy against the inevitable demise of conscious matter and with it the question What does it all mean? The problem is he's waiting for an answer. The very point is uncertainty the propulsive force of our species.Whether all this makes for a particularly cinematic experience I'm not sure. The Cronenberg and Aronofsky films I mentioned were successful because for all their vast questions their focus was narrow and their plots simple. The Zero Theorem is at its best when at its least manic  perhaps its least 'Gilliamesque'  lost in the quiet intimacy between Qohen and Bainsley. Like Wes Anderson's latest this feels like the film of an auteur fighting against two opposing impulses. The results particularly when seen as a straightforward study of depression are interesting if not entirely successful.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Terry Gilliam's prior work I was confident that this film would live up to 'Brazil' and 'Twelve Monkeys'. Couldn't be more wrong. The screenplay makes Forrest Gump look sophisticated. The characters are uniformly caricatural the tortured genius looking for truth the hooker with a heart of gold the techsavvy adolescent wise beyond his years the shrewd business mogul who manipulates all and so on and so on. Art direction musical score set design range between annoying and just plain over the top. Special effects and computer graphics straight out of the late great Cannon Studios tradition of C for cheeeeesy. As regards the cast Matt Damon is wooden and Tilda Swinton who I revere histrionic. Only Christoph Waltz manages to keep his character afloat through stilted dialogue and terrible costumes for which he deserves a better part. The worst thing by far is the mannered camera work which makes every one of the seemingly endless 107 minutes excruciating to watch. This film is an embarrassment to all involved. If you like Terry Gilliam do yourself a favour and skip this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Terry Gilliam is like a fine wine except the older he gets he is all the more bizarre. And like a hangover from a jolly night of inebriation through Time Bandits 1977 Brazil 1981 and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen 1988 The Zero Theorem is the snow settled after the blizzard a grand encore to remind you of your past adventures. The Zero Theorem is as much a Gilliamsized hit of nostalgia as it is a cocktail of longing gazing back on the days of old. In those days there were no spying cameras hidden throughout your home and no dazzling virtual reality tech to make you ponder the existential just a simple life to enjoy your imagination. I'm torn on whether Gilliam enjoys his world or loathes it. I think it's a bit of both.And if The Zero Theorem is a companion piece to Brazil  which it undeniably is  it would better serve as its counterpart. The streets aren't governed by Brazil's grayscale monotony they're a bizarre flurry of colour advertisements chatting and stalking you down the streets. It's a world devoid of minimalism but not too far from todays. Our hero Qohen Leth is a computer hacker extraordinaire housed in a run down cathedral precariously located next to a sex shop. He is an agoraphobe a claustrophobe and just about any other phobe you could imagine. He loathes his workplace and begs to hack from home. His manager  not to be confused with resident Big Brother 'Management' helmed by a strangely suited Matt Damon  advises him to be careful what he wishes for.So Qohen's workstation a flashing retrohipster fusion of plastic and neon vials joins him in his towering cathedral. His door is secured by seven different locks and the building is home to a colony of rats doves and oodles of microwave meals. Whenever the phone rings he darts to its side. It's not the call he was hoping for his call that explains every iota of existence just another disappointing deadline from the mysterious Management. Deadline for what you ask? Qohen is tasked with decoding the titular 'Zero Theorem' a mishmash of data that could explain all or nothing. Qohen thinks all and nothing is the same thing. He's not wrong and at the same time perhaps he isn't right?.The process seems impossible but Qohen is making progress. To him he isn't it's just one step forward and a dozen back his house of cards crumbling as he perfects its steeple. Hacking seems fetishistic keyboards are gone replaced by the future equivalent of an Xbox controller joysticks twiddling and flashing buttons twanging. This future seems to beg for attention a world of flashing lights and arcadey sounds to captivate our ever degrading attention span. Even work is a game just a twiddle of joysticks and a colourful computer screen. It's quite unlike Brazil  Lowry's world was uninteresting and bleak distractions were a temptation. The Zero Theorem is its pole.But Qohen avoids distractions like the plague never daring exit the security of his towering cathedral. Along comes a pretty blonde strippergram dressed in a latex nurse suit. He avoids her and recoils from her touch enjoying loneliness more than her charming company. Nor is he the life of a party nearly choking to death on a piece of candy. Soon the colourful strippergram Bainsley introduces Qohen to the future equivalent of phone sex where they plug themselves in and go at it online. The web extension is .sex  subtle. Technology is a fetish.Gilliam is less a filmmaker than a magician. He conjures up the wackiest location you could imagine only to whirl you there with a wave of his magic wand. The journey is exciting like traversing a tunnel of colour and lights a carnival of the strange but delightful. Behind the colour nestles a drunken nostalgia an understanding of something more a little something you may have missed. The colours pop and scream but his alarming cynicism bleeds through the picture. Qohen is sad his cathedral Gothic and ancient. He is reluctant to live in his new world. Perhaps Gilliam shares his reluctance.Qohen's obsession with nothingness is existential of course but far from nihilistic. It's his faith the God that echoes throughout his cathedral of memory and sadness. This faith saps his life sucking it into one of Gilliam's neonlit vials. He doesn't refer to himself as 'I' but as 'we' and 'us'. He is so distracted that he is no longer his individual self  he is as selfless as the monks who lived in the cathedral before him sworn to chastity and silence.Gilliam once said People in Hollywood are not showmen they're maintenance men pandering to what they think their audiences want. If that is true Gilliam is like the dashing terrorist of Brazil lobbing a spanner in the works to grind against Hollywood's corporate gears. Unlike Brazil his latest film is far from perfect. But to Gilliam Time Bandits was about childhood Brazil was about adulthood and The Adventures of Baron Munchausenen is about old age. The Zero Theorem is about the inbetween the moments in life where you don't know who you are. In the end of his tale I hope Qohen has figured out who he is. I want him to move into the next stage of Gilliam's master plan.".

	schema:headline " The Zero Theorem isn't a film for every taste but I found it quite interesting";
	schema:reviewBody "On the positive side The Zero Theorem is full of philosophical concepts explorations of human condition and a perverse sense of humor which finds laughs in the futility of people and all that is contained in a space decorated by the same production designers of the TV series Max Headroom with a limited budget. On the negative side... the same reasons. But in my humble opinion the positive side surpasses the negative one because I'm accustomed to see the films directed by Terry Gilliam as authentic displays of an unstoppable creativity vaguely structured by ideas and deep existential questions which are easy to lose of sight due to the fact that they are expressed through deceptively irrelevant details when in fact they contain the films' true essence. However those who will see The Zero Theorem exclusively focusing on its superficial elements might find the screenplay obtuse and repetitive and told in confusing settings created by special effects of a doubtful quality. However I think that this film's authentic value goes much beyond its variegated presentation. It's hard for me to put that on words but it's exactly why I generally like Gilliam's films the sensation of a purpose behind the chaos. I don't know if that's real or just a consequence of my ossified brain trying to process random information looking for ideas where there's only style. Anyway it worked for me and that's why I think The Zero Theorem deserves a recommendation with the hope that every spectator will find something different and maybe valuable in the experience. And I would also like to mention the excellent work from the whole cast who brings credibility and enthusiasm to the eccentric characters. In conclusion I enjoyed The Zero Theorem pretty much. At the difference of its tortured main character I don't need a concrete answer in order to be left satisfied by a film. It's enough for me with the possibility that the solution exists in some place of the narrative waiting for the moment of revealing itself and surprising us.".

However I think that this film's authentic value goes much beyond its variegated presentation. It's hard for me to put that on words but it's exactly why I generally like Gilliam's films the sensation of a purpose behind the chaos. I don't know if that's real or just a consequence of my ossified brain trying to process random information looking for ideas where there's only style. Anyway it worked for me and that's why I think The Zero Theorem deserves a recommendation with the hope that every spectator will find something different and maybe valuable in the experience. And I would also like to mention the excellent work from the whole cast who brings credibility and enthusiasm to the eccentric characters. In conclusion I enjoyed The Zero Theorem pretty much. At the difference of its tortured main character I don't need a concrete answer in order to be left satisfied by a film. It's enough for me with the possibility that the solution exists in some place of the narrative waiting for the moment of revealing itself and surprising us.";

A theme often found in Gilliam's movies but one that can only be addressed directly once you have already achieved credibility and fame as a Director and here it is. The main character Qohen Leth teeters on the brink of the Abyss both spiritually and physically. A mathematical genius given the task of proving the zero theorem to prove the futility of life. Ironically everyone who has previously tried has failed or been driven insane by the task. Qohen already half way to insane has been awaiting a phone call from God a call in which his purpose and the meaning of life will be revealed. During the movie Qohen realises his delusions yet still persists in trying to prove the Zero Theorem all the while pushing away all human contact and any possibility of having a worthwhile life. Gilliam's point is this there are no definitive answers to our purpose life is for living. The very act of trying to prove the point of existence is a waste of a persons existence. Qohen Leth's tragic tale is the epitome of this message.".

All he can think of is he's dying even though he really isn't.It's left to a corporate call girl to waken him to fun and love. But he eventually rejects her feeling betrayed...all the while he's waiting for his reward in this life or the next in the form of a phone call. And here is the interesting aspect. Matt Damon as the corporate supremo lays it out to Waltz in a somewhat anti Christian rant about people wasting their lives on the assumption that this life is a meaningless phase when the next life is where it's at. He castigates Waltz for this view telling him he should be doing something with his life here and now instead of waiting for a 'call.' This is Jewish philosophy.I don't think Gilliam is Jewish...and he appeared to be knocking religion in general...but Jews believe God commanded them to make the most of this life and protect the earth for the here and now.

The point of this movie is to be a spoof of all the other lame ones but to be enjoyable because it's not really one of those at all. I mean it is but only because it's spoofing...SPOOFING! but it has a good sense of humor and tone to it. I couldn't get enough of the dog. I taped it back in...probably 6th grade and I'm planning on watching it tonight!!! I really enjoy this movie because who can't love a dog with such a humanlike character to him? Hmm??? And the people he meets along the way too haha. It's great. It's a great comedy I love the part where the crooks are trapped by the police and they realize all the hostages are gone so they look at Bingo and in the next scene they grab the dog and say one move and the dog gets it!...well it's funnier in the movie. But it's definitely worth the watch. I mean if you keep an open mind and don't act like the rest of these dufuses who probably started the movie with a negative response and kept with it not even WANTING to enjoy it. Geez give it a chance. And even if you don't like it I think it was worth the experience. Either way there are funny parts in the movie. Has Lassie ever gone to jail? Has Willy ever been to a place where they serve killer whale meat on the menu?????? Well have they?! No. So watch it because it's a SPOOF not just another one of those movies. It's great for everyone...except for angry men and bitchy women.".

And the next scene in Bingo's recollection where he was sitting in front of his mother's memorial fountain that read TAFFY Beloved Mother made it even more sad.I almost cried.The rest of the movie was very funny.

	schema:headline " I don't like Bingo Night. I would rather play the tabletop game then see this dog movie again.";
	schema:reviewBody "At least the tabletop game was a lot more fun than this film. Bingo the comedy film was dogcrap. As a kid of the 1990s this kid movie was really hard watch at the time. Directed by Matthew Robbins the film tells the story of a circus dog named Bingo trying to reconnect with his owner Chuckie Devlin Robert J. Steinmiller Jr. when both of them got separate on a recent move to another state. Can Bingo find Chuck or will Bingo end up being abandoned? Watch the movie to find out if you want to! Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say this movie was pretty damn dark for a kid's film. It was really shocking to find out that this film was rated PG at the time due to fact that the film has a lot of swelling overdrinking sex related themes and some rather graphic violence. However it's the disturbing scenes that take the cake for me. There are tons of intense scenes where animals are being turn into meat sausages going through fires or getting shot at. That's hardly the worst as the film really veer off from being acceptable as a family film as adulttheme gags are introduce such as Bingo meeting a sleazy prostitute named Bunny Tamsin Kelsey a large knife wielding escape prison convict FourEyes Wayne Robson and a bunch of criminals Lennie Kurt Fuller and Eli Joe Guzaldo who loves torturing children. Honestly I have no clue who this film was gear for? It's marketed as a kid movie but most of the jokes seem for adults. I really doubt any adults of a certain age would find this movie fantastic to watch. After all they could just watch funnier more recent adultdriven comedies with dogs like 2011's TV Show 'Wilfred or Family Guy. The only ones I can see rewatching this film are the kids now turn adults like myself just wanting to rant about it. However that viewership is slim to none since this movie bomb at the box office went it came out. For children I really doubt kids of today would find this film very interesting due to the fact that it's a bit dated. Also because that there has been a large surge of unwatchable childfriendly dog movies that been circulating kid's film genre as of late. Not only has those films really oversaturate the market but it makes films like this harder to stand out. In my opinion films like these don't have a chance in being a good dramatic heartwarming film compare to films like 2009's 'Hachi A Dog's Tale' or 2008's 'Marley  Me'. Even as adventure comedy about a dog trying to get back with its owner this movie really fails to be very entertaining as a kid's film. Films like 1993's 'Homeward Bound Incredible Journey' shows a great mix of humor and heart. This movie hardly shows that. Most of the human characters are onedimensional unrealistic doghating villains. Even Chuckie's family was very crude and unlikeable to Bingo for some odd reason. They were just the worst. Very annoying parents Natalie Cindy Williams  Hal Devlin David Rasche were. All they do is fight and yelled. The brother of Chuck Chickie David French is nearly a borderline psychopath because of it. I really don't think Bingo should even reunited with Chuckie just for that reason along. God knows what Chuckie's evil family would do once they get hold on him. As a spoof in which I believe this film was going for. It's a lot better than let's say the 2005's film 'Karate Dog' but not as good as '2001's Cats Vs Dogs'. While the movie does have some funny low blow dark humor sadly most of it didn't hit my funny bone. I laugh more at the cheap awful visual effects in the film like puppet paws more than the film jokes itself. Still it was nice to see Bingo being able to telephone 911 know Morse code drive a truck do math and even stop a bomb from exploding. I found the farfetched nature of Bingo's actions to be kinda funny. I also like the female dog that portraying the very male Bingo. I found her to be very cute friendly and welltrained. Other things that I kinda like about the film is the theme song by Robert Gibbs. Its sound very similar to 'Way Out There' by Carter Burwell from 1987's Raising Arizona. It's somewhat catchy. Still overall this film seems to have missed its mark. Not only did it not gain its intended target overtime but it's still being overshadow by better animal related comedies. It's a long forgotten comedy that probably deserve that title. In other words dog crap.".

He meets up with an outcast child who's brother goads him into jumping his bike across a river which leaves him face down in a river with an open headwound. Luckily the dog is able to pull him out perform CPR and then strip him naked to prevent hypothermia despite being in a locale where everybody's breath is visible when they speak.This leads to the kid trying to hide the dog from him family which could not be less concerned with his 24 hour absence and visible headwound upon his eventual return. There's no real comedy here despite going through the movements of setting up wouldbe gags.".

Cindy Williams best known s Shirley Feeney from her popular spin off of Happy Days plays the young boy's mom and she was the movie's star perhaps the only wellknown person in the film and not a major movie actor. The young boy Chuckie is the voice of reason in his dysfunctional family with rather cold and negligent parents such as his harsh contemptible father a struggling NFL Player and a mean older brother. Being born in 1944 and the movie being released 47 years later David Rasche looked simply too old to be in the NFL. Bingo is very sharp and intelligent and his capabilities seem farfetched but might be conceivable. The dog saves Chuckie's life after being knocked out in the stream and the two spend a night or two in the forest and then return home and skateboard play video games do math homework and go fishing all the while hiding the dog from his family. Chuckie's father gets inconveniently traded from Denver to Green Bay and Chuckie's attempts to sneak Bingo in the car fail and he chases after them in the car only to be too slow. The Journey to find Chuckie is a real hoot he encounters some really flaky and dysfunctional characters that largely parodied the Heartland. He rescues all the dogs from a cruel roadside restaurant Chuckie's family stopped at for lunch and drives the cruel owners in a cage in the truck and makes them crash into the joint. Then he meets the two comic villains that fit a classic movie stereotype Lennie is the big and tall guy who is more warmhearted and inept as well as environmental while the shorter of the two Eli is more sinister and villainous but the two are a great comic duo whom Bingo first encounters in a motor home where the do held a quirky family with mom dad and two eccentric girls hostage. Bingo gets them arrested and even the dog gets summoned to court! Bingo gets out of jail and somehow the villains break loose and after more misadventures Bingo finally makes it to Green Bay where a wacky local restaurant hires him as an assistant dishwasher and the villains capture Bingo and Chuckie finds him again before a lot of chaos. The movie shows the amazing instinct and capabilities of man's Best friend. However this is in no way just for kids. Some of the content made it seem on the edge for a family film. There is a lot of bad language and a couple inappropriate moments and the climax is pretty dramatic and tense for a lighthearted comedy. I saw this movie several times on video when i was little after it was a new movie and maybe when I was a little older. The movie truly cheers me up when I could use a smile.".

However parents may want to check it out for themselves before watching it with their youngest children as there are scenes that may be upsetting it's not that family friendly. Still there are some very bright moments and the cast is good especially the wonderful female mongrel in the title role  a truly talented canine found in a shelter  trained by animal specialist Boone Narr.Bingo is a dog who's run away from a circus and who comes into the life of a boy named Chuckie the appealing Robert J.

Bingo then embarks on a series of silly misadventures while tracking the Devlin family cross country incurring the wrath of two felons on the loose Lennie Kurt Fuller and Eli Joe Guzaldo.This actually gets a little intense at times such as any scene involving fire and the whole sequence with the diner is likely going to bother some people not just kids. But there's enough engagingly loopy comedy to counteract any bad taste that might be generated. Among other things Bingo brings champagne to a hottotrot cocker spaniel is made to walk a straight line by a traffic cop takes the witness stand in a courtroom and goes to a prison  a human prison. Cindy Williams and Rasche are fine as the parents Fuller and Guzaldo appropriately scummy as the criminal duo and the cast features other familiar faces such as Glenn Shadix Janet Wright Wayne Robson and Suzie Plakson. Director Matthew Robbins Dragonslayer The Legend of Billie Jean batteries not included keeps the pace consistent and brings things to a lively finish Jim Strains' script closes the movie on a hysterical final joke.Fun stuff overall.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "POKMON THE MOVIE GENESECT AND THE LEGEND AWAKENED 2013 is the seventeenth Pokmon movie and the last one in the Best Wishes Black and White series that's been running on TV in Japan since 2010 and in the U.S. since 2011. This time the regular protagonists' adventures take them to New York City and a brandnew Pokmon sanctuary established right in the middle of Central Park in the heart of Manhattan making this the first time the Pokmon crew has traveled to this reviewer's hometown. It's much more of a solid actionadventure than usual for these movies with far more Pokmonvs.Pokmon action than we've seen in a long time. In fact the main characters of Ash Ketchum and his everpresent Pokmon sidekick Pikachu take something of a back seat here as the formidable MewTwo a talking cat Pokmon created in a lab and first seen in the first Pokmon movie 15 years ago takes on the major fighting role as he seeks to protect other Pokmon from the invading Genesects a party of five extinct Pokmon recreated from fossils in yet another lab and then set loose on a destructive path into the world. One of the Genesects disdains fighting and laments that it just wants to go home. It soon bonds with Ash and his party and paves the way for some climactic mediation with the Red Genesect the ruthless leader of the invaders.MewTwo is quite a powerful creature and makes for a good match against the Genesects. Their fights dominate the film although the other Pokmon in Central Park threatened by the invasion stand up for themselves as well especially a muscular Feraligatr a bipedal alligatorlike Watertype Pokmon who bravely leads the resistance. It's quite a stirring sight to see an army of wildly different Pokmon fighting back entirely on their own initiative. Most of the Pokmon counterattacks take place under Central Park inside a massive power station which serves as a new nest for the Genesects. Meanwhile Red Genesect and MewTwo take to the skies over Manhattan and have some spectacular nighttime battles slamming into highrise buildings with alarming force. The action culminates in a highspeed trip to outer space for MewTwo and Red Genesect that leads to an unusual and highly suspenseful finale.There's only one new human supporting character in the cast and that's Eric the caretaker of the sanctuary Pokmon Hills and apparently the only one on duty when the Genesects threaten the power station and cause blackouts in parts of the city. Eric comes up with the solution that satisfies the Genesects' ultimate needs so he plays a major role but there isn't a lot of downtime for Ash and his friends Iris and Cilan to socialize with him other than a quick meal of hot dogs a local specialty as Eric tells them. Team Rocket the series' set of regular hapless villains Jessie James and Meowth plays a greater role in this film than they have in any of the last few films although their efforts as usual come to naught.The production design of the New York backgrounds is breathtaking with shots of Central Park and the towering Pokmon Hills complex arising from within sprinkled throughout the film and seen at all hours of the day from afternoon to dusk to nighttime to dawn. The story pretty much takes place over the course of a single day and night. There is one shot of Times Square that perfectly captures the 21st century BLADE RUNNERstyle configuration of giant screens and moving images arranged in sprawling formations that shower light on the area 24 hours a day. This isn't TAXI DRIVER's Times Square. The only significant difference from the actual Times Square is the predominance of Japanese lettering. Truth to tell the film never actually identifies the city by name. Also Central Park is a highly unlikely place to build a power station particularly one that according to Eric powers the entire city.This is the last movie in which we'll see Ash's Black  White companions Iris and Cilan since they're leaving the series as Ash moves into a new season Pokmon XY. I for one won't miss them since their schtick has changed very little since they were first introduced over two years ago with Iris constantly berating Ash for being such a little kid in that grating voice of hers at least in the English dub and metrosexual Cilan constantly waxing rhapsodic by means of forced foodiecooking metaphors to describe everything he sees. Too bad Cilan doesn't simply stay in New York since he and Eric seem to hit it off. Where are Misty and Brock when we need them? I happen to enjoy the annual Pokmon movies and while I think the best of them are found among the first seven up to and including DESTINY DEOXYS 2004 there've been some good ones in the last few years with this film standing out as one of the better ones. If I have any criticism it's that it doesn't give Ash and his friends a scene where they get to explore New York and see some of its famous sights. A tourist sequence would have made this outing just perfect.The movie was released to theaters in Japan on July 13 2013 and was first shown in the U.S. in an Englishdubbed version on the Cartoon Network on October 19 2013. It was released on DVD here on December 3 2013 marking the shortest period of time ever between a Pokmon movie's Japanese release and its arrival in the U.S. In the past I'd been accustomed to seeing the Japanese version of the movie well before its U.S. release. As of this writing my Japanese video store in Manhattan still hasn't gotten the Japanese version.".

As bad as the pokemon movies have been before they never really did anything to get the mythology wrong. In the first movie it's clearly established that Mewtwo is one of a kind but now here's another one. I guess other scientists did the same thing? Wouldn't that make her Mewthree? Even for a short movie it's pretty padded. I guess the animation is nice but that's about it. As someone who personally thought the original was mediocre at best I had no choice but to hate this. It's the worst thing that ever had the pokemon name on it.Team Rocket serve no purpose but it doesn't really matter. Ash Iris and Cilan don't serve any purpose either! The fight scenes are just monotonous with Mewtwo and the head Genesect just flying around for too long. There are so many pokemon movies you get to the point where you just can't reprise old stuff and that's just what this movie was. There's even a scene where Genesect gets between a blast with the head Genesect and Mewtwo directly lifted from the original movie! Mewtwo can Mega Evolve. Why would she need to do that? Why does she keep going back to her original form? I think even the people who worked on this movie admitted this was a gamble and knew people wouldn't like it. If a idea seems bad just don't make it. 12".

	schema:reviewBody "Genesect and the Legend Awakened 2013 is profound. Other than having a compelling backstory it has great themes and settings too. With many Pokmon in action we could also have a glimpse of their daily lives. There are just so many symbolic stuffs if you analyse it. In this animated feature the Genesect Army is lead and controlled by its shiny member called the Red Genesect and their nest is actually creepily interesting. As you may have already known if you have played the games before restoring Pokmon fossils have been a part of the main series games since the first one but these Genesects are the first real living fossil Pokmon featured in a Pokmon film so it is quite special! The ones in Pokmon Heroes are undead!However it is sad to watch them being resurrected just to be lost in time. They are suffering confusion have trust issues and there is even one feeling severely homesick. Lonely and afraid these creatures are actually simple and sweet. Although they do resemble an insect that I am not quite fond of I like one of the Genesects the gentle one stands out a lot. Might be just me but I felt that particular Genesect is nicely animated it probably exhibits the best body language by any Pokmon in films to date and I just couldn't help to feel sorry for it! Then there is one inevitable issue for older fans or those who are diehard fans of Mewtwo Strikes Back 1998 and Mewtwo Returns 2000. The Mewtwo here is seemingly a different one as it obviously has different much feminine voice and certainly do not know Ash Ketchum personally. Though that could be an issue it is still refreshing and it is not the major flaw of this animated feature. Instead Mewtwo fans should rejoice as the Pokmon is back on screen after so many years with its new mega evolution form!In my opinion the major flaw of Pokmon the Movie Genesect and the Legend Awakened 2013 is that there are several abrupt moments. I find it unsatisfactory but I am happy with what I see overall and what they do with the Genesects in the end. My verdict? Give this anime family film based on video game a chance and you may find yourself entertained especially if you like its genre. After all it is one of the better Pokmon Films ever made and it certainly will not lost in time!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Pokemon movies can get pretty formulaic but I still like to see them because the animation gets a humongous upgrade from the anime series although that rift diminished in the spectacular XY anime series. This movie sees Ash and co. exploring a Central Parkesque Pokemon Hills. Trouble looms however as a group of Genesect are set on making Pokemon Hills their new home disrupting the Pokemon ecosystem and potentially the power plant beneath it that runs the city. It's up to Ash Cilan Iris the Pokemon Hills director Eric and Mewtwo to put a stop to it.The Genesect's motivation at the beginning of the film is clearly established they've been fossils for 300 million years and have been woken up by Team Plasma and weaponized. This is clear enough but having the Team Plasma scientists play a bigger role could have greatly enhanced what is a middling entry in the series.Mewtwo's appearance in this film is understandable given that they wanted to advertise its mega form. What was unnecessary however was erasing the relationship Ash and Mewtwo built up through two movies plus several other appearances. The way Mewtwo and Genesect's conflicts were resolved were also very unclear. Overall this is a passable film and one I'd put around the middle of the Pokemon pack. It didn't take full advantage of its unique setting but it did shed some light on Genesect a Pokemon that even in the games is very mysterious.".

It didn't take full advantage of its unique setting but it did shed some light on Genesect a Pokemon that even in the games is very mysterious.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was a fairly decent Pokmon movie. This is hardly up there with the best ones but it's at least a vast improvement over the fiasco that was Kyurem vs. The Sword of Justice.I thought the premise was kind of interesting. I liked the dynamic with the Genesect having been created the same way that Mewtwo was. Not a bad way of using the clich of machines created by humans turning into monsters.The animation and GCI are topnotch and the scenery is really nice in a setting that is based off Manhattan. The action scenes were also pretty good and it was nice to see Ash's Charizard again.However there are lots of flaws. Of course I didn't think there was any need for another movie involving Mewtwo and I have no idea why Mew has a female voice in this film. It was kind of strange how Mewtwo just suddenly started caring about humans during the climax of the film.The baby Genesect was kind of annoying with it constantly repeating I want to go home over and over. The script has its weak spots and some scenes are kind of strange. Also there's Iris and Cilan.While not everything in this one measures up this is still a mostly satisfying addition to the series. Not really a mustsee but still worth a look for Pokmon fans.RATING B".

	schema:reviewBody "After the cultural landslide that was the cinematic release of Pokmon The First Movie hands up if you've still got a Burger King tiein toy! all subsequent Pokmon movies have struggled for relevance. Lacking in the first film's energy and urgency from being released in the thick of the rampant zeitgeist the later straighttoDVD offerings have largely slumped somewhat  still lots of fun for allegiant fans but increasingly obligatory and arguably not unlike the games inextricably knotted in a formula too restrictive for much innovation. Despite the franchise's motto few would dispute that if you've seen one you've effectively caught 'em all.Genesect and the Legend Awakened sixteenth!! film in the series does not jostle this formula but does its best to breathe some life and gumption into it. Unlike the customary expansive globetrotting Pokmon movie narrative Genesect marks a rare exception where lowering the scope from the fate of the world is at stake! is actually beneficial. We still get the familiar 'thrilling but vaguely defined mythology' the origins of the titular Genesect  fossil Pokmon who have been weaponized by humans?  are glossed over in an infuriatingly quick aside naturally. But after an impressively gripping airborne mountain skirmish the action is confined to a Pokmon natural reserve and the bustling metropolitan city surrounding it lending some interesting consequential collateral damage to the inevitably destructive Pokmon showdowns and making the action all the more claustrophobically exciting. Naturally there's little motivating the plot or conflict but the trappings make it worthwhile. The animation demonstrates a marked increase in quality and is gorgeously engaging in its fluidity integrating more seamlessly with CGI to bring rich texture to the backgrounds.As always half the fun is playing your own game of 'Who's that Pokmon?' with all the cameoing creatures flitting by in the background  a shout out to a particularly valiant Feraligatr thrust into central hero status here. Similarly the Genesect make for engagingly offkilter enemies  uniquely eerie and alien in their fusion of robotic and insectoid tics aided by some creatively skittering sound editing choices even if their respective personalities defined in the broadest of possible strokes verge on irritatingly bland. Inevitably the fun lies not in the moralizing melodrama but in their fighting with their myriad of abilities making for some furiously energetic and entertaining battles changing shape like Transformers ripping through the air and letting rip with concussive energy blasts all the while. And at the other end of the ring back by popular demand the iconic Mewtwo now seemingly with added Poksex change and megaevolution to boot  a more than suitably thrilling and mobile sparring partner. Whether spitting cynical diatribes about creation and denial of humanity or blasting one another the film sparks to life when the two titans clash.It's a shame that the human characters fail to engage even more than usual. Diluting boyhero Ash of his initial whiney exuberance may be an attempt at having the character slowly grow up but recasting him as a perennial Mother Theresa type patron saint of all Pokmon is a far less interesting lead to connect with. This in tandem with the lack of the show's goofy cutaway humour the movies are SERIOUS BUSINESS you know an extraneously shoehorned in Team Rocket and interplay with the particularly drab 'Gen V' Misty and Brock surrogates Iris and Cilan makes the filler character building scenes bridging the action drag far more than usual. As with most anime dialogue kids will infuse the script's hyperbolically proclamative oneliners with their own inspirational profundity it's timeto push itto the limit! but it's unlikely that even the most nave or forgiving of audiences will fail to sneer at the film's climax and its aggressively trite moral about the importance of friendship complete with a 'profound worldview' pilfered from Superman Returns of all things bleh.Such indepth concerns may be a moot point as Genesect and the Legend Awakened comes with a pretty infallible builtin audience. For kids or adult fans of the series there's lots of fun to be had here and the vivacity of the battles and exhilaration of the return of Mewtwo should help diffuse the overfamiliarity of story. To those three underaCrustle dwellers who have yet to either yay or nay at the world of Pocket Monsters this is unlikely to convert you as Pokfans or make even a mote of sense but if the formulaic but fun action and heart on display appeals you like the Genesect may finally have found a home.6.510".

Posing as the woman's husband Kuroda takes the lead with the kidnappers who want money and no cops. However the law requires that Kuroda notify local authorities who blunder a bit. Various exchanges go awry then the kidnappers send the mother and Kuroda to the Amalfi coast on what appears to be a goose chase. Why the delay? What's going on?";

	schema:reviewBody "I guess even coming back from the Tokyo International Film Festival my appetite for Japanese films still isn't satiated. Amalfi is Fuji TV's 50th anniversary film and it's no holds barred in terms of the production values jetsetting throughout Rome with a bevy of star even getting Sarah Brightman herself to perform the number Time to Say Goodbye on screen.Yuji Oda stars as what looked to be on the surface as an uncomfortable career diplomat though I'd like to think of his character here as a behindthescenes clandestine operative sent around the world to provide various Japanese embassies that oversight into major events their diplomats are organizing or attending. It's been some time since I last saw a Yuji Oda film the last I believe being very long ago with the Bayside Shakedown 2 film and he's visibly aged here with no hint of a betrayal to the more quirky Aoshima character then versus a nononsense serious role here.Caught up in between a kidnapping of a Japanese girl and his actual mission in shadowing the ministerial visit his Kurodasan becomes drawn toward the plight of a single mom Saeko Yuki Amami who had lost her daughter Madoka Ayane Omori while out touring Rome. Sworn to render assistance to all Japanese citizens overseas regardless of rank and title he takes it upon himself albeit quite reluctantly given his more pressing diplomatic matters to assist in what seemed like a simple extortion case but one which will unravel itself to reveal a somewhat convoluted plot of a larger conspiracy involving retribution vengeance and the seeking of justice.I was very much drawn towards Yuji Oda's character as a man torn between duty and good sense to help a fellow citizen in a strange land. Very much like his Bayside Shakedown films which examine the perennial tussle between beat cops and its internal bureaucracy Amalfi also provided a sneak peek into the lifestyle of diplomats overseas who live under the graces of its citizen's taxes back home and it presented itself as a commentary and a demonstration on the extravagance led by the diplomatic corps where anything budgeted should be maxed out and in some instances allowed to go beyond allocation too.The plot though did require some suspension of disbelief given what you would expect necessary for all the disparate incidents to come converging toward each other as the narrative progressed. There are moments which do seem a little farfetched especially when it has to do with security processes within restricted environments and how anyone could go away scot free after causing what could become an international disaster.Being a film to celebrate an anniversary no effort got spared in the production front. There's even Sarah Brightman lending her vocals in a scene designed to do just that. On the whole it's a relatively entertaining investigative thriller running around Rome much like what Angels and Demons did.".

Thrillers without twists are in minority nowadays so the twists are expected. The twists in this movie did not really surprise me but maybe it's just me.Japanese thrillers usually contain too much melodrama Amalfi is no exception. However when a thriller like Suspect X manages to integrate the melodrama organically into the plot Amalfi does not do such a good job.The movie is set in Italy and at times focuses too much on the settings. Incidentally much of the action occurs in the wellvisited tourist spots and it makes the movie look like a travel agency brochure Top 10 places in Italy to visit adapted for Japan accompanied by Time to say goodbye sung by nonItalian Sarah Brightman. Too cheesy.On the up side however the mystery keeps you interested for a while and the acting is more or less convincing. Watchable for those interested in Japanese movies like myself but no more than that.".

And goddamn puppets swearinghaving sexkilling peopledancing never gets old. NEVER.The film is actually almost 2 hours long but as expected is one which time takes on less relevance. Of course some people are going to see just how limited Trey Parkers voice talents are but having 4 different minor character sound exactly the same is always a surefire treat. Take note that a grand total of zero big name actors lend their voice to this film though Little BchDian Bachar does give a little appearance here and there.The whole film is real. You heard me. Absolutely nothing in this movie with the exception of the title credits and I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. was done with computers. While this may sound impressive on paper on film it's actually a masterful achievement. While Parker sometimes plays into the film's selfconscious aura and indulges the audience a bit most scenes are played out to their full puppet potential. I'm sure this film will be a benchmark in the world of puppeteering for years to come despite it's content.All in all it was exactly what I expected and I have high standards for Parker and I could not have been happier with the result. A second viewing will be needed just to take in all the detail of the film as the sets are lush elaborate and breathtaking scale models of cities all over the world.For those who want to bother comparing it to Parkers earlier forays yes it is better than Cannibal! and Orgazmo but does not quite stand up to SPBLU but only because BLU had the background and the familiarity factor. After a second viewing this opinion could very likely change.In other words if you like this sort of stuff you'll love it. If you are iffy on ParkerSouth Parklibertarian humor then you will most likely hate it. But what else is new.".

	schema:reviewBody "Team America World Police is a great sendoff to one of the most turbulent times in American history and South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone both equal opportunity offenders pull no strings no pun intended with this hilarious and blazingly satiric model of the United States and its supposed role in world affairs.But again what better way is there to remember the tumultuous reign of the U.S. and its War on Terror than to make a movie that satirizes the living hell out of both? Like their previous effort South Park Bigger Longer  Uncut they take chances that no other filmmaker in America is ever willing to take and that is to be as crude and vulgar as humanly possible for 90 minutes straight.Anyone expecting an antiBush treatise like Fahrenheit 911 or a proKerry ad campaign will be sorely mistaken. It's really best that liberals and conservatives both stay as far away from this movie as possible as they both get their fair share of bashing. Parker and Stone have even said that anyone who thinks it should be used to sway votes is a fking idiot. America itself seems to be at the top of their hit list or at least American bravado is.As a casual fan of South Park I understand that Trey Parker and Matt Stone go to the extreme in making fun of American culture and lampooning people they don't like. Already they've gotten fan mail from Sean Penn who is understandably upset over his portrayal in the film as well as several other liberal celebrities who are portrayed as being backstabbing morons.But I'm not really here to argue political bias in this film George W. Bush has got to go come November 2nd in case anyone wants to know and the perfect satire has come to fuel the fire of the most important election in United States history.Team America World Police is hugely inspired by the Thunderbirds marionette cartoons that aired during the 1960s and it shows us a TEAM of Americans that POLICE the WORLD. North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il has weapons of mass destruction and has implemented plans to use them. So Team America goes to work to foil his evil plans. In doing so they lay waste to several world landmarks including the Eiffel Tower the Louvre the Sphinx and the Egyptian pyramids.America parades through virtually every action movie clich imaginable most notably from the films of producer Jerry Bruckheimer whose Pearl Harbor 2001 gets lampooned the worst they even hit Top Gun 1986.There is no question that Team America World Police is inspired and imaginative filmmaking made by two creative geniuses who LOVE to push the envelope anywhere they can. Liberal Hollywood celebrities get some of the worst bashing here with political gadfly Michael Moore playing the part of a hot dogmunching suicide bomber and Alec Baldwin as the leader of the Film Actors Guild F.A.G. get it?. But conservatives aren't off the hook either as their politics of U.S. intervention in every world affair is taken to ridiculous heights hence the title World Police.Team America World Police is a brilliant satire of our times of course that doesn't make it safe from the detractors who claim that Parker and Stone are irresponsible morons. Indeed there are smarter ways to approach such sensitive material but Parker and Stone aren't intellectuals who are out to change the world they're just two guys who like to fool around and make people laugh.Team America World Police  1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is crude rude politically incorrect but hell yeah a whole lot of fun! Well what do you expect from the makers of South Park? The setting of the movie is Today  in the wake of 911 and of transnational terrorism. Team America's the world police equipped with Thunderbirdslike firepower and fancy transportation whose mission is to strike at terrorists around the world. And what more the main baddie's North Korea's Kim Jong Il and his band of middle eastern terrorist posse with WMD... hmm... a little too close to reality for comfort? This film is so full of itselfAmerica that it gets most of its laughs from there. From location settings that takes reference point from America to the current inane insensitivity of American forces on foreign soil to pointing fingers at bad Intelligence it is all insane fun from the beginning when pandemonium strikes that you start to wonder who actually does more damage  Team America or the terrorists themselves.Another highlight of this movie is the songs! When you first hear the Team America Theme with it's America! F YEAH! you know you'd had better pay attention to the lyrics of songs to come some of which pokes fun at Pearl Harbour pokes fun at filmmaking the use of montages and you even have Kim Jong Il doing a solo number! As with most slapstick comedies sometimes you just gotta spoof some classics which includes Star Wars Matrix and Top Gun. Also if you enjoy MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch then you'll also enjoy the numerous fight sequences in Team America which is just as creative in its decapitations and as bloody.Another infamous scene that got a lot of attention was the sex scene between 2 lead puppets. It's no holds barred puppetry porn. Whatever positions you can think of it's mimicked on screen. Moreover the conversational dialogue that led them to making love is totally inane.Look out for appearances by familiar Hollywood faces and political figures like Hans Blix Tony Blair etc used without their kind permission more like as they're put in really bad but hilarious light.America F YEAH!".

They always have a humanist and oldfashioned naturalist approach to show the weaknesses in the limited and fashionable ideas in modern USA. They do their satire not by exposure but by explosion the ideas blow up in your face. Like when Matt Stone himself interviewed in Making Of South Park says you know we expect a lot of our people but when they show up at the office we're already there and when they leave we're still there you know what I mean and they can see how hard we work and that I think that inspires them to work all the harder for us. He delivers this line with such a straight face that you are lured into a semiautomatic approval of Calvinist work ethics even if you know he's just joking. You might at times even feel insecure about where the satire ends is it a joke about a joke? What does Matt and Trey actually think? Do they come first to the office every morning? You can't even save yourself by rolling the eyes and saying of course not you fool.Team America World Police is a puppet animation which is almost selfevident by it's title. The world police is a small team of vigilante puppets that fight world terrorism. In the opening of the movie you soon see them cheerfully destroy the Eifell tower in a fight against semiticlooking terrorists in Paris... and you get the joke. But when they are critized by Hollywood actors for this act of destruction the critics are exposed as hypocrites that actually work for the evil terrorism of the world. In fact we will see the workings of a 'republican conspiracy theory' turn real. Typical Matt and Trey!The movie is a lot of laughs and makes fun of an endless row of Hollywood clichs and has tons of movie references. The satire is never done plumply. You will listen to patriotic country music almost thinking you hear the real thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Team America World Police is a hilarious movie in both premise and in action. The fact that the entire movie is made with marionette dolls is not only funny but clever. The other great thing about this movie is that it is a good satire of America and just about everyone. That is the nice thing about this movie It should offend everyone equally.The movie follows the premise of Team America having to stop Kim Jongil before he destroys most of world with weapons of mass destruction. The movie is careful enough to make this premise work by adding many hilarious and weird moments so that the movie never becomes truly offensive particularly when is shows Islamic stereotypes. One of the greatest things about this movie is that it takes advantage of the marionette dolls and essentially breaks the fourthwall without the characters ever being aware. This is done by a lot of gags that involve how stupid the dolls move and just how absurd everything is. Sometimes the dolls don't walk properly sometimes props seem to mess up heck a giant statue of Kim JongIl is literally a guy wearing bronze makeup and standing still. This is where a lot of the movie's best jokes come from The design jokes and the satire jokes.But then there is the weaker side to this movie The crude jokes. While some of them work a lot of them don't. Now I know people will say You either like South Park humour or you don't This is made by Trey and Matt after all but that isn't it. The problem is that the crude jokes don't add anything to the movie... and they aren't even funny. For one scene the main character has give oralsex to another man to be accepted as a member of Team America. This scene is referenced multiple times in the movie but it was never funny to begin with. Just because something is crude doesn't mean it is funny. It is only funny if it is executed properly. Just saying crude dialogue isn't funny in itself.Unfortunately the last third of the movie focuses mostly on crude humour for most of its jokes which makes the movie feel like a real drag. Instead of having witty satire and funny parodies in the first half it tries to outdo itself in the final act. For some reason the movie thinks that the only way to outdo clever humour is with non clever humour. Fortunately the first two thirds of the movie are pretty funny and unique. I wouldn't say the third act of the movie didn't have funny jokesbecause it was still funnybut it seemed to get caught up at times and is essentially the weakest point of the film. The intro to this film is also probably one of the funniest moments.The main reason why I like this film is for its originality and how many weird and obscure hidden marionette jokes are in it.".

While some of them work a lot of them don't. Now I know people will say You either like South Park humour or you don't This is made by Trey and Matt after all but that isn't it. The problem is that the crude jokes don't add anything to the movie... and they aren't even funny. For one scene the main character has give oralsex to another man to be accepted as a member of Team America. This scene is referenced multiple times in the movie but it was never funny to begin with. Just because something is crude doesn't mean it is funny. It is only funny if it is executed properly. Just saying crude dialogue isn't funny in itself.Unfortunately the last third of the movie focuses mostly on crude humour for most of its jokes which makes the movie feel like a real drag. Instead of having witty satire and funny parodies in the first half it tries to outdo itself in the final act. For some reason the movie thinks that the only way to outdo clever humour is with non clever humour. Fortunately the first two thirds of the movie are pretty funny and unique. I wouldn't say the third act of the movie didn't have funny jokesbecause it was still funnybut it seemed to get caught up at times and is essentially the weakest point of the film. The intro to this film is also probably one of the funniest moments.The main reason why I like this film is for its originality and how many weird and obscure hidden marionette jokes are in it.";

	schema:headline " America!!! F Yeah! Team America is funny all the way!";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is so amazing hilarious. The world needs more Marionette movies like this. I haven't saw many like this before and many like this after. The script for this film was actually Plan B from Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park television fame in making a marionette movie. Their first idea was filming a 2004's The Day After Tomorrow or 1998's Armageddon environment type movie with the puppets. Since they couldn't secure the rights to the 'Day After Tomorrow' script. They fought for the remake of 1960's Thunderbirds puppet television show script only to get turn down when they found out that the studio that got it wanted it to film it in live action. While the script did go on to become a live action film release in 2004 with Bill Paxton in the main role and a different director. It was deeply disappointing. Matt Stone  Trey Parker would use their notes for their Thunderbirds film and rewrite it as Team America World Police. Indeed they really wanted to make a marionette movie. I really dig the puppet work because a lot of hard work went into it. The film had a troubled time in production with various problems regarding the marionettes as well as the scheduling extremes of having the film come out in time. I give the movie props to how detail the sets were and the puppets being used. It felt like we did come into their world. Household objects were used as props in order. It's fun looking for these items as Easter eggs throughout the film. Honestly the movie wouldn't had work if it wasn't done by puppets. The puppets really gives the film its unique comedic look and style. It's funny watching the puppet move slightly odd. It is fun to watch them get killed off in outrageous deaths or trying to perform actions scenes. It's shocking to even see puppets having a sex scene. The version of this scene in the uncut unrated DVD version is much more graphic and much longer. While it's play for laughs it's pretty pornographic. What made the movie even better is the sociopolitical comedy film about United States political position about trying to police the world post 911. No historic landmark is spared in their quest to take out potential threats to the United States. You can really see the tongue in cheek nature of being overpatriotism while also see the over the top pacifists society of America. The film is an also a satire of bigbudget action films using clichs and stereotypes to get through the humorous emphasis on the global implications of the politics of the United States at the time. Team America focuses on a fictional team of political paramilitary policemen known as Team America World Police who hired an Broadway actor Gary Johnston Voiced by Trey Parker get inside information on the next terrorist attack that is being plot by Kim Jongil Also voiced By Trey Parker. The supporting voice work by Kristen Miller Matt Stone Daran Norris and others were all great in their roles. The film also boasts the occasional musical number from a 'Rent' musical spoof of 'Everybody got AIDS' to 'I'm so roney' sung by Kim Jong Il about how lonely it is to be an evil dictator. The main theme song is pretty damn catchy. 2001's Pearl Harbor film by Michael Bay also gets it pretty hard as there's a whole song pretty much detailing why it sucks Yes the film is very controversy. The film has racist stereotypes sexual derogatory words some gross potty humor and constant profanity. The filmmakers had to fight with the Motion Picture Association of America for Rated R after getting NC17 rating a number of times. The film was recut by a few seconds and rated R. It's really hard to think that this film is NC17. I saw worst animation type movies than this get PG like 1986's Howard the Duck. This movie was at less watchable. This RRating movie isn't for children so don't get confused by the animations and decide to let small children watch the film. Still the film had a really good message toward adults. There is an amazing speech in the end that all comedy and satire but really that speech still is valid to what's going on with the world. Like South Park there are plenty of celebrity caricatures here that can make you laugh your head off. My favorite had to be the Matt Damon puppet. Parker and Stone had a particular beef with Michael Moore and took it out on his character due to 1999's Bowling for Columbine documentary in which it seems like Moore made them in favor of his position when they weren't. The only celebrity that took really offend on his portrayal in the film had to be Sean Penn who took the film as an insult to helping out war torn countries. While I'm a huge fan of his work I did think Sean Penn took the movie too serious. Other celebrities just ignored it or laugh it off but Sean Penn really made headlines with this feud against the movie. It only help gather free promoting to go see the film to the normal audience member. Americans need to be able to laugh at themselves and I found it to be a very smart comedy. Overall Team America World Police delivers the laughs and it's worth the watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is so amazing hilarious. The world needs more Marionette movies like this. I haven't saw many like this before and many like this after. The script for this film was actually Plan B from Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park television fame in making a marionette movie. Their first idea was filming a 2004's The Day After Tomorrow or 1998's Armageddon environment type movie with the puppets. Since they couldn't secure the rights to the 'Day After Tomorrow' script. They fought for the remake of 1960's Thunderbirds puppet television show script only to get turn down when they found out that the studio that got it wanted it to film it in live action. While the script did go on to become a live action film release in 2004 with Bill Paxton in the main role and a different director. It was deeply disappointing. Matt Stone  Trey Parker would use their notes for their Thunderbirds film and rewrite it as Team America World Police. Indeed they really wanted to make a marionette movie. I really dig the puppet work because a lot of hard work went into it. The film had a troubled time in production with various problems regarding the marionettes as well as the scheduling extremes of having the film come out in time. I give the movie props to how detail the sets were and the puppets being used. It felt like we did come into their world. Household objects were used as props in order. It's fun looking for these items as Easter eggs throughout the film. Honestly the movie wouldn't had work if it wasn't done by puppets. The puppets really gives the film its unique comedic look and style. It's funny watching the puppet move slightly odd. It is fun to watch them get killed off in outrageous deaths or trying to perform actions scenes. It's shocking to even see puppets having a sex scene. The version of this scene in the uncut unrated DVD version is much more graphic and much longer. While it's play for laughs it's pretty pornographic. What made the movie even better is the sociopolitical comedy film about United States political position about trying to police the world post 911. No historic landmark is spared in their quest to take out potential threats to the United States. You can really see the tongue in cheek nature of being overpatriotism while also see the over the top pacifists society of America. The film is an also a satire of bigbudget action films using clichs and stereotypes to get through the humorous emphasis on the global implications of the politics of the United States at the time. Team America focuses on a fictional team of political paramilitary policemen known as Team America World Police who hired an Broadway actor Gary Johnston Voiced by Trey Parker get inside information on the next terrorist attack that is being plot by Kim Jongil Also voiced By Trey Parker. The supporting voice work by Kristen Miller Matt Stone Daran Norris and others were all great in their roles. The film also boasts the occasional musical number from a 'Rent' musical spoof of 'Everybody got AIDS' to 'I'm so roney' sung by Kim Jong Il about how lonely it is to be an evil dictator.

	schema:reviewBody "Hopefully I'm not the only person to see this movie and feel a little uneasy at first. It took me a while to decompress to the puppet environment. But after I could emerge myself in the movie I felt better though in the back of my mind I was always just a bit freaked out by those puppets. But this is irrelevant.Matt Stone and Trey Parker usually have some interesting skewed comment to make on our society with their hit show South Park and with Team America I was expecting a huge satire on America's warcrazy antics. While it does have some of that I think it really ends up more of a satire of Jerry Bruckhiemertype films and the blatant American jingoism underlying in them. There's nothing really wrong with that except it ends up being more just a bunch of crazy stuff happening instead of having that kind of comment that the South Park episodes may have.I really laughed my ass off during this movie. The songs like America Fk yeah the puppet sex scene the big speech at the end and the hilarious MATT DAMOOONNN line are just some things that make this a hilarious wacky...puppet movie. As far as raunchy comedies go I don't think you can get much raunchier than this. Team America World Police wasn't as clever as I hoped it would be but it was funnier than I could ever expect.Last but certainly not least I would also like to comment on the performance by one of my heroes Maurice LeMarche who played the voice of Alec Baldwin. LeMarche is probably best known for his voice work as The Brain from Pinky and the Brain and it was great to see his incredible talent added to this movie. It was the highlight of the entire thing for me.My rating 710".

	onyx:emotionText "Well I did like Keroro  Deep Sea Princess movie except for Princess Natsumi's scantilyclad dress complete with her pink seashell veil and Meru was supposedly destined to marry Natsumi Hinata who claims her to be his princess.and again Natsumi does show a lot of skin throughout the movie except for her private female parts including Fuyuki going barechested almost the whole movie while one of the other female leads named Momoka Mois and Koyuki respectively have swimsuits involving some skin but in general no nudity but all of this may definitely bother some parents so I'm not the only one who agrees of course.by the way This anime movie does feel like a a Fanservicey Cinderella story inspired by Charles Perrault in 1697 in France.Again It does sound a bit strange since Western Princesses rarely fall into such a Veilclad niche.so If you really like Fanservice This Keroro movie is for you.

The plot is familiar the details of the revenge rather ingenious.This is actually a rather solid and effective chiller based on Stephen King's memorable short story. Instead of adding countless new themes in an effort to show the audience that they are not merely making a horror flick the filmmakers have added scenes that actually foreshadow and strengthen the ending.This hardly classifies it as a classic but I found surprisingly little to gripe about and actually one or two additions that I found impressive. Christian Slater seems to be enjoying his part without turning it into camp and Besley manages to convey some real human emotions without seeming to reach for the Oscars. In this sort of short movie restraint is just as important as ideas seeing as how countless thrillers just go overboard on a desperate quest for impact. The cinematography and sound engineering stand up to scrutiny and the minor parts are well executed. In short this one works.".

I didn't find it one of his better stories namely because the story early on reveals exactly what the protagonist is planning and subsequently does it. No surprises or twists. The screenplay for this movie does fix this not revealing what the protagonist is planning until it happens though there are a few hints along the way. However the screenplay does still have some flaws. It runs too long a pitfall many movies adapted from short stories have. There are many scenes with Dolan that don't seem necessary. And there are some plot holes like how the protagonist got Dolan's cell phone number.Another flaw is with Slater. He tries REALLY hard enough that he deserves an A for effort. But he's still the last person you'd imagine to be a gangster. Had someone older and more weathered been in his role I think the movie would have worked better.Still there is some merit to be found. The production values are really good  this is one shotinCanada movie that actually manages to make you think it was shot in the United States. And the last half hour of the movie is very good tense and gripping. If you can't find a better movie and have the patience to sit through a soso first hour for a really good last half hour then I would recommend this movie.".

I liked the way our hero was not shown as a superman who just walks and throws people away as if they were pieces of rough paper. This man is a normal guy who is scared of criminals but still wants revenge. He gets defeated by the villain quite a few number of times but still does not give up. Realizing he can't win over them by just using guns and trying to kill them he hatches a plan to seek revenge. And boy what a method it was !! This movie really has one of the best climax in recent times. And the last scene is one of the most original scene I have seen in a long long time. Of course you know what would happen in the end but still you would like to watch it. Definitely recommended !!!".

Despite getting protection from the FBI Dolan manages to murder her and Robinson goes on a quest for revenge. But Dolan's car a Cadillac is a fortress in itself armored and bulletproof so Robinson must think of something special.Comments A rather bad movie that actually is rather hard to put into a genre. It got a little action but not enough to make it an action. It is probably supposed to be a thriller but it doesn't got much of suspense. And it certainly isn't a romance comedy or drama. It got a little of everything but it is nothing in the end.The story is very simple and divided into three parts. First the setup. Show the happy couple kill the girl and give proper motivation for Robinson's quest. Then the plot. This is where Robinson plans his special revenge which plays out by him working as a roadworker. Not very exciting at all. And last the revenge. Which is not very exciting either because it is very single sided. Oh I'm sure Robinson got a kick out of it but to watch it. Nah.Unfortunately but not very surprising the acting is nothing to remember either. Well I suppose there wasn't much to do with the material at hand but still. The cast is mostly unknown to me at least with the exception of Slater. I have higher expectations on him although his recent work doesn't promise much. Vaugier was the only one that showed some promise and I hope she gets another shot.In conclusion not a good movie but not too bad either.

I mean the movie The Watchmen made it into the theaters didn't it? or The Spirit? Now those were a waste of time in my opinion. I love Christian Slater and he did an excellent job portraying an evil bastard that you love to hate. As said on another comment it's not a huge blockbuster but it is definitely a good watch and I would recommend it. Perhaps you need to be a little morbid to enjoy it as much as I did but it needs to get the recognition that it deserves. Just because the trailer shows a lot of the movie doesn't mean you know everything. Trust me I was surprised at the end. I give it a 2 thumbs up!".

I didn't even realize they'd made a movie out of what is I shiite thee not one of my top 3 favorite Stephen King stories of all time but I saw it had Christian Slater and Blackheart from Ghost Rider and...gravy.Honestly I bought the movie thinking that Slater was the protagonist so imagine my shock when I found out he was playing Dolan. When I read the story as a kid I think I imagined Dolan as more of a Robert DiNiro Al Pacino or even Mickey Rourke. Given those biases I really had a hard time buying Slater as Dolan. At first. However I really saw him come into his own in those scenes where he's looking at the girls the very end in the Caddy and some of his sleazier moments. Still I think that Slater was a little too younglooking to portray a gangster.I'll agree with most other reviewer's assertions that the last third was the best part. But I will add that even if the rest of the movie completely sucked it was still worth it to see those two play out the final scene that Stephen King painted years ago. The scenes where Richardson stood screaming at his shredded gloves was right out of my imagination. Fantastic.In short I give about 15 minutes of this movie a 4 and the rest a 9 so it averages out to an eight. Definitely worth the 5 I paid for it by easily a factor of four.".

Uh Jeff I got some bad news....From a Stephen King short story of the same name from the 1993 collection Nightmares and Dreamscapes screenwriter Richard Dooling misses the point completely and somehow thinks he can improve on a writing legend's plot elements  much like the rewriters of THE SOUND OF THUNDER 2005 had the brass balls to think they could improve on a Ray Bradbury story. DOLAN'S CADILLAC  a straighttoDVD release  is another great Stephen King story wasted onto the small screen.Robinson Wes Bentley and wife Elizabeth Emmanuelle Vaugier are a regular Las Vegas couple whose life is upended when Elizabeth witnesses humantrafficker Dolan Christian Slater execute people in the Nevada desert. Dolan has her killed. Robinson gets revenge in a very unique exacting way.Dolan is chauffered around in a bulletproof Cadillac as fortified as a tank. In the short story Robinson uses this fact to entomb Dolan in a highway grave the first person narrative pathologically taking us through the meticulous lifeplanning and interesting physics of devising the trap. In the book the arc of descent becomes a blueprint for Robinson's subterranean trap and a metaphor for his psychological and physical deterioration. While in the movie the arc of descent is something that Dolan pulls out of thin air while standing at a pee trough. Was that the writer's subliminal message to us? I'm URINATING ALL OVER STEPHEN KING! King's characters are efficiently made twodimensional by leaden Wes Bentley whose terrifically vapid performance in GHOST RIDER must have scored him this role and Christian Slater getting drunk on Jack Nicholson not Daniels. The highway trap is merely a flat drop covered with tarpaulin. No science required.In trying to extend King's story to movie length instead of inserting all those interesting master plan elements which would have drawn out the time compellingly screenwriter Dooling puts in banalities Robinson buying a Dirty Harry gun Dolan extending his trafficking to children Chinese mobsters an FBI guy Al Sapienza from THE SOPRANOS and loads of black mascara for Wes Bentley in lieu of acting.To hear director Beesley speak of his filmic debacle in the DVD Featurette is to wonder whether he has ever viewed his own film ...extremely entertaining... a great ride... a Saturday night popcorn movie... And here's the one that made peanuts fly out of my nose At its heart it's very much an art film. Choke. Gasp. Bwohahahahahaha!King's story was an homage to Edgar Allan Poe's The Cask of Amontillado in subtle disturbing ways story described in detail how Dolan's highway grave could never be discovered. Beesley's movie gives us a scene of Robinson shifting a final stone slab into place over Dolan's screaming face for the sole reason to echo Poe's and King's words For the love of God no! But this final homage is Beesley's final illogical mistake. The manner in which Beesley's trap is built is rife for discovery by authorities the final stupid stone over Beesley's own face.Poe and King have assured themselves their places in history. Beesley has assured himself a career at the Shell GasNGo.Fill 'er up please Jeff.".

I'm not going to moan about how the film isn't better than the book cause it's never is but what i will say is that my friend must of got confused during the final parts.The main character Robinson takes up a job on the highways to get a grip of the machinery which he'll be using to execute his plan. This also involves him creating a illusionary canvas and setting up a false detour. I know all this because i've read the book however the film does such a awful job showing the characters emotions and there purposes that i'll warn you not to get upset when you find yourself lost.Long story short film is a mess. Bently at times was laughable Slater had no swagger and Robinson's Partner was idiotic. I dunno i loved the story but even if had never read it before setting eyes on the film it wouldn't of made much difference.".

I then contemplate an elaborate scheme that has so many flaws that only a person in the industry could point out. Shame on Christian Slater although I always enjoy his attempt to never change his haircut in the last two decades and Stephen King for this nightmare idea based on his short story.Many times on the job when I am working really hard I wonder how my face gets so dirty not really it is the 21st century...labor is over...if a machine can't do it it doesn't get done. I then ponder why I am shovelling dirt straticically staged in front of a backhoe with such great effort one shovel at a time for hours...if not days while a perfectly capable machine is sitting there eager to reduce hours and days of work.One of the many riveting parts of this masterpiece is a lesson. When trapped in a vehicle with overburden material being placed from abovesoil in this case and all four 4 sides of your Cadillac Escalade 2007  2010 model trapped in a vertical hole approximately 10' deep rectangular with absolutely no vertical deficiencies and there is only one escape route up what do you do?

My stomach churns with disgust. Honestly I was hoping for a True Romance performance from Christian and a American Beauty performance from Billy Badass Aka  Construction WorkerSchool TeacherMurdererI ruined my acting career by not only accepting but following through with this role.I applaud this films production and acting. This movie gives hope to everyone that thought creating a movie and acting in a movie was only for select individuals. Now we all know if you've viewed this fantastic portrait of a poetic classic and historic piece that our childhood dreams are now not only possible but can easily surpass the the previous rendering that talents were preffered in the business.".

Honestly I was hoping for a True Romance performance from Christian and a American Beauty performance from Billy Badass Aka  Construction WorkerSchool TeacherMurdererI ruined my acting career by not only accepting but following through with this role.I applaud this films production and acting. This movie gives hope to everyone that thought creating a movie and acting in a movie was only for select individuals. Now we all know if you've viewed this fantastic portrait of a poetic classic and historic piece that our childhood dreams are now not only possible but can easily surpass the the previous rendering that talents were preffered in the business.";

The movies first 30 minutes were so bad that I would not even give it the honor of having B movie status and the rest was so poorly acted due to the directing that you just wanted to shut the thing off. This movie will never make it to the big screen in the US nor will most foreign markets entertain such horribly bad film making. The story was written by Stephen King and is a decent short story but about revenge but the only revenge should be on the audience wanting an hour and a half of their life back.

Bentley and Slater are of course the real reasons to watch this movie and they really get into their roles and make you believe they are their characters. That's a little more impressive with Slater of course since he once was a A list celebrity but you have to respect the craft and intelligence of the two actors and it's obvious the director knew how to get what he wanted out of them. The story itself is a neat satisfying little revenge fantasy with a good visual setup. One caution this one builds quite slowly and you might find the first 30 minutes or so a bit dull. But the first part of the screenplay sets things up quite nicely for the payoffand it is quite a payoff. Glad I picked this one up for a remaindered price  if I had paid the usual new copy price when it came out I still would have been happy.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie totally rocks!! Especially for all of you who fell in love with Christian Slater's performance in Heather's. He has this face that just cannot be duplicated the eyes that grin the eyebrows the wicked voice. But he never could really grasp that perfection again. Oh he was GREAT in Murder in the First GOOD in Untamed Heart Hard Rain Broken Arrow and True Romance OKAY in The Contender Young Guns 2 Robin Hood and although Pump Up the Volume was a little weird it was actually enjoyable. My point is after Heathers it took Slater 22 YEARS to again reach that perfect character. He being the bad guy performed his BEST acting since Heathers in this movie. Very memorable performance. And the perfect role for him. Then there's Wes Bentley mostly known for his dark roles  I mean look at that face those eyes he just screams those types of roles!. But after great performances in movies like Ghost Rider American Beauty Soul Survivors The Ungodly and P2 you will be pleasantly surprised with Wes' role in this movie. He's a man in pain after losing his wife to a killer yet he's kind of hard to figure out. Yeah he's gonna go after the guy for revenge but it's his methods that kind of confuse you. You're actually completely unsure of Wes' full intentions until THE very end of the movie. If you're a smoker you'll want to go for a smoke if you're not you might want a cigarette anyway! The cool thing about the movie as a whole is the fact that there's not fifty characters running around  to keep up with. Just a handful of great performances from beginning to end. And the movie does us the favor of going straight from the beginning to the end without a lot of bullshit stalling or boring periods of time to endure. I couldn't think of anything that I would change or add to this movie. It was moving exciting sad eerie unpredictable and definitely original. No I haven't read the book and I don't intend to I haven't had a movie grip me in this way in a long time and I don't want to chance altering that. I have to add that Al Sapienza who I had NEVER heard of in my life was also excellent in this movie. He has a certain it factor going on and he played his role well. Nice on the eyes as well. My opinion If you like a good thriller not horror with continuous entertainment from beginning to the end then you have got to check out this movie.  Especially those of you like me that have been desperately waiting for Christian Slater to push that bar again HE FINALLY DID IT!! GAVE IT 100!!. Enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "That would be my one sentence review of this movie and the TV show that it is based on but I'll go more in depth. This movie is likely to weird out and drive away anyone who's not a fan or a casual viewer of the series. But if you haven't seen anything relating to Keroro Gunso the plot is not very hard to figure out. The movie assumes that you already know who the characters are so you may be left in the dark in that respect but it's about a froglike alien and his companions saving earth so you shouldn't be in too much trouble. As a film version of Keroro Gunso it probably delivers for fans since it has all of the main characters in it and even a few minor ones. The humor during the film is a bizarre combination of cutesy little kids jokes pop culture references to Anime and well known films and occasional stream of dark apocalyptic creepiness. The deadly serious tone that filled much of it confused me sort of like if The Simpsons Movie was about Homer dying of cancer. But the grim tone of the x marks as well as the many forms of the creature Kiruru filling in the role of boring villain created solely for film version of TV show inspire some aw cool moments. The voice work is serviceable. Standouts are Takehito Koyasu who manages to carry the same detached sleaziness that made his character Kururu stand out as the most interesting in the TV show and Haruna Ikezawa as Momoka which isn't really surprising for those who've seen the series. As for Gunso himself Kumiko Watanabe screams and wildly acts which promises to be a fun portrayal but as in the TV series there is some sort of passive blandness to our main character probably due to his 3note personality. So the movie manages to translate the series to the silver screen fairly unchanged. Like the show it is diverting and fun but goes by so fast and leaves such little impression it's hard to care. Watch it with beer and friends and it can pass the time assuming you and your friends are alcoholic otakus.EDIT2008 Wow this review is horrible. I did it when I was like up at 300 in the morning but that doesn't make it any more tolerable. I still stand by most of these opinions but JEEZE my writing style was godawful. Turn away folks.".

How come Timmy when raised from the dead staggers around like your runofthemill zombie while little Gage actually seems smarter and suddenly knows how to operate a telephone? It's all very sloppily done. In fact the only explanation at all for why the cemetery does what it does is that the ground is sour. Sorry but that doesn't really cut it for me. If the movie had focused more on the mystery of the cemetery it would have been a fantastic thriller. Unfortunately it ditches the interesting stuff and instead turns into a Tales of the Crypt episode about a crazy toddler with a knife.Of course there's still a lot to like about this movie. If it's main intention is to scare you it certainly does it's job. The scene with Zelda is one of the scariest things I've ever seen and the death of Gage is very upsetting and hard to watch. The mysterious Judd is arguably one of the coolest movie characters of all time and to be honest I was so upset when he died I completely lost interest in the rest. And while at first it seems a bit odd for a zombie with half his head missing to be the comic relief somehow it works. But even though it has its good parts not nearly enough attention is given to the intriguing premise and it ultimately turns into a cheesy spook story.

	schema:reviewBody "In the trivia section for Pet Sematary it mentions that George Romero director of two Stephen King stories Creepshow and The Dark Half was set to direct and then pulled out. One wonders what he would've brought to the film as the director Mary Lambert while not really a bad director doesn't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of King's novel of which he wrote the screenplay. There are of course some very effective grotesquely surreal scenes mainly involving the sister Zelda likely more of a creepout for kids if they see the film and the casting in some of the roles is deadperfect. But something feels missing at times some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably Kinglike atmosphere which is in this case about as morbid as you're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in who knows if he'll save that for his final novel... As mentioned though some of the casting is terrific notably Miko Hughes as Gage Creed the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80's horror movie to being a little monster I say that as a compliment of course especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel. And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters who plays this old secretive man with the right notes of underplaying and doom in tone. And applause goes to whomever did the makeup on Andrew Hubatsek. But there are some other flaws though in the other casting Dale Midkiff is good not great as the conflicted disturbed father figure Creed and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just didn't work for me at all.In terms of setting up some chilling setpieces only a couple really standout a certain plotthickening moment not to spoil it does involve a cool Ramones song and the first visit to the pet sematary the bigger one including the sort of mystical overtones King had in the Shining. For the most part it's a very polished directing job though it could've been made even darker to correspond with the script. If thought out in logical terms albeit in King terms it is really one of his more effective works of the period. But it doesn't add up like it could or should. Still it makes for a nifty little midnight movie.".

Along with him is his wife Rachel and their two kids Ellie and Gageas well as Ellie's cat Church. Soon they met their new neighborand old man named Judd Crandall.Judd not only warns Louis and Rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their housethat is constantly a way used by big trucks but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house. Judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery but Rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children since she has traumas from her sister Zelda's death.During the first week of the family in the new house Louis already has dead people to deal with Victor Pascow a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident addresses his dying words to Louis personally even though the two men are strangers. On the night following Pascow's death Louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets Pascow who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns Louis to not go beyond no matter how much you feel you need to. Louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles. Anyway he dismisses the dream. Many strange things starts to happen and Church Ellie's cat dies while walking on the highway. Louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about Church's death with Ellie but Judd sympathizing with him Jud takes Louis to the pet cemetery supposedly to bury Church. But instead of stopping there Jud leads Louis farther on a frightening journey to the real cemetery an ancient burial ground that was once used by the Micmac '...Indians...'. There Louis buries the cat on Jud's instruction with Jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life. And that is where the real horror story begins...I personally find this movie very good. It's not THE most horrifying of all but it is one of the best horror movies I watched. The way Gage dies is almost impossible to not stay in your memory specially being a toddler. It's cool to see Stephen King's cameo as the minister of the funeral.Of course there are some script errors How can a rich doctor with two small kids goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house? How Gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck? Why Louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters? Things like that doesn't make any sense but I can understand that all horror's scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work.A good thing I saw in this movie is the necessity to talk about death with the children no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist and also that avoiding important subjects doesn't help anything. Because of Louis being afraid to be honest with Ellie confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn't be back again all the nightmare began.".

It's cool to see Stephen King's cameo as the minister of the funeral.Of course there are some script errors How can a rich doctor with two small kids goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house? How Gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck? Why Louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters? Things like that doesn't make any sense but I can understand that all horror's scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work.A good thing I saw in this movie is the necessity to talk about death with the children no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist and also that avoiding important subjects doesn't help anything. Because of Louis being afraid to be honest with Ellie confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn't be back again all the nightmare began.";

	schema:reviewBody "Pet Sematary is an adaptation from the Stephen King novel of the same title. The story follows the Creeds  an all American middleclass family who move into a house out in the country. The family consists of Louis and Rachel and their two young children Ellie and their toddler son Gage. The house couldn't be better and the family meets a strange but friendly old man Jud who lives across the road. He leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies  filled with a huge amount of animal graves. And just beyond there lies a sacred Indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power. When the family cat Church is killed Louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery  and strangely enough soon after Church returns to life. But there's something evil about him now he isn't the same cat he used to be. And when a tragic accident takes the life of young Gage Louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son... unfortunately he gets more than he bargained for.Having read Stephen King's novel I can say that the book is much better than the film. Not to say the movie is bad because it isn't  the book is just a little bit better. The real strength in this film lies in it's story which is both bizarre but extremely original something that King's stories are typically known for. The script is very well adapted from the story and while it minorly differs in some aspects it's a pretty good pagetoscreen transformation. There are a few plot holes here and there nothing major though. Besides that this movie is actually pretty scary and it succeeds in it's intention to do so. There are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film and I'd have to say that the flashback sequence of Rachel's sister Zelda is the number one. Honestly that is one of the most disgusting disturbing things I've ever seen in a horror film  it's not gory and bloody it's just flat out sickening. One thing's for sure that image won't leave your head anytime soon.The performances in this film were all very up to par and I really had no problem there. This film is actually on the gory side there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there including the shocker of an ending. I really liked the way they ended the film it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive but it worked better that way with all things considered.Overall Pet Sematary is a good horror movie that I'd recommend to those who are fans of either Stephen King or just fans of the genre in general. The story is the film's greatest asset and it's a creepy one too. One of the better Stephen King adaptations I'd say. 710.".

They have just moved into a new house and they seem happy. But there is a pet cemetery behind their house. The Creed's new neighbor Jud played by Fred Gwyne explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery. That burial ground is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when you bury a human being or any kind of pet up in the burial ground they would come back to life. The only problem is that when they come back they are NOT the same person they're evil. Soon after Jud explains everything about the Pet Sematary everything starts to go to hell. I wont explain anymore because I don't want to give away some of the main parts in the film. The acting that Pet Sematary had was pretty good but needed a little bit of work. The story was one of the main parts of this movie mainly because it was so original and gripping. This film features lots of makeup effects that make the movie way more eerie and frightening. One of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back was in fact the makeup effects. There is one character in this film that is truly freaky. That character is Zelda. This particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise. Zelda is Rachel Creed's sister who passed away years before but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the movie isn't generally scary because she isn't talking or anything but the second time is the worst and to be honest the second time scares the living  out of me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie it is almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great scares some pretty good acting first rate plot and mesmerizing makeup. This is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time. 10 out of 10.".

Close at hand...is a pet cemetery where all the dogs and cats killed on the road are buried. Neighbor Fred Gwynne shows another cemetery with incredible powers just beyond...the power to reanimate the dead. Trouble is the dead are nothing like they once were. Although I have not read the book by Stephen King he did write the screenplay and must have remained relatively faithful to his own work. The film has many flaws but is also worthwhile. Coincidence and some muddled flashbacks from the past help make the script somewhat erratic and implausible. The acting in the leads is OK but in the second half really deteriorates. Fred Gwynne is literally and figuratively a cut above the rest. He gives a heartfelt performance as a man run down with time and overburdened with knowledge he should or would not have. Brad Greenquist is also good in his role as a ghost. His character also causes some believability factors. Director Mary Lambert does do some things rather nicely. There are some wellshot scenes of the cemeteries. The peril of the trucks is made very real and she also relies heavily on human emotion that is universal. At its heart Pet Semetary is about loss coping with loss and grief and what are some of the effects of not coping with those things well. The film has many suspenseful moments and although the ending became a bit tiresome  still manages to keeps its mood and message throughout. Author Stephen King has an interesting cameo as a preacher!".

	schema:reviewBody "Making a book into a movie by following the story pagebypage is NEVER a good idea. When people read the book they automatically start making their own mental movie of who the characters look like the places they exist in how the situations progress. And everybody's mind'seye opus is different which is why when the 'REAL' movie finally comes out you're always going to have a tickedoff segment of the moviegoing audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up.All a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see.There is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of Stephen King. When filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying CARRIE 'SALEM'S LOT THE DEAD ZONE or they can be what fans consider to be a gawdawful mess Kubrick's version of THE SHINING the miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS. Although it's not even close to being the perfect King adaptation PET SEMATARY has so many moments of just skinandbonedeep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings. For that we have music videoturnedfilm director Mary Lambert to thank she also directed SIESTA not exactly a horror movie but another freakyashell mustsee you should put on your list working from a screenplay by the 'Manster' Himself and probably one of his better ones.Since the majority of you know the story I won't put you to sleep with too many of the details. Dr. Louis Creed Dale Midkiff has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country. Well almost perfect except for two nasty little details the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back. Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son...well even if you haven't read the book do the frickin' math. It IS a King story after all so no mystery where this is headed. It's not so much the destination that counts here but the spooky stops along the way. Certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery screaminducing life here Rachel Creed's STAR TREK'S Denise Crosby horrific memory of her terminally ill crippled sister Louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger Victor Pascow Brad Greenquist both before and after his death the trip into the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. And that third act...if it doesn't give you a few nightmares maybe you should check your pulse.Good performances by all here especially the late Fred Gwynne as the wellintentioned neighbor Jud Crandall who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up Sometimes dead is better.About the only problem with the movie version is the casting of Louis's son Gage Miko Hughes. Knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this Lambert and crew still did the best they could and unfortunately Hughes at the time was just too damn CUTE to sell his intended role as an evil demonpossessed zombie. This takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged especially Gwynne's death scene.Other than that everything else is still about as good as it gets. CARRIE still holds the title for best King adaptation as far as I'm concerned but SEMATARY is right up there in the Top Five.Still will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story? Not BLOODY likely...for now.".

For that we have music videoturnedfilm director Mary Lambert to thank she also directed SIESTA not exactly a horror movie but another freakyashell mustsee you should put on your list working from a screenplay by the 'Manster' Himself and probably one of his better ones.Since the majority of you know the story I won't put you to sleep with too many of the details. Dr. Louis Creed Dale Midkiff has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country. Well almost perfect except for two nasty little details the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back. Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son...well even if you haven't read the book do the frickin' math. It IS a King story after all so no mystery where this is headed. It's not so much the destination that counts here but the spooky stops along the way. Certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery screaminducing life here Rachel Creed's STAR TREK'S Denise Crosby horrific memory of her terminally ill crippled sister Louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger Victor Pascow Brad Greenquist both before and after his death the trip into the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. And that third act...if it doesn't give you a few nightmares maybe you should check your pulse.Good performances by all here especially the late Fred Gwynne as the wellintentioned neighbor Jud Crandall who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up Sometimes dead is better.About the only problem with the movie version is the casting of Louis's son Gage Miko Hughes. Knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this Lambert and crew still did the best they could and unfortunately Hughes at the time was just too damn CUTE to sell his intended role as an evil demonpossessed zombie. This takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged especially Gwynne's death scene.Other than that everything else is still about as good as it gets. CARRIE still holds the title for best King adaptation as far as I'm concerned but SEMATARY is right up there in the Top Five.Still will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story? Not BLOODY likely...for now.";

However when the family cat is hit by a truck Louis doesn't want his daughter pained about the death of the cat she loves and Judd knows this so he tales Louis beyond the 'Pet Sematary' to an old American Indian burial ground and miraculously the cat is revived but it is not the same old friendly cat... and things get really bad when Louis baby boy is accidentally killed. He knows that reviving him won't bring the same boy back but is it better than not having a son at all?From the first scene right up to the last this film sticks right with the book with literally no deviation. Not a surprise since Stephen King himself wrote the screenplay and oversaw production. That makes a for a faithful adaptation that is pretty compelling but those who read the book will see just how much better it is. Many anecdotes supporting characters and scenes have been chopped off. The overall tone is less tense and the dramatic elements seriously down played. While that pretty much comes standard with most booktoscreen adaptations it is always annoying when the book is so freakin' good!But overall this is a decent adaptation that still keeps certain strengths of its source. 610Rated R violencegore".

I know it's not all Stephen King's fault but he did write the novel and the screenplay so he takes the lion share of the blame. This movie was meandering along until one critical moment. There was the OMG moment that made the entire movie bad. I was going to suffice with giving a general review but because of that one moment I now have to mention everything wrong with this movie.What was that moment? When mushforbrains Dr. Louis Creed allowed his son to wander onto a highway and get hit by a truck. Didn't he nearly get hit when you first moved to the new town? How in the world did you turn your back on your two year old son long enough for him to wander clear onto a highway? Really???? OK so now I'm going to town with all the stuff I didn't like.1. The acting. I see that Dale Midkiff went to the same acting school as Keanu Reeves. All of the acting was poor with the exception of Miko Hughesand I was just impressed he could speak so well for a toddler. I'm used to toddlers babbling even on screen.2. Jud. Jud introduces Louis to the Indian burial grounds only to reveal to him later that he once used it to bury his dog and his dog was never the same. Well Judd if you frikkin knew that why would you have Louis bury the cat there? Oh yeah you figured that Ellie couldn't handle the loss of her cat. What a flimsy excuse.3. Rachel and her sister that died from spinal meningitis. What in the universe did that have to do with anything? 4. Gage. What kind of name is Gage? I thought that his dad had an affinity for shotguns or wire.5. Postmortem Gage. Boy did he remind me of Chucky. Undead or not possessed or not he was still a 25 pound toddler. No 25 pound scalpel wielding toddler can slice and dice people with that efficiency. Furthermore the scene with Louis fighting his undead son was just laughable. He was literally holding the kid while the kid is hacking him to pieces with a scalpel. Come on man! 6. Dr. Louis Creed. After your cat was acting creepy. After the warnings from Jud. After your son butchered two people and nearly butchered you. You still go back to the Indian burial ground as though somehow this time things will be different. You are a moron.7. Dr. Louis Creed again. I still can't get over how you let your son wander onto the highway. That was deplorable.That's it. I've said my piece. I was very disappointed with this movie it definitely wasn't one of Stephen King's finer moments. But I guess you can't win them all.".

Delores Claiborne Stand By Me Misery Carrie Shawshank Redemption The Shining and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT Maximum Overdrive Dreamcatchers Thinner The Running Man Firestarter...and of course this one.Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original.This film has all the feel of a madeforTV movie or directtovideo film...and in fact that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fastpaced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy drawling old man. Overacted. Not subtle at all as his character was in the book.Ellie the daughter was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural.Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters.They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects but set in the backdrop of a badly made film it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered scary is with the cheap hauntedhouse BOO! scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder.Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And as expected beyond this flop she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well except for more music videos and the followup stinker sequel to this film.Let's hope the 2008 remake is better.".

Preposterously stilted dialog written by King himself! delivered in a totally unbelievable and stilted way by the worst cast in film history directed by Mary Lambert who must have been using a baseball bat on the actors makes this a really painful experience. If you have read the book STEER CLEAR of this film you'll probably curse King Lambert and yourself for being led by the nose into this real bomb. I have an idea. Let Lambert and Boll work together on a new film. At least it will give us something to write about here in the IMDb comment boards. Actually I have another idea. This film should be shown to film making students in a class titled DON'T DO IT THIS WAY! Utter Garbage. If King were dead he'd probably rise up just to burn this drek.".

The slim 87 minute running time is heavily padded with inconsequential friends and a pointless cheating boyfriend. The killer is devoid of even the token motivation of Jason or Michael or even the original movie's killer and as a result is never particularly frightening. The police behave in such an unbelievably ineffectual and lazy manner as to verge on professional misconduct. Simon West brings the same attractive banality to proceedings that he managed with Lara Croft but his style of directing is decidedly generic possessing no indicators of real talent or vision. The performances are routine dark hallways replace genuine horror and the scares are of the tired catinthecloset variety.The cinematography and production design however are above average for this kind of film. The house is beautifully designed all dark wood and glassy reflections and there are a few moments that are of visual interest.Though lacking an ounce of dramatic originality it acts as a reasonably satisfying 'dark house' thriller and maintains interest longer than most of its ilk.".

	schema:headline " Beautiful girl nice house but that's about it really";
	schema:reviewBody "When A Stranger Calls is a remake of a 1979 film of the same name a movie that i have not yet seen. The plot is quite simple. A high school chick has racked up a large phone bill and to pay it off has to do some babysitting. She babysits in a real nice house packed full of gadgets in a remote location.Camilla Belle is alone for the most part she's a goodlooking girl and acts pretty well. This isn't really a horror film it's just about making you scared and it does that well for much of the time but at times it can be frustrating. It's constantly building up tension but to be honest will little action and that's where it can get slightly boring.I have a few issues with this movie but that's not to say I'm slagging it off because it wasn't a bad movie with suspense and manages to entertain somewhat. But why the did the Mandrakis' need a babysitter in the first place? They had a maid. Why didn't she just look out for the kids? Secondly if she was there then why not any conversation between the two. They could have at least said a few words and not just the maid saying hello.Thirdly why did Tiffany come along only for a few minutes?. What was the point? and drove all the way up to that remote location. That must have really meant at least 30 minutes or even more she wouldn't be spending at the bonfire party.And why didn't Jill go check the kids more?. OK she did after the stranger's call. But she's the frigging babysitter. Surely she would have had the decency to check the children are fine more often.Plus there was a lot of noise. Phone ringing quite a few times. Jill making noise from being scared answering the phone turning on the TV music Tiffany talking and stuff like that. Might have woken the kids. And finally seems that Jill will be spending more time babysitting after another phone bill she seems to have racked up in the process.But anyway who cares halfdecent entertainment nice looking girl and house.".

There's a lot of Camilla Belle wondering around a dark house wondering who's calling her and encountering all kinds of false scares. It all gets repetitious and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to muster up much in the way of suspense or chills. It certainly never reaches the intensity of the original film especially since it wimpsout and changes one important plot point from the original. I guess we have the PG13 rating to thank for that.On the plus side there's an impressive set design and some dark atmosphere unfortunately there's not much going on around it to save this remake from being subpar. Belle's performance is pretty mediocre too.It's just another unimpressive remake. 12 out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "What should have been a routine babysitting gig at a secluded lake house turns into a night of terror as high school student Jill Johnson Camilla Belle receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker while trying to stay one step ahead of him.The first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good but it was all downhill from there. The remake takes those first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80 minute feature film. That's a good idea because its eliminating everything that made the original bad. However if they wanted this film to work more effectively then they should have hired a better lead actress better director writer etc. There's no suspense everything can be figured out long before it happens and it's a very dull film since not much happens. At least there isn't much to sit through since its less than 90 minutes.If this premise were to work then the lead actress has to give a realistic performance. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen and throughout the whole movie she seemed to be reading her lines. You get a lead role in a Hollywood film that will be viewed by millions of people and you give no effort at all! Why did they hire this girl? Sure she's pretty but she can't act at all yet I suppose this won't matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this film up. The rest of the cast is bland and forgettable especially the woman who plays the maid Rosa. Even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at all.This movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film Boogeyman. That movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and When a Stranger Calls is pretty much the same. Jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid. This type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes the stranger appears. He has to be one of the lamest killers ever. He carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat. The ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesn't really matter. The film is directed by Simon West and he is really bad at building up suspense. He was using every clich he could think of and the results weren't very good. The house was amazing and I'll give the film credit for that. It was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but that's about the only good thing this film has to offer. In the end if you're not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie. Rating 210".

You get a lead role in a Hollywood film that will be viewed by millions of people and you give no effort at all! Why did they hire this girl? Sure she's pretty but she can't act at all yet I suppose this won't matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this film up. The rest of the cast is bland and forgettable especially the woman who plays the maid Rosa. Even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at all.This movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film Boogeyman. That movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and When a Stranger Calls is pretty much the same. Jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid. This type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes the stranger appears. He has to be one of the lamest killers ever. He carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat. The ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesn't really matter. The film is directed by Simon West and he is really bad at building up suspense. He was using every clich he could think of and the results weren't very good. The house was amazing and I'll give the film credit for that. It was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but that's about the only good thing this film has to offer. In the end if you're not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie. Rating 210";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't watch very many 'horror' movies but one night I sat down and watched this with my cousins. Now we're teenagers so we tend to make fun of a lot of things but honestly the acting here really wasn't very good especially at the beginning. One line that stood out was when Scarlett says to Jill and Tiffany This is so... high school! while the next scene shows Jill walking past a sign with their High School name on it... Many parts at the beginning reminded me of a corny badlywritten badlyacted Lizzie McGuire episode. However as the story progressed and the cast moved on to just about only Jill most of the time I was able to appreciate the movie more. Camilla Belle did really well in this movie and I think that the other actors and actresses ruined the movie for her. And I must admit this was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Well no there weren't big monsters and white faces appearing in dark corners and possessed dolls but the thing that made this movie scarier than ones containing those things is that it really could happen. And this movie really reminded me of what really IS scary... We all know we're not likely to stumble upon the living dead any time in our lives but the idea of having a murderer inside the house you're babysitting at could really happen. The only flaw with this movie is that it's one of the most clich movies I've ever seen. It has everything in it that any horror movie has ever had turning the keys and the car starts shadows in the corner turning the corners of the stairs with suspense turning around and seeing a dead body ending a fatal scene quickly with waking up from a dream etc. At the suspenseful scenes it was very predictable but overall I would give it a 710. It's definitely worth seeing.By the way This is my first review so I don't know if any of those things were spoilers.. But just to be safe...".

Right from the getgo from the terrifying opening I wasn't expecting to the chilling ending the suspense kicks in and doesn't let up. Though it was fairly easy to predict who was going to die and who wasn't it didn't make the deaths any less scarier or shocking. The story is simple enough Jill Johnson is your everyday average sixteenyearold girl going through a rough time with her friend and boyfriend which caused her to go so far over her cell phone minutes that her parents grounded her for a month taking away her cell phone and her car. She must pay them back by babysitting for Dr. Mandrakis and his wife at their enormous hillset home. When she arrives it's obvious that it will be an easy night the kids are already asleep and she has access to everything that the house has to offer including a wellstocked fridge TV and stereo and a koi pondaviary in the middle of the house. However it isn't long before the phone calls start. Sometimes it's just heavy breathing sometimes it's a little talking but they don't last for more than a few seconds. Jill finally gets exasperated and calls the police but calms down when she realizes that the family's maid is still in the house. However when the caller asks Have you checked the children? Jill gets annoyed and treks upstairs to find the kids safe in their bed. It's not until two seconds later that the phone rings asking How were the children? that Jill really starts to freak out. The twist about the caller is revealed in the trailer but it doesn't take from the suspense at all. A feature that the house has is motionsensitive lights which turn on upon entry in the room. I thought this would take away from the suspense because you'd know where someone was at all times but it doesn't at all and is in fact used in one extremely suspenseful scene very masterfully. All in all I thought the movie was very well made and I will definitely go see it again. I highly recommend it if you can let go of the improbable premise which maybe isn't so improbable after all...".

Jill the horribly wooden Camilla Belle goes over her cell phone minutes and is forced to babysit for a rich family who lives in a beautiful mansion in the middle of nowhere. It's the perfect job. Nice house to explore children are asleep fridge is stocked. Until she starts getting calls from a stranger asking have you checked the children?. Of course you all know the calls are coming from inside the house.First of all there was no twist ending. The stranger just ended up being some random serial killer stalking and murdering young babysitters. The killer and the girl were such idiots. A pointless waste of time.Second this movie had plot holes the size of Texas. For example when the police trace Jill's call and find out they are coming from inside the house why did they not catch on and tell her that there is a serial killer? How did the blonde friend know where the house was? The blonde friend was killed outside how did her body get in the bathroom of the house? Camilla Belle is one of the worst actresses to ever grace the screen. She was just so bad it was unbelievable. Line after line was delivered without emotion and she had this dumb blank stare constantly on her face.She's pretty though and her all wet in the pool kept me from falling asleep.110.".

Of course you all know the calls are coming from inside the house.First of all there was no twist ending. The stranger just ended up being some random serial killer stalking and murdering young babysitters. The killer and the girl were such idiots. A pointless waste of time.Second this movie had plot holes the size of Texas. For example when the police trace Jill's call and find out they are coming from inside the house why did they not catch on and tell her that there is a serial killer? How did the blonde friend know where the house was? The blonde friend was killed outside how did her body get in the bathroom of the house? Camilla Belle is one of the worst actresses to ever grace the screen. She was just so bad it was unbelievable. Line after line was delivered without emotion and she had this dumb blank stare constantly on her face.She's pretty though and her all wet in the pool kept me from falling asleep.110.";

The movie has failed in all aspects but most profoundly in its lacking of the real story line. The story line is somehow a replica to very common horror movie you got bad man out there and start running around with not clear idea WHY? WHY?

	schema:headline " Slightly better the original...though thats not saying much";
	schema:reviewBody "When A Stranger Calls got a bit of a critical bashing when it was released back in February. I guess it was to be expected since most critics are a little hard on the horror genre in general but I was a bit surprised by the bashing it got from regular movie goers like you and I. It has a rather low 4.2 rating at IMDb and if you go to the message board on the site for this film the comments aren't too pretty. Despite this bashing it didn't stop the film from opening at number one and grossing almost 50 million dollars.I may be the minority but I really think that most people were wrong about this one. It is by no means a perfect film but as a remake to an already flawed production i think it succeeds by being better than the original. Again I may be in the minority on that statement but after watching the original film the night before I saw this I had a fresh perspective.The original When A Stranger Calls was released in 1979  a year after the superior Halloween and was a moderate success based on its heart pounding opening 20 minutes. We've all heard the babysitter alone in the house while a madman calls her from inside the house urban legend and the film's opening toyed with our knowledge of this and did a good job of generating tension.The problem with the original is that once the 20 minute opening has passed the film slows to a snail's pace. The middle of the film doesn't provide any thrills and you have to wait until the last 10 minutes for things to pick up again. If there was any film that needed to be plucked out of the remake box it was this film.The new version takes the opening 20 minutes and turns it into a 90 minute motion picture. This does present some problems because things get tedious after awhile but the best moments of the original translate well here and I for one thought it was a decent improvement.A babysitter Jill Johnson Camilla Belle arrives at the lakeside Colorado home of Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant to care for their two children while they do the dinner and a movie thing. Almost immediately Jill begins to get ominous prank calls heavy breathing and messages wondering if she has checked the children. Eventually freaked out and unable to reach anyone by phone her parents are at a concert and everyone from her high school is attending a bonfire party in a location that conveniently does not have cell service she contacts the police. They trace the call and determine it's coming from within the house.This is a setup that I don't think can get old. Both guys and girls know what it's like to be in the house alone sometimes and get suitably creeped out by every noise creek and motion of our home. the film toys with those fears but generating some decent tension early on. Some might get bored by the numerous scenes of Jill just walking around the house but I for one found them necessary to lead up the slambang final 20 minutes. It does get a little repetitive after awhile but for the most part it works.The house is also a character in and of itself. Glass houses tend to be creepy to me in general but since this home is in the middle of nowhere and is grand in stature it tends to be even more frightening. The production designer should be proud of this creation because it's truly something.The final 20 minutes are also noteworthy. After all the build up we're rewarded with a nice game of cat and mouse between the Stranger and Jill. It helps that we see very little of him since he's mostly shown in shadow thus making him truly more creepy. You can tell the original concept of Michael Myers from the first Halloween is a model for this stalker and if you're going to imitate someone it might as well be the best of the bunch.The film truly falters on one major level and it's enough for me to bring the grade down to something just slightly above average. The performance of Camille Belle really drags the film down. I haven't seen her other films but she seems out of place here. Her interpretation of Jill is too juvenile and she cannot carry the film on her little shoulders. She seemed amateur throughout most of the film. She redeems herself a bit during the final 20 minutes but by that point it's too late to truly save her performance. Since we're left alone with her for much of the running time she has to win our sympathy and she doesn't. I got into the film merely because i kept wondering what i would do in that situation and not because I particularly cared about her.Despite this When A Stranger Calls is suitable entertainment. It's not the new horror de jour and it certainly won't go down as a classic by any means but it is better than the source material and for that reason alone I think you should give this film a bit of a chance before you dismiss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "While i read all of the complaints about this movie before i saw it i still had interest from the preview. I don't know if it was because i was expecting a bomb or what but i really enjoyed the movie. The I was not very frightened at all until the second half of the movie but even then it wasn't very bad at all. I think that most of the scenes and false alarms were realistic if a little too coincidental but it was necessary to move the story along. I think that the house and surrounding area is the perfect setting for this type of movie it is beautiful and huge but then the same qualities that are attractive become scary. I also think that the light arrangement worked extremely well because not only did they turn on upon entry but there was no way to keep them on so the house stayed dark outside of the small section Jill was in.Speaking of Jill i thought her part was acted pretty well at first it wasn't as believable but after a few phone calls it was fine. In fact the scenes where she is frightened are acted perfectly. And finally someone got the fire poker right. I can't tell you how many times when i hear a noise at my house i grab the fire poker and it was a nice touch for her to do the same even though she idiotically forgets it when she needs it most.In regards to the plot holes the movie is not perfect but almost every hole can be explained and part of the mystery is how he got in..exactly how long was he watching her? how did he get out to kill her friend? and when exactly did the gardener die? overall i enjoyed it and i was surprised how quickly it went. It kept my attention and i wanted to see how it ended although the ending was very brief and left a bad taste in my mouth. My only complaint other than the ending was the lack of character development. They could have added ten minutes with her and her friends or something to make us feel bad for her situation more to give us a taste of her personality and to give us foreshadowing to how she will handle the situationfor example the scene where she debates whether to go back for the kids it looks like some scene is missing at the beginning that talked about her only caring about herself or something.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I was 16 when this released and I saw it without knowing anything about the plot and I had a crush on the very pretty and cute Camilla Belle after seeing the movie. So this is one of my ultimate guilty pleasures and I will always love this film. This was coming on TV the other night and I just saw it again for the 6th time without a second thought. I hope you will watch it without any preconceived bad false notions about it.Jill Johnson Camilla Belle is a high school girl who is on the track team and one of her best friend has kissed her boyfriend. So she breaks up with him and refuses to talk to her friend. She has also talked too much on the phone like 800 extra minutes and her dad makes her to babysit to earn her money so she can pay off her own bills. She has to babysit Dr and Mrs. Mandrakis's Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant kids and they live in a huge lakeside house. Things start to get a bit creepy when a stranger Tommy Flanagan keeps on calling Jill and seems to be spying on her. She can't find the house maid and the police don't give much thought to her predicament.Though there are many films of this kind out there the studios just keep on churning them out every year. Do you know why? It is because every year new kids step into their teens and they would not see old movies of this kind. So this will be new for them and a babysitter who is stalked by a psycho killer is pretty horrifying if you have ever babysat in a house which makes some creepy noises. Almost every kid will connect with that. Camilla was good in her role though many have complained that she didn't portray her fear very well. Well what do I know maybe some girls don't like to show they are afraid of the killer ring a bell? I am a guy so don't think only girls or young boys will be afraid of this film. The first time I saw the film I was horrified and wanted Jill to get out of the house away from the killer. Now its more like a pleasure to see her and the beautiful mansion once again. That house is huge with all the modern securities and gadgets within it.The opening scene is very chilling and the director tries very hard to give us false jump scares which were quite annoying with repeated viewings actually. The decor of the house was magnificent with the bird sanctuary or something within the house and a beautiful lake outside. The atmosphere is very eerie because of the magnitude of this house. I have to say Jill is a very lax babysitter. She doesn't even check on the kids until the prank caller asks her about them. The adults in the film are not given much scope for acting. Even the stranger Tommy Flanagan is just a caricature. They could have at least given him some kind of weapon to show us how he killed his victims. That's the only slight flaw I found in my first few viewings. Jill's friends are dumb and boring at best. I wanted them to finish their scenes more quickly so that Jill had more screen time without their distractions. The kids were not used properly in the film though. This film doesn't have an ounce of sexual tension which was quite surprising and I was happy with that Many pg13 movies make the actresses run around in their underwear. Don't let the rating on IMDb fool you. This is quite a good suspense thriller for us youngsters.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Jennifer Lopez as Zoe is a beautiful and talented woman who slummed in this movie. The film had a disconcerting incongruity to it from the beginning to the end. The opening title sequence is an animation reminiscent of a 1960's movie. The cartoon of Lopez sees all kinds of things in New York that reminds her of having a baby. The animation segues to the live action of her being artificially inseminated. We discover later in the movie that she made that choice because she had no family since her mother died when she was a child and her father abandoned her leaving her grandmother played by Linda Lavin of the Alice TV series to raise her. And she did not have much longer to live.Both my wife and I enjoyed the movie in the very beginning but it quickly became troubling to both of us. Exaggeration is a standard comedic technique for getting a laugh and this film relies totally on exaggeration. So I don't think they were trying to put down families but the use of exaggeration makes it come off that way. Every child is shown to be little monsters which is not at all true. But they are trying to set up reasons for not wanting children. The disturbing message given by this is that families are a bad thing or at least incredibly difficult with very little reward. This theme is vocalized by the playground dad Anthony Anderson who tells Stan Alex O'Laughlin that raising kids is Awful awful awful awful then momentarily incredible followed by awful awful awful. Zoe Lopez goes to a single mother's support group where later she and Stan witness a live birth in a plastic pool of water. Exaggeration is used for the comedic effect yet the resulting message is that child birth is a horrible experience that no woman should ever have to go through. This scene was the most repulsive scene in the movie and the lowest point of the film.Zoe has a pet dog who through inbreeding has a weakness in its hind legs that render them unusable. Consequently the animal is on wheels and the filmmakers make fun of the animal as it tips over in one scene and rolls backward trying to climb up a hill in another. I only felt sadness for the creature and considered the humor cruel and pointless.The main plot of the story is that Zoe doesn't think that she will meet Mr. Right so has her children by artificial insemination only to meet him the moment she leaves the fertility clinic. The story is the struggle of her trusting him to accept her and the babies. But from the audience point of view I found the whole scenario to be utterly stupid and unrealistic. When they agree to move in together they both agree that it was without promise or conditions. She places expectation on him when they are only shacking up together and are not married! Why would any woman go through such angst when no commitment of marriage is given at all! All I could think was that she was a total moron who did not deserve any sympathy. Of course the movie ends with him finally asking her hand in marriage for the happy ending but I found the underlying message to be a total lie that one can enter a meaningful marriage relationship by the back door. It encourages gullible youth especially naive girls in thinking that they can live together before marriage as a path that will lead to marriage which statistically shows that is false.What grieved me most though was not just the movie but the audience. I was appalled that so many laughed at the jokes without offense. The dumbing down of Americans is so bad that trash like this movie would be entertaining. It was a total waste of my admission price. If you really need to see it wait until it is on DVD and you only have to pay 1 at Redbox. My recommendation though is don't waste your time at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Zoe Jennifer Lopez has decided that she has waited long enough looking for Mr. Right to come along before she becomes a mother. Her clock is ticking and time is running out for her so Zoe makes an appointment with the doctor to become pregnant without a man. Within hours of the procedure Zoe meets Stan Alex O'Loughlin an attractive and charming man who has caught her eye. Soon a budding relationship between them becomes a full blown courtship. Then Zoe finds out that she is pregnant after only one try at the doctor's office. She must find a way to tell Stan that she is pregnant without his walking out of her life. Stan is not sure at first but he fully commits to Zoe and says that he is in. As the pregnancy comes nearer to the birth both of them are unsure about the future and their relationship.My Comment The Backup Plan is a lighthearted romantic comedy that shows what can happen in life when you start a family in the reverse order. This movie is funny a bit touching and a family tale about trusting the partner you love and accepting the things he or she does. It is a feel good movie that lets the women of the world know that there are still some good men out there. The women in the audience can relate to the story because it presents the crazy and tough times and all the moments inbetween that women go through during a pregnancy. Jennifer Lopez and Alex O'Loughlin had very good couple chemistry as the relationship developed. Be sure to watch the credits because there are some hilarious outtakes. This is a movie that would be best seen when it comes out in DVD however if you want to see Jennifer and Alex on the big screen go ahead. CBS Films Run Time 146 Rated PG13 510".

	schema:reviewBody "The times aren't easy for Jennifer Lopez. She still looks good she might have a great voice and a killer body but first her label drops her and then she stars in a movie that's so terrible it could simply not exist.Let's start off with the plot which is I'll be first to admit it not that bad. A single woman gorgeous and sweet decides to go in vitro since she's always wanted a baby and we all know how hard it is to find the right guy apparently. And then she meets her prince charming about 10 minutes after being done with the procedure. Fine with me nowhere did it say that the movie has to be realistic. Other than that the movie touches an interesting issue  when you're single and you want a baby but there's nobody to make it with you how do you make your love life and your dreams coexist? But then the unrealistic situations start to pill up. All the funny moments are already shown in the trailer. And the movie itself even though it starts interesting gets completely out of hand  long and weird making no sense finally embarrassing and even disguising. The moment I personally gave up was when one of the ladies gives birth in the pool poops while doing it and one of the women scoops it out with a fishnet  or was it when Lopez passes out into the pool and then instead of taking a shower like any sane person would do decides to take a walk? Acting is not even embarrassing  it's non existent. You'd think that after so many attempts to act Lopez would finally learn a trick or two maybe even become an actress instead her movie dog is better at acting than she is or I think it's safe to say will ever be.But the thing that bothered me the most is  aren't we all tired of silly romantic comedies packed with unrealistic situations that never happen? Cute hunky men don't just get into the same cab as you and then madly fall in love with you and decide to stick around even though you're pregnant with a guy you don't even know. They don't drive their tractors semi nude. They don't make love to you in a barn full of cheese. That just doesn't happen and I'm completely serious when I say that even Sex and the City 2 was far more realistic than The Backup Plan not to mention a lot more fun.".

I knew I was in trouble meaning I was NOT going to laugh very much after the intro scene between the two main characters JLo and Stan. The whole cab thing...excuse me? You have at least 5 other cabs driving around behind them and they couldn't each simply flag another one down? Or at least make a comment about it? I found it rude that she scarfs down all the muffin samples and when the Muffin Lady calls her on her stuff she DOESN'T even buy one? Just walks away? Rude!He was dressed too tacky on that first date. She drank wine during dinner! Hellloooo! You may be pregnant and you're drinking? And later on in the movie when the pregnant buddies got together to celebrate with champagne? Huh? What kind of writing is this? Bad. Also bad writing was evidenced by the fact that we never know exactly what the relationship is between him and the Muffin Lady till way into the movie. Wouldn't the Jlo character be at least a LITTLE curious as to the status of this woman given her initial reaction? Wouldn't you ask that on a first date? Unbelievable.At her grandma's wedding Jlo's character is constantly using the cell phone. Rude. Also rude was dipping all that bread in Stan's stew and then wiping her face with another piece of bread. That was not cute only gross. Ewww....he should have taken one look and dropped her like a hot potato.By the end of the movie which was horribly predictable I was just sitting there sadly shaking my head. The whole premise was unrealistic that a great looking guy is going to stick around after finding out the woman he's dating is having twins. That aren't his. For what?I say stay away. Sure Lopez looks beautiful but that's about it. Oh wait a minute the birthing scene was rather chuckleworthy.".

The idea of falling in love getting married and having a baby not necessarily in this order could have worked with a better screenplay. However the situations and characters are too stupid to work. Zoe is described as a former successful executive but her character seems to be a housewife fan of melodramatic soapoperas. Stan is a guy trying to reach an objective in life through the study at night and Zo's character has nothing positive to keep a steady relationship out of time. His decision of staying with an unstable woman pregnant of twins is absolutely unreasonable and never funny. The writer seems to be alienated from the concept and reality of raising a family.

	schema:reviewBody "...I knew I was in for a long and gruesome two hours. When the doctor uttered I'm not looking at your toenails I'm looking at your cervix I knew it was all downhill from here. What can I say about this movie? First let's discuss how unrealistic it is. Sure movies are not always meant to be based on realism but... meeting a random guy on the street having the guy be weirdly fascinated by you after having met for only what 3 minutes falling in love with each other and finally having the guy so enamored by you that he is willing to be the father to your artificially inseminated children? Just doesn't happen! Lopez and O'Loughlin have zero chemistry. I never once believed that these two people who met on the street were really falling in love. Their fights were hardly believable either and I didn't sympathize with either party. There is also a birthing scene of another woman not Lopez to show how Zoe Lopez how painful childbirth can be but this was dragged out for far too long. The joke was decently funny at first but after several minutes it's like... alright. We get it. Giving birth hurts. After several minutes it's just not funny anymore and becomes uncomfortable. Basically this movie is a load of garbage. I give it two stars instead of one though because I would be lying if I said it didn't entertain me. The dialogue at times was so outlandish that I could not help but laugh. And nearly every planned romantic moment between Lopez and O'Loughlin made me laugh too. But generally a few comedic moments and laughable dialogue is not enough of a reason to go see this film. Definitely save your money and stay far far away from this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to like it. I talked to Alex O'Loughlin about the movie over a year ago I think. And this was Jennifer Lopez' big return to film after a 5 year absence. Both of their characters in The BackUp Plan are very likable. She is a successful businesswoman who has decided she's done waiting for Mr. Right and a family. She goes ahead and gets inseminated. That day she bumps into Stan a gorgeous funny guy who has his own farm note the cheese above and dreams of owning a sustainable food shop. He pursues her she resists. All sorts of clumsy weird things happen along the way. Honestly these characters and their relationship is really interesting. It's all the other junk the filmmakers put into play that I found distracting and distasteful and unbelievable. For instance Zoe has an upscale pet store with a couple of interesting employees who have realistic questions about her and for her but we barely see them. Instead we're subjected to a strange single mother's group that is stereotypical and offensive. It's like the writer and director are trying to straddle a line between a sweet romcom like Sweet Home Alabama and something more crude like Knocked Up. There were so many likable and believable story threads that were just dropped in favor of the gross out scene or something silly that just didn't make sense for the characters. I didn't hate it because I liked the leads I was just really disappointed and not satisfied. I give The BackUp Plan a 6 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Total Chick Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "The BackUp Plan starts with a desperate girl named Zoe who wants  nothing more than to meet the man of her dreams and have a family.  Mostly the bit about the family. But having dated for years with no  results she decides to take matters into her own hands and gets  artificially inseminated by CRM1014. On that very day along comes the  man of her dreams Stan. A cheese selling farmer. He's good looking  charming and after learning that Zoe is pregnant is willing to help  her raise this kid who isn't his. They have 9 months to date fall in  love and have a baby. Her clock is ticking like no other.  So. Having watched the preview and against your better instinct you are  now considering whether to watch The BackUp Plan. And you ask Is  this movie as cheesy as the cheese Stan sells for a living? Let's  start with the notsogreat. On their first date Stan accidentally  spills wine on Zoe while going in for their first kiss. Apparently the  wine they have is 50 alcohol because their candlelit dinner in the  garden turns into a fire. In an attempt to put the fire out Zoe  inadvertently sprays Stan down with a hose and a water fight ensues.  This is not the first chick flick I've seen with a playful water fight.  Actually Remember Me had one as well. I just don't understand the  appeal or the entertainment value. In another scene Zoe and Stan are  standing in front of a kiddie pool with a fully dilated mother  screaming her lungs out in an exorcismlike fashion. Not only does Zoe  belly flop into the pool but Stan gets a nice Shamoosized splash in  his fearstricken face. Disgusting? A little. Funny? A little. Before  women start chastising me  I just want to state that having children  is a beautiful thing and can be very painful. Women everywhere have my  utmost respect for going through what they do to bear and raise  children. But how may times has a movie exaggerated the insanity of  giving birth? From a moviegoer's perspective this has been played out.  I could say the same about a lot of the other jokes. The humor was on  the lower end of the scale for me. The best laugh I got was the  gynecologist repeating Vagina. Vagina. Vagina. in order to calm Stan  down during a visit.  What about the good? What if there something deeper to this shallow  comedy that masquerades as entertainment? Perhaps The BackUp Plan  serves as a litmus test for the acceptance of artificial insemination  in today's modern world. Must the modern woman live life at the speed  of light and battle the pressures and expectations of marriage and of  having children? Perhaps The BackUp Plan shows that a true man  perseveres and stands by his woman through thick and thin and babies   and a real man should. Well then I'd have to retract all my criticism  and atone by watching it once again with open eyes and a new  perspective. Or maybe this is yet another failed attempt at cheap  entertainment because with a 12 price tag it might be a bit  overpriced.  Well if you can first suspend your disbelief that a man is able to  fully commit to a woman pregnant with someone else's baby after just 2  dates. Then if you wade through all the failed comedy bits and the  clich romance then maybe we can talk a bit about the good. Perhaps  Zoe isn't trying to be a single mom because she can't meet the right  guy. Maybe the reason is deeper and is paralleled by her grandmother  who has been engaged for the past 22 years. Maybe I'm giving this movie  too much credit. But what I do know is that there were at least a dozen  people in the theater and there were quite a few good laughs in the  audience. This movie is entertaining  to some. So if you're on the  fence about The BackUp Plan I say just do it. I hope those that  decide to watch it against my recommendations enjoy it. As for me I'd  rather watch Knocked Up again.".

I then walked out of The Back Up Plan wondering what I was doing there. The best thing that can be said for this film is at least there's a Jennifer without the last name Aniston starring in it. Anthony Anderson has a welcome cameo as a playground dad and Alex O'Loughlin as Zoe Jennifer Lopez's love interest Stan is good but what can they really do with this forced unfunny material? There's one scene in particular that stood out to me as an example of how bad this film is. That scene is a scene in which a woman not Zoe was giving birth. The joke is that the birth plays more like an exorcism. That's a funny premise for a joke but they take it way too far to the point where my stomach churned. Also Zoe takes every word Stan says as a sign that he's leaving her. He never does leave her but I would have if I were him because Zoe was just so unpleasant. I found The Back Up Plan to be less a movie and more a brainless sitcom that only made it to the length of 5 episodes. Yes 5 sitcom episodes is a total of 110 minutes so this is another romantic comedy that runs way longer than it should have. Please for the good of mankind skip this garbage and rent a good romantic comedy like Better Off Dead The Sure Thing or When Harry Met Sally.".

A serious drama that is not another thrown together love story that just does not work. If you want to see this wait for the DVD but don't waste your money at the theater you'll be kicking yourself.

Jlo as always dresses well and looks hot even though she plays the role of a mommytobe in almost half of the movie and Alex O'Loughlin is a hunk. Don't know about the second half of the movie but in the first half his character is too good to be true. Obviously this is 'reel' life not 'real' life but you so want to believe in it and you do 'coz he's done a fab job at acting not to mention he looks gorgeous. I wish life could end up being as perfect as in the film with marrying the love of your life who happens to be hot not one but two children when you wanteven though you don't have a clue who the father is with a third on it's way this time you know who the father is and a pet shop of your own. This sure ain't a movie for guys who are into action thrillerhorrorscifi films and all the rest of the boy stuff. Will couples expecting soon like the movie? ummm...not sure!! At least the fathers to be won't. All the cons of having a baby stood out more than the pro's but I guess people are pretty much aware of the ups and downs of parenthood already.".

Dodgeball is vulgar crude and without substancebut your stomach will hurt from laughing and don't we all need that from time to time? In case you really want to defend this film you can always say it features tons of unsubtle criticism towards modern American image of exaggerated healthobsession. Ben Stiller's character is the personification of the obnoxious fitness guru 'We're better than you and we know it'. Opposed to him there's Vince Vaughn as the chilledminded lovable guy who owns a fitness center for the underdeveloped wimps. Due to his financial situation he risks losing his gym to Stiller except if he and his teams of misfits manage to win the worldfamous dodgeball tournament. The film is a series of cheap chuckles eccentric characters and outrageous oneliners. It's pretty funny to hear Stiller yell out lines like 'You're a skid mark on the underpants of society'. Or the alwaysamusing Rip Torn encouraging his team with the words 'you're as useful as a cockflavored lollipop'. The acting is great as it can be with Ben Stiller and Rip Torn who go delightfully over the top and lots of enthusiast cameos Chuck Norris David Hasselhof William Shatner and even Lance Armstrong. It sure isn't Schindler's List but Dodgball is great entertainment and stress releasing.".

	schema:headline " Very silly but fun despite the odd patch of misses";
	schema:reviewBody "Peter La Fleur runs a second rate gym that is populated by nonpaying members who are shall we say on the edge of society. Peter's relaxed existence is made difficult by the fact that a large gym across the road aims to shut him down. When the Average Joe gym receives its final warning from the bank they face a 30day deadline to come up with 50000 or lose the gym to competitor White Goodman. After their initial ideas fail they discover that the national dodgeball contest has a prize of that very amount  with a little help from an exchampion they set out to make it to the finals and save the day.This film came to the UK on a wave of hype and praise but I was a little wary because I knew that the style of humour that it has can be very hit and miss. The film has the same plot that all these sorts of sports movies have and you pretty much know where it is going from the very start but to be honest how many people have come here for the engaging story? No  me neither! The humour is very silly and it will not appeal to everyone but I found it pretty funny with the outoftheblue stuff being the funniest if you find it funny to hear the line 'thank you Chuck Norris' said with sincerity then this will be the film for you. It isn't as consistent as I would have liked because it does have a couple of patches where there are more misses than hits but generally I had a good hatful of laughs and when not laughing I still had a smile on my face.Of course like I said this isn't for everybody and I'm sure many will see it as a juvenile  and it does seem to have been aimed at the young male side of the market. The downside of this is that the majority of the laughs are pretty basic and as we are seeing too often recently the old audience draw of girls kissing is wheeled out yet again. The casting also helps to a certain degree and do help a bit to cover the basic humour. Vaughn is cool and relaxed and although you wouldn't call it 'acting' he is a likable lead. Stiller has a few dry moments but generally his 70's fitness freak steals every scene he is in. Taylor is pretty but you can't help feeling that the film is only using her when for no reason other than titillation she is revealed as bisexual with a girlfriend. Torn is funny if basic and Azaria is also funny. The support cast is more about off the wall characters than good writing or performances but Long Root Moore Tudyk and others are all OK. Cameos from Hasselhoff Norris Shatner and Lance Armstrong are all briefly amusing and just like Best in Show commentators Gary Cole and Jason Bateman do spot on spoofs of lowgrade sports commentators and have lots of great lines between them.Overall this is not the funniest film EVER as some critics have absurdly claimed  it simply isn't consistent enough for that accolade but it is still a pretty funny film if you are in the mood for silly humour and some pretty basic jokes. The use of easy draws such as female flesh lesbianism and physical jokes is a bit of a downer when you think about it but I doubt many will complain when it is on. The cast generally do well and the material is funny and energetic enough to do the job producing a silly film that is hardly memorable but will be fun while you're watching it.".

Stiller plays White Goodman and he is the snobbish owner of his uptothestyle Globo Gym whereas Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur and he is the owner of Average Joe's. The gyms find out that there would be a dodgeball tournament held in a few weeks with a grand prize of fifty thousand dollars. Average Joe's need that money or else the gym goes to Globo Gym. The gyms ended up going and making it to the finals. But who wins? The movie will tell you that. All of the supporting actors were funny especially Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan. If you like Ben Stiller you will like this movie. I rate this film a 1010.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is one of the funniest slapstick comedy ever. Ben Stiller was funny as always and Vince Vaughn was surprisingly funny. Stiller plays White Goodman and he is the snobbish owner of his uptothestyle Globo Gym whereas Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur and he is the owner of Average Joe's. The gyms find out that there would be a dodgeball tournament held in a few weeks with a grand prize of fifty thousand dollars. Average Joe's need that money or else the gym goes to Globo Gym. The gyms ended up going and making it to the finals. But who wins? The movie will tell you that. All of the supporting actors were funny especially Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan. If you like Ben Stiller you will like this movie. I rate this film a 1010.";

First it's a movie about a group of noncompetitive and somewhat eccentric adults playing dodgeball to save a notveryimpressive gym from the clutches of a competitive monopolistic chain gym. Second  Ben Stiller. Stiller is overthetop and hilarious as the evil nemesis of average Joe Vince Vaughn. Vaughn  playing the slightly less than average Joe owner of Average Joe's gym plays the perennial hard luck loser to the hilt. The supporting cast is terrific. Alan Tudyk Rip Torn Christine Taylor and Stephen Root are a great ensemble.This is a rather extreme and rather Hollywood camp comedy. Although a lot of the humor is adult the film is also refreshingly clean compared with the averaged 21st century comedy. Dodgeball also doubles as a spotthecameo film since a whole host of odd celebrities pop up here and there throughout.The first time I saw this film I was charmed and I laughed a lot. Although the film remained entertaining like most comedies it lost a bit of its luster in its second viewing.Why only a 6 rating? Despite the campiness and good solid humor this is still a very formulaic film and it does tend to vaporize after a viewing or two.Strongly recommended  for one viewing!".

By the way this is an R all the way if any concerned parents are reading this. You need a computer to add up all the sex jokes in here and the last 30 minutes are really really stupid. Both of those are typical too. Yet most of my friends said this was hilarious and to check the film out. Prior to the typicallydumb ending are some very funny moments mostly provided by Ben Stiller's overthetop fitness guru White Goodman a man who runs an ultra hightech fitness center. Vince Vaughan plays the likable good guy smallgym owner who is in competition with Stiller sort of like David against Goliath the nerds against the jocks.....another formula that is so often used these days in comedies because it's always fun to see the little guy knock off the arrogant big jerk. Christine Taylor is the token young hottie that you also see in these kind of pictures skinny pretty but not exactly the wholesome type.Rip Torn almost steals the show as Patches O'Houlihan the old man who helps coach the underdog volleyball team using some unorthodox methods. I laugh every time I think of him. In fact Patches puts the added edge in this film to elevate it slightly above a fair rating.A lot of the humor in here is the improbableness of the whole story. Of course it's an insult to anyone's intelligence but that's part of the charm and one does get a decent amount of laughs for an hourandhalf so it's not all bad.".

The rest of the funny parts were stolen right from BASEbasketball the team names the girls dancing in extreme costumes the obscure sports idea but BASEbasket did it more original and more funny to watch. I highly recommend that over Dodgeball.The movie feels like it was a SNL sketch that should have lasted 10 minutes yet was stretched to fit an hour and a half. The actors look like they were given a couple lines and then told to go for it. They look blank at times like they don't have anything funny to say. Basically if you like comedies where the characters and situations are just supposed to be hilarious and they are like The Royal Tenenbaums devoid of any jokes or humor beyond that. Maybe this has something to do with Ben Stiller since he was in both films. That might be the case since I did like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. I was brought up with the idea of comedies to either be satires or had a joke a minute thrown at you like Airplane the Naked Gun and South Park. A movie like Dodgeball moves slow because the characters after they come into the scene and give you that one laugh like the gym owner or the pirate guy don't seem to have any more steam and the viewer is suppose to enjoy it for what it is. It seems to be the new wave of comedy film making and it isn't funny nor makes any sense. The jokes fall flat like everything was improved and nothing was written down. Movies cannot live by improv alone. Take Timecode and movies like that....please. Then if you get the DVD there is an alternate ending that made me laugh not because it was funny because it was so bad. I don't think the director knows how to make a movie. Rawson Marshall Thurber should go back to his day job!I give this a 1 which is the lowest rating I have given any movie. If there was a 0 I would give it for my time wasted. I am glad I actually didn't see this in a theater. I would have asked for my money back.".

Pete's patrons are all losers and social outcasts who find Average Joe's the one place where they can find camaraderie and be accepted for who they really are.

To raise the money Pete and his comrades form a ragtag dodge ball team and head to Las Vegas to compete in the national championships. When Goodman gets wind of the plan he forms his own team to take on Average Joe's lessthanaverage players in a David and Goliath showdown broadcast on nationwide TV.Most of the humor in Dodgeball is of the Three Stoogeshitoneanotherinthegroin variety that works pretty well for the most part even if it does tend to become a bit strained and repetitious after awhile. Vaughn and Stiller have a fun time playing off one another with the former carefully low balling his performance while the latter bursts forth in a noholdsbarred display of manic energy. Christine Taylor is also lovely and fine as the bank accountant who starts off rummaging through Peter's financial records and winds up as a star player on his team. The other cast members are all entertaining as well and the film features a host of effective cameo performances from the likes of William Shatner David Hasselhoff Jason Bateman Chuck Norris and Lance Armstrong who really makes a mark in his short but pivotal and well written scene near the end of the film. But the real acting honors go to Rip Torn as a crazy wheelchairbound coach who uses some mighty unorthodox methods to whip the boys into shape. Torn is the undisputed comic force at the center of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this film because of Ben Stiller who I think is fantastic. This film had me in stitches from the moment it started to the moment it ended. Ben Stiller is great as White Goodman a neurotic gym owner on a power trip and for me steals the show. Rip Torn plays the part of a former Dodgeball champion and for those of you who like physical humour had me in pain from laughing so hard.The story has been well thought out and put across to the audience in a way that everyone will relate to at least one of the characters. It is the type of movie that you can watch without really thinking about it. By that I mean that you can watch it and laugh and you will without worrying whether or not you're gonna be too loud and miss vital plot points. The movie is sheer comedy. You watch the screen and you laugh... it's that simple. All the family can enjoy this. My son is also a very big fan. I know that when I sit down to watch this movie with my son that there are no times when I have to block the screen or shield him from any dirty or disgusting dialogue. Yes this is one for the whole family... from children to the senior citizens.If you haven't seen this movie yet then I advise you to buy  rent it now. You don't know what you're missing.".

	schema:headline " Another Frat Pack movie";
	schema:reviewBody "There was the 'Rat Pack' the 'brat pack'. Now there is the 'Frat pack'made it up on the spot. The 'Frat Pack' consist of Ben Stiller Will Farrell Luke Wilson Owen Wilson Vince Vaugn and some of their friends. These actors have their hold on Hollywood and they basically can do most comedy movies they want because they have can make a good amount of money doing these movies. Other Frat Pack movies include 'Anchor Man' 'Starsky and Hutch' and Old School'. I'm not saying these movies are terrible or i don't like the actors. It annoys me seeing the same actors playing the same comedic parts and the studio expects that just their presence should make us laugh.I'm not trying to insult fraternities. I call them the frat pack because they appeal more to those guys.I always enjoy a good comedy but if the next 10 years is going to be comedy movies like this then i might just watch reruns of 'The Simpsons' or 'Family Guy' for comedy.The game of dodgeball is humorous but it doesn't mean you should make a movie out of it. If anything you should only use this story within an episode of a t.v. show ex South Park instead of dragging two hours of this nonsense.We are supposed to laugh whenever we see Ben Stiller while he plays one of his 'crazy' characters. He looks funny but his character gets real annoying real fast. I liked Stiller at one point but after 'Zoolander' and this movie I'm starting to worry about his future granted he's making more money now compared to when he was funny. We're also supposed to like Vince Vaugn but he plays the same 'takes no gruff' character. The pirate character was the most annoying of the cast. 'HA HA a man dressed up as a pirate in a gym. Excuse me while I change my pants'.This story plays out the same comedic formula as most mindless comedies. I guess when you do a movie about dodgeball then you can't really do too much with it. A lot of people apparently have seen this movie and liked it. So if you like pointless comedy that has no intelligence behind it then you will enjoy this movie. If you like a plot and some intelligence in a comedy movie then stay away from this one.I'll probably skip the possible sequel 'Kickball' but from how much money they made from this one I'm sure they're planning the sequel right now.".

But that isn't all the gym wants to be owned by the annoyinggross and long time rival of Peter owner of Globo gym White Goodman Ben Stiller in I think one of his best roles ever. The thing is this guys are willing to do anything to keep the gym they learned to love that place and they made a bunch of great friends. Anyhow the only way to keep the gym is to get 50.000 in 1 month and that's how they get into dodgeball.. The rest you have to see it.A really fun movie wonderful performances by everybody in the cast I can't complain of anyone they were all awesome! Especially Ben Stiller we're used to see him in roles like There's something about Mary as a sweet good guy but in this one forget about it! He's nasty dumb not the Zoolander kind of dumb this one is actually funny and annoying! But that was the character so I'd say Ben Stiller was perfect. Vince Vaughn was great too funny and the classic good guyhero of the movie I liked him. Christine Taylor was good too I'd watch this movie again anytime one of the best comedy movies I've seen in a long time  12 out of  the half point taken away by David Hasselhoof's came I have no idea what he was doing or why he was there but it was stupid and not fun.".

Even if the mortgage payments were current the club is so outdated that it looks more like a place where homeless people crash for the evening.In a desperate attempt to save the gym Peter hires an accountant Kate Veatch played by pretty lady Christine Taylor to go over the books. The problem is that Peter hasn't looked at the books since Clinton was President so her help is to of no avail.Things have gotten even worse because a rich spoiled brat has built a beautiful gym right next door. The brat is played to absolute hilarity by Ben Stiller who has his own unique way of impressing the ladies.Hint puff puff the magic dragon.By sheer coincidence there is dodgeball tournament at Las Vegas that will payyep you got it 50000 to the 1st place team. Since Peter and his friends have virtually no talent they bring in coach Patches O'Houlihan for training. His training includes tools of steelliterallyto ones face that will adjust them to the agony of being hit by a ball. That part was included during the sneak preview but I laughed even harder the second time around.Two other characters also add to the fun. Gary Cole Office Space and Justin Bateman from Starsky And Hutch play the sport announcers and Bateman isn't exactly rowing the boat with both oars especially after he hopes that the outcome of the game won't be affected when Vaughn's team has to forfeit.For the directing and writing of Dodgeball I was expecting to see the name Zucker or Wayan. Instead the credit was given to some guy by the name of Rawson Marshall Thurber. If I see that name for the upcoming Scary Movie 4 I'll take a chance and see that one too.P.S.

Yes I've got a puerile sense of humour and so does this film. But so what? The story's ludicrous but perfectly constructed. The performances are oft times baffling but just the right side of silly.

These are usually the key words to a suspenseful drama but in this case are applied to a dark comedy that is relentless chaotic and just as funny as advertised. Horrible Bosses is the type of movie that would make Danny DeVito proud as it blends a fun plot full of fun twists with standout comedic performances plenty of surprises and the inability to ever become predictable. Unlike most recent Rrated comedies this film is raunchy without truly crossing the line profane without becoming redundant and outrageous without becoming tedious. Don't look now but this movie is legitimately funny and among the better comedies released in quite some time.Horrible Bosses is about three average joes Jason Bateman Charlie Day Jason Sudeikis that are stuck on their job with awful bosses Kevin Spacey Jennifer Aniston Colin Ferrell all for different reasons. After all three reach their breaking point they decide that their lives would be better if their bosses ceased to exist. What follows is their hilarious efforts in finding a way to get it done without getting caught. The premise was promising and thanks to a fresh script by Michael Markovitz John Daly and Jonathan Goldstein the potential was indeed deliveredalthough not in the ways you'd expect.The cast is handsdown the standout reason why this movie works. As a matter of fact its also its one minor flaw because we have tons of talent that were not utilized enough because some of the performances were so hilarious in the minimal material given. The bosses themselves were convincingly awful especially the alwaysreliable Kevin Spacey as this sadistic manipulative and extremely cruel president of a company. Colin Ferrell and Jennifer Aniston step out of their usual roles and surprisingly deliver plenty of laughs with their own cruelly aggressive mannerisms. The main three also provided plenty of laughs and played off each other perfectly well with Charlie Day being the best of the three. Day's experience with the mildlydark It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia definitely shows off here as his whiny and highpitched voice perfectly matches his character persona and offers the most laughs and oneliners.Seth Gordon's resume as director has been an interesting one ranging from the enjoyable Fistful of Quarters to the weakweak Four Christmases. In here he keeps the pace constantly quick constantly throws a crazy scenario to pit our heroes in and never gives you a chance to breathe and realize how preposterous this movie really is. The movie's raunchiness is matched by its grim sense of humoryou need a dark strong heart to laugh at some of the meanspirited shtick that is embedded in the 100 minute timeframe. In this movie nobody is safe and you never know just what might happen next. Unpredictability is essential in comedy and the best part of Horrible Bosses is how it can remain one step ahead of you while still giving plenty to laugh about. We are laughing at our heroes but secretly we are definitely rooting for them too. Yes folks you will secretly be hoping that they do indeed do the dirty deed.Bottom Line The talent pool runs deep here and is the main reason why the film works. Luckily for us and the cast they also got to work with great pacing a fun script and fresh dark humor that can inject life in this dismal summer season. The underrated talent of Sudekis Day and Bateman continue to quietly shine in Hollywood as they are hilarious from the first second to the closing credits. But let's not forget the triplevillain team of Aniston Spacey and Ferrell which infused even more humor and craziness into the comedy. To sum it up the film works in its dark manner as Horrible Bosses never takes itself seriously but you'll be too deep into laughter to notice the difference. The movie is dark as the movie earned its R rating easily but if you can handle it you are in for a uproarious ride. Keep an eye on this one as it is one of the best summer surprises in recent years.".

The real treat of the film much like 2009's The Hangover is the in the execution. So many aspects of the film come together in just the right way with exceptional comedic timing that you simply can't help but to enjoy the ride.Horrible Bosses stars Jason Bateman Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as three good friends who all have the same problem they hate their bosses. Albeit for different reasons of course. Bateman's boss Dave Harken Kevin Spacey is an egotistical jerk. Day's boss Julia Harris Jennifer Anniston is a sexcraved maniac while Sudeikis' new boss Bobby Pellitt Colin Farrell is a coke head. The film gives the audience plenty of good reasons to hate these bosses which helps to relate to the friends' idea of murdering them.What starts out as an offjoke one night between friends blossoms into something more dark and sinister than one would think with the three friends actually going out of their way to dispose of one another's bosses. They can't handle their work environment and the film's script gives very good reasons as to why switching jobs really isn't an option. This is key in relating to and believing in the script.Despite what the trailers may lead you to believe most of the time within the film really isn't spent establishing the murders. Instead the jokes are found within the concept giving the three actors plenty of time to entertain you. You're not watching three men plot to murder their bosses you're watching three men ponder the plot of how to murder their bosses. There's a fine distinction here and the script does a great job of establishing the difference.Seth Gordon does a fantastic job directing here adding a layer of intensity to the dark subject matter. The script is nearly perfect offering the right amount of dark and crude humor with a great amount of solid unforgettable laughs.Outside of those two concepts Horrible Bosses really shines in two great ways. The three stars of the film Bateman Day and Sudeikis have fantastic chemistry here. The three play off of one another in such a manner that you can't help but laugh. Each is bringing a drastically different character to life though arguably Bateman is still playing the same man he plays in every movie and their interactions are key to the audience enjoying the film. The group truly works well together much like a great ensemble should and we only hope a sequel is quickly greenlit.The other amazing component of the film is the supporting cast which couldn't be more perfect. Spacey is clearly enjoying his dark disturbing role as an office jerk spending much of the film steamrolling anyone who gets in his way. Every so often you can even catch a slight hint in Spacey's eyes that he's enjoying himself. Maybe a little too much.Colin Farrell completely disappears into the role of Bobby. His despicable manners and attitude toward other human beings is absolutely hilarious. He's nearly unrecognizable in the part and it's fantastic to see a role where Farrell is out of his comfort zone.And last but not least is Jennifer Anniston's Julia Harris the sexually harassing foulmouthed and loathsome creature. She spends much of her time on screen making one sex joke after another and it's great to see her playing a character completely unique to her past. Horrible Bosses is easily Anniston's best film to date though that might not be saying much.If you've enjoyed movies like The Hangover or Bridesmaids you'll love Horrible Bosses. It is simply the best comedy so far this summer and deserves to be seen in theaters. It's a mustown once it hits retail shelves. Horrible Bosses is one movie not to miss this summer.Our Rating 4 out of 5 Reels".

	schema:reviewBody "Horrible Bosses is too crazy for a dark comedy. We all know killing your boss is a cruel idea but in this film they're making it a joke. Despite from its cruelness Horrible Bosses isn't horrible at all. It's undeniably hilarious. Too much fun by the performance of the cast. Horrible Bosses doesn't have a lot of gumption to its dark premise but it's all about the comedy. This is just a little comedy that you will enjoy all the time.The beginning of the film shows how horrible their bosses are. It's pretty reasonable why they wanted to kill them. But what's fascinating here is how the main three had a perfect chemistry to their horrible bosses. Especially when it comes to Charlie Day and Jennifer Aniston. Charlie Day made his role too innocent to get sexualized by Jennifer Aniston. He's like a child being harassed by a pedophile. Jason Bateman plays a hardworking man and Kevin Spacey is teasing him like a bully. Kevin Spacey is perfect for this role. Jason Sudeikis and Colin Farrel does their thing.The entire film is all about the laughs and the fun. Nothing else to say about the filmmaking. The movie is just funny. It doesn't have a knack to get serious in some parts. Its darkness is always hilarious. By the way this is a comedy. It's supposed to fun all the time. Yes like even murder is funny.Horrible Bosses is not the kind of film that tries to be the best. It's just a little fun comedy. It's a movie that you'll still enjoy even if you've seen it many times. It's funny enough. It's clever enough. Most of the fun goes to the performances. At least Horrible Bosses is one of those better comedies that we are getting recently. It's just fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I went to see this movie for a friend's birthday cause he wanted to see it desperately. I gotta say I would've been better off letting my friend just in the theater while I spent my 98 minutes peacefully reading a book at Barnes and Nobles. This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen! Let's start with the plot three guys hate their bosses so the best thing to do is quitfind another job? No. Report their bosses? No. Ah that's right let's murder them. The three main characters were annoying and overthetop. They were too stupid to actually be believable. The dialogue was just an endless stream off curse words sex jokes and dirty humor which is typical in comedies these days. Last time I checked comedies were supposed to be oh I don't know funny! The movie also had no heart. The writers wanted this movie to be simply another dirty raunchy comedy with absolutely no substance! The writers could've given the evil bosses a reason for the way they acted. It could've been a movie about understand different pointsofviews and people's experiences but no...it was simply a movie about three guys who want to commit firstdegree murder because they don't their bosses. There was absolutely nothing funny about that concept at all.What's up with Jamie Foxx's character who served no purpose than to be the stereotypical black guy with a criminal record and the street cred. And while we're on the subject of stereotypes let's not forget the movie's ode to outsourcing with the Indian guy Gregory operating customer service for a built in GPS. He saves the day go see the movie if you really really want to.My advice don't spend a dime on this movie. Sneak into wait for it to come out on DVD whatever...this movie was the worst. It was overthetop disgusting cartoonish and incredibly unbelievable. Suspension of disbelief is one thing but this...oh man.One redeeming quality I liked Jennifer Aniston in this movie. Too bad she wasn't America's Sweetheart in this role.".

There were a few funny lines but they were interwoven into a tapestry of mediocrity. I'm pretty biased though because I don't like Charlie Day's shtick. He plays the exact same character as he does in Always Sunny a really stupid guy who talks a mile a minute and if you listen carefully there's a few jokes in there. I don't enjoy that. I don't really like Jason Sudekis either. I find him bland and he plays an extremely dull character in this as well. You could take him out and the movie would still be mostly the same. Jason Bateman's character seems to be aware he's in a bad comedy. He doesn't really seem to like Sudekis or Day and treats all the wacky situations with a sort of slightly angry distaste. I watched Bridesmaids a few nights ago and enjoyed it way more than Horrible Bosses. That movie also had story line problems but it had a lot of funny parts. That's all I want a comedy to do make me laugh. Horrible Bosses didn't really do that for me as the vast majority of its neverending dialogue falls enormously flat.".

I will not say that I did not laugh at all because that is untrue. There were a few times I made audible chuckles mostly because of Charlie Day but 3 laughs in 2 hours is not worth a 7.50 matine. There were a surprising number of cameos like from Ron White that dude who plays Bunk from The Wire and several other easily forgettable performances by famous people I typically like in films. But just because I like peanut butter and mayonnaise and pickles and feta cheese and oysters and raw Kobe beef and orange sorbet does not mean that I'll add all of them in a bowl mix em up and hope something good comes out of it. Charlie Day was alright. Kevin Spacey was unforgettable. Jason Bateman was just bad. Jason Sudeikis was the worst. Jennifer Aniston was hot. So why was this movie so bad? Comedy is a complex art form. Not everyone can be funny all the time. They can't all be winners. Not all Led Zeppelin albums rock the same. This is a case where seasoned actors and proved writers combine in a cacophony of crap and the result is remarkably unfunny. 2 stars for Charlie.".

This is nothing else than slavery. Therefore in many parts of the movie I asked myself if I should laugh or not. Right after the movie presents the relationship between the bosses and workers it continues with a murder attempt story which is another outrageous part of the scenario. I mean should we really laugh at that some people tries to kill others.

	schema:reviewBody "While this has been billed as Jet Li's detour from his martial arts filmography Ocean Heaven should really be known for more than that. This is an intimate and deeply moving portrait of a terminally ill father's Jet Li's Wang Xuechang attempt to teach his autistic son the necessary life skills to survive on his own before he passes away. It is also a poignant tribute to the infinite love that parents have for their children and their unending desire to take care and look after them to their best abilities no matter the struggle no matter the effort.Beginning on a somewhat ominous note Wang is first seen with his son Da Fu Wen Zhang out at sea with the intention of drowning them both using a large weight tied to their legs. He doesn't succeed his son the excellent swimmer unties them both and saves them from certain death. The deed may seem appalling but his motive is in fact humane a single father since his wife's death 14 years ago Wang thinks it may be better off for Da Fu to join him in death than for him suffer on his own when Wang dies.After the failed suicide attempt Wang takes it as a sign that Da Fu is meant to live and so sets out to train Da Fu to be as independent as he can be while looking for an institutional home willing to accept persons with autism. Both these missions turn out equally moving for they bring to light certain truths that we are either ignorant of or choose to ignore. Though almost at the age of 21 Da Fu knows not simple tasks like taking off his clothes boiling an egg or riding a bus that younger kids without disabilities would probably have mastered effortlessly.Watching Wang patiently teach Da Fu the steps of these daily tasks is in itself a testament to the perseverance and love that parents of children with special needs have for their kids a love so pure and boundless it deserves to be celebrated. Just as you will be led to feel vicariously the patience and determination of these parents like Wang you'll also experience an indescribable joy when Da Fu finally picks up these skills think of these tasks like miniEverests and the completion of any one of them equivalent to the sweet triumph of conquering the summit.On the other hand Wang's search for an institutional home for his son highlights a societal gap that deserves attention. As Wang sums up aptly there is often support for the young and the old in special schools and aged homes respectively but little services offered for adults with special needs between these ages. The responsibility falls on the shoulders of their parents to look after them and it is a real concern when these parents ask who is to help them take care of their children when they are too old or frail to do so. Indeed local viewers may draw a parallel with a recent article in the Straits Times that also similarly highlighted a gap in our specialneeds welfare system in catering to adults with autism.Unlike lesser directors who would have tried explaining the workings of Da Fu's mind to their audiences writerdirector Xue Xiaolu instead wisely uses his affinity for the world underwater swimming with the turtles and dolphins as a motif of his state of mind different and yet beautiful in its own way. These scenes of Da Fu's graceful diving in the aquarium where both he and Wang works are captured in a ravishingly lush blue palette by Christopher Doyle's cinematography set evocatively against Joe Hisaishi's score and Yee Chung Man's production design.Perhaps the only missed opportunity here is Xue's subplot involving Kwai LunMei's circus clown turned friend to Da Fu. Not enough time is spent delineating the friendship that develops between the two and the result lacks credibility especially since Kwai's character seems too ready to accept Da Fu's quirks and idiosyncrasies. Nevertheless the film's focus is really on the fatherson duo of Wang and Da Fu and in this regard succeeds tremendously thanks in no small part to Jet Li and Zhang Wen's sublime yet powerfully convincing performances.Yes you should know that even without his fists or kicks Jet Li still proves to be a magnetic actor with his unassuming portrayal of an ordinary man looking out for his son while looking death in the eye. But really this film is more important and more significant than just being Jet Li's first nonaction role it is an extremely moving story of a father's tireless love for his son no matter the odds no matter the challenge. Especially to the parents of children with special needs who have given themselves continuously to the care of their kids this is a tribute to the depth of your love the depth of your heart.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Ocean Heaven";
	schema:reviewBody "The marketing for this film went into overdrive with its touting of this being action star Jet Li's first dramatic role. Unless you count his appearance in a non combative role in Founding of a Republic and the various attempts to balance his action status with more dramatic acting chops such as Danny the Dog then Ocean Heaven will be that maiden effort. Written and directed by Xue Xiao Lu this modest effort is by no means small in ambition having the likes of Jay Chou and Kwai Lun Mei lend their vocals to separate title tracks with Kwai also starring in the film as well as being lensed by the renowned Christopher Doyle.Jet Li stars as Wang a middle aged technician at Qingdao's Ocean World who discovers that his liver cancer is at its 4th stage and a medical death sentence has been passed giving him 3 to 4 months to live. His prime concern will be that of his autistic son Da Fu Wen Zhang because this means as the main caregiver he has to find an able trusted replacement most likely an institution but as any single parent can attest to this effort is none too easy in the absence of direct family support with places like mental institutions being totally out of place and Da Fu being too old for an orphanage and too young for a senior citizens' home. The film opens with a fatherson suicide only for the latter to inexplicably save the both of them and bringing them back to the drawing board.It's interesting to note at least for me that the Chinese language term for Autism is Gu Du Zheng which directly translates to a condition of loneliness. Through the film Wang cannot shake off the fact that this figuratively applies to him being alone in his care of his teenage son for many years since the passing of his wife and not wanting to impose his troubles and issues on others such as his neighbour and provision shop owner Zhu Yuanyuan who undoubtedly has affections for Wang himself. Wang is the classical stoic Chinese man who bottles up his troubles seeking instead to source for solutions himself than to rely on the graces of others although help does come from an understanding boss as well as Da Fu's school principal.Xue spends considerable screen time in outlining the fatherson relationship albeit that it's not quite the norm because communication almost always seem like a one way street. Wang with his limited time wants to train Da Fu in performing simple tasks in looking after himself from cooking to taking the public bus and through many of these scenes Xue has allowed for an awareness of autism to ring through without resorting to overreliance on melodrama to do so. Tasks are to be explained with extreme patience and knowledge imparted through constant rote learning and praising. It's not easy but as any parent this unconditional love is something that's quite innate.Both Jet Li and Wen Zhang share great chemistry which helps make their individual performance credible. You'll for once feel as exasperated as Li since this time he cannot kungfu kick his way out of challenges and troubles and have to rely on perseverance and love to educate his son. You'll feel his pain and share his pessimism and slim hopes that he'll be able to impart delegate and leave behind enough for his son not only material wealth but emotional stability as well which comes in the form of a sea turtle motif known for its longevity Wen Zhang too has this child like quality in his portrayal of autism which endears and is able to bring out the confusion fear and anger when he is not understood by others.The only peculiar performance here will be that of Kwai Lun Mei's Ling Ling whose role is that of a clown who juggles. I can't place her role anywhere other than to solely beef up the star attraction to this film because her role and the subplots involving her character all seem a little out of place and useless and can be done without. Perhaps it is just there to balance that sense of bleak from Wang's point of view since scenes between Ling Ling and Da Fu mostly hinges on play and friendship providing that lift to the audience unbeknownst to Wang that his son is capable of making new genuine friends and that he need not worry that Da Fu will eventually be alone in this world after Wang's own passing.I won't say this is a tearjerker but there will be those who will inevitably be touched by Father's love going by the amount of sniffles in the cinema hall. I suppose Jet Li's foray into a purely dramatic role is quite successful although personally I can't wait to see him kick serious ass in The Expendables with an ensemble cast of action heroes where he belongs. But of course one can't go on forever in such a role. Maybe he too can adopt the Jackie Chan direction I'm pretty sure they would have exchanged notes during their pairing in The Forbidden Kingdom where a film role balancing drama and action is possible ala Chan's Little Big Soldier or even following what Clint Eastwood is doing in going behind the camera to tell heartfelt stories.".

	schema:headline " Is this really autism?";
	schema:reviewBody "Ocean Heaven is an intriguing movie for several reasons 1. It portrays a young man with autism who also shows emotion 2. We see a sanitized view of modern day China and how disability is supposedly supported by average citizens and the state and 3. A terminally ill father struggles with finding support for his son.Each theme is a separate review I'm sure. I really did not want to like this film and as a previous reviewer suggested I was also prepared to turn my nose up after the opening dramatic scene. But I kept going with it. I'm glad I did.The actor who portrays the young man with autism is actually quite believable. He gets the gestures just right the mannerisms the vocalizationsand the expressions. Having known people with autismall across the spectrumfor thirty years now I was amazed at how nuanced this performance was and it did not fall into the mistakes of stereotypical portrayals such as Rain Man. It worked. His emotional side based on fear of the unknown was handled well as was his father's reactions to him. The setting for the movie was another aspect of the film that captivated my interest. It is no secret that having a disability in Chinese society is complicated there is stigma attached to the family not much support in terms of formal schooling and even less for social services in the community. It is not discussed and rarely revealed. Most newborns with obvious disabilities such as Down syndrome are routinely abandoned in the hospital and left to die. So why this sudden sympathetic portrayal? Did China undergo a transformation after hosting the Special Olympics in 2008? They did after all implement a national policy of be nice to people with disabilities in preparation for those games. The natural supports for Dafu son were all around him if his father would only look. The character of auntie Chai totally got Dafu. She could have enlisted his work ethic in her store. He already had a job swimming with the fish and sea mammals at the aquarium. We saw scenes of him being one with the water and marine life. And so on. But the film takes us on a trip to see Chinese institutional care segregated schools and missed opportunities for true inclusion in his community.There are side stories that don't advance the film such as the circus troupe and the film star clown who juggles. The metaphor of the circus outsiders some would also equate them to freak shows accepting Dafu is an old clich that wasn't necessary. Another side story that is not developed deals with his deceased Mother who apparently could not handle the truth of her son's autism. There are veiled references to her untimely death as a suicide.Now the story has legs. The real issue that is presented is that it is understandable and even acceptable for a parent to intentionally kill their child with a disability. Pity the poor parents who have to endure the shame and burden of a child with a disability. This is how most people really feel. In fact there is societal support for parents who murder their child out of pity. In Canada there is a famous case of Robert Latimer a father from Saskatchewan who murdered his daughter Tracy because she had cerebral palsy. Most Canadians thought Mr. Latimer a sympathetic figure not deserving jail time for his crime. There are numerous instances of children and adults with autism who end up dead at the hands of a caregiver or family member. Check out the website notdeadyet for further reporting on this subject. So the opening scene where Dafu chooses life for himself and his father is quite dramatic and likely the best evidence of Dafu's intellect emotion and will to live. It is also a tribute to all those other people with disabilities who do not get to choose how their life unfolds whether in China or anywhere else.".

It is not discussed and rarely revealed. Most newborns with obvious disabilities such as Down syndrome are routinely abandoned in the hospital and left to die. So why this sudden sympathetic portrayal? Did China undergo a transformation after hosting the Special Olympics in 2008? They did after all implement a national policy of be nice to people with disabilities in preparation for those games. The natural supports for Dafu son were all around him if his father would only look. The character of auntie Chai totally got Dafu. She could have enlisted his work ethic in her store. He already had a job swimming with the fish and sea mammals at the aquarium. We saw scenes of him being one with the water and marine life. And so on. But the film takes us on a trip to see Chinese institutional care segregated schools and missed opportunities for true inclusion in his community.There are side stories that don't advance the film such as the circus troupe and the film star clown who juggles. The metaphor of the circus outsiders some would also equate them to freak shows accepting Dafu is an old clich that wasn't necessary. Another side story that is not developed deals with his deceased Mother who apparently could not handle the truth of her son's autism. There are veiled references to her untimely death as a suicide.Now the story has legs. The real issue that is presented is that it is understandable and even acceptable for a parent to intentionally kill their child with a disability. Pity the poor parents who have to endure the shame and burden of a child with a disability. This is how most people really feel. In fact there is societal support for parents who murder their child out of pity. In Canada there is a famous case of Robert Latimer a father from Saskatchewan who murdered his daughter Tracy because she had cerebral palsy. Most Canadians thought Mr. Latimer a sympathetic figure not deserving jail time for his crime. There are numerous instances of children and adults with autism who end up dead at the hands of a caregiver or family member. Check out the website notdeadyet for further reporting on this subject. So the opening scene where Dafu chooses life for himself and his father is quite dramatic and likely the best evidence of Dafu's intellect emotion and will to live. It is also a tribute to all those other people with disabilities who do not get to choose how their life unfolds whether in China or anywhere else.";

Either the guy playing Dafu is really autistic or he is a really good actor. The story tells how the father prepares his autistic soon to live independently. The father's unconditional love for his child his unlimited patience and unrelenting care is very respectable. Anyone will be touched by him. The film also depicts the lives of ordinary citizens with real problems adding realism to the touching plot.

	schema:reviewBody "This has been touted as Jet Li's first starring nonaction drama. While that is interesting it is probably the wrong approach to think of Li's past roles before watching this movie. This is a simple bittersweet realist drama that is a moving cinematic experience because of the earnest performances. Jet Li's minimalist characterization is the right approach for his character Wang Xuechang and quite different than his action persona. The director describes Li's character as like a man who has become a mother. He is described by others in the film as a good man which he is. He is doing the best he can with this situation with dogged determination not with brilliance or luck but perseverance. Wang is a maintenance work for an aquarium and had lost his wife fourteen years ago. He also has complete responsibility of his son Dafu Wen Zhang also acts with Jet Li in the later The Sorcerer and the White Snake who suffers from severe autism. Wang is also dying from liver cancer and is given around three months to live.The film stars off inauspiciously. Wang takes his son out to the ocean to drown him and himself. This does not work because the son had secretly untied the rope and the son has one special gift in his mostly closed world  he is an excellent swimmer. So Wang goes back to his home and work determined to leave his son prepared for his passing while his pains get worse by the day. At first he tries to find a place where he can leave his son. But either the institutions are for kids or seniors which the 22year old does not qualify. While this proves difficult he also spends time going over simple behaviors like riding the bus cooking eggs and spending money so he can have some semblance of a normal life.While Dafu spends his days swimming in the aquarium tanks he befriends a traveling circus clown and juggler Ling Ling Kwai Lunmei also acts with Jet Li in the later Flying Swords of Dragon Gate she also sings a song for the film who also gives Dafu someone else to trust. But given that her life is nomadic and that Wang's life is slowly ebbing away you are left to wonder what is going to happen to Dafu.This is Xue Xiaolu's first directed film. Her only other screen credit is for the writing on Chen Kaige's Together. Xue has stated she has worked on this project fourteen years referring to her volunteer work with autistic children and by the time the screenplay got to be read by Jet Li it was in its seventh draft. What is impressive is the crew that was put together for this film. For the cinematography you have Christopher Doyle In the Mood for Love RabbitProof Fence Hero for the music you have Joe Hisaishi Kikujiro Spirited Away and production design by Yee Chungman Tokyo Raiders Shaolin. Having this triumvirate is quite unbelievable considering the modest budget. Their collaboration helps the film immensely in sound and image.This is a beautiful looking film. The cinematography and production design is dominated by blue hues throughout as a constant allegory to the water in their lives. The acting from Li and especially Wen is quite good. There relationship is quite touching as is the relationship between Dafu and Ling Ling. That one is underplayed but I think that is the right decision for this film. So much of the success of this film depends on how Wen portrays his character's interactions with these two. There are no magical solutions to the familial issues just a lot of hard work from caring people. There are no real antagonists in this story. Some might consider this a negative but the movie does not need it. I am glad because Dafu's life is difficult enough and the movie is emotional enough. I had to watch it in two sittings because the first half depressed me quite a bit. I do recommend this movie and hope those who are on the fence about watching this to give it a watch. I think it is quite a good film.There are certainly some parallels between this film and Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung's Heart of Dragon. Both films were dramatic roles dealing with a caretaker having no choice in dealing with a mentally challenged relative and both were popular action stars getting a chance to expand their acting repertoire. This film also reminds me of Zhang Yang's underrated Shower in which the relationship between Er Ming and Liu parallels that of the two main characters here. There is also a water motif present in both films though I think the allegory is stronger in Shower and more matteroffact here. I mention these films because both are interesting and different approaches to similar matter. Shower is also one of my favorite films.I saw this on the R1 Well Go DVD release. But there is also a R1 BDDVD combo available from Well Go which should have the same extras. For the extras there is an 11 minute Making of extra which has interviews from Jet Li Kwai Lunmei Wen Zhang and Xue Xiaolu and inserted footage from the movie. It has some good information but is ultimately too short. There is a trailer and a teaser for the movie as well. The startup trailers not accessible by menu are 1911 The Stool Pigeon and The Man From Nowhere. I found a mistake in the description on the back cover which uses names for the two characters Sam and David that appear nowhere in the film and there is no English dub so I am not sure where they came from. The two dubs for this are a Mandarin 5.1 Dolby and a Mandarin Dolby Stereo. There is also an R3 Edko release of this film that came out in 2010.".

	schema:reviewBody "CONTAINS MINOR PLOT OUTLINEIn recent years Chinese cinema has fallen somewhat behind Japanese and korean cinema in showcasing the best Asian movies. While it won't be challenging for international awards everyone involved leaves with their reputations raised. So can a Chinese film without a hint of violence crime or political overtones can be any good? i'd like to think so if jet li is a stereotype for all those genres he can safely say he is capable of much more. Many eyes will be focused on Jet Li who is an out and out action star and any foray into western cinema only reifys his action star status. Like Chan before him he's no longer 20 or even 30 and will be looking for dramatic roles before eventually being put behind a desk in some cop drama. Li excels as the caring father who's autistic son is soon to be left alone in the world as he discovers he has terminal cancer. However the real star is his son i'm not sure who plays him since the IMDb page is painfully sparse on information. Either way Da Fu is played clinically and with all the mannerisms you'd expect but it all seems natural he brings life into the character and there's never so much a hint of over acting or artificiality. The supporting cast do what they can in their limited roles and often breathe sympathy towards Da Fu if only to bring peace of mind to those who wonder if he will actually make it himself. The journey itself moves along at it's own pace with segments of Da Fu being taught to survive on his own while some areas do seem episodic as his progress is lumped into one section accompanied by aspirational montage music which is really familiar to spirited away with haunting piano keys and melodic violins. As well as the Ling Ling love interest which removes Li from the equation somewhat. I'd like to think the love interest was in Da Fu's imagination or that of his father's to show people can really past his autism. One scene does seem out of place and spoilers if you don't wan't to know so skip the next paragraph.The scene in question is the scene where Li explodes at Da Fu for not being able to mop but even worse is when he calls him stupid. Up until that point he was caring and tolerant and him snapping seems out of place and against character while he has good reason to you would not expect this father to snap. His death was also handled quite off screen and you never really see how Da Fu really reacts if he ever does.That said the film brings out great acting and a film which may love itself in metaphor towards the end. However the ending does bring justice to the character we've seen develop and even if he is essentially the same person the world around has changed.".

I believe it conveyed the feelings and emotions of all parents of autistic children. If you want to get a glimpse of the life of a family with autism this movie will give you a slight idea. There is so much more pain and heartbreak and frustration that is not a part of this movie but it is still a small window into autistic life.I wish I was able to contact the director and actors directly to thank them for this movie and express how emotional it was watching it.I HIGHLY recommend this movie it was very well done.".

There is so much more pain and heartbreak and frustration that is not a part of this movie but it is still a small window into autistic life.I wish I was able to contact the director and actors directly to thank them for this movie and express how emotional it was watching it.I HIGHLY recommend this movie it was very well done.";

That is quite a punch right there. The movie really grabbed me emotionally with repeated small acts of kindness not just from the father but from everyone in his community. You will need a box of Kleenex. The father has totally dedicated his life to his son's well being. His gentle kindness transforms everyone around him and brings out the best in them.The movie completely worked until the very end when Dad tried to create a simple religious myth to explain his impending death to his son. It was bathos. It spoiled the end of the movie for me. The movie suddenly went Disney on me. It was just too goofy. I suppose I could reframe it as insane last ditch desperation.It has an intense bittersweet ending.".

He live in his own world and impaired social interaction and communication he cannot take care of himself in daily life. Dafu's mother killed in an accident when he was young but believed she was suicides because she could not bear to combat his son is autism. Wang singlehandedly brought up Dafu and trying to teach him basic necessary life skills in order to survive on his own and take care for himself after he found out he is terminally ill and only has 3 to 4 months to live. As well as teaching him how to wear clothes how to cook how to ride the bus he struggles to look for a home for his son before he passes away. Finally they found a newly opened institution with helps from the principal of the school for intellectual disabilities children that Dafu attended as a child.In order to let his son live comfortably Wang made the layout of his son's room exactly the same as his usual one.The film has an opening scene of Wang trying to kill himself and his son by tied themselves to a big rock and jumped into the oceanbecause Wang do not know what to do with his son and do not want him to suffer on his own after Wang die. However Dafu loves water he is an expert swimmer which saved their lives. Everyday swimming at the aquarium that his father works for are the happiest time of his life where he meet Lingling Lingling plays the role of a clown who is part of a traveling circus that perform in the aquarium for a short period of time they get well together as Lingling is a orphan they become friends and Lingling has taught Dafu how to answer the phone in the aquarium when he hears it because she know she will be leaving soon with her circus. Eventually Wang passed away without regrets Dafu also learned everything his father has taught him and works at the aquarium at the end Dafu lying on the back of the turtle swim with peace of mind and happiness. Just like lying on his father's back.A father who is terminally ill and singlehandedly brought up his son. A son who suffers autism that cannot take care of himself in daily life when we see such film like this we cannot help but thought where is the Ocean that makes people happy and delightful? Where is the desirable to feel the happiness of heaven? Ocean heaven is a movie that can touch something deep in people's heart. The director aims to raise public's concern on the struggling and desperate status of autistic people in the society in a very impressive way. The director has well knowledge with autism which is one of the key elements to makes such amazing touched film. This film is a masterpiece of Xiaolu Xuewhose own personal experience from working as a volunteer at an autism school for ten years. This movie is about sincerity. It shows that in this day and age those filmmakers are willing to do something for society. It is trying to express gratitude to all the parents in the world through the film. At the beginning of the movie father jumps into the ocean with the son and tries to end their life in the heart of the ocean. This is a very impressive scene. The ocean is beautiful and peaceful sky is blue all of these lead people to think about the positive things of life. However this father attempted to kill themselves in the heart of the ocean. Xue has successfully sets a question mark in audience's mind. The trembling of Dafu's fingers was the major element used in the film showing the characteristic of autism patients the compulsive behavior of Dafu appears to follow rules and arranging objects in stacks or lines. Restricted behavior of Dafu preoccupation with a single toy all of thesewhich makes the film more reality and touched. Dafu's daily life is totally dependent on father due to his autism. When the father tries to find a shelter for Dafu after he knows he would die within few months it is sad that there is no government organizations is able to help them including hospital insurance welfare disabled school. But fortunately Dafu is taken by a group of people who are eager to help voluntary groups of people in society. This contrast reflects the problem and the instant need of improvement of china health care system. The thing that goes into the deepest of people's heart is the father's selfless love to Dafu. He accomplished an impossible task which is to teach Dafu the necessary life skills to take out his daily activities such as taking a bus cooking getting across the road and working at the aquarium. In order to prevent Dafu feel lonely He dressed as a turtle and swim with his son he told Dafu he will become a turtlehe will always by his side.This is a very emotionally charged family drama showing a father's tireless selfless love for his autistic son.

So it was with some expectations that I sat down to watch Ocean Heaven aka Hai yang tian tang.First and foremost I must say that writer and director Xiaolu Xue managed to accomplish something quite unique and beautiful with Ocean Heaven. It was a rather beautiful story that was both entertaining and also had somewhat of a deeper message other than just being for entertainment purposes.Then I must also move on to say that Jet Li was surprisingly good in a dramatic role albeit it was a bit odd to see him in a mature and serious role such as the one he portrayed in Ocean Heaven. But he managed that with flying colors. However it was actually Zhang Wen who stole the spotlight with his performance.This is the story of an Wang Xingchang played by Jet Li who is taking care of his disabled brother Dafu played by Zhang Wen. Dafu is a man with autism and needs his brother to assist him in many things. But when given some bad news Wang Xingchang must ensure that Dafu learn enough to be selfsufficient.While the story in Ocean Heaven is a touching and profound then it just lacked something to become a real tearjerker. But it is definitely a beautiful movie with equally beautiful performances by the cast.If you enjoy dramas and if you enjoy Asian cinema then you should by all means give Ocean Heaven a chance. I enjoyed it and I was genuinely surprised with Jet Li's performance in a slowed down movie such as this in comparison to the adrenalinefueled and fast paced action martial arts movies that he usually stars in.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film on December 17th 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.This is the story of Beatrix Potter the author of many classic illustrated children's stories such as Peter Rabbit. She was raised in the latter part of the 19th Century in an upper middle class stuffy family. And worked in the early part of the 20th Century.It is a story of rebellion and one woman's liberation from knowing one's place settling on an arranged marriage and quietly raising a family in the shadow of a man. Beatrix Renee Zellweger would have none of that. She had a dreamy artist's imagination and talent and temperament from an early age and simply rebelled and lived in her own created world. When the world recognized her talent she slowly became a part of the commercial world via the book publishing industry and a mentorlove interest Ewan McGregor and the mentor's sister Emily Watson.The cast is brilliant. You go back in time with them a 100 years and live with and understand their stilted social mores. The art direction and cinematography are stunning and are worthy of Academy Award nominations. There is one neat trick of animation that appears throughout this film. The drawn animal characters occasionally become animated but only to Beatrix. It sounds hokey but it is a clever way to demonstrate how real these characters were to their author. And it's why they have rung true to children and to adults for many generations.Beatrix is a model for determination and pluck and steadfastness. This is a beautiful story beautifully told. Undoubtedly this film will be compared to Finding Neverland. Miss Potter is of the same high quality. FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

And worked in the early part of the 20th Century.It is a story of rebellion and one woman's liberation from knowing one's place settling on an arranged marriage and quietly raising a family in the shadow of a man. Beatrix Renee Zellweger would have none of that. She had a dreamy artist's imagination and talent and temperament from an early age and simply rebelled and lived in her own created world. When the world recognized her talent she slowly became a part of the commercial world via the book publishing industry and a mentorlove interest Ewan McGregor and the mentor's sister Emily Watson.The cast is brilliant. You go back in time with them a 100 years and live with and understand their stilted social mores. The art direction and cinematography are stunning and are worthy of Academy Award nominations. There is one neat trick of animation that appears throughout this film. The drawn animal characters occasionally become animated but only to Beatrix. It sounds hokey but it is a clever way to demonstrate how real these characters were to their author. And it's why they have rung true to children and to adults for many generations.Beatrix is a model for determination and pluck and steadfastness. This is a beautiful story beautifully told. Undoubtedly this film will be compared to Finding Neverland. Miss Potter is of the same high quality. FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.";

My friend and I thought it was such a heartwarming movie through every scene we kept wondering Wait when does the climatic bad part happen? This movie shows the inspiring journey that the successful author of Peter Rabbit Beatrix Potter undergoes.Beatrix loved drawing woodland animals as a girl and telling stories about them to her maid and younger brother. Despite her mother's stolid opinion against her adroit hobby Beatrix displays her fortitude as a young woman trying to get a publisher. She is introduced to the youngest son of a publishing company who is played by the urbane and charming Ewan McGregor Moulin Rouge. Miss Potter's only friends were her drawings of her forest creatures until she met the young publisher and her comical sister. Her drawings come to life you see them animated whenever Beatrix looks at them and are reflections of characters in her own life and feelings.Reoccuring themes such as friendship antimarriage in the early 1900s in the views of suffragettes and attainment of one's dreams.Highly recommended for anyone who's been wanting a poignant feelgood film.

However Renee Zellweger is such a good actress and embraces this role so well that i have no qualms in this area here although i did read one comment which said Emily Watson Millie would have made a better Beatrix  and am in complete agreement that she too would have been wonderful  i mean aren't there enough British actresses to go round?! but as i say i couldn't fault Renee Zellweger either. One thing that was nice to see was a good British supporting cast not one of whom put a foot wrong. The story was brilliantly scripted too with a good blend of fact fiction innocence romance and fantasy touches. The film just really left me smiling  its a great reminder of what we go to the cinema for.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fine movie. It has exquisite beauty love aspiration and dreams and meticulous historical vibes. It is very true to the real story of Beatrix Potter. It is also a solidly interesting and entertaining movie as well. Far from being only a mere confection and therefore meaningless 'Miss Potter' is meaty and solid.In addition to being a great dramatic movie and true to life it also possesses charm and grace. The very selective animation of the watercolour characters she drew and animated only for Miss Potter's eyes mind! are sweet and totally in line with the original paintings she made 100 years ago. It is truly as if the characters come alive for her and we get to share her passion intimacy and love for them rather than the audience merely seeing a 'cartoon' of some kind. A welcome and pure delight!The movie in being faithful to the real Miss Potter's life reflected her actual world. Note that she had a chaperon at all times even when in her own garden or shopping. Social mores and what was proper or not occupied her mother who herself was only a generation away from being one of those odious and lowly creatures she so despised 'a tradesman'. Heavens!Anyway given the life and times of Beatrix Potter a movie about her will have certain degree of that as well a certain gentility. Note also that her children's books were also the very soul of discretion and refinement. She painted watercolor bunnies for goodness' sake. I found the life she did lead and which was amply depicted in this movie to be as dramatic as any. Consider what she endured and what she went through. As well as what she didn't go through. She was healthy and rich so we won't see a lot of struggling with survival. She was kind and refined so we won't see a lot of violence and judgement and hatred etc. those things were simply not in her.She was nonetheless truly inspirational. She was bold and a free thinker who displayed a lot of courage. She wasn't a prostitute or a criminal or a resistance fighter or a herion addict or any 'dramatic' thing like that. Maybe she didn't have to agonize over each piece of literature she produced but the process of creativity and perseverance she did go through was inspiring to me.Renee Zellweger did a remarkable job. And just think she comes from Texas! The fact that a Texan pulled off a spoton portrayal of a great English artist seems to have bent the noses of a tiny few English folks maybe they are jealous and stuck in some old and fetid dream of a long gone Empire? Dunno. But I loved Zellweger in this and I think you will too. She masterfully and expertly did Beatrix Potter and the English society of the turn of the last century proud.".

Always a teller and writer of stories Beatrix breaks free from her suffocation and takes her tale of Peter Rabbit to the Warne publishers. Where she is pleasantly surprised to find a deal offered and young Norman Warne assigned personally to aid her in her first publishing venture. But as the pair start to fall in love and the book takes off the pressure from home threatens to derail her chance of happiness.Before it was even released Miss Potter was being tagged Oscar Bait by lazy and uninformed movie fans. It seems that any film that falls into this ilk is considered to be folly and destined to be rubbish. Why that is I don't know since film's like Miss Potter Seabiscuit Cinderella Man and Finding Neverland are technically great movies that tell amazingly impacting stories. Amazingly impacting stories backed up by fine acting I might add. Things further hindered Miss Potter by those decrying the casting of Rene Zellweger in the title role it was Bridget Jones madness all over again. Once again Zellwegger took up the challenge and proved it to be an inspired choice to put her into the prim and proper corset of our dear Beatrix. Then there was the historical inaccuracies argument like it has stopped so many millions of film's in the past doing it! none of which are really worth listing. So finally the last big negative put forward to kick Miss Potter is the age old chestnut of it not being a fully formed biopicture. Please do me a favour. It's got a running time of 90 minutes and primarily focuses on the most telling time in her life.What Miss Potter is guilty of is not affording more time to her wonderful artistic achievements. Director Chris Noonan Babe and writer Richard Maltby Jr. choose to enforce the whimsy and romanticism rather than showcase what a unique talent she was. In fact Miss Potter for the most part makes Beatrix comes off as a kooky dreamer. Something she most probably was when she dived into her work. Thankfully tho in the last quarter of the piece Beatrix is shown to be the strong ahead of her time woman that she was. Her conservationism and blow striking from the gorgeous Lake District she called home is given weight and rounds the film out nicely. Prior to this we are treated to a magical world where Beatrix's creations come to life on the page only to her you understand but the impact as she converses with the likes of Peter Rabbit is uplifting and keeps us focused on what great work she achieved in the world of children's books. Conversely when things do go bleak as most Potter fans know as regards her real life story the animation sequences are brilliant at portraying Beatrix's emotional state. Great work from Noonan and his animation team. While a special mention for Andrew Dunn is due because his cinematography around the Lake District is truly sumptuous.In support of Zellwegger who was nominated for Golden Globe is Ewan McGregor delightful and believable as love interest Norman Warne Emily Watson terrific as Norman's sister Millie an early feminist and confidante of Beatrix. While Bill Paterson and Barbara Flynn as the Potter parents involve and infuriate to the right levels of story enhancement. Yes it's charming yes it's sweet but Miss Potter is far more than just a movie made to please a certain demographic or Oscar as the silly people say. Expect a film about a period in her life and accept that at 90 minutes long it's never going to be a fully formed Beatrix Potter film. And you may just be as beguiled as I was. Not as classy as Finding Neverland but a most worthy accompaniment to that picture it be. 810".

	schema:headline " An Enchanting Miss Potter";
	schema:reviewBody "Miss Potter based on the life of Beatrix Potter the best selling author of children's books of all time is an enchanting film.Directed by Chris Noonan Babe and written by Richard Maltby Jr. whose theatrical background is no doubt the reason the 94minute film has such a jaunty pace Miss Potter is not a standard biopic in that it has the ability to appeal to pretty much everyone with the exception of the very young which I'll get to in a moment. Opening images of a pair of hands carefully choosing the pencils and brushes that are the tools of the writerillustrator's craft paired with a voiceover that tells us that there is something delicious about writing the first words of a story reveal Potter's passion for her craft. Her affection for what she calls her friends  the bunnies frogs and ducks who are the subjects of her tales  is equally strong. So strong in fact that we wonder as do the two gentlemen who agree to produce her work if Miss Potter Rene Zellweger isn't just a little daft.This notion is quickly laid to rest however when we see the author escorted by fledgling publisher Norman Warne a sedately sweet Ewan McGregor confidently direct the printing of her works an endeavor not generally expected of single women in 1902 London and not deemed acceptable by its society. Among those who find this effort distasteful are Potter's parents Barbara Flynn and Bill Patterson a pair of social climbers who seek to marry their only daughter to a man of means. That she refuses these overtures is the crux of their often contentious relationship.In lieu of marriage Potter immerses herself in her work. As her success blossoms so does her relationship with her champion Mr. Warne who introduces the author to his sister Millie Emily Watson another spinster. The two women develop a palpable bond based primarily on their likeminded philosophies about life. Precisely how Potter developed her ideology is never told but flashbacks to her childhood reveal an independent girl charmingly played by newcomer Lucy Boynton with natural storytelling abilities and a love for drawing the small animals she encounters while summering in England's bucolic Lake Country with her family. It is from these experiences that Potter fashioned her famous Tales of... series.In an effort to bring Potter's experiences with the books to life on the screen Noonan incorporates a series of technically adept animation sequences. These are completely effective in delivering the sweetness of Potter's tales and they will appeal to even the youngest viewers. But the film offers too few of them to be satisfying. As a result they become a tease a sort of trailer to get us to buy the books. While there are many reasons to buy and read Potter's books using a film to get us to do so feels like too much manipulation.In all other ways this is sound and pleasurable filmmaking. Performances are what one would expect from so seasoned a cast with Zellweger bringing her natural cherubic quality to the role of the author. Production design by Martin Childs which incorporates a color palette that matches Potter's work and cinematography by Andrew Dunn History Boys Mrs. Henderson are elegant but not ostentatious and are reminiscent of the look of Finding Neverland another film set in turnofthecentury England.In the hundred or so years since Beatrix Potter created her venerated children's series a lot has changed in the world. One thing that hasn't however is that we still love a good story particularly one that warms our hearts and makes us feel good about the world. Miss Potter does precisely that.".

	onyx:emotionText "Miss Potter based on the life of Beatrix Potter the best selling author of children's books of all time is an enchanting film.Directed by Chris Noonan Babe and written by Richard Maltby Jr. whose theatrical background is no doubt the reason the 94minute film has such a jaunty pace Miss Potter is not a standard biopic in that it has the ability to appeal to pretty much everyone with the exception of the very young which I'll get to in a moment. Opening images of a pair of hands carefully choosing the pencils and brushes that are the tools of the writerillustrator's craft paired with a voiceover that tells us that there is something delicious about writing the first words of a story reveal Potter's passion for her craft. Her affection for what she calls her friends  the bunnies frogs and ducks who are the subjects of her tales  is equally strong. So strong in fact that we wonder as do the two gentlemen who agree to produce her work if Miss Potter Rene Zellweger isn't just a little daft.This notion is quickly laid to rest however when we see the author escorted by fledgling publisher Norman Warne a sedately sweet Ewan McGregor confidently direct the printing of her works an endeavor not generally expected of single women in 1902 London and not deemed acceptable by its society. Among those who find this effort distasteful are Potter's parents Barbara Flynn and Bill Patterson a pair of social climbers who seek to marry their only daughter to a man of means.

The drawing and special effects when she talks to her friends are funny and well done. Great supporting roles especially Emily Watson and the chaperone part...Beautiful landscape. I really hope the movie will attract a big audience even though I'm not sure who the audience will be. Peter Rabbit and Co. are part of everybody's childhood and it brings back a lot of memories.

Her snobbish mother Helen Potter Barbara Flynn had introduced several bachelors to Beatriz until she was twenty years old but she turned them all down.Beatrix Potter has been drawing animals and making up stories about them since she was a child but her parents has never recognized her as an artist. One day Miss Potter offers her stories to a print house and the rookie publisher Norman Warne Ewan McGregor is delighted with her tales and publishes her first children's book. The successful selling leads Norman to publish two other books and Miss Potter becomes the best friend of his single sister Millie Warne Emily Watson. Sooner they fall in love with each other but Helen does not accept that her daughter marries a trader. However Beatrix's father Rupert Potter Bill Paterson proposes that his daughter spends the summer with his wife and him in their country house in Lake District and if she is still interested in Norman after the summertime he would bless their marriage. When Miss Potter stops receiving letters from Norman she is disappointed. Until the day she receives a letter from Millie explaining what had happened to Norman.Miss Potter is a beautiful film about the life of the British writer of children's books Helen Beatrix Potter. This writer is not popular in Brazil and The Tale of Peter Rabbit was only published in Portuguese in 2009. I saw Miss Potter without knowing that it was biographical and I found very sad when she loses Norman. However Rene Zellweger once again has a magnificent performance in the role of a woman ahead of her time. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Miss Potter".

	schema:reviewBody "Every time I see a book or a character of Beatrix Potter it brings a nostalgic feeling that takes me back to when I was 710 years old the time when I discovered her books and fell in love with them. I still love all the characters. Her paintings always amuse me with the delicacy detail and creativity behind it and the books remain a favourite children's book to me.Noonan does a a meritorious job of his presentation of Miss Potter. Though it's not exactly an accurate portrayal the storytelling is commendable. He already has shown what an excellent storyteller he is in 'Babe' and 'Miss Potter' is an equally story that isn't overly saccharinefilled. He has a talent of showing spirited characters and relationships. The animation is used wonderfully giving us a glimpse of Beatrix's fantasy world. I also liked how her works were effectively introduced without looking like a booksale promotion. Furthermore it is gratifying that he shows Beatrix's contribution to conservation. He beautifully captures the dazzling English countryside particularly the Lake District. So spectacular is Lake District that I immediately wanted to be there.I could not picture anyone else other than Renee Zellweger who could have fitted the title role so well. Her touching portrayal of a extraordinary woman ahead of her time who manages to stay strong and dignified through her ups and downs is admirable to say the least. She's already mastered the British accent as has been evident in 'Bridget Jones's Diary' but here she also manages to adjust her English accordingly with the time period sounding very natural. Ewan McGregor and Emily Watson shine in their roles. McGregor as the slightly naive publisher who believes in Potter and eventually falls in love is a fine match for Zellweger's Potter while Emily Watson who hardly ever disappoints is outstanding. The rest of the cast that include Bill Paterson Barbara Flynn Matyelok Gibbs and Lloyd Owens are great.A very minor quibble is that some important aspects of Beatrix's life were left out of the film such as the ignorance by the of her work by the officials due to her gender in the field of botany. Yet even though it's not an accurate depiction like Marc Forster's magical 'Finding Neverland' it remains charming lovely and entertaining. It works as a slice of life and a character study.".

It's the story of Beatrix Potter the alltime bestselling author of children's books. It's about how she became an author who helped who didn't who encouraged her who didn't and who she fell in love with and what happened with him. This is a very involving film right from the start and it doesn't overstay its welcome at 92 minutes.This is one of those rare films in which even in some of its tougher moments and there were some had me almost in tears many times. I guess I am hopeless romantic. Anyone who is will treasure this film male or female. Anyone who appreciates beautiful scenery will treasure this too. Some of the shots of the English countryside are absolutely stunning. This is a beautiful picture visually and in story. There really isn't anything to criticize.Rene Zellweger gives an terrific performance as Beatrix Potter. She is the second American actor I have heard on screen in the last two months speak with a British accent and do it well enough that I didn't think about it after a short time. The other was Edward Norton in The Painted Veil.. Zellweger and Ewan McGregor Norman Warne are about as charming a couple as you will ever see on film. The support from Emily Watson Barbara Flynn Bill Patterson and the rest of the cast also is firstrate.This is about a clean a movie as you'd ever see too regarding language and sex. However I doubt kids wouldn't be interested in this film. It's an adult story.If you are looking an interesting and emotional hour and a half of entertainment this comes highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Deeply Disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "I'd been looking forward to this movie for some time and saw it last night.I was deeply disappointed. I've pretty much enjoyed Zelwegger in everything she's done and feel SHE rather then Zeta Jones should have garnered an Oscar for Chicago but I hate to admit that not only is she horribly miscast but she mugs and overplays the part so horrifically I was expecting the movie to end with her being carted off to some postVictorian asylum and administered electroshock therapy until the walls of her cell open up and her friends take her off to Neverland. Definitely NOT an Oscarworthy performance.The movie really opens up once McGregor appears on the scene and he subtly steals every scene he's in...to my shock he's turning into a more and more versatile actor the older he gets. Once he leaves the picture there's a gaping void that simply can't be filled. Indeed the last 20 minutes or so of the film is a badlyconceived mess.Noonan's direction is all over the place  the movie felt rushed in places and is accomplished in others. Yet strangely he doesn't seem to be able to place the camera to get effective use in what are the many static talky scenes. His direction of the actors as them all spouting the lines at a level of barelysuppressed hysteria. It's as if somebody had sent spiked CoolAid back in time and topped up their teacups with it.The blame for the movie must largely be laid at Richard Maltby's screenplay. The characters just don't ring true.The nicest thing I can say is that the movie rattles along quickly and it's largely pretty to look at. Oddly it reminded me of several movies from the early 70s  including the far superior Agatha.".

Renee Zellweger as Beatrix Potter a 32 yr old unmarried woman is very convincing as someone who loves her work and has no desire or want to be the wife of any man. Ewan McGregor  Norman Warne as the brother of two accomplished publishers is full of enthusiasm for Miss Potter's work because that's his first assignment in the world of publishing. Norman's sister Millie unmarried out of choice just like Beatrix played very convincingly by Emily Watson takes an instant liking to Beatrix. They have a lot in common. Two pleasant women in love with life and all that is pretty and have no need to be tied to a husband and nurture babies. Miss Potter's anguish at her loss of first love and how she derives happiness from her friends is very touching. Bil Paterson and Barbara Flynn as Miss Potter's parents did very well as parents very much against a 32 yr old wanting to be on her own. Renee Zellweger is excellent as Miss potter her eyes and her voice are filled with love for her friends. Her love is contagious . By the end of the movie i wanted to hear more from her about her friends. Ewan McGregor was excellent in Moulin rouge and is very good in the role of Norman. Emily Watson is very talented. I enjoyed her role in the movie Hillary and Jackie. And of course Renee Zellweger...she is Price above rubies. I enjoyed this movie and recommend this movie for the big screen . Enjoy the photography and the music. No DVDs please.".

	schema:headline " An excellent intelligent film which remains faithful to the period";
	schema:reviewBody "I once read on the back of a romantic title a brief quote from a magazine review of the book calling it a gentle romantic story. I was always puzzled by the use of this quote to advertise the book's charms because surely such a quote does not express unmixed praise to say the least. So I hesitate to call Miss Potter a gentle romantic story  which might give the impression that it is a pretty little movie in which essentially nothing happens  although that is what it is. However as well as being gentle it is also a quite lovely curiously touching and exquisitely made film.One of the most impressive aspects of Miss Potter is the way it almost perfectly captures an era and a society  this is one of the most convincing period movies I have ever seen outside of the BBC of course!. The costumes are excellent and so are the hairstyles it frustrates me more than anything else to see anachronistic hairstyles in a period film or worse only the heroine with a gorgeous modern hairstyle and everyone else with daggy hair just to rub it in and the makeup is good too the ruddy complexions are pretty faithful to the time. More importantly nearly everyone in this film succeeds in looking as though they actually believe they are living in that period...so that when someone cries out jolly good or formally addresses even close friends with Miss or Mr it sounds completely normal and expected.I have never seen Renee Zellweger before in a movie and she is very impressive! It must be difficult to act with an accent that isn't your own yet she managed to sound unforced and put so much quiet emotion into her part making Beatrix a slightly eccentric but very appealing character. In fact all the actors in the movie are excellent with the possible exception of the girl who plays a young Beatrix. Some of her lines aren't very well timed and I found her very precocious manner slightly offputting. That's probably just me though and I don't want to criticise her too muchbecause her performance is certainly passable and doesn't take away from the overall quality of the movie.The very gentleness of Miss Potter is partly what makes the love story so effective I think. The Christmas party scene a central scene in this story is particularly well done  it could easily have been overdone  but with a minimum of dialogue and use of very effective images the development of the romance between Beatrix and Mr. Warne is believable and moving. Contrast with the truly cringeworthy romance of such movies as Titanic. I have always loved the books by Beatrix Potter and was predisposed to like this movie. I can honestly say that the movie far exceeded my expectations! It touched me as very few movies have its story is truly inspiring without being mushy the romance is captivating and there is a truth of feeling and tone which elevates it from a good film to a minor masterpiece.".

Leaving aside the small artistic licence and you need not know what this is Renee Zellwiger seemed at first an unlikely choice for the title role but she carried the part of talented spinster very well. I notice'from the credits that Ms Zellwiger had a voice coach  if I have any criticism of her it would be the slightly forced English accent and maybe I could put this down to the upbringing of her rather starchy parents played by Barbara Flynn and Bill Patterson. Etiquette being all the range the 36yearold Beatrix was constantly accompanied by a chaperon which situation lent itself to moments of comedy.The Warne brothers were all well cast. Star of the show was Norman Warne Ewan McGregor who was thrust at Miss Potter as the other brothers did not want to deal with such a mere trifle as a children's book. The other two made a brief appearance and seemed far more typical of the businessmen they were to represent. I was very nearly moved to tears when Norman Warne died  he and Beatrix had secretly become engaged and the wrench was all so real. Take a hankie just in case.I would recommend this movie to everyone who's a fan or merely an interested reader of Peter Rabbit et al. You will no doubt fall in love with the scenery too  and by all means use this as an excuse to visit the Lake District see High Top and of course the lakes themselves. This is a film for all ages.".

	schema:headline " A truly charming biopic";
	schema:reviewBody "We have reached the stage of the year where all the dreary Oscar movies arrive in some sort of a desperate hope that they will be nominated albeit forgotten about within a years time. I usually dislike this season as the movies that come out just bore me to tears sure its very nice that people want to win an award but the movies they usually churn out try to be very important and try to have morals. Yet most of them fall flat on their faces and just seem like a never ending movie full of dialogue that never truly gels. The biggest movie like that I've seen recently was Cold Mountain possibly one of the most dreary and downright boring movies I've seen in ages. Of course occasionally you get the odd gem nominated such as The Hours Gladiator The Lord of the Rings and last years Crash. But many others never really work for me. Miss Potter is a movie clearly aiming for either Oscar or BAFTA success unfortunately its not likely to get any but still it is aiming for the nominations. For starters its a biopic about an author an especially well known children's author to be exact Finding Nervland anyone?. The movie of course is about Beatrix Potter author of such classics as The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Playing her is Oscar winning actress Renee Zelweger an actress who is highly overrated in my opinion and along for the ride playing her editor is Ewan Mcgreggor as Norman Warne. I was expecting a decent if not great movie out of this and surprisingly what I got was a charming little movie that really did impress me. In fact it impressed me so much I really do hope that it does well on Oscar night I really want this to beat the dreary looking Flags of our Fathers as this is just a nice and entertaining movie. Something that a lot of movies this time of year forget about is to be entertaining its all very nice being important but if you're not entertained you couldn't give a damn about the movie. Miss Potter is full of wonderful performances a great storyline and a character that is always intriguing.The story of Miss Potter follows the life of beloved children's author Beatrix Potter. Beatrix Potter was born into a wealthy family who basically lived to be social climbers they cared more about who they spent the following evening with then helping the poor or what Beatrix was up to. Beatrix also was still unmarried at the age of 32 unheard of in that day and age despite the number of suitors her mother and father had brought her. All Beatrix longed for was to publish her little book about a rabbit called Peter she also wanted it to be affordable for young children. After being rejected by a number of publishers one family agreed to do it however these publishers wanted just to dump it on their younger brother Norman to keep him occupied. However Norman has a few ideas for the book all of which Beatrix agrees with and they are surprised when The Tale of Peter Rabbit becomes a surprise hit. As Beatrix churns out more books her and Norman slowly fall in love despite her mother and father disagreeing with her going with a trades man. This movie is the untold tale of a woman and her courage to defy what people naturally expected her. The story is an intriguing one many will argue that she gets things done a little too easily but as this is a true story I was willing to accept it. The major thing of this movie is the romance between Beatrix and Norman the romance is very nice and actually very believable. The reasoning behind this lies with the fact the two leads Ewan Mcgreggor and Renee Zelweeger have a brilliant chemistry. The rest of the cast also go along extremely nicely especially Emily Watson as Norman's unmarried sister.So does Miss Potter contain faults? Of course it does a biopic usually drags on and in tradition Miss Potter has moments in the middle where it does sage quite dangerously. Matters aren't helped by the fact that the final half an hour isn't quite what I was expecting sure its very nice and I still enjoyed it but it also felt like an advertisement for the Lake District more than anything else. My other teeny weeny moan is that Emily Watson wasn't in it quite as much as I would have liked. She is fast becoming one of my favourite actresses and here she does a superb job it wouldn't surprise me if she gets a nod for best supporting actress to be honest. However she does disappear a bit too often for my liking and she really could have featured in the final half an hour a bit more. However these are mere quibbles as Miss Potter does still shine magnificently and the movie undoubtedly will get a lot more people interested in the novels of Beatrix Potter.This movie works so well because of the cast always being up to an extremely high standard the movie looking absolutely beautiful and the fact that the movie is very entertaining and charming. Renee Zelweeger delivers her best performance to date and she really does deserve the Oscar nod any scene with her and Ewan Mcgreggor really does sparkle. A very good movie and early front runner to be one of the best of 2007. I really do recommend it.".

	onyx:emotionText "We have reached the stage of the year where all the dreary Oscar movies arrive in some sort of a desperate hope that they will be nominated albeit forgotten about within a years time. I usually dislike this season as the movies that come out just bore me to tears sure its very nice that people want to win an award but the movies they usually churn out try to be very important and try to have morals. Yet most of them fall flat on their faces and just seem like a never ending movie full of dialogue that never truly gels. The biggest movie like that I've seen recently was Cold Mountain possibly one of the most dreary and downright boring movies I've seen in ages. Of course occasionally you get the odd gem nominated such as The Hours Gladiator The Lord of the Rings and last years Crash. But many others never really work for me. Miss Potter is a movie clearly aiming for either Oscar or BAFTA success unfortunately its not likely to get any but still it is aiming for the nominations. For starters its a biopic about an author an especially well known children's author to be exact Finding Nervland anyone?. The movie of course is about Beatrix Potter author of such classics as The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Playing her is Oscar winning actress Renee Zelweger an actress who is highly overrated in my opinion and along for the ride playing her editor is Ewan Mcgreggor as Norman Warne. I was expecting a decent if not great movie out of this and surprisingly what I got was a charming little movie that really did impress me. In fact it impressed me so much I really do hope that it does well on Oscar night I really want this to beat the dreary looking Flags of our Fathers as this is just a nice and entertaining movie. Something that a lot of movies this time of year forget about is to be entertaining its all very nice being important but if you're not entertained you couldn't give a damn about the movie. Miss Potter is full of wonderful performances a great storyline and a character that is always intriguing.The story of Miss Potter follows the life of beloved children's author Beatrix Potter. Beatrix Potter was born into a wealthy family who basically lived to be social climbers they cared more about who they spent the following evening with then helping the poor or what Beatrix was up to. Beatrix also was still unmarried at the age of 32 unheard of in that day and age despite the number of suitors her mother and father had brought her. All Beatrix longed for was to publish her little book about a rabbit called Peter she also wanted it to be affordable for young children. After being rejected by a number of publishers one family agreed to do it however these publishers wanted just to dump it on their younger brother Norman to keep him occupied. However Norman has a few ideas for the book all of which Beatrix agrees with and they are surprised when The Tale of Peter Rabbit becomes a surprise hit. As Beatrix churns out more books her and Norman slowly fall in love despite her mother and father disagreeing with her going with a trades man. This movie is the untold tale of a woman and her courage to defy what people naturally expected her. The story is an intriguing one many will argue that she gets things done a little too easily but as this is a true story I was willing to accept it. The major thing of this movie is the romance between Beatrix and Norman the romance is very nice and actually very believable. The reasoning behind this lies with the fact the two leads Ewan Mcgreggor and Renee Zelweeger have a brilliant chemistry. The rest of the cast also go along extremely nicely especially Emily Watson as Norman's unmarried sister.So does Miss Potter contain faults? Of course it does a biopic usually drags on and in tradition Miss Potter has moments in the middle where it does sage quite dangerously. Matters aren't helped by the fact that the final half an hour isn't quite what I was expecting sure its very nice and I still enjoyed it but it also felt like an advertisement for the Lake District more than anything else. My other teeny weeny moan is that Emily Watson wasn't in it quite as much as I would have liked. She is fast becoming one of my favourite actresses and here she does a superb job it wouldn't surprise me if she gets a nod for best supporting actress to be honest. However she does disappear a bit too often for my liking and she really could have featured in the final half an hour a bit more. However these are mere quibbles as Miss Potter does still shine magnificently and the movie undoubtedly will get a lot more people interested in the novels of Beatrix Potter.This movie works so well because of the cast always being up to an extremely high standard the movie looking absolutely beautiful and the fact that the movie is very entertaining and charming. Renee Zelweeger delivers her best performance to date and she really does deserve the Oscar nod any scene with her and Ewan Mcgreggor really does sparkle. A very good movie and early front runner to be one of the best of 2007. I really do recommend it.";

Same goes for virtually any of the characters in H2.Oh memo to those who griped about Michael grunting....he grunted in Carpenter's original as well...just check out the scene where he strangles Lynda or when he's breaking into the closet or choking Laurie.And of course they had to go the whole ohmyGodshe'shisSISTER! route which was stupid in the first HALLOWEEN 2 and is even more so this time around. John Carpenter came up with the idea in 1981 and even he admits it was a dumb one. Michael Myers is far more terrifying as simply the boogeyman.....anybody could be his victim nobody is safe. With this lame subplot as long as you aren't related to him or between him and a relative you're safe! Maybe it's nostalgia for the good old days but I think I'll avoid any of Mr. Zombie's future HALLOWEEN efforts and simply stick with Carpenter's classic....the unequaled original.....".

Michael Myers was nuts and he was seeing what he thought was himself and his mother. I think Rob Zombie was showing what was making Michael tick.I loved the actress who played Lori Strode. She delivered the scream queen role with passion. The kill scenes did not seem lame like in the awesome slasher 80's horror movies. I thought Rob Zombie showed a more intimate kill. The people who were getting killed seemed to be more scared and the kill scenes were brutal and nasty. I liked that.Could Dr. Loomis have been more deep in the movie? Yes but oh well.I think Danielle Harris's death scene was amazing. The scene where she sees Michael in the bathroom and the slow motion starts and the look of terror on her face as she was running away was amazing. She pulled that scene off well. I also liked how they showed the picture of her with her dog when she was young. I took that as a shout to Halloween geeks who are fans of Halloween 4 and 5. I thought the way that scene was shot was done well.I own this movie and will watch it again. One must look at the acting and the characters and the way in which Rob Zombie was showing how hardcore crazy Lori was getting. Over all I give this movie 2 thumbs up and 3 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Its numerous sequels were wildly variable with 'Halloween H20' being the only above decent one for me the fourth one was also watchable but not much more and 'Halloween Resurrection' being proof that the series shouldn't have been resurrected and that it should have ended at 'H20' a perfect place to stop. Something that was further felt in Rob Zombie's awful first 'Halloween' outing from 2007. His second 'Halloween' film this one is even worse and even more pointless than its predecessor. The only real good thing here is the makeup which is pretty good. Brad Dourif comes off best in the acting department and does his best but he deserves better and has been better too.Everything else fails...and not just by a little. Catastrophically. The rest of the acting is scarier than Michael Myers himself at his least creepy here in how bad it is. Scout TaylorCompton in an embarrassingly appalling careerkilling performance and Sheri Moon Zombie who should be nowhere near in front of a film camera are especially bad. The film also brings the worst out of Malcolm McDowell actually a good actor wasted in a very poorly written and used role.All the characters are bland annoying or both nobody is remotely likeable here or worth rooting for even those intended to be and the dialogue down there with the worst of SyFy and The Asylum and worse. The production values are too gimmicky Zombie continually seems to think taking a selfindulgent smug approach to his directing is being cool and the music is constantly at odds with the mood and the action nothing atmospheric or appealing here and more outdated attempts at being cool. Overused and a vast majority of the time gratuitous expletives artificial gore and sickeningly brutal violence completely get in the way of a coherent or engaging story that's instead paperthin unintentionally silly nonsensical dull and contrived. As well as tension suspense chills or terror none in sight. The whole Deborah and white horse stuff was not needed felt completely misplaced and just added absurdity to the story while the ending is as slap in the face a joke as it comes.In summary awful and had no point to it whatsoever. 110 Bethany Cox".

I was looking forward to having a lot of fun watching this sequel only to be set up for extreme disappointment. The movie lacked suspense. Also for some reason Rob must have thought that to be extremely loud is to be scary. Wrong! Also Laurie Strode aka Angel Myers was so whiny and unstable I couldn't wait for her to be killed which sad to say never happened. Every character was just a cookie cutout waiting to be killed. There were many of the actors in which you didn't even get a good look at their faces before they were killed. The movie was disjointed and extremely loud and gory. I love gory but this was a bit over the top. Michael Myers was popping up everywhere. It was too much like a Wile E. Coyote cartoon. Oh I guess Sheri Moon Zombie wanted a bigger role. Wow! What a big mistake! She cannot act. And she was annoying. Also Sam Loomis's character was only there to be killed off. Believe me by the end of the movie you'll be cheering for his death. I also didn't like the fact that the movie veered so much into her nightmares that most times you didn't know if it was real or just a nightmare or was Michael Myers like Freddy Krueger and he could be anywhere. All of the characters were white trash and severely stupid. I never thought a movie could be so violent and gory yet be so dreadful and boring at the same time. As I was watching the movie I kept thinking about the original Halloween 2. It was a much better movie. Also Rob Zombie should know better! Introduce the characters and let us get to know them before you go and kill them. In this movie Michael Myers went on a happy and silly killing spree popping up everywhere at the same time with such silly and extremely loud stabbing sounds! Rob do you know what overkill is? Do you actually know how to write a decent screenplay without excessive F words? And can you write a movie without having to put your wife in it? It's not enough to have style Rob you also need to have some substance in there. Halloween 2 2009 was just a stylish piece of crap.".

I understand that Rob Zombie tried to create a whole different movie and not follow the original movies but really? ghosts? seriously...So right when the movie started I loved how it continued right on from the end of Rob Zombies first Holloween where laurie is walking down the street covered in blood with the 357 still in her hands but what i loved about Rob Zombies first holloween is that there is a lot of criteria covered showing Myers life at the beginning but this goes straight into killing with no motive.Even though it is a new movie not a remake I do believe that Dr. Loomis shouldn't have sold out Loomis has always been the badass trying to hunt Myers down now he is a sell out who dies in the end... there is no where to go with a sequel on this because it wont be Holloween without Loomis.But the number one thing that ruined this movie is the ghosts... seriously what the hell Ghosts? this is a slasher film not a ghost film keep casper out of this throughout the whole movie his mom's ghost and him as a kid ghostby the way the kid taking Daeg Faerch was terrible he was a terrible Micheal he no longer had the creepy kid ambiance just keeps popping in and saying these terrible lines like were ready Micheal seriously rob zombie what were you thinking...So if you are as big of a Halloween fan as me don't see this movie.".

I understand that Rob Zombie tried to create a whole different movie and not follow the original movies but really? ghosts? seriously...So right when the movie started I loved how it continued right on from the end of Rob Zombies first Holloween where laurie is walking down the street covered in blood with the 357 still in her hands but what i loved about Rob Zombies first holloween is that there is a lot of criteria covered showing Myers life at the beginning but this goes straight into killing with no motive.Even though it is a new movie not a remake I do believe that Dr. Loomis shouldn't have sold out Loomis has always been the badass trying to hunt Myers down now he is a sell out who dies in the end... there is no where to go with a sequel on this because it wont be Holloween without Loomis.But the number one thing that ruined this movie is the ghosts... seriously what the hell Ghosts? this is a slasher film not a ghost film keep casper out of this throughout the whole movie his mom's ghost and him as a kid ghostby the way the kid taking Daeg Faerch was terrible he was a terrible Micheal he no longer had the creepy kid ambiance just keeps popping in and saying these terrible lines like were ready Micheal seriously rob zombie what were you thinking...So if you are as big of a Halloween fan as me don't see this movie.";

	schema:headline " Pumpkin men Weird Al and a ghost horse Halloween II is one bizarre movie";
	schema:reviewBody "It was quite the dilemma deciding whether Halloween II was a good film or a bad one. One thing is certain it's a weird film undoubtedly the most bizarre major studio release of the year. Rob Zombie's sequel or vision  as it's being touted  seems to have been envisioned with the aid of various hallucinogenics and mindaltering substances withering away whatever was left of the original John Carpenter Halloween mythology after Rob Zombie's remake and leaving a nonsensical uberviolent mess in its wake. This isn't a sobadit'sgood movie nor would I call it a justplainbad one this is a soweirdit'sgood movie a blooddrenched collage of absurdities and irrationality which like a train wreck a term some would use to refer to previous Zombie efforts is hard to look away from. Little of the iconic original Halloween is left here  all that's left is Michael Meyer's mask which itself is less recognizable beneath the grime and torn pieces  but perhaps it would be foolish to try to match the original masterpiece anyway. Zombie has crafted something entirely different something quite frankly silly dumb and for lack of a more politically correct term retarded but nonetheless entertaining not in spite of but because of this.Picking up where the remake left off Halloween II sees Laurie Strode recovering from her ordeal with psychopath Michael Meyers. Mentallytraumatized after both the Halloween day massacre of nearly everyone she knew and her own dispatching of Meyers  by way of shot to the head  Laurie finds herself dreading the oneyear anniversary of the serial killings plagued with the irrational fear that the deceased Meyers will return to smalltown Haddonfield to finish her off. Well lowandbehold Meyers is alive and he makes it his mission to track down Laurie and finish what he started.The general plot outline is as generic as can be but it's hard to fathom or comprehend the insanity that occurs. Michael Meyers the original maskwearing soulless psychopath the pure evil murderer the Big Cheese of all horror movie villains has now been transformed into a homeless vagrant who randomly eats dogs. Yep that's right he's a hobo that eats dogs now. When a film is remade one expects some alterations but this is akin to remaking Indiana Jones and turning him an extraterrestrial who molests children. There is practically no semblance of the original character...and the new ones just messed. As well Meyer's is followed by his deceased mother himself in childform and a gigantic white horse seemingly all figments of his imagination. Except they interact with Laurie as well...making them ghosts? Except Meyers isn't deceased so it makes absolutely no sense for there to be a ghost version of him. Maybe Laurie is inexplicably psychic and seeing into Meyer's mind? Or maybe Zombie just ate a few too many shrooms. Either way this momboyhorse trio follows Meyer's around as he kills various victims instructing him on what to do next. It's as stupid as it sounds.Dr. Loomis has also been changed significantly. The remake hinted at Loomis profiteering slightly off the Meyers incident but here it has been taken to ridiculous proportions. He's now a prima donna celebrity who travels around in a jet black limo with his publicist throws hissy fits at reporters and threatens to beat on woman. One sequence has Dr. Loomis appearing on a talk show alongside Weird Al Yankovic with the famed discjoker lampooning the doctor and Michael Meyers making puns about whether this is the same guy who starred in Austin Powers until Loomis finally explodes with anger on air at the hosts assertion that Meyers is a shark. If it sounds like this has nothing to do with the film it's because it doesn't. This irrelevance not only pertains to the Weird Al scene but all of Dr. Loomis's scenes. His entire role is a completely separate unrelated tangent in which he gallivants around the country promoting his book. For that matter even Laurie and Michael have about ten minutes in the way of plot. Laurie up until the last fifteen minutes never encounters Michael. The near entirety of Halloween II is Michael fighting random people  farmers strippers toughguy scumbags  while Laurie lives her life as per usual.The rest of the film is a compilation of pumpkin people vans running into cows golden showers discussions about fornicating with corpses and sex with a guy in a wolf costume who sounded suspiciously like Michael Cera. It's weird undoubtedly convoluted but in the end it's pretty entertaining. It's punctuated with displays of head smashings throat slittings and other displays of excessively graphic violence. Nudity is slightly down from the first one but there are still several scenes involving bared breasts. In the end between all the nonsense gore and nudity Halloween II is a bigbudgeted toneddown Hollywood stab at a Troma movie. In other words a pretty fun movie.I'm one of the few who actually enjoyed Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween  a lot. For reasons I won't get into here I enjoyed it immensely but at the same time I could completely understand why so many disliked it. It took some of the things that made the original Halloween so great in many people's eyes and switched them around completely. Those who despised the first Halloween for that reason will likely loathe this second installment with a passion. However if one can go into Halloween II not expecting a Halloween movie  or even a reasonably scary horror  they might just have a good time. It's not bad per say  although it's hard to say what Zombie intended it to be  but it's enjoyable in its bizarreness. Worth checking out if you don't mind Carpenter's story being completely bastardized.Dylan allhorrorfilms.com".

	schema:headline " Rob Zombie threw a party and Michael Myers just happened to drop by";
	schema:reviewBody "A couple years ago we had the release of the remake Halloween directed by Rob Zombie he claimed that it wasn't a remake as more of his own vision. I was very much looking forward to it and was greatly let down. So when I heard that Rob was working on the sequel I just laughed and knew I wasn't going to see this movie. But then I saw the trailer for the film and darnit curse Rob Zombie for feeding my hunger towards scare and gore. The trailer looked so great I just had to see the sequel I don't know maybe it had hidden messages saying see this movie or something. But I saw Halloween 2 today and once again I fell for it! Now I think Rob Zombie is a very talented director his visionary style is incredible coming from a graphic design background I admit this movie still has some great and creepy images. He has this knack for these gritty horror films and I believe that down the line his film The Devil's Rejects will be a cult classic. The reason why despite the fact that The Devil's Rejects is somewhat of an homage to the old gritty dark horror films of the 1970's it was exactly meant for Zombie as it was his vision that made it into the classic that it will be. Halloween is not meant for Zombie and the reason why is in one word Simplicity.Simplicity being the reason why this isn't Zombie's picture to mess around with Michael Myers is evil no specific reason why he just is. As we saw in the first movie Zombie tried giving Myers a soul and it took away the scare more than give it to the audience. He's made Michael Myers into a bum or at least he looks like one take for example The Mask. Myers does not wear the mask for most of the film or at least it's ripped off and we can see a good amount of Myer's face and it's not Michael Myers without the iconic mask. His look for me is just all off as well I don't see his height as much of something to be bothered by while his kills are extremely creative and fun to watch on screen he still didn't do much for me as he looked like a hippie bum with that long black cloak. Zombie also has all his trademarks in this movie as his love for the 1970's strippersboobies gore sex drugs and dirty ugly bums who look like they still haven't figured out that the tooth brush has been invented. But here's Zombie's version of what he thinks the sequel should be.Taking right where we left off from the first film Laurie has a vicious nightmare that Michael is still after her but she wakes up. It's one year after all the murders and Laurie is now living with the Bracketts. Michael's body has been missing since last Halloween presumed dead and Laurie has been having recurring nightmares about the event. While Laurie deals with her trauma through therapy Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book. Meanwhile Michael has been seeing visions of his mother's ghost and a younger version of himself who instructs him that with Halloween approaching it is time to bring Laurie home.Scout TaylorCompton this girl I have no idea why she was picked as the strong female Laurie Strode because she spent 98.9 of this movie crying sobbing and blubbering he'sgonnagetmeeeee! I'mnotwhoyathinkiam! and how in the heck was I supposed to root for that kind of a female lead? Scout is a lousy actress and the writing was all wrong for the character as well. Another trademark that I forgot to mention earlier that Rob loves putting in his movies his wife Sherri Moon pretty woman and over all a talented enough actress. But how in the heck was her role needed in this movie? Zombie is ripping off Psycho by making Myers see his dead mother all over the place saying for him to kill everyone. Again I like the simplicity of Myers just being born evil with no explanation. Rob Zombie delivers in images and gore but not in the scares. While the movie has some awesome kills it's not worthy to add to the collection of Halloween sequels which the first 7 are actually good and worth watching. This was a project that wasn't meant for him nor should have it been for anyone Halloween should be left alone. With Zombie making this into his vision he's turned Mike Myers into a bum who dumb people for some odd reason pick a fight with and then get killed in the end and I'm supposed to feel sorry for them? Not likely just skip it.110".

The reason why despite the fact that The Devil's Rejects is somewhat of an homage to the old gritty dark horror films of the 1970's it was exactly meant for Zombie as it was his vision that made it into the classic that it will be. Halloween is not meant for Zombie and the reason why is in one word Simplicity.Simplicity being the reason why this isn't Zombie's picture to mess around with Michael Myers is evil no specific reason why he just is. As we saw in the first movie Zombie tried giving Myers a soul and it took away the scare more than give it to the audience. He's made Michael Myers into a bum or at least he looks like one take for example The Mask. Myers does not wear the mask for most of the film or at least it's ripped off and we can see a good amount of Myer's face and it's not Michael Myers without the iconic mask. His look for me is just all off as well I don't see his height as much of something to be bothered by while his kills are extremely creative and fun to watch on screen he still didn't do much for me as he looked like a hippie bum with that long black cloak. Zombie also has all his trademarks in this movie as his love for the 1970's strippersboobies gore sex drugs and dirty ugly bums who look like they still haven't figured out that the tooth brush has been invented. But here's Zombie's version of what he thinks the sequel should be.Taking right where we left off from the first film Laurie has a vicious nightmare that Michael is still after her but she wakes up. It's one year after all the murders and Laurie is now living with the Bracketts. Michael's body has been missing since last Halloween presumed dead and Laurie has been having recurring nightmares about the event. While Laurie deals with her trauma through therapy Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book. Meanwhile Michael has been seeing visions of his mother's ghost and a younger version of himself who instructs him that with Halloween approaching it is time to bring Laurie home.Scout TaylorCompton this girl I have no idea why she was picked as the strong female Laurie Strode because she spent 98.9 of this movie crying sobbing and blubbering he'sgonnagetmeeeee! I'mnotwhoyathinkiam! and how in the heck was I supposed to root for that kind of a female lead? Scout is a lousy actress and the writing was all wrong for the character as well. Another trademark that I forgot to mention earlier that Rob loves putting in his movies his wife Sherri Moon pretty woman and over all a talented enough actress. But how in the heck was her role needed in this movie? Zombie is ripping off Psycho by making Myers see his dead mother all over the place saying for him to kill everyone. Again I like the simplicity of Myers just being born evil with no explanation. Rob Zombie delivers in images and gore but not in the scares. While the movie has some awesome kills it's not worthy to add to the collection of Halloween sequels which the first 7 are actually good and worth watching. This was a project that wasn't meant for him nor should have it been for anyone Halloween should be left alone. With Zombie making this into his vision he's turned Mike Myers into a bum who dumb people for some odd reason pick a fight with and then get killed in the end and I'm supposed to feel sorry for them? Not likely just skip it.110";

	schema:reviewBody "In my review of Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds I wrote that those put off by Death Proof would also likely be put off by his latest. Go figure that one week later I am applying the same notion to Rob Zombie's sequel to his 2007 remake of Halloween. One of the most heatedly derided remakes to date I found Zombie's take impassioned and sincere while transcending John Carpenter's minimal workmanlike lowbudgethorrorflick terrain. While not a perfect film Halloween epitomized to me anyway the creative potential of the remake when placed in the right hands.Halloween II finds Zombie returning to the Michael Myers maelstrom while tightening alreadyestablished character arcs employing a harshly gritty style courtesy of DP Brandon Trost and topping it all off with a heapin' helpin' of carnage. Whereas Halloween focused on the inception and evolution of Michael Myers Tyler Mane from a murderous youth to the hulking masked madman we all know and love Zombie's thematic focus this time out is family and its many incarnations using the traumatized character of Laurie Strode Scout TaylorCompton as its axis.Picking up one year after the fateful night her brother decided to come home Laurie has become a punkedout version of her former virginal suburbanite self and now resides with Sheriff Lee Brad Dourif sporting a Ted Nugent hairdo and Annie Brackett Danielle Harris. Meanwhile the Eve of All Hallows is looming over Haddonfield like a shadowy blanket with a rejuvenated hoodedangelofdeath Michael Myers making a pilgrimage back home guided by the specters of his younger self Chase Wright Vanek and his mother Deborah Sheri Moon Zombie. In the meantime Dr. Sam Loomis Malcolm McDowell has become a poppsychology celebrity authoring yet another book on his last runin with the notorious Myers.With Halloween II Zombie drops the slick polished look of the initial film replacing instead with dark grainy stock punctuated by flashes of neon and the soft focus of black  white. In many ways the director has created a film that like his characters is schizophrenic in its style cleverly threading complex dream sequences into reality and cutting away from scenes with little warning. While the employment of dream sequences in most films is a cheap tactic for a GOTCHA! moment Zombie keeps his motives ambiguous do the dreams represent a psychic link between Laurie and Michael? the erosion of Laurie's sanity? Michael's distorted concept of pilgrimage? Either and every way they give the proceedings a richly layered psychological weight that in addition to their shock value make us feel that the characters each have something at stake. The events leading up to the brilliantlystaged climax are both unpredictable and surprisingly affecting.Unlike the Saw sequels which have become the bane of the discriminating horror fan's existence bathed in a hypocritical morality amid all the twisted flesh spilled blood and dungeon locations Zombie is cognizant of death as something horrifying and destructivethe murders in Halloween II are played straight executed with a fury that is disquieting Myers has become a driven beast whose path of destruction possesses a joyless workmanlike quality removing any potential glamorization from the act. Every fleshtearing slash every helpless scream cuts to the bone.Quite admirably Zombie uses his second go'round with Myers as a chance to tie up character arcs and plot threads that felt truncated in the overambitious Halloween Loomis who seems detached from most of the main plot is given a chance to redeem his greedy bottomfeeder ways Sheriff Brackett gets to exhibit a paternal side but also an authoritarian mentality once the code of law is broken he has several great emotionally wrenching scenes near the end of the film as Deborah Sheri Moon Zombie's detached trancelike performance is apt for the physical manifestation of the voice guiding a psychotic mind. Amid the carnage of his corpsestrewn landscape Zombie's interest in character interaction and moral ambiguity gives Halloween II a depth that for those with the stomach to take it is downright refreshing.".

Yes it's extremely brutal and violent but it IS a horror movie and a Rob Zombie one to boot so what did you really expect out of it? Zombie said from the getgo that he set out to take the Halloween story and make it his own vision which is exactly what he's accomplished with his two entries into this franchise. It's not high art nor does it set out to be.

Rob Zombie was able to make his own original story line with slight psychological elements that i enjoyed. Also i liked the fact that there wasn't as much sex in this as the first one. Being an art student at an art college i enjoyed the trippy artistic dream sequences that he put in the film but a lot of people will hate that because they are afraid of change or something i don't know i think the haters just wanted a remake of the original Halloween 2. Whatever.Anyways another thing i liked about this movie were some of the heartwrenching scenes acted out by Brad Dourif near the end. He is a great actor and i am glad he was chosen to play Sheriff Brackett for these two films.Now all that aside it's not perfect. For one and this made a LOT of people angry the traditional Halloween theme barely makes an appearance in this as does Laurie's theme. Also there wasn't too much to the storyin other words a LOT of blood and guts. I am indifferent about Samuel Loomis' character change i like it but i don't at the same time...All in all it's a solid attempt at Zombie putting his own lore into the franchise and yes some of the scenes actually DID scare me. Zombie's good at what he does i believe. If you aren't afraid to see something original tried to put into an old franchise then go see it. Just don't go in expecting an Oscar winner...expect a slasher movie with some good scenes.".

I was fourteen at the time of its' release I feel pretty stupid the fact that I gave Rob Zombie money. Stay clear of this one at all costs you'll end up wasting time when you could've seen a film worth your time. I hate everything about this movie there's one scene that's more suited for a heavy metal music video than a motion picture. I didn't like the fact that Zombie dressed him up in a hood. He makes Michael Myers have more of a human personality in this one. The film is terrible from beginning to the end. The shooting style is to gritty a graphic blood bath. Once again Rob Zombie goes over the top with blood and guts much worse than his 2007 remake to try to scare his audience. I'm a huge fan of his music After I saw the trailer for his newer film 31 I can definitely say Zombie you're not the filmmaking type it's either two options 1. Take filmmaking classes or 2. Stop making movies and leave it to the filmmakers who know what they're doing. Sorry everybody it's just sad to see everyone waste their money on this piece of trash he calls an amazing horror film. Also note that Rob Zombie's visions of creative art form arent's working for him in his movies.For an overall rating I give Halloween II 2009A 12 star.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has become a sad sport for unhappy horror fans to watch the numerous franchises drop to everlower depth  and none of the franchises have fallen as low as Halloween. Most series had a good numbers of duds and stinkers but Halloween 2 takes Michael Myers to new lows that the fan couldn't have imagined.Rob Zombie has two things in common with German director Marcus Nispel both managed to breathe fresh air into the slashergenre Nispel with his GradeA remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Zombie with the TCMcumEasy Rider bloodletting epos The Devil's Rejects. And both managed to take two slasherclassic and almost run them into the ground.The new Jason Vorheers is now an inbred survivalist  Michael Myers 2.0 is a hobo with lots of facial hair who does a lot of walking through the countryside looking a lot like the fairy tale giant Rbezahl. Indeed for an instant we're almost glad that movie giant Matthew McGrory Big Fish The Devil's Rejects passed away before Zombie could cast him as Mike Myers.As in all his films Rob Zombie invites us into his private paralleluniverse where humanity consists entirely of white trash and degenerates and where Emo Goth and Heavy Metal kids rule every household. Brad Dourif looks like a bum put into a sheriff uniform while his adopted offspring deface their home with Fk Youscrawling satanic graffiti and posters of Charles Manson and Kiss.Unlike Zombies prior works House of a 1000 Corpses and TDR there is not a likable or even remotely charismatic character in sight. The heroine of the film has the charm of a pubescent loaf of bread trying to hide the inability to act by throwing manya tantrum adding to the film 'length'. The male cast invariably looks like they all slept in their suits and didn't bother to shave for a long time.If there is any good word to be dropped on the flick we might name two or three well choreographed splatter scenes. True Michael Myers never has been an imaginative killer like Freddy Krueger mostly he stabs his victims while grunting a lot. Stab grunt stab grunt  simply grunt it's like watching a woodchuck chuck wood for an hour an a half.I could also speak of unwarranted dreamsequences of fairy tale settings and white horses of the world's worst actress I give you a tip she's married to the director but the memories seem painful and the electronic ink too precious.The honourable Razzie of the year must invariably go to Malcolm McDowell. Granted he's not given much to work with. Most of the time he doesn't even appear with the rest of the maincast content to rattle down his lines in some parody of a Dr Phil mediahack. Only in the very last minute does he appear in the real film only to be killed by Michael who of course is then killed by the police. Yes it is the scene where Michael Myers has dialogue DIE! Let it be a man more bitter than myself who wishes that a disgruntled fan repeat that line when expressing his 'gratitude' to director Zombie. The worst I'd wish upon Zombie is that the most mediocre MTVpophiphoptrend band will cover Rob Zombies hitalbum La Sexorcist just so that we can ask him How does it feel Rob? Sucks doesn't it? Speaking about music the Coup de grce is delivered by the soundtrack perhaps the fan must be thankful that the iconic Halloweentheme is not featured. Instead Zombie decides to let some godawful Psychobilly band play a couple of songs give  hey did I mention that Zombie will be producing that bands next album? Coincidence over coincidence.The Halloween franchise has pretty much covered the entire spectrum of badness. However this train wreck of a movie has added a new one embarrassment. If you thought Zombies first Halloween film was bad boy you haven't seen anything yet  this is worst infinitely worst. Where are those minusratings when you need them?".

Stab grunt stab grunt  simply grunt it's like watching a woodchuck chuck wood for an hour an a half.I could also speak of unwarranted dreamsequences of fairy tale settings and white horses of the world's worst actress I give you a tip she's married to the director but the memories seem painful and the electronic ink too precious.The honourable Razzie of the year must invariably go to Malcolm McDowell. Granted he's not given much to work with. Most of the time he doesn't even appear with the rest of the maincast content to rattle down his lines in some parody of a Dr Phil mediahack. Only in the very last minute does he appear in the real film only to be killed by Michael who of course is then killed by the police. Yes it is the scene where Michael Myers has dialogue DIE! Let it be a man more bitter than myself who wishes that a disgruntled fan repeat that line when expressing his 'gratitude' to director Zombie. The worst I'd wish upon Zombie is that the most mediocre MTVpophiphoptrend band will cover Rob Zombies hitalbum La Sexorcist just so that we can ask him How does it feel Rob? Sucks doesn't it? Speaking about music the Coup de grce is delivered by the soundtrack perhaps the fan must be thankful that the iconic Halloweentheme is not featured. Instead Zombie decides to let some godawful Psychobilly band play a couple of songs give  hey did I mention that Zombie will be producing that bands next album? Coincidence over coincidence.The Halloween franchise has pretty much covered the entire spectrum of badness. However this train wreck of a movie has added a new one embarrassment. If you thought Zombies first Halloween film was bad boy you haven't seen anything yet  this is worst infinitely worst. Where are those minusratings when you need them?";

And please scout do the world a favor go into the bathroom and work on making a facial expression that isn't annoying as hell. I doubt you'll have much luck.

The style and feel of the film was perfect. But the storyline was complete trash. He should have stuck to the original story.Zombie's reimagining of the second coming of Michael Myers was way off. Yeah he spiced up the original with Michael's backstory but he completely redid the second one.So if you just want to see people get stabbed with a cool directorial style and nice lightingoh and boobs lots of those then yeah you might like it.But for what it's worth the backbone of any good movie is good source material and the source material for this was Zombie's lackluster screenplay.Shame. The first one was so promising. This one definitely ended it. Not only because Zombie says he won't direct another but because it went so far downhill from the first one it basically killed itself.Oh and the final scene in the movie is ridiculously laughable and will most likely give you a WTF look on your face.510 for this one.

	schema:reviewBody "Back when Zombie's first Halloween was released I started trying to watch it and I couldn't get past the first scene. Rob Zombie has some real problems with writing characters. He tends to write every character as a jerk. When the entire family establishes that they are all wastes of space why should we care when they die?Eventually I returned to that movie and found a few redeeming qualities to it. It was still an exhausting movie.Then I started this movie. Right off the bat I like following up with Laurie being patched up in the hospital. Then things start rolling downhill. Things very quickly turn into Michael escaping from people transporting his body arriving at the hospital and killing everyone he sees. Laurie spends a bunch of time running. This whole sequence takes up somewhere in the area of half an hour. The whole time I'm thinking that there's no way they can sustain this for that long. So they reveal that it's a dream sequence. Dream sequences can be a useful tool but when the purpose is to be able to start your movie out with a bang without earning it...The movie continues with the same problems as Zombie usually has. He confuses annoying people for interesting ones. It's a bleak world that he uses bereft of any nuance where everyone is sleazy everyone is meanspirited. Now that I think of it the cop father is a decent person which might be why he generates most of the interesting movement in the story.There's effectively no tension. There are a few jumps but we all know exactly how things are going to play out. Michael kills whoever he sees which a single exception. But there are people he kills for absolutely no reason.Most of these complaints are things I could overlook except that the movie gets boring. Zombie has an eye for doing some interesting visual work but it gets bogged down in relentless mindless violence. Michael stabs his victims multiple times. Does it get scarier as we see each stab? Nope. Does it communicate anything in particular? Not really. It mostly wastes time.The writing is also a real annoyance. I couldn't care less about cursing in movies but this movie is an exercise in two screen writing nonos. First the characters curse constantly and needlessly. I've known people like this and they are especially boring. Second everyone is ready with a ridiculously written insult. This is a trend that I saw heavily in things like Juno and good god it's terrible. It eliminates any sense of reality a movie could have. And for a horror movie that's the kiss of death.Normally I wouldn't bother to write a review of something that has 400 reviews already. But I wanted to get my thoughts out. This is probably one of the worst horror movies I've seen. Mostly because they had the budget to make it work but they skimped on all of the places that could have made it work.".

I won't even go into her dreams of killing Annie or of the incomprehensibility of the ending when she finishes off Michael with a knife AFTER telling him she loves him then walks out of the broken down shed wearing his mask. Or that silly ending where she's meant to look menacing...but instead looks less menacing that the child Michael!

However after a blood soaked ten minutes of terror in the hospital the audience is ripped away to the story of Halloween 4. Danielle Harris is even there just like in 4 only this time as the friend instead of Michael's last relative. Just like Danielle's original character Jaime Laurie is haunted by the image of Michael in her dreams while living with an adopted family. After the carnage with the nightmares of her brother running through her head even while she is awake Laurie sports the mask and becomes the family's new killer just like Jaime who dons the clown mask to kill her mother and become mute.The only differences come from the fact that Jaime was a little girl while Laurie is a teenager and that Rob Zombie is nothing like John Carpenter. The story is unoriginal but it is a great addition to a great horror franchise with Rob Zombie's brutal violence and filthy language saturating every second. John Carpenter's originals keep the blood and gore at a minimum with knife swings penetrating flesh off screen. Zombie celebrates every chance to show people inside out making audiences whiteknuckle armrests as the body count rises.".

Of course each trip from Sweden to Germany brings new risk as the Gestapo is cracking down on traitors.One of his contacts is Lilli Palmer a prominent society woman with whom he begins an affair. Palmer was a refugee herself from Nazi Germany and she brings that dimension to her part that can't be imitated. Alfred Hitchcock probably could have made this film a classic still and all George Seaton who wrote and directed can't be faulted for the job he did. Holden and Seaton had worked well together before in The Country Girl and Seaton gets good performances from him and the rest of the cast.Hugh Griffith is very good as the cynical British agent who is Holden's contact who is not above using any means to defeat the Nazis. I also liked Werner Peters the German actor who played a really terrific variety of Nazi types throughout the Sixties and who is suspicious of Holden from the gitgo.But the best scenes in the film involve young Helo Gutschwager who is the son of one of Holden's German contacts and a true believing member of the Hitler Youth. First Holden to escape and then Gestapo agent Stefan Schnabel to apprehend Holden play some real mind games on this kid who has grown up with Hitler the only reality he knows.The Counterfeit Traitor is one fine espionage film and definitely in the top ten of William Holden's performances.".

It gives William Holden his secondbest role of the '60s surpassed only by his work in The Wild Bunch and provides good subsidiary roles for Lilli Palmer Hugh Griffith and Ernst Schroeder.Holden is terrific as a Swedish citizen born in the USA named Eric Erickson. Erickson is a businessman trading oil from his Stockholm HQ during WWII. Many of his customers are Germans and quite often he goes on business trips to wartorn Germany leaving the sanctuary of neutral Sweden behind. The British secret service approach him and plead for him to act as a spy gathering sensitive information for them during his seemingly legitimate trips. Matters are complicated when Erickson meets fellow spy Marianne Mollendorf Lilli Palmer with whom he soon falls in love. His mission is seriously jeopardised when her spying antics are exposed and she is seized by the Gestapo and taken away to be executed.The film is wellmade by everreliable director George Seaton. Seaton also wrote the screenplay basing it on an Alexander Klein book and he must be given credit for fashioning a thoroughly believable and suspenseful story. The film is shot on actual North European locations and the use of real backdrops  as opposed to the usual studio lensing favoured by Hollywood in the early '60s  adds to the film's authentic flavour. Nowadays the appeal of this kind of film is sadly limited but if you have an affinity for this kind of stuff then The Counterfeit Traitor is definitely a title worth tracking down.".

It begins in Stockholm 1942 . He made scores of trips to Germany between 1941 and 1944  the hazards were great. He gathered priceless information on Germany's oil refineries which he turned over to his Allied contacts . Gestapo agents tracked him on his visits to Germany. Though Erickson knew that he was under constant surveillance he went about his oil business as well as the business of spying. One of his closest confederates was a woman a haunting Lilli Palmer. Gestapo agents suddenly rushed in and arrested them both. Both were confined at Gestapo headquarters .This is a suspense thriller full of tension  agonisingly intriguing and entertainment. Frequently riveting but overlong  it results to be a magnificent film. There are tremendous acting from the main protagonists as Holden and Palmer . Furthermore  splendid support cast from Germany as Klaus Kinski  Wolfgang Preiss Werner Peters Schuman  from Denmark as Reichhardt and from Sweden as Palme. Sensible and stirring musical score by the classic Alfred Newman . Colorful cinematography by the French Jean Bourgoin .The producers wish to express their gratitude to the city government of Stockholm  Copenhagen  Hamburg and West Berlin whose cooperation made it possible to photograph the authentic locales in the recreation of this true story. The motion picture is stunningly directed by George Seaton. Professional and polish writer and director who occasionally rose well above his average standard and was twice rewarded with Academy Award for so making . Seaton formed a partnership with William Perlberg  was to produce all Seaton's movies for several years. Both of them produced and directed the following successes as Miracle on 34th Street The country girl a monster Box office as Airport  another unusual War film as 36 hours and of course Counterfeit traitor.Based on true events  Erickson spied on German synthetic oil plants for the American OSS in World War II. At the outbreak of World War II Erickson offered his services to the United States. Pretending that he was a Nazi Erickson visited Germany more than 30 times between 1939 and 1945.Working with a few German industrialists and businessmen who were part of the conspiracy. He and his women accomplice were arrested. The woman however had been under suspicion as being a spy. The Germans concluded that Erickson was simply a businessman seeking sexual gratification but the woman was a spy. The Allies stepped up their bombing of Germany and Nazioccupied countries in 1943 but had difficulty in locating the oil refineries that kept Hitler's war machine moving. Erickson was told by his OSS spymasters that he had to locate the key refineries. Erickson and his wealthy German business friends he said planned to build a huge oil refinery in neutral Sweden safe from Allied bombers. This plant when running at peak capacity could deliver all the oil Germany might need. If he went ahead with his plans he explained he would want an exclusive contract with the Germans. Erickson then pointed out that he had few friends in Sweden because of his long association and loyalty to Nazi Germany. He also pointed out to the Gestapo chief that his name was on the Allied blacklist a fact that Himmler already knew and one that endeared Erickson to his cold heart. As they talked Himmler came quickly to believe that Erickson was an opportunist who had thrown in his lot with the Germans after they had scored lightning success through blitzkrieg invasions. He was also impressed in the detailed blueprints for the proposed Swedish oil refinery that Erickson had taken pains to prepare and submit for examination. Erickson then explained that before he and his partners put up their millions to build the plant he would have to inspect present oil refineries and receive from experts and technicians in the field all important information on operations in order to better build a highly productive refinery. Himmler authorized Erickson to travel anywhere in the Reich or occupied territories to investigate any oil refinery operation he wanted to see and to get from experts any information he desired in preparation of building the proposed refinery in Sweden. He was also given an order signed by Hitler that provided automobiles for Erickson . Erickson was shocked to run into a man he thought long dead a German oil executive he had formerly known . He told the Nazi that it was simply good business to have joined the Germans and that he was a businessman first and always. He told the man that he had been on the Allied blacklist for years after establishing friendships with German Nazis. He then played his trump card showing him his newlysigned Gestapo papers which bore the name of Heinrich Himmler .This seemed to convince the Nazi that Erickson was indeed to be trusted.In the months to follow the intrepid spy toured almost every major oil refinery in Germany and the occupied countries. He obtained detailed plans of oil operations and these quickly wound up in the hands of the OSS MI6 and subsequently the Allied air forces which then bombed the refineries out of existence. Lack of oil caused the surrender of more than 300000 German troops in the Ruhr Valley the last real threat in the West against the Allies. Following the war General Dwight D. Eisenhower attributed the Allied victory to the destruction of the German oil industry and almost all of the credit for that destruction was due to one man Eric Erickson.".

Colorful cinematography by the French Jean Bourgoin .The producers wish to express their gratitude to the city government of Stockholm  Copenhagen  Hamburg and West Berlin whose cooperation made it possible to photograph the authentic locales in the recreation of this true story. The motion picture is stunningly directed by George Seaton. Professional and polish writer and director who occasionally rose well above his average standard and was twice rewarded with Academy Award for so making . Seaton formed a partnership with William Perlberg  was to produce all Seaton's movies for several years. Both of them produced and directed the following successes as Miracle on 34th Street The country girl a monster Box office as Airport  another unusual War film as 36 hours and of course Counterfeit traitor.Based on true events  Erickson spied on German synthetic oil plants for the American OSS in World War II. At the outbreak of World War II Erickson offered his services to the United States. Pretending that he was a Nazi Erickson visited Germany more than 30 times between 1939 and 1945.Working with a few German industrialists and businessmen who were part of the conspiracy. He and his women accomplice were arrested. The woman however had been under suspicion as being a spy. The Germans concluded that Erickson was simply a businessman seeking sexual gratification but the woman was a spy. The Allies stepped up their bombing of Germany and Nazioccupied countries in 1943 but had difficulty in locating the oil refineries that kept Hitler's war machine moving. Erickson was told by his OSS spymasters that he had to locate the key refineries. Erickson and his wealthy German business friends he said planned to build a huge oil refinery in neutral Sweden safe from Allied bombers. This plant when running at peak capacity could deliver all the oil Germany might need. If he went ahead with his plans he explained he would want an exclusive contract with the Germans. Erickson then pointed out that he had few friends in Sweden because of his long association and loyalty to Nazi Germany. He also pointed out to the Gestapo chief that his name was on the Allied blacklist a fact that Himmler already knew and one that endeared Erickson to his cold heart. As they talked Himmler came quickly to believe that Erickson was an opportunist who had thrown in his lot with the Germans after they had scored lightning success through blitzkrieg invasions. He was also impressed in the detailed blueprints for the proposed Swedish oil refinery that Erickson had taken pains to prepare and submit for examination. Erickson then explained that before he and his partners put up their millions to build the plant he would have to inspect present oil refineries and receive from experts and technicians in the field all important information on operations in order to better build a highly productive refinery. Himmler authorized Erickson to travel anywhere in the Reich or occupied territories to investigate any oil refinery operation he wanted to see and to get from experts any information he desired in preparation of building the proposed refinery in Sweden. He was also given an order signed by Hitler that provided automobiles for Erickson . Erickson was shocked to run into a man he thought long dead a German oil executive he had formerly known . He told the Nazi that it was simply good business to have joined the Germans and that he was a businessman first and always. He told the man that he had been on the Allied blacklist for years after establishing friendships with German Nazis. He then played his trump card showing him his newlysigned Gestapo papers which bore the name of Heinrich Himmler .This seemed to convince the Nazi that Erickson was indeed to be trusted.In the months to follow the intrepid spy toured almost every major oil refinery in Germany and the occupied countries. He obtained detailed plans of oil operations and these quickly wound up in the hands of the OSS MI6 and subsequently the Allied air forces which then bombed the refineries out of existence. Lack of oil caused the surrender of more than 300000 German troops in the Ruhr Valley the last real threat in the West against the Allies. Following the war General Dwight D. Eisenhower attributed the Allied victory to the destruction of the German oil industry and almost all of the credit for that destruction was due to one man Eric Erickson.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I hear the title THE COUNTERFEIT TRAITOR I immediately think of my father because he often said it was his favorite spy film.Seeing it years later I understand why. WILLIAM HOLDEN was in the middle of a winning streak of films at this time and establishing a secure foothold on his reputation as one of Hollywood's finest actors.Since his role requires him to start as a cynical character before he becomes convinced of the justness of his cause it's a role that might well have gone to someone like HUMPHREY BOGART. But Holden fortunately got the part of the Swedish oil merchant who through extortion and blackmail is chosen by HUGH GRIFFITH to act as a spy against the Nazis in Denmark.He does so unwillingly at first but gradually through his meeting with another spy LILI PALMER in one of her best roles comes to see things the way she does. The moment Palmer comes into the film the plot thickens and interest mounts. The final result is a spy film that is truly mesmerizing able to get a powerful grip on your heart and emotions full of colorful action and intrigue.Stunning location photography in and around Copenhagen is a plus factor as is the rousing score by Alfred Newman. Holden has never been more persuasive in a role that fits him like a glove.Taken from a truelife story espionage tales don't come any better than this.".

The film really began to move when William Holden's love interest was arrested by the Gestapo and it became emotionally absorbing to its end.  The last hour of the film is as good as anything I've ever seen about the Second World War.  I was particularly fascinated by a scene where the Danish unite against the Nazis in a nonviolent protest with no weapons except bicycles and bells.  The small part of Klaus Kinsky is also very touching.  I highly recommend this film.".

Great story superb acting not just from William Holden and Lili Palmer but also the entire supporting European cast. Once again a great albeit small performance from Wolfgang Preiss Colonel Nordoff who has never given a bad performance that I've seen although some of his movies have been questionable he never is. The script is a standout especially the thoughtful treatment of how a person of conscience lives with the knowledge that her actions cause the death of innocents as well as the evil. Nothing is black and white in this movie. And for once the Germans are not all monsters. A truly absorbing tale one that can be enjoyed more than once. Some of today's screenwriters should take notes. And producers today should have the courage to spend less on special effects and more on a special story. The recent Enemy at the Gates is a movie that could have been so much better with a better script.People who like gripping stories and great acting in a WWII setting should definitely see John Frankenheimer's The Train with Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield...another outstanding and thoughtprovoking movie. We need more like these.".

His stories tend to wade neckdeep in sophismic quagmires aided and abetted by insolently visual splendours which however for the intelligent viewer will not succeed in covering up certain lackings which place this director a long way away from Buuel or even Saura if you push me. After having been besieged throughout his La Camarera del Titanic' which left me neither hot nor cold and wondering where the supposed story went under the overlay of irritating sumptuousness I ventured into watching Volavrunt' more from my personal interest in the famed Spanish artist Francisco Goya and to see how Aitana SnchezGijn and Penlope Cruz  who are intimate friends  would bear up rather than any attraction Bigas Luna might have.The story revolves around Goya's womanising and the mysterious death of the Duchess of Alba at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th Centuries at a time when Madrid was wobbling through a difficult time and setting the scene for the following Prim vs Crown uprising. The title of the film comes from the Duchess of Alba's euphemism for her most private parts supposedly revealed  in the famous painting La Maja Desnuda' but which in fact is another woman's body  possibly Pepita Tud Penlope Cruz. Las Majas' were originally called las gitanas' gypsy women but in those days maja' meant a liberal woman who enjoyed her sexuality and sensuality.The sets are superb at least as good as any other period piece films I have ever seen Franca Squarciapino's costumes are extravagantly magnificent Asturian courtyards heraldicemblazoned palaces and luxury carriages pass by in front of your eyes. But the story is stulted overwhelmed perhaps by such an immense visual banquet.Jordi Moll played an unconvincing Godoy you should see him in La Buena Estrella' qv. And as for our two lovely actresses I can only opine that Carlos Boyero in his insolent and infinitely unrefined article in El Mundo' when this film was shown at the San Sebastin film festival was right at least in saying that they are superbly beautiful but they too need rles which can show they are good actresses. Amen in Volavrunt' they were not able to show anything  apart from a fair amount of sexuality.At a grand gala dinner held in the midst of so many conspirations in and out of the royal palace a fascinating piece of music can be heard it is the last movement of El Retrato de Madrid' Portrait of Madrid by the Italian composer Luigi Boccherini who for many years was the Spanish Court's official maestro da capela this piece was composed some years later than the film's story.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have ill feelings about this movie because of its straighttovideo status then put those feelings aside and you'll be treated to a fun movie. This sequel succeeds where Bring It On Again miserably failed and let me tell you that movie failed BIG TIME!. Unlike the previous entry this third installment gets everything right with a likable  appealing cast killer dance routines a terrific soundtrack good story and better production values most likely thanks to product tieins from Cingular Teen People and Volks Wagon. While it doesn't top the original it still comes close as a worthy companion. The film borrows the same basic premise as the original pompous upperclass cheer squad this time the Pacific Vista Pirates vs urban middleclass cheer squad Crenshaw Heights Warriors. But thanks to a new twist involving the former captain of the Pacific Vista team having to transfer to Crenshaw Heights and join their squad the film focuses more on the racially diversified Crenshaw Heights Warriors and their pointofview. Much credit is due to writer Alyson Fouse a former writer for Chris Rock and Keenan Ivory Wayans and director Steve Rash who both do an admirable job of going back to what made the first film so great without making it seem like they're trying to do the exact same movie over again. The cast although made up of young unknowns should also be complimented for bringing the right amount of spark and attitude to their characters so that you can't help but like them no matter how stereotypical some of them may be. Which is more than can be said about the charmless bland wannabes from the second film. Going through the DVD's bonus features you'll be able to tell that the cast and filmmakers worked hard to make this movie live up to the original by having the cast go through rigorous training at cheerleader camp as well as hiring a variety of talented and innovative choreographers to come up with some unique and dazzling routines. So put all prejudices aside wash the awful taste of Bring It On Again out of your mouth and give this fun addition to the franchise a shot.".

But thanks to a new twist involving the former captain of the Pacific Vista team having to transfer to Crenshaw Heights and join their squad the film focuses more on the racially diversified Crenshaw Heights Warriors and their pointofview. Much credit is due to writer Alyson Fouse a former writer for Chris Rock and Keenan Ivory Wayans and director Steve Rash who both do an admirable job of going back to what made the first film so great without making it seem like they're trying to do the exact same movie over again. The cast although made up of young unknowns should also be complimented for bringing the right amount of spark and attitude to their characters so that you can't help but like them no matter how stereotypical some of them may be. Which is more than can be said about the charmless bland wannabes from the second film. Going through the DVD's bonus features you'll be able to tell that the cast and filmmakers worked hard to make this movie live up to the original by having the cast go through rigorous training at cheerleader camp as well as hiring a variety of talented and innovative choreographers to come up with some unique and dazzling routines. So put all prejudices aside wash the awful taste of Bring It On Again out of your mouth and give this fun addition to the franchise a shot.";

The second movie in my opinion was pretty poor it just tried too hard and didn't flow at all.That being said this film was definitely a step up from the second one and actually an entertaining movie. The story begins with Britney played by Hayden as cheer captain in a wealthy predominately white neighborhood. But when her father gets transferred they move to a lowerclass neighborhood predominately black and Hispanic. Having trouble fitting in she adapts as you would expect cheer leading.Now the movie itself has a very different feel when compared to its previous two successors. This movie has more profanity and prejudice then the other films. The ladies in the film are also showing more skin and dancing more sexually than either of the first 2 movies. It seems that the movie is trying to appeal to the older male crowd a little more than before.Now the movie has been getting a lot of trash for being a straight to DVD sequel but it really is not as bad as people would make it out to be. While it may not be as familyfriendly as the original Bring It On the third installment still is an entertaining movie to rent.".

But to my surprise it was really funny. The mix of urban street and high class attitudes was excellent. I thought the movie also showed both sides to the racial prejudice that we in the United States still face. They did not show a one side issue with upper class whites downgrading the minorities. They went on to show that the minority groups also have stereotypical attitudes about whites or people who live in the upper class of society. The ending was the best it had a dance challenged at the end that rocked the cheers were out of this world the audience were on their feet and filled the theater with laughter the whole movie. It was great the kids love it. Get it when it comes out you will not be disappointed. Great family movie with parental guidance not for younger children but the preteens will enjoy".

The whole movie had amusing lines scattered all the way through. my favorite Some of my best friends live next door to black people! The only criticism I'd have with this movie is that it was too flashy. The outfits were way more revealing than those of the first movie and there were so many people bouncing and jumping around that I had a hard time making sense of it all when they started their acrobatics.All in all though I would call this a chick flick that is not a chick flick. I don't consider the time I spent watching this wasted and I think it can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females.

	schema:reviewBody "Bring It On All or Nothing 2006 Directed By Steve Rash Starring Hayden Panettiere Solange KnowlesSmith Gus Caar Marcy Rylan  Cindy Chiu MPAA Rating PG13 for sexual humor and language The Bring It On series has never spawned deep intellectual movies but it has also never even attempted to do so. This series exists solely for the purpose of entertaining teens and thus far it has been quite successful. Yes to some extent the movies are silly and unbelievable but they are highly effective in entertaining audiences and making people have a good time while watching a movie. The first film starred Kirsten Dunst and Gabrielle Union and was quite a big hit drawing in nearly 70 million domestically on a 30 million budget. It gave birth to the obligatory sequel which went straighttovideo and was met with grunts and sneers from most fans of the original who were disappointed with the almost completely unknown cast and the lack of connections to the original. As soon as this sequel was released there was hardly a doubt on anyone's mind that a third movie would be made and would following the lead of the sequel go straight to video. And here we are. The third film entitled Bring It On All or Nothing is a vast improvement on the first sequel yet it still fails to completely produce the spark that ignited the original. It's still fun and original but just not as good.Britney Allen Panettiere has the perfect life at her posh high school. She is a senior the new cheerleading captain a shoein for Homecoming Queen and she has the perfect boyfriend Brad Jake McDorman. But weeks before Homecoming her father loses his job and she is forced to move to Crenshaw Heights a rough high school populated with tougher and more violent students. Britney proves herself to the overlyconfident cheerleading captain Camille KnowlesSmith and joins the squad. The team the Crenshaw Heights Warriors begin to prepare for a competition to perform on television with pop superstar Rihanna. However they are not the only ones preparing. Her former squad the Pacific Vista Pirates is also gearing up under the command of Britney's replacement Winnie Rylan a snobbish and cruel cheerleader. As both squads make a mad dash for the goal friendships will be tested and romances will crumble and possibly form. But only one squad can take home the grand prize. This is just the type of plot one should expect when a Bring It On film is announced. The plots are predictable rather shallow and always lead to some big faceoff between two archrival squads. They are merely excuses to string together laughs songs and cheerleading performances. Just ignore the ultimately pointless plot and enjoy the entertainment it brings. That is the important thing when talking about Bring It On All or Nothing.Bring It On All or Nothing suffers from one major problem and many minor problems. The major one is the overuse of racism and racial remarks. I understand that the biggest difference between these two squads is their race but this was also true in the original film and yet there was a limited number of racial comments. It seemed as though every character was a racist snob. Another problem was the almost constant cheesy dialog. I found myself chuckling during the romantic scenes and laughing out loud during the arguments. Does the screenwriter really think this is how teens talk? Teens should be offended that this is the way they are being portrayed. The performances are okaybut nothing too special. Hayden Panettiere does a good job and definitely gives the best performance. She was just so lovable. Solange KnowlesSmith a.k.a Beyonce's little sister also does a good job though I thought her character could have been developed a little more. She handles herself well though. Gus Caar just didn't do it for me. The boy may have the ability to make girls swoon but he doesn't handle the emotional notes as well as he should have. Marcy Rylan gave a comical performance as the villainess of the movie. She was convincing enough. Cindy Chiu was delightful.This may eliminate some of my respectability as a movie critic but I liked Bring It On All or Nothing. It wasn't smart innovative or original but it was a fun movie that kept me entertained. I found myself laughing and simply having a good time. Did I know what was going to happen? Sure. Did the movie overload on cheesy dialog? Definitely. But when the credits rolled I didn't feel as though I had wasted my time or money because if nothing else it was enjoyable. You will gain nothing of any value from this movie except for what you gain while watching it. It's a film that doesn't stay with you after it ends. This review is very hard to conclude as I have no strong feelings about this movie whatsoever. It's a movie so pointless and harmless that writing four paragraphs telling you why you should see it is almost just as pointless. I say this because if you were a fan of the first two films then you will no doubt see this regardless of what I say and if you hated the first two films then you most certainly will not be seeing this. My point of this review is not to sway you people but to sway those who have not seen the first two or enjoyed them but don't particularly remember them. To these people I say See it. It's a light watch filled with fresh faces and plenty of laughs. There is no harm in having a little fun.Final Thought Fun and entertaining Bring It On All or Nothing Is PointlessThough Completely Harmless.Overall Rating 610 B".

Despite what the movie makes you think there is no weight limit on a high school team and mainly on the upper level teams the weight limit is only for the flyer the person up at the top. also you are not able to step on or near the matfloor when other teams are competing  as in the scene when the battle they are not allowed to wear glitter unless they are an allstar team  a team that competes against a score card per sayyour hair must be put up you can not changeadd to your team at during the competition and the uniforms are illegal they are too short and reveling as well as a good 12 of the stunts that they preform are illegal to do on a high school team and even in a upper level team unless once again you are an all star team on top of that they make most of the cheerleaders  mainly the captions to look like they are always mean. and they make they make the cheerleaders look well like sluts...in almost every movie except the first. the writers did not research this topic as well as they should have. They should have put more time into the planning. do they not realize that ACTUAL cheerleaders would watch this? and do they not realize that little girls who want to be cheerleaders will also watch this and if this is what America is being shown as cheerleading it is a sad world we live in. It is a exausting dedicatedand very technical sport. all the sequels are sad and it is horrific that this is what they chose to portray cheerleading as a complete joke. it is a sport and it should be portrayed that way.".

Despite what the movie makes you think there is no weight limit on a high school team and mainly on the upper level teams the weight limit is only for the flyer the person up at the top. also you are not able to step on or near the matfloor when other teams are competing  as in the scene when the battle they are not allowed to wear glitter unless they are an allstar team  a team that competes against a score card per sayyour hair must be put up you can not changeadd to your team at during the competition and the uniforms are illegal they are too short and reveling as well as a good 12 of the stunts that they preform are illegal to do on a high school team and even in a upper level team unless once again you are an all star team on top of that they make most of the cheerleaders  mainly the captions to look like they are always mean. and they make they make the cheerleaders look well like sluts...in almost every movie except the first. the writers did not research this topic as well as they should have. They should have put more time into the planning. do they not realize that ACTUAL cheerleaders would watch this? and do they not realize that little girls who want to be cheerleaders will also watch this and if this is what America is being shown as cheerleading it is a sad world we live in. It is a exausting dedicatedand very technical sport. all the sequels are sad and it is horrific that this is what they chose to portray cheerleading as a complete joke. it is a sport and it should be portrayed that way.";

Bring it on All or Nothing is a good movie to watch. I especially liked Hayden Panettiere who played the role of Britney. There isn't anything wrong with the film there just isn't anything special about it either. Bring it on All or Nothing is a good movie to watch especially for preteens. The stunts in the movie were awesome. They did really cool lifts and stuff. Bring it on All or Nothing is about a girl Britney who is the captain of her school's Pacific Vista High School cheerleading squad. She has a boyfriend and a couple of best friends. There is one girl Winnie played by Marcy Rylan who wants to take Britney's place. When Britney's dad has to relocate because of his job Britney has to switch schools to Crenshaw Heights where she doesn't fit in and Winnie gets her wish. She also ends up stealing Britney's boyfriend Brad played by Jake McDorman. Britney has to adjust to life at her new school. She vows to her friends at Pacific Vista that she will never cheer again. Long behold she breaks that promise and joins the cheerleading squad at Crenshaw Heights. There is some drama and conflict. In the end Crenshaw Heights and Pacific Vista compete in an audition for Rihanna.".

Even if it is not a total mirror it is impossible to watch this film without seeing Allen's influence all over it.  So immediately large sections of the audience will want to turn off however I love Allen so am happy to give this a shot on that basis alone.  As a film it's plot is just a collection of messy relationship through which Carrie sorry Gwyn learns lessons.  It isn't substance rich but that's the point  instead it is quick and rather witty never sitting still for very long but being quite fun with it.The cast also helps as they do some very fun turns despite some weaknesses. Parker is good and her New York personae certainly seems to fit the material.  Bellows is rather bland for the role but there are some great little bits from Banderas Farrow and Mazursky.  It's always good to see Pollack and Piven but Campbell demonstrates why she hasn't moved into a successful film career by reading her lines with all the emotion of iron although she looked great in the beachshoot scene.Overall this is a fun little film that is quite slick if you are a fan of Woody Allen's relationship neurosis films.  If you're not then you'll probably do well to avoid this film.".

It was super refreshing to see a neurotic thinking womens role that toyed with the notion of marriage and commitment.

My brother cheating on his wife so here's my Oneliner. Her character doesn't exist before the movie it like she's born yesterday.She did not come from a broken home and was not abused as a child so why all the cynicism.  A line did mention that she never went out much back in high school because she was so skinny A Hat Rack her words not mine If so she must have been Invisible because she still is skinny.The movie wasn't so bad it had a good pace the scenes without Parker are actually great even though there are few not that's  her fault. The flashbacks are well placed it would have been better if the Writerdirector had taken five minutes just 5 min to build Gwyn's neurosis right in the being of the movie and then maybe a Flashback or two then I could have felt connected to her but instead the writer just hands them out to her and all the characters in the film like a lottery. Speaking of the lottery the studio must have had a raffle and the director must have won permission to make this movie in that contest.

Yes it does mimic the style usually associated with Woody Allen but that is not  a bad trait.  There have been numerous films fashioned to replicate Allen's choices most recently The Sidewalks of New York the Ed Burns film from 2001.And although Miami Rhapsody is not as good as Allen's best works it is a well structured and a wellacted piece. Sarah Jessica Parker is well suited for the movie and as always she plays her  part well.  Mrs. Parker is not an actress with great range but when plugged into  the right project she shines.  Her delivery and timing in comedic roles has always been reliable even if she has been in some very poor movies e.g. If Lucy Fell Hocus Pocus Striking Distance.  She has established herself as a  star in the past few years on Sex and the City and her character in Miami Rhapsody is very similar like Carrie's longlost doppleganger living in Florida.This film is definitely worth watching if you enjoy Sex and the City and the  sharp writing and likable characters make the viewing of this movie extremely  enjoyable whether it is your first second or third time seeing it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every movie's title needs to make sense and this one Miami Rhapsody makes perfect sense.  It is set in Miami and the definition of rhapsody is a highly emotional utterance  a highly emotional literary work  effusively rapturous or extravagant discourse.  The short synopsis is this  mid20s girl is engaged to be married has a great relationship with her livein boyfriend but suddenly she in succession finds out that all those close to her even mom and dad are having marital problems and she begins to have serious doubts if marriage is the right thing.  In the end she says Marriage is a lot like Miami. It is hot and stormy and dangerous but if it is so bad then why is there still so much traffic?The writing and diolog delivery are very clever and the editing is just so good I found myself constantly marveling at how good that part of the film is. I like Woody Allen in small doses but this one I seemingly never tire of.CAUTION  SPOILERS FOLLOW Sarah Jessica Parker is great in the lead. Now I understand the Woody Allen references. In fact imagine a female delivering Woody Allenesque lines and you have Sarah's role in this film. Antonio Banderas as the Latin lover who seduces her mother Mia Farrow and comes very close to bedding her too is also excellent. The one big problem I have with this film is its apparent cavalier treatment of infidelity. When mom first tells daughter she suspects dad is having an affair and daughter later discusses it with dad the subject could well have been dad has hair on his back. That's how calm and accepting they all were of infidelity and the same later when it is revealed that mom is also bedding grandma's male nurse Banderas.  Similar to the various other couples who are cheating on their spouses.The film starts and ends with Parker in her therapist's office all the time talking into the camera. The film is done as a series of flashbacks with commentary after she tells the therapist that once she was engaged. She ends up losing the man but her parents and also all the other couple infidels all realize that they had simply given in to temptation and in the end loved and appreciated their mates and all was heading in the right direction. And Parker's character learned that in spite of all its pitfalls relationships and marriage are still worth pursuing. So allinall it is a personal growth movie involving primarily Parker's character and the rhapsody told in the film is solely to show how she achieved that.  I rate it a very solid 7 of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "If I had a cool fake last name and a semisuccessful pseudometal band in the 90s maybe I would be approached to direct a retelling of a horror classic to make a ton of money for the studio.If I was I would keep in mind all the elements that made Halloween '78 so popular and leave them exactly how they were such as prolonged steadycam shots to give the sense that of The Shape's point of view a minimal but chilling soundtrack to add to the tension a brave heroine who isn't a helpless idiot and keeping the antagonist off screen for at least the first half of the movie to build the tension. This was the formula for all the great horror and suspense movies such as Psycho The Exorcist Jaws and the first Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street movies and I would keep true to it in my Halloween remake.The only things I would fix in my retelling would be little things that my larger budget would certainly allow. I would make the sets of Haddonfield Illinois in October look less like Southern California in April. My actresses portraying teenagers would not be in their late 20s or early 30s and I would eliminate small holes in the plot like the opening scene of Michael's sister making out with her boyfriend upstairs for only 40 seconds before he leaves and the sheriff responding to a breakin at the hardware store during normal business hours usually burglar alarms don't sound during shoplifting. I would also pick a year that my remake was supposed to take place and stick to it. I wouldn't confuse the audience by having people with sort of retro fashions and hairstyles driving pristine cars from the 60s and 70s and kids on stingray bikes that haven't been seen in 25 years but at the same time modern police cars and cell phones.I understand Rob Zombie's temptation to answer questions that all of us have had about Michael Myers such as why is he so intent on killing people and why does he insist on wearing a mask? The problem is in answering the questions and telling about Michael's background Michael becomes more human and therefore less scary. Even Zombie's choice of explanation is suspect. The audience expects a tormented kid from a crappy home to turn out disturbed but a bad kid from a seemingly normal home seems a lot scarier since it could happen to anyone. Halloween '78 got this part right as well. Not everything in this movie is completely inferior to the original hence my rating of 4 stars. The sets look thousands times better than the original. The actresses seem more believable as teenagers than in the original and we get to see a lot more of them. The new scene of Michael ripping up floorboards in his old house to get his mask and knife was pretty cool too.As for the rest of the movie it is an interesting study in what truly comes across as suspenseful on a screen. Is a powerful 6'8 antagonist scarier than one who appears and vanishes into the shadows? probably not. Does gratuitous gore and language actually distract from the suspense? yes. Does the inclusion of well known rocksongs for more than 5 seconds at a time really kill the mood? absolutely and it also interferes with the classic soundtrack. This was also a problem in Halloween 2. Are dizzying quick MTV jump cuts scarrier than long steady shots? see for yourself and decide. In a way Rob Zombie had an impossible task of making a sequel even if it was called remake or retelling when everyone already knew about Michael and what was going to happen thereby removing almost all of the suspense. However that doesn't excuse leaving out the opening title sequence with a simple black background pulsating theme music and the off center poorlycarved Jack O Lantern giving a sense of foreboding. I am almost certain there was a fantastic eerie version of the classic 58 theme played on an outoftune honky tonk piano that was played in a trailer for Halloween '07. It would have worked perfectly for such an opening sequence but sadly it was omitted for the actual movie.Don't expect a lot from this movie like being scared or entertained but if you watch it to study what truly works in horror movies and what doesn't it is worthwhile viewing. When it comes to horror less is more since nothing is more powerful than the viewer's imagination.Remember that Rob.".

	onyx:emotionText "If I had a cool fake last name and a semisuccessful pseudometal band in the 90s maybe I would be approached to direct a retelling of a horror classic to make a ton of money for the studio.If I was I would keep in mind all the elements that made Halloween '78 so popular and leave them exactly how they were such as prolonged steadycam shots to give the sense that of The Shape's point of view a minimal but chilling soundtrack to add to the tension a brave heroine who isn't a helpless idiot and keeping the antagonist off screen for at least the first half of the movie to build the tension. This was the formula for all the great horror and suspense movies such as Psycho The Exorcist Jaws and the first Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street movies and I would keep true to it in my Halloween remake.The only things I would fix in my retelling would be little things that my larger budget would certainly allow. I would make the sets of Haddonfield Illinois in October look less like Southern California in April. My actresses portraying teenagers would not be in their late 20s or early 30s and I would eliminate small holes in the plot like the opening scene of Michael's sister making out with her boyfriend upstairs for only 40 seconds before he leaves and the sheriff responding to a breakin at the hardware store during normal business hours usually burglar alarms don't sound during shoplifting. I would also pick a year that my remake was supposed to take place and stick to it. I wouldn't confuse the audience by having people with sort of retro fashions and hairstyles driving pristine cars from the 60s and 70s and kids on stingray bikes that haven't been seen in 25 years but at the same time modern police cars and cell phones.I understand Rob Zombie's temptation to answer questions that all of us have had about Michael Myers such as why is he so intent on killing people and why does he insist on wearing a mask? The problem is in answering the questions and telling about Michael's background Michael becomes more human and therefore less scary. Even Zombie's choice of explanation is suspect.

	schema:reviewBody "Rob Zombie has made a career of all things horror. From the musical group White Zombie to his own solo career in comics with his monster fighting character El Superbeasto and into films. His first two forays House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects tied into one another nicely with the second film being a sequel to the first. But with his third film Halloween Zombie falls short of offering not only scares but signs of a developmental director.Everyone already knows the tale of Michael Myers the psychopath from Haddonfield IL who murdered his sister only to be committed to an institution he would later escape from with the intent of more killings back home years later. While that is the basis for Zombie's film it is not a remake but more of a retelling a reinvention of the same character.Here we are offered young Michael and the household he grows up in that forms his life. Michael's mother Sheri Moon Zombie is a stripper saddled with a new husband William Forsythe who is disabled and a ne'er do well more interested in yelling at the kids than in offering any sort of role model. Michael's sister is a trashy sleep with anyone teen who dresses provocatively and does little else. All of this is not lost on Michael who spends his time killing his pets and taking photos of them. What we are being offered is a textbook glimpse as to why a youngster becomes a serial killer. The nice middle class family shown in the original is tossed aside for this new group. And in this first portion of the film the problems Zombie has are apparent.Zombie has filled three films now with the same characters. Sure they may have different names and different small time characteristics but the fact remains that he focuses on the dysfunctional family and their housecleaning inabilities. Yes it seems that all families in Zombie's world can't clean to save themselves. Not only that but they all have the same dingy look to their living quarters as well as references to pop culture. The house Michael grows up in could be a home that the Firefly family would feel comfortable in. It all looks the same and that detracts greatly from the viewing experience unless of course you'd never seen another Rob Zombie film.Comparisons to the original film are inevitable and this will most likely be the downfall of the film in the long run. Michael goes overboard with his murderous rampage as a child in this film unlike the original. Where no blood was seen in that film it flows freely now. Perhaps this is due to the changing times but it adds nothing to the scares of the film or the character. It does make him a more brutal killer leaving him one without a touch of sympathy. But the mindless killer from the original is replaced by someone we feel absolutely nothing for now.Once finished with the whole back story of young Michael his family and the kindly Dr. Loomis Michael McDowell who takes care of him at the institution we move forward 15 years to when Michael escapes and heads back home. The body count increases once more as he kills everyone he comes into contact with their including a worker who had befriended him. Once out the story becomes more familiar almost a duplicate of the original shot from different angles with different actors and focusing less on the character of Laurie Strode the central character in John Carpenter's version.Laurie and her friends are nothing more than meat to be slaughtered by Michael in this one. There is no development of character no reason for us to think of them as more than teens in peril that we have seen in hundreds of other slasher flicks. While we cared about the original teens this time around they seem less human and placed in our way for two reasons to be killed by Michael and to offer more exposed flesh than the first.By the film's end we are offered the traditional sliced and diced teens gratuitous nudity and enough blood to make a special effects company weep for joy at the size of their bill. But we have gained nothing in the iconography that is Michael Myers. While we are given more background on him we care less about him than we ever did.Worst of all is the fact that Rob Zombie a director that showed such great potential before seems to be telling us after only three films that this is all he has to offer. Stories told from the same world a world that blasts apart the whole Father Knows Best world we would all like it to be. In his world there is no caring parent. And when they are caring they are twisted in some revolting way.I haven't given up on Zombie yet though. Having recently signed a two picture deal with the Weinstein's perhaps he will show us he has more tricks up his sleeve than he let on. But if he returns to the carny soiled world he's offered in three films to date then it looks as though he's a one note director. Let's hope he offers us more. It's in there somewhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into the theater with very few expectations except for one This new Halloween movie was going to have great atmosphere and chills. I was confident it would be one scary movie and I was really looking forward to it.The first ten minutes go by and I'm laughing quite a bit. I thought to myself is this supposed to be a comedy? Am I in the wrong theater? I figure maybe Rob Zombie made it funny at first as an odd way to hook the audience.Suffice to say I'm still waiting to be scared. This movie had no atmosphere and did not scare me in the least. Sure some of the killings were gross but none were scary. And where was the 1970's style horror atmosphere? I thought Rob Zombie loved 1970's style horror movie making as do I. Halloween is 1970's horror served up on a silver platter.This isn't a bad movie overall very average if you ask me but it is a less than stellar Halloween remake or reimagining. It just doesn't work as a different take on Halloween. It's almost as if Rob Zombie took an old story he created about a kid with a totally messed up family life who becomes a serial killer and said Hey. I'll just make this kid Michael Myers. His explanation of Michael Myers while very well acted especially by the little boy just didn't ring true to me. The boy becomes a serial killer because of a bad family life? Clich and uninspiring to say the least. The footage of him in the asylum was even worse. Awful and boring are words I would use to describe the asylum footage. And the writing and acting for the Dr. Loomis character was laughably poor. It got to the point where I laughed every time he was in a scene. Spoiler And the ending. The endearing quality of the original 1978 film is the ending. The imagery of seeing Dr. Loomis looking out the window at the spot where The Shape should be is the most compelling and powerful portion of the film. I literally was so scared I couldn't even move when I saw the original the first time. Fantastic imagery and a fantastic ending to the movie.Rob Zombie chose to include the silly Laurie Strode is my sister addon angle from Halloween II but chose an ending that is neither clever nor endearing. It's your average bloody girl somehow is lucky enough to survive and kill the knocked out bad guy. Folks that's not what the original Halloween is all about.I guess I assumed wrongly that Rob Zombie understood what Halloween was about originally. Or maybe he didn't have complete creative control as claimed. Either way what I saw was a decent horror movie but a very poor take on the original Halloween.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all as a movie in general I though was less than average. As a remake it was beep horrible. People will always say Oh this is a different movie not the original don't compare. It's a remake how could you not beep compare First I always had a problem with a backstory Michael was pure evil without one. Michael was so evil because he had no reason to kill he just did. He was pure evil in human form there was no rhyme or reason for what he did. Okay a backstory doesn't have to be terrible but it answers nothing.People say that this answers the question that had lurked in everyone's mind since the first 10 minutes of the original Why is Michael the way he is. No it doesn't at least not under the circumstances presented in the original. In that one Michael has a nice and clean home with two well kept and fitting looking parents and a sister that seemed horny but not a slut. In this one the father is mysteriously dead and a filthy white trash piece of beep who has no respect for women especially two very attractive ones takes his place. The house is a decrepit place the mother is a stripper and it seems to be a white trash haven. Anyone can give a reason for Michael's rage in this way just throw everything that was presented to the table in the original and put unoriginal stuff on it. The backstory itself is unoriginal and stupid.The first 5 minutes already answer the question to Michael's rage it's not drawing us in. Imagine the backstory starts with two clean and nice parents who are loving and in a nice home. That would be better because the audience will be engrossed with all these questions Whoa what the hell his life seems pretty nice. I wonder what will happen to make him evil. That is original and gets the audience interested right away because Myer's life seems perfect but then an event happens and so on. In the remake it looks like someone watched a documentary on serial killers and threw it in the movie. It's not original or new it's used and boring. I wanted something that really surprises the audience about Michael and answers the question on his rage under the same circumstances as in the original but in an unsuspecting and surprising manner.All right now for my biggest complaint in character development Loomis. I remember in the original Loomis was a take charge type of guy who showed no mercy when he tried to find Michael. He never hesitated or gave up a chance to kill Michael because he knew he was pure evil. Loomis in this one calls Michael his best friend and is sympathetic to him. Then the next scene he is calling him pure evil and the antiChrist. WTF. If Loomis thinks Michael is pure evil why does he try to negotiate with him hesitates to shoot him and is remorseful towards him. The original had Loomis never resting till he found his evil patient. This one he wastes time talking about his book and other crap. Especially in this one Loomis should be more eager than ever since Michael kills 5 people as opposed to 1 as a child. People will say this Loomis is so much more caring and polite. Lets think for a second. Loomis has spent 15 years of his life trying to get through Michael. He soon realizes Michael is pure evil and tries to get him transferred People think he's an idiot and what happens? Myers escapes and they blame the whole thing on him. Would you be beep polite after all that and now you have a murderer on the loose and only you know how he works? I sure hell as wouldn't. Loomis in the original was more realistic knew what he was dealing with and took every chance he had to kill Myers before he kills anyone else.Now let's look at the slasher himself Michael Myers. They took a true and pure evil villain who tortured and murdered his whole family and made him into a sympathetic antihero who only wants to be with his sister Laurie. Michael never tries to kill Laurie in this one at least not in general circumstances. Instead he tries to be with her. Michael used to be a villain who stabbed and tried to strangle his sister but now he's just a loving but murderous brother. The only times where he appears to want to kill her are times when he's reacting in anger not evil. Michael used to be the villain everyone was rooting for to be killed I still love the scene where Loomis shoots the hell out of Michael in the original. This one Michael is not evil at all just some misguided fool. I can't watch this feeling sorry for the villain.The movie itself is used and boring the stuff used from the original is rushed and a cheap knockoff in this one. The murders are rushed and someone gets killed every 2 seconds. My favorite kill in the first one was when Michael strangled to girl with the phone line because it looked so painful when she was gasping for air. This one he just grabs and her and 2 seconds later she's dead. The murders and stabbing sounds are fake looking and sounding and the gore is way too exaggerated. One person gets stabbed one and then there are oceans of blood. This movie was not scary in any shape or form and it ruined the image of Myers. No longer is he pure evil but a misguided and sympathetic fool who just wants love. By the end of the movie I had to watch the original to chafe the bad taste in my stomach from this one.".

Malcolm McDowell is a good actor and I am surprised that he went for this part it was very weak and I feel sorry for him that he has had to add this to movies he has been involved with! On a side note his character seem so self absorbed in the movie that honestly I am not surprised poor Michael Myers stopped talking he was probably hoping the good doc would shut the hell up or eventually go away lol! I could see that maybe Rob Zombie was going for the more real Michael Myers a screwed up kid and why he was that way. If left at that and nothing to do with Halloween he could have had something really good IMHO however the constant back and forth of making Michael Myers real as opposed to a remake of the old movie was just annoying and God awful! My advise AVOID THIS MOVIE WITH A TEN FOOT BARGE POLE as we say back in the old country lol! Or if you have to absolutely see this tragedy of a bastardization of a cult classic don't even rent it borrow it from some other poor sap that paid the rental fee!".

I'll also admit I have the Michael Myers doll that plays the music. Huge fan. So when I heard RZ was remaking this I was a little peeved. Then I started to see some of the previews and actually became excited about it. So I DID go in with an open mind. The best way to sum this up is that RZ COMPLETELY missed the point of what made Michael so scary in the first place. The fact that there WAS no reason no conscience no sense of ANYTHING. He was and I quote purely and simply evil. He IS in essence the boogyman. Trying to shove down my throat the fact that he became like that because his family was white trash is NOT scary. If I wanted to watch Jerry Springer I would have stayed home. RZ if you read this you need to realize that gore does not mean scary. It was not necessary in the 1978 original yet that remains some 30 YEARS LATER the GREATEST horror movie of all time. What does that tell you????".

	schema:reviewBody "This comment is for people who have already seen the movie. The way Michael Myers is able to break through the chains and kill four prison guards and not get hurt at all is insanely unrealistic. Also regarding that scene they would've had that whole killing on a hidden camera and more guards would go to Myers and attempt to stop him. That part was where I really became upset with the film. Other unrealistic parts of the movie were when Dr. Loomis shoots Myers I believe three times and hits what seems like around the heart every time and Myers still gets up no less than two minutes later and continues to kill people with ease. Also on a couple occasions when people would have a gun pointed at Myers and not shoot and give him time to destroy them that made me think What the heck are they doing not shooting this maniac? They have a perfect shot every time yet they seem to freeze up. And when the girl stabs Myers in the neck or maybe it was the back but if it was the neck there is no way he is surviving that yet he was able to just pull the knife out of his neck and continue trying to kill the girl. There are other parts that were really just not impressive and it made me highly disappointed with the quality of the film. It seemed to me that Rob Zombie and others who wrote and had a hand in directing and writing and producing the movie just wanted to make it as bloody as possible and just focus on the shock value but there is more to a horror movie than just making the people in the audience throw up in their seats after being overwhelmed by gallons of blood spray throughout the silver screen. I wouldn't recommend it you can spend your money in a more wise way on a better horror movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like a lot of viewers had high hopes going into this movie. Usually I am a Rob Zombie fan as he has made some good horror flicks in the past. This however was not one of them. I agree with a lot of folks that the back story on Mikey's upbringing made him seem human and not as scary as the original. The original Michael never uttered a sound except the disturbing breathing sounds uttered from his mask. This character talked for probably the first 30 minutes and actually was kind of funny when he was talking to Dr. Loomis. He seemed like a dorky kid who one day started slaughtering every person he encountered except his mother and baby brother? sister? I thought it was a boy until the plot developed further. When he grows up he is ridiculously huge and looks like a member of Slipknot. From here the movie really begins to derail badly. Shamelessly ripping off lines from the first movie quick sex and even quicker violence is only half the problem with this movie. My personal favorite was the Ben Trammer reference from the first movie that was thrown in there for obvious comic effect. Where Rob Zombie really failed in this movie was how Laurie Strode was portrayed. In the original Jamie Lee Curtis was a sweet naive girl who was scared to talk to boys and had an innocence about her. This incarnation of Laurie Strode is your typical high school slutand ultimately we don't care if she lives or dies. My least favorite part of the movie was the darkness of it and the insane fight scenes between Mikey and Laurie. For like the last 30 minutes they are fighting in what seems like pitch black. I understand what Zombie was trying to do but it was annoying. Because of this the viewer really did not know what the hell was going on. Laurie was in the walls the ceilings the fence and the whole time Mikey was jabbing his knife or stick into these attempting to kill her. It was hard to even see what was going on. Then the movie has a false ending and then really ends. Who cares at this point? What a shame. My high point of the movie was seeing the lovely Danielle Harris topless for about ten minutes. All in all this movie was a waste. Poor story bad coloring in the film although nice topless scene with Danielle Harris. Preceed at your own risk.".

All of his films have been sub par for me and the only reason I saw this was because I'm having a bit of a gore fest and I heard that this version of Halloween did in fact have some blood in it.I'm also not a big fan of the original. I thought the pace was a bit slow BUT none the less the original Halloween was a film with a smart concept. IE. to show what evil would be like if it was simply a force of nature.It was a unique interpretation of what evil could be like. This was not some killer with a motive to his crimes. This was not something that could be explained or reasoned with it was just evil and that was it.It was such a simple yet interesting idea. So many films try to explain away inhuman acts and Halloween just said screw it and didn't explain a thing. For that alone I understand why it is held so highly even if I couldn't get into it.Anyways If you have seen Halloween the original then you've seen this. This isn't a recreation of Halloween. All this is is a two bit back story stapled onto the Halloween we already have. Myers is given a back story which obviously isn't needed because why doe Myers even need a motive? Once the back story is doneI admit it is a long back story but only cause it's dragged out the original Halloween starts. Entire scenes are shamefully recreated. Lines from the original are used instead of new dialog. Really the only 'new' things this film brings to the table is bloodwhich isn't needed despite my gore fest nudity the two note back story and a rape scene which fits in with Halloween about as well as a flying pig in Friday the 13th.Other then that every scene from the original is simply reused and poorly.The scenes that Rob does add come off as jokes. There is an actual scene not kidding that plays Love Hurts to make us feel sorry for Myers. There Myers is crying his eyes out and about to kill his whole family and the song Love Hurts is blaring over the film. I have never seen such a cheap scam to get a tear from the viewer.The list goes on and on for flaws in this film but I'll just stop it there. Happy Halloween oh I mean Christmas. Man even the release date was screwed up.".

	schema:reviewBody "And so it goes that Rob Zombie great horror mastermind and irrelevant metal vocalist takes on one of my personal favorites in the Hollywood horror genre and promptly reduces it to the value of a single piece of dog feces.I rated this film a 4 not because it had much value but that I simply could not bring myself to give it the rating it truly deserves  a zero. The film starts off in decent fashion giving us insight into the mind of the childhood Michael Myers yet the film fails to explain why exactly this background is even relevant. All I know is that the little kid cast as Michael in the film looked like he did more drugs than Sheri Moon who played his mother. That's a lot of drugs. The only scenes he didn't looked completely stoned in were scenes in which he inexplicably appeared to gain 75 pounds in his face. An odd phenomenon and one of the few pseudointeresting things happening in this movie.Aside from the blubberfaced stoner kid we are treated to a girl cast as the heroine who literally begs the audience to hate her. The person who actually did the casting for this film must have had serious drugalcohol issues to cast the little punk Scout TaylorCompton as Laurie in this film. Not only does she display the single most annoying voice in the history of horror cinema her character is one that I actually WANTED to see get beaten repeatedly with a blunt instrument. Her acting skills aside her dress her appearance her character lines...all simply cried out Please Michael kill me for the pleasure of the audience. Unfortunately like so many things in this movie that wish is not delivered as Laurie survives through the entirety of this travesty of a film.Terrible cast aside let's look at key scenes that were omitted. The classic laundry room scene the equally compelling scene where Tommy sees the Boogey Man carrying his victim around the neighboring house as he stares out the window....these classic scenes are totally gone. Scenes from the original that Rob did remake in the film are pointless almost pathetic in their attempts to top the original scenes. And the fact that the film establishes Laurie is Michaels sister from the getgo is a terrible idea that completely erases the creepy randomness of Michaels attacks.In closing if you want to see a classic horror film see the original Halloween. If you want to see a classic horror film get completely raped and pillaged see Rob Zombies Halloween.".

	onyx:emotionText "And so it goes that Rob Zombie great horror mastermind and irrelevant metal vocalist takes on one of my personal favorites in the Hollywood horror genre and promptly reduces it to the value of a single piece of dog feces.I rated this film a 4 not because it had much value but that I simply could not bring myself to give it the rating it truly deserves  a zero. The film starts off in decent fashion giving us insight into the mind of the childhood Michael Myers yet the film fails to explain why exactly this background is even relevant. All I know is that the little kid cast as Michael in the film looked like he did more drugs than Sheri Moon who played his mother. That's a lot of drugs. The only scenes he didn't looked completely stoned in were scenes in which he inexplicably appeared to gain 75 pounds in his face. An odd phenomenon and one of the few pseudointeresting things happening in this movie.Aside from the blubberfaced stoner kid we are treated to a girl cast as the heroine who literally begs the audience to hate her.

However when it gets to present day the story line skips through sections and you get the feeling of bad editing. Plus all the jumping around leads to no character development and a group of teenagers we could care less about. To put in plainly there is no suspense in this movie. Even though Zombie adds his own touch and scenarios to the story line he never gives the audience a feeling of dread. Unlike the original there are no moments of run' look out behind you and all the edge of your seat stuff. It's just cut to scene kids are killed cut to next scene.Even the cameos are wasted. Take the Spiderman movies for example. In each one Bruce Campbell steals the scene he is in. This movie had countless cameos by some of the best in B movies and horror films. For the most part none of them leave a mark.At times this movie feels like a remake at times a sequel and at times a reenvisioning. Never does it feel like a good movie. definitely not worthy of the title.".

Halloween'70's was absolutely perfect in every aspect in my opinion it's the scariest movie of all time. But when I heard that Rob Zombie was on to direct this movie I actually thought for a minute there was a possibility this may be a good remake. I saw it this morning at the theater I am in absolute disgust. Just it's not like he just remade the movie into his own idea no he took some of John Carpenter's excellent ideas and just made them into crap. Now I'm separating this from the original Halloween2007 was actually by itself a bad film. Which really disappointed me since The Devil's Rejects was done so well this was just a typical stupid unoriginal slasher movie. Now Rob had a good idea where he developed Michael's character in the beginning where we had a better idea on why he became Michael Myers. But after that everything went downhill because Rob just rushed all the other IMPORTANT characters so they got no development whatsoever.Mike Myers is a tormented kid his mom is a stripper his step dad is an alcoholic jerk his big sister treats him bad and he is picked on at school. But he kills small animals as well leading him to go onto bigger things like humans. He massacres his family excluding his mom and his baby sister he is taken to a mental institution and escapes 15 years later and is going after Laurie his baby sister who is now grown up and is preparing her and her friends for a night of hell.The acting on the teenage girl's parts was just horrendous like extremely bad I was actually hoping for them to get killed how sad was that? Laurie was just a whiny little priss not at all likable like Jamie's performance same with the other two girls they couldn't live up to the other performances. These girls were just annoying not likable at all while the other actresses at least had that going for them and made them likable vicitims. But it just seemed like they wanted their 15 minutes or some kind of big break because it didn't even take them 10 minutes to take their tops off. On a movie on it's own it's just too unoriginal and I'm disappointed in Rob because I thought he was really improving. Comparison to the original Halloween perhaps Rob should have read the tag line THE ONE THE ONLY HALLOWEEN because this was a huge slap to John Carpenter's face on his brilliant classic.210".

	schema:reviewBody "I think Rob Zombie is a talented film maker. I thought his first two efforts were perfect homages to the genre he professes to love. He subtly tipped his cap to the pinnacles of the genre and yet still managed to show us his own style. When I heard he was taking on Halloween it made me nervous. Halloween is the best of the bunch. With all due respect to Psycho which Halloween tried to emulate Halloween is just so much better than any other horror film ever produced. I realize this is not an empirical statement but the quality of Halloween and the influence it has over a plethora of horror films is. There is simply no getting around it Halloween is the best of the best. I say this because for Zombie to want to remake the pinnacle of horror takes a lot of balls and it had better of been a faithful retelling of the story or it won't work. This film sadly doesn't work. In fact it stinks.Rob Zombie either has no understanding at all of the Michael Myers character or he just doesn't care. Perhaps he needed a hit after his first two films were well received by the critics surprisingly but did little business at the box office. Or perhaps he thought all of today's jilted youth would flock to it and somehow relate to the Myers character. Let's revisit the original 1978 Halloween. The film presents us with a child who for no apparent reason at all stabs his sister to death. As Dr. Loomis tells us there is no rhyme no reason and no understanding behind his eyes. He seems like he is a normal kid with a nuclear family who just takes a large knife and slaughters his sister on Halloween night. It is simply evil that motivates him. This idea that an incarnation of evil could just snap is what made the film so FRIGHTENING. He spends the next fifteen years in an institution just waiting. He doesn't speak or move or show an intelligent signs of life or even a modicum or human understanding. He just waits for Halloween night and then guided by evil he escapes. IT Michael Myers escapes Smith's Grove and heads to Haddonfield and goes after his only remaining family member. Why? Who knows. It is never really explained. But we are left with is pure and unadulterated evil on a mission of death. Dr. Sam Loomis was the only person who knew this. No one else believed him or took heed to his warnings. They just left Loomis and his pet patient alone. Loomis' world has become one that is spent making sure that Myers never leaves Smith's Grove. It drives him almost to the brink of insanity. He wants to make sure that Myers is never let out of the institute.These themes are tantamount to what made Halloween such a brilliant piece of film making. I don't think another movie will ever capture the feeling of evil and doubt and fear quite like Halloween.When you look at Zombie's white trash version the first five minutes of the film are like a slap in the face and it makes you cringe.Zombie literally slaps you in the face and decides to give us a reason as to why Myers is the way he is. And what do you think that is? He is from a white trash trailer park family. The evil and disgusting stepfather the stripper mother and the whorish sister. The family speak like drunken sailors and go on about things that just don't resonate. And then of course you get Myers being bullied at school. So we have the personification of evil being evil because his step father is a jerk and kids beat him up. Are you kidding me? So basically Michael Myers goes from a character that represents complete evil and lack of humanity to a tortured nutcase that snaps. When in the original he was just EVIL.What is also terrible in the film is the writing and the dialogue of every character. Where Carpenter and Debra Hill shared the writing duties in the original Zombie does it all here and his juvenile rantings of the female characters in here is just wrong and even his kindergarten like interpretation of Loomis is terrible. Malcolm McDowell is fine as the good doctor but Zombie betrays him with psyche 101 babblings of what he thinks Loomis would say. What makes it that much more frustrating is that Zombie says he loves films like Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And instead of emulating what made those so effective he dumped all over the Halloween legacy. This might have been a decent horror film but it is not a Halloween film. He doesn't understand Halloween Myers Loomis or any of Carpenter's brilliance. He hacks away at it for the Facebook generation and it is a nauseating experience. This movie resembles more of a rock video than it does an iconic horror film. And that is sad. Even worse is kids who haven't seen the original might actually like this repulsive version.This is the worst horror remake ever and that includes Psycho.DO NOT SEE THE HALLOWEEN REMAKE.".

	schema:headline " A Gory Bastardization of a Horror Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "The basic problem with Rob Zombie's remake of the classic horror flick Halloween comes from its purpose. The only reason he should have even considered attempting such a feat is if he seriously felt he could service the film by giving it an update and improving some of its shortcomings that result from the tests of time. Sadly Zombie not only does nothing to improve the film he hacks and slashes away all of the mystique the original had and rips open brand new gory messy and pointless holes throughout.The character of Michael Myers in the original film came from a fairly welltodo suburban family yet inexplicably turned out a rotten merciless killing machine. It is pretty essential to Michael's Boogeyman persona that he appear as something almost supernatural and certainly nothing the audience could ever sympathize with. Yet Zombie drags a newly fashioned backstory out for half of the movie trying to give reasons for why Myers does what he does stomping all over the mystery that surrounded the original character and struck fear into all members of the audience. It is also a major part of the character of Dr. Loomis that Michael be the impossible case study one that even the most accomplished psychologist couldn't comprehend. Instead Zombie in typical fashion of his Godawful career makes Michael the product of a rundown white trash environment. Any moviegoer would find it difficult to not laugh at the ridiculous caricatures Michael's family members portray if they were not already bored to death by Zombie's fetish with white trash and his predictability as a director.Zombie saw it fit to remove almost all of the classic scenes that made the original so memorable and replace them with bloodstrewn bodies of naked women at every turn. I'm not sure who exactly thinks porn  gore  horror but I'll tell you that there is a major difference between a creepy mysterious maskwearing man chasing after a scared babysitter and popping out from behind every corner and one bashing in someone's head with a baseball bat repeatedly to no one's amusement. It's fine if some people in the world enjoy goriness every once in awhile it's not fine if Hollywood directors begin to confuse this with horror. Repeated sadistic killings are not what scares an audience they're what sickens them. Mystery suspense and the creepy aura of the unknown are what make up a good horror film and the original Halloween is THE classic example of this. Also as a sidenote but something that needs to be mentioned who the hell talks like Laurie and her two friends in this film? These three girls the blonde friend in particular converse as if high schoolers find it extremely cool to drop the fbomb every other word and sound as annoyingly immature as possible. The entirety of the dialogue written for their parts suggests no one involved in the making of this film has any idea what teenage girls talk like so one of them decided to make it up and make them all look like total fools. I had already given up on the film by this point but it seriously made me and everyone I came with kind of concerned that a film could get all of the way through the editing process and into theaters with such odd dialogue that would actually cause us to look at each other with quizzical faces.My one piece of advice to moviegoers everywhere is instead of putting more of your hardearned money into the pocket of a hack director like Zombie and fueling the fire of awful modern horror films and terrible remakes stay at home dim the lights and watch the original classic to remind yourself of just what makes a horror movie tick just how great movies of that genre once were and just what it feels like to truly be scared  heck that's exactly what I'm going to do to try and push this steaming pile out of my memory. It's bad when a horror movie comes out that's filled with lots of cheap gore overused expletives and pointless nudity it's far worse when it's done as a remake of a classic. The only people this film will strike horror into the hearts of is fans of the original and sadly this is not the type of horror they paid to see  they like myself will be absolutely horrified at just how bad the abomination of a remake that is Rob Zombie's Halloween truly is.".

I didn't know too much about Rob Zombie but I did think that remaking the film wasn't the best choice. my thought was that if they did want to remake it then first they should do a FINAL Halloween sequel to finish off the Halloween series and finally give it an end then film a remake for October 2008 the 30th anniversary but instead we get a rushed written script rushed filming and production and a back story to a once terrifying character that proved to be overdone and drawn out. I could not believe how poor the dialog was it was if the director believed that use of poor language was necessary in making a successful movie. the movie opens in a such a way that anyone who has seen the original will say that it does not fit the story. Michael's family is just pure white trash what's the point of that. all the death scenes contained way too much gore and every girl that was killed had to be done while having sex and nude. a lot of the characters that we're killed had no point to be killed. the second half of the film was completely rushed we didn't get to see much of the other characters. ScoutTaylor Compton is a gifted actress but the script gave her no acceptable lines or enough screen time. the placement of carpenter's music does not fit at all. being the fan of Halloween that i am i could not wait for the movie to be over. if a sequel is made to this movie i only hope that rob zombie is not asked to write or direct it. this movie makes Halloween resurrection look like a masterpiece that should explain it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the taxonomy of redeeming values one could include social scientific artistic political comedic moral etc. And it's nearly impossible to find any creative work that can't be defended or justified under one of these categories. That is until now. Rob Zombie's Halloween is devoid of any redeeming value. It not only plumbs the depths of deprivation it sets a new lowwater mark for tasteless dreck.This has nothing to do with prudishness squeamishness or easily offended sensibilities. It has to do with poor scripting bad read no character development predictability gratuitous gore and ultimately just plain meaninglessness. Even the most abstract nonnarrative experimental genres of film have a point that can be ascertained albeit with some difficulty in some cases. But Halloween has no point. In the end it is merely a series of unmotivated contrived gruesome vignettes that cumulatively add up to nothing. The film uses every clich known to bad cinema Doors that don't open guns that don't fire victims who fall and crawl when they can illafford to do so under lit scenes that attempt to falsely create a sense of impending mayhem some horrific vile and pandering dialogue and the monster who just won't die. Mr. Zombie uses them all. It's hard to escape the notion that there is nothing intended or achieved beyond fundamental shock value.Billed as a 'retelling' of John Carpenter's original a somewhat if only marginally better version this edition of Halloween supposedly provides an explanation of the causes of Michael Myers' homicidal psychosis to wit his excessively foulmouthed and dysfunctional parents who as characters are as creekshallow as the rest of the cast. The only one I felt sorry for was Malcolm McDowellthe actornot Dr. Loomis his character. How he the quintessential ultraviolent Alex de Large of Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and the multifaceted Mick Travises of Lindsay Anderson's If and O Lucky Man and the H. G. Wells of Time After Time got roped into such an awful piece of cinema is a mystery.Thematically and cinematically Halloween is virtually identical to Mr. Zombie's two previous films House Of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects. In fact except for the titles the three films are nearly indistinguishable from one another as they all suffer from being stuck in the same stylistic rut. While Mr. Zombie does push the envelope of bad taste there's no evidence that he pushes his own development as a filmmaker and shows no directorial growth in his progression of films. What he overlooks in his bloodlust is the idea that showing less can be more effective than showing more as in the Psycho shower scene when the knife is never seen striking the victim. Leaving nothing to the viewer's imagination and instead hammering home the obvious can be the undoing of a film which sums up the problem with Halloween. Slasher films may well be the cinematic equivalents of bottomfeeders but it doesn't necessarily follow that they have to be abhorrently distasteful and bad or that they can't strive to achieve some measure of redeeming value.Where Rob Zombie will go from here seems painfully apparent. Having painted himself into a corner from which it may be hard to escape he may be his own next victim.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard nothing but positive reviews from friends and family when I decided to check Zombie's version of Halloween out for myself. So you could say I was looking forward a nonstop thrillride of some sort. To say it simply I couldn't count the numerous times I yawned throughout this terrible movie. Rob Zombie had made it clear to his audience to see this for a movie itself don't try to compare it to the original. But what you don't understand is that when you're remaking the classic best horror movie of all time it is impossible to just forget the original completely especially when several scenes came STRAIGHT from the original.If anything I'd call this a remake of The Blair Witch Project with better cameras since half of the movie was done in the dark and with handheld cameras which made it impossible to really see anything and just create some massive migraines for the entire audience. It was hard to watch and what you did see you wish you hadn't. Zombie said he approached this film from a serious angle but all I heard in the crowd was laughter.It was either too fast or too slow or just down right annoying to watch.Something else that bugged me about this film was the people who said Finally! We get to see what made Michael the way he is! And no you don't. You get to see Rob Zombie's version of what his own impression of why Michael does what it is he does. In which it completely treads on the original of an average built guy being able to do things that only someone much stronger would be capable of doing. Zombie's solution to this problem was to hire a giant actor who COULD break someone's face with his bare hands rather than just someone full of such evil and having the power to take a bullet and still get up.It was more of a 'craptastic' prequel if anything at all showing Michael's youth of being a redneck in a family of lazy and greasy people. The way Zombie set it up apparently is that Michael was full of such rage due to the fact that his mother was a prostitute ... Yeah. Something Rob Zombie has failed to do three times in a row now was to make you sympathetic for the victims. Just doesn't show them long enough to make you miss them when they're gone. Most of the movie was done with little Myers in the hospital so the last thirty or so minutes of him randomly killing people goes by so fast that you don't really care. He tries to cover this up by playing sad music like Love hurts when someone special is killed but all it did was get more laughter for a reaction.The major character changes were all that but flawless Don't get me wrong the actors did their jobs well it's just they were given the jobs that they never should have done. To show so little of key characters like Dr. Loomis and then to rid him away so quickly.. The entire cast good actors I can say just were all terribly wrong for their parts. Danielle Harris is the perfect example reduced to play a teenage slut after her major involvement in the prior Halloween series? When you make a slasher flick the object is to cast people you want to survive not a cast of faces and whiny little voices that you wish would be killed off sooner. It just didn't get it. The film was nothing short of disappointing which is as was expected as soon as I heard that Zombie had been set to direct. I honestly do think that if someone were to ever ask Would you do a prequel to House 1000 and show where Otis came from exactly? Zombie would reply with Halloween. In the end this movie was just like every other recent remake of something classic that shouldn't exist but does and now we just have to deal with it. . In my opinion which is all I can offer is that this is the best example of what a true insult to the horror genre could ever be. I always said that one day a remake would pop up that might open up peoples eyes as to the real damage remakes are doing to horror and now I just have to point at this. Honestly Halloween was just not the film Rob Zombie should have remade and the movie itself stands as if saying This is what you get for not letting me remake 'Texas Chainsaw Masscre' instead!Simply and yet sadly said it was for todays generation where true horror no longer exists. That's all. ".

So I have seen a lot and I still have a lot more to see. I watched the Halloween series grow a lot worse from the 3rd film on down. When it came time for Halloween H20 it could not have ended the series better. The they made another and when Busta Rhymes used karate on Michael it was the final nail in the coffin. The series to me was dead. When Rob Zombie was announced as the next director to do a Halloween film I didn't really care they were already ruined. When I heard it was a remake I got a little bit of hope in me. I hated House of 1000 corpses and Devil's Rejects. They weren't horror to me. It was like he sat down and wrote the films as if the world had no morals no one cared about anyone and everyone was raised in a dirty truckstop by crack addicts and hookers.For some reason I thought he might actually care about doing Halloween very well since it would be the best thing to do. I went in the theater ready to love this film. If you plan on seeing this moviewhich I advise against stop reading this right about here if you want nothing ruined for you. If you don't care then keep on reading and I'll tell you what made this movie a sad waste of film time money and everything else this film could effect..... .. .. The film started off bad right from the get go. The story was moving in a great direction but the actors and dialog were killing the movie slowly. The crippled stepdad checking out his stepdaughter calling Michael Queer and Psycho destroying the breakfast table with an infant just feet behind him. Screaming obscene lines at everyone who came on screen with him really made the first few scenes annoying. It was the Devil's Rejects all over again. Michael gets his heart broken by his sister when she doesn't take him out for trickortreating. So he kills all but his mother and infant sister wearing the trademark white mask. When his mom comes home from work the cops are arriving to take him away already. He claims while in smiths grove that he doesn't remember killing anyone. He even asks his mom if everyone at home is OK. The movie seems like it's going to redeem itself for a moment. The night janitor tells Michael to buck up and not let these walls get him down. When Micheal finds out he can't go home he kills a nurse and doesn't speak anymore. His mother goes home and commits suicide leaving Laurie crying in her crib.Years later when he is to be transfered Michael kills the guards and gets free. The janitor that befriended him is shown no mercy where it would have made a huge difference if he HAD. At this point it has become impossible to care about any character except Laurie. Michael goes back to his old home where he breaks floorboards up to get back his old knife and mask. Now if anyone knows anything about latex it doesn't keep very well even indoors. It rots in moisture this mask as you see in the trailer is in great shape. Just a little dirty.We meet Laurie who is grown and in high school and as soon as she gets on screen she is just as vulgar and demoralized as every other person in the film. Now even in class every girl she talks to is given lines to make hookers blush. Even Dr. Loomis is a waste in this film. It's like horrible bar band with no talent covering great songs. Only they turn it up just enough to bother your ears and get lyrics wrong just to upset you. It was at this point I walked out of the movie. If anyone write back to tell me that the movie got better after that I doubt it plus what good is a movie that is half good? I am not interested at all in seeing the rest of the film. To avoid going I actually wish they woulda just found another lame way to make a sequel rather than remake it. As long as Rob Zombie doesn't direct it.".

As he previously did with the Frankenstein monster Karloff imbues this character with an aching sense of humanity which was completely absent later incarnations of the Mummy character. Credit must also be given to the able supporting cast including Zita Johann and the always reliable Edward Van Sloan. Now here's a question. Is the film scary by today's standards? I guess I'd have to say not really. However I just watched this film again after seeing the American version of 'The Grudge.' 'The Grudge' certainly had me jumping more but which film did I enjoy more? It'd have to be 'The Mummy.'".

The taking of the body perfuming it placing it in a room full of gold then killing the slaves so that only the priests would know the actual resting place of the body. There was also the bit about being wrapped alive for burial. I'll tell you.The effect of that story which is portrayed in the movie put a bigger scare into me than any movie I've ever seen. Since this one was really the only one we would ever see on television I watched it every time I could. Isn't it interesting that both the Lugosi Dracula use a quotation from Swan Lake as a theme song. I've always wondered why that is. It is certainly eerie and as the credits roll it builds in intensity. I was told once that Tchaikovsky would probably do movie soundtracks if he were alive today. Pardon my digressions. It is interesting that the mummy as a fully wrapped personage really doesn't appear after the beginning sequencewe just know that old Boris is in the process of decay and will eventually be sent to his eternal reward. As usual the scientists and those who should know carelessly leave the young woman unattended and he makes his move. The threatening suavity of Karloff is the high point of the movie. I feel the world received such a gift when these films were made. It is a delight full of frightening images and classic moments.".

They were made when the talkies were still novel and film makers were experimenting with storytelling approaches often taking inspirations from German Expressionism indeed 'The Mummy's director Karl Freund who later directed another 1930s classic 'Mad Love' originally worked as a cinematographer on Fritz Lang's science fiction classic 'Metropolis' and several movies by F.W. Murnau. And it was before the Hayes Code kicked in and took a lot of the fun and thrills out of horror movies just look at how safe and uninteresting horror became in the 1940s with a few notable exceptions e.g. the movies produced by Val Lewton. The film obviously owes a lot to 'Dracula' and Edward Van Sloan and David Manners from that film reappear here in similar roles. Karloff is brilliant as Imhotep a.k.a The Mummy and stage actress Zita Johann is wonderful too very striking with exotic good looks. Too bad she became very quickly disillusioned with Hollywood as she should have been a major screen star. Karloff and Johann are fantastic on screen together and make 'The Mummy' impossible to forget. I was quite surprised to discover that this movie wasn't enormously successful when originally released but it has obviously captured the imagination of thousands of film fans since. It is easily the best Mummy movie ever made though I also have a fondness for Hammer's Blood From The Mummy's Tomb' made almost forty years later and much more entertaining and intelligent than the awful remake starring Brendan Fraser et al. 'The Mummy' stands alongside 'Dracula' 'Frankenstein' 'Island Of Lost Souls' 'Freaks' 'The Invisible Man' and 'The Black Cat' as one of the best horror movies of the 1930s an era that has had an enormous impact on horror ever since. Highly recommended!".

	schema:headline " The one TRUE mummy!";
	schema:reviewBody "Having recently seen the 1999 remake I realized just how powerful Karloff's portrayal of ImhotepArdath Bey truly is. Without fancy effects or CGI without an 80000000 budget with little more than drylooking makeup a doleful stare and that wonderful lisping voice Karloff created a monster that will endure long after the rental copies of the remake have shed their metal oxide coatings. Karl Freund the director was one of Germany's finest cameramen and this was his first film as a director. Employing the less is more theory of filmmaking he keeps the mummy a very mysterious and deadly creature. Never does the mummy stroll up to someone working them into a corner to strangle them. No he just reaches out with his mind killing people from miles away. Finally the flashback scene is one of the best done in silent film style with music and Karloff supplying a morbid voiceover.

	onyx:emotionText "Having recently seen the 1999 remake I realized just how powerful Karloff's portrayal of ImhotepArdath Bey truly is. Without fancy effects or CGI without an 80000000 budget with little more than drylooking makeup a doleful stare and that wonderful lisping voice Karloff created a monster that will endure long after the rental copies of the remake have shed their metal oxide coatings. Karl Freund the director was one of Germany's finest cameramen and this was his first film as a director. Employing the less is more theory of filmmaking he keeps the mummy a very mysterious and deadly creature. Never does the mummy stroll up to someone working them into a corner to strangle them. No he just reaches out with his mind killing people from miles away. Finally the flashback scene is one of the best done in silent film style with music and Karloff supplying a morbid voiceover. Sadly Universal cut the flashback short before the mummy had a chance to tell about chasing the reincarnated princess throughout time. Some stills survive and Henry Victor still gets credit as The Saxon Warrior.";

Following FRANKENSTEIN and THE OLD DARK HOUSE the public knew it liked Boris Karloff but he had been silent in his two biggest roles.  When this movie was released they flocked to the cinema to hear him speak evidently they had missed THE MIRACLE MAN NIGHT WORLD BUSINESS AND PLEASURE and the other minor roles he appeared in while FRANKENSTEIN was becoming a hit. His voice was no disappointment and neither was his performance in this picture. Director Freund handles many important scenes as if he were directing a silent film . . .and it WORKS!  The scene of ImHoTep returning to life is masterful as is the flashback sequence where he shows his reincarnated princess just what became of him.  David Manners is a far more practical hero in this film than he was in DRACULA and he is not hampered by having to wear those ridiculous knickerbockers and Edward van Sloan is fabulous yet again.  Watch for Noble Johnson showing off his muscular frame as the Nubian servant.  Jack Pierce's makeup is nothing short of fantastic what he did with gum cotton and collodion was truly masterful.  The photography is very well done also.  One scene where the camera flashpans away from ImHoTep and over the rooftops of Cairo coming to rest on Helen Grosvenor is truly Germanic.  A similar scene appears in FAUST 1926 and also in SVENGALI 1931. Red Rock Canyon substitutes for ancient Egypt but we always believe we are seeing just what we are supposed to be seeing.  This is a very subtle film and all the more scary because if its subtlety. Now shall we discuss MAD LOVE?".

It HAD to be better than that lowgrade though high budgetRaiders of the Lost Ark ripoff I spent two hours suffering through. Thankfully my impulse proved to be on the money.I really look at this film as Karloff's first piece of proof that there was more to his talent than Frankenstein's monster. Imhotep aka Ardeth Bay couldn't be more different than that sweetnatured brute. Though both are pathetic in their own way and lonely Imhotep is more intelligent and a great deal more malicious by far. He's willing to do anything kill anyone and break any taboo to be reunited with his lost love. Karloff never has to raise his voice to convey menace just a hardening of the eyes or a steely tone in that ohsodistinct voice of his is enough to make you a little uneasy.An overlooked aspect of this film is that in a way it's something of a tragedy. Imhotep has literally sacrificed everything he ever had just to be by the side of his beloved princess. So focused on this goal is he that he doesn't realize the great harm he is doing to all those around him including to his beloved who in a thankful break with movie tradition at the time proves to be the undoing of the immortal monster. I feel more of a sense of relief at film's end than triumph. Maybe now Imhotep can rest in peace.".

But never again will it be so magical. Never again will it be so scary with the use of so less effects. Boris Karloff BECOMES Imhotep just like he became Frankenstein in the earlier monster classic. His achievement makes this film immortal. Even in another 75 years he will still be the one and only Mummy to me. This classic monster production from Universal delivers. It's grabs your attention from the very first minute and it doesn't let you go. Most of the credit for that go to Karloff himself of course. His voice and especially those eyes !!! All the modern computer generated skills can never give the same horrific effect as Boris Karloff's creepy look. The mummification at the end the few close ups when the camera stares right in his eyes...those are images who can never ever die !! I have to give some credit to the rest of the cast as well of course. Zita Johann is absolutely gorgeous as the Princess AnckesenAmon. Imhotep sees in Helen Grosvenor the reincarnation of his long lost Egyptian priest. Only her love for archaeologist Frank Whemple can save her. Edward Van Sloan also a great legend in early horror  he played in Frankenstein and was the very first Dr. Van Helsing in Dracula with Bela Lugosi  plays a very memorable part in this film as well. His character Dr Muller is an expert in the field of the Egyptian culture. Overall like the credits in they end say  A good cast is worth repeating I think that's great. I'm a great fan of the Egyptian Myths and recommend this film to everyone who likes this great culture as well. I also advise you to see the Hammer version starring Peter Cushing and Christoper Lee and The mummy lives starring Tony Curtis. I do not like the modern version of the mummy actually. Brendan Fraser is good the CGI effects spoiled the magic for me. It's loyal to the story I gotta give it that. Finally I would have loved to be there when this film came out back in 1932. Only a few years after the amazing discovery of the tomb of Tut. this must have been gigantic. I heard the audience was frightened to death when Karloff opened his eyes for the first time. The hype back then I would love to be a part of that. My humble opinion on The Mummy...what do you think ... 1010 !!! This title comes with my highest recommendations".

Amazingly so because it relies so little on special effects or makeup. You see Boris Karloff in the beginning while he's still in his coffin in his Mummy wrap.

Her mummy is raised and put in the Cairo Museum. But that's only the beginning of Ardath BeyImhotep's plan. It also involves Zita Johann the daughter of the Governor of the Sudan who is Egyptian on mom's side. She's a collateral descendant of the princess and feels drawn to Karloff. She's also drawn to young David Manners and that could put a crimp in Karloff's plans.Boris Karloff probably had his most challenging role here. It's a terribly complex part. We are repulsed by Karloff's scheme but at the same time the audience feels terribly sorry for what he's been through. While Johann is in a trance Karloff narrates a flashback sequence to her telling how he was buried alive after she died because he tried to use Egyptian black arts to raise the princess from the dead. What a terrible hurt the man must have felt and the audience feels it too.The mood is helped in large part by the great orchestrations of James Dietrich of Tschaikovsky themes. Also interpolated in the film background score is the popular ballad Beautiful Love. It creates an aura of unredeemed sadness throughout the film.There is a lot of similarity between The Mummy and that other Universal horror classic Dracula. But Bela Lugosi's Dracula is hardly as sympathetic a figure as Imhotep as played by Boris Karloff. Also Edward Van Sloan as Professor Muller plays the same kind of role in The Mummy as he did as Van Helsing in Dracula.The remakes of The Mummy used a lot of gimmicky special effects to achieve what Boris Karloff did with sheer talent. Personally I still think this version has the power to frighten and entertain.".

How can any actor hope to get noticed while sharing the screen with one of the greatest horror icons of all time especially in what many consider to be one of Karloff's roles? Granted that after 80 years some aspects of the movie may creak a bit. However there's no getting around the fact that time has detracted absolutely nothing from Karloff's performance.It is interesting to compare the 1932 version of The Mummy with the 1999 version because the differences in style and production emphasis are so striking. The modern version is all about CGI special effects and rollercoaster paced action. The 1932 version is all about setting an eerie mood and of course the sheer charismatic presence of Boris Karloff.In Frankenstein Karloff played The Monster as a heavy hulking stumbling mute. Yet how different he seems in The Mummy. Yes there are scenes in which the actor was wrapped up and heavily made up to simulate a 3700yearold mummy. By all accounts that was a very unpleasant experience for the actor too. However in most of the movie Karloff was dressed in a sort of fulllength gown emphasizing the actor's tall and spare frame further implying the notion that he is a 3700yearold reanimated mummy. Nevertheless the actor's performance was not limited to makeup and costume. Further accentuating the idea of a walking corpse is the subtle manner in which Karloff moved or should one more precisely say didn't move. Karloff's mummy moved very slowly almost gliding and when he stood he stood very still moving his body as little as possible. The overall effect of that stillness was to make Karloff's mummy seem even more powerful and menacing. Another notable difference was that unlike in Frankenstein in The Mummy Karloff got a chance to make use of that wonderfully sibilant purring voice of his that unique voice that has put chills up generations of spines and still continues to do so.It is also worth noting that Karl Freund's direction was a textbook example to aspiring modern horror film directors of how less can be so much more. The initial scene in which Karloff's mummy becomes alive opening his eyes slightly and slowly moving one hand just a little bit still has the power to chill. So does that the subsequent scene in which all that is visible to the viewer are a couple of bandages moving slowly along the floor and trailing out of the door. Nothing is more frightening than the imagination and in that classic scene Freund demonstrated exactly how far a little bit of suggestion can go.".

	schema:reviewBody "What director Karl Freund achieves in this movie is nothing short of staggering even at a remove of nearly 70 years. If this same story with this same basic approach were released today it would still be great. And especially now when the box office successes of such movies as The Sixth Sense What Lies Beneath and The Blair Witch Project demonstrate that audiences are hungry for a return to the classic horror virtues of style mood and suspense as opposed to the tired formula of gore in your face shocks special effects and more gore The Mummy would seem ripe for some kind of revival too bad the lame Brendan Fraser vehicle has stolen its title  though nothing of its wit skill or conviction.What makes this movie so good is. . . gosh there are so many things! Start with the creepy and unsettling tone which the movie establishes right away. The very first scene  where the Mummy is awakened  is one of the greatest ever for pure atmosphere and chills. Look at the way Freund under plays it every step of the way. Instead of piling on a crescendo of scary music and using odd or distorted camera angles to dramatize the situation he has the action play out in total silence and with a resolutely still camera the tasteful cutaways from the mummy in the tomb to the archaeologist sitting not five feet away being the only frill. The tension which results is unsettlingly powerful  and is made moreso by the fact that the scene refuses to resolve itself in the way which we expect it to. I'll give no more details but when you watch the film ask yourself isn't this resolution ten times more creepy and effective than the one we thought we saw coming. Already five minutes in it's clear that The Mummy has a far more wicked sophisticated sense of horror than any of the other big monsters of the day Dracula Frankenstein Wolf Man etc.  and a good deal more than many that have come after too.But of course all the style in the world ultimately cannot save a weak or hackneyed script.  And so it's a great pleasure to report that all of Freund's technical finesse is at the service of a really super cool story. Not content to be merely a spooker the film is also  nay one might even say primarily  a tragic love story one that deals intelligently with such provocative notions as forbidden love reincarnation religious desecration inhuman torture and a strong subtheme of the desire to respect the past vs. the need to live for the moment. All of these elements swirl so ingeniously and nondidactically in The Mummy's streamlined storyline that I'm tempted to proclaim this at once both the most compact as well as the most ambitious horror movie script I have ever come across.Of course such superlatives can get you in trouble too so let me add that yes there are flaws  mainly the ones endemic to all horror movies of the time. The socalled hero is once again a young man of no charm or interest whatsoever. Meanwhile the venerable old expert who must explain the ways of the monster to everyone else is already a tired convention at this point  and since the role here is played by Edward Van Sloan who was Van Helsing in the original Dracula and  its sequel Dracula's Daughter as well as Dr. Waldman in Frankenstein there is an even greater than usual sense of perfunctoriness to the undertaking. However even here the movie displays its strength and uniqueness by toying with our expectations of what these stock characters will be able to do and achieve. Whereas in most other horror films the romantic lead and the crusty old doctor end up being the white knights who vanquish the monster and save the girl here they operate on a much less exalted plane  and are thereby made more human in the process.As for faults that's pretty much it. The pace is masterful some have called it slow but I strongly disagree. The film flows naturally and inevitably with every scene building upon the one before it. There's nothing extraneous in the way it unfolds  achievement enough when compared to the countless other horror movies of its day. As an added treat there is a flashback sequence in the middle of the movie that is a minimasterpiece all by itself it has all the fury and grandeur of a D.W. Griffith silent honed and encapsulated down to its bare essence. It tells the tale of the title character's previous life with an economy and precision that could still serve as a model for filmmakers today. And well most of all the movie has. . . Boris Karloff.I've restricted my discussion of him until the end because his towering greatness is so routinely accepted and understood that it's almost redundant to comment upon it. Also I wanted to make clear that though he is the film's chief asset he is far from its only one. But there's no question that it is his stately brooding menacing performance that ultimately pushes this film over into the realm of greatness. The key thing here is this while the concept of a centuriesold being raised from the dead and out for vengeance is a great idea Karloff's portrayal is what gives it tangible terrifying REALITY. Observing this man  with his stiff ramrod posture his measured and stately movements and his absolutely hypnotic voice  we are truly convinced on a visceral level that yes here indeed is the walking dead. That kind of verisimilitude is rare enough in horror movies of any era and its presence here stands as an absolute revelation. Just as does the entirety of this wonderful exquisitely made film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the great length of his career Boris Karloff played a number of horror cinema's most memorable characters. But I've always been of the opinion that his work in Universal's The Mummy is his best.The story in The Mummy is in many respects almost identical to Universal's earlier Dracula movie. Exchange a mummy for a vampire and Cairo for Transylvania and the rest is quite comparable. Both movies are basically love stories  regardless of how twisted the love may seem. Ardath Bay's sole purpose in life or should that be afterlife is to resurrect the spirit of his long dead love Princess AnckesenAmon. His 3000 year obsession and devotion is demonstrated in the line AnckesenAmon my love has lasted longer than the temple of our gods. No man ever suffered as I did for you. The response he receives a few scenes later No. No I'm alive. I'm young. I won't die. I loved you once but now you belong with the dead. I am AnckesenAmon but I'm somebody else too. I want to live even in this strange new world is heartbreaking.Other obvious and less obvious examples of how the two movies are similar include the use of religious symbols to repel the monsters the use of hypnosis the closeup shots of the eyes and cast members who play basically the same roles Edward Van Sloan and David Manners appear in both films in almost identical roles. Finally a similarity that I've always noticed that I've not read anywhere else concerns the Renfield character from Dracula and poor Ralph Norton in The Mummy. Both become starkraving hystericallaughing mad lunatics. And whether intentional or not both assist their respective monsters with their plans  Renfield by actively helping Dracula and Norton by accidentally bringing the mummy back to life.Karloff is perfect as ImhotepArdath Bay. I've said a number of times that Karloff was born to play this role. His slim long body looks like what I imagine a mummy might look like after 3000 years in the hot drying desert. Karloff's face with the help of Jack Pierce's makeup looks like it would turn to dust at the slightest touch. And as most would agree Karloff's voice has an otherworldly quality that sounds as if it were coming from the grave. Karloff's acting abilities also add to the illusion that he is the mummy. Whether his decision or that of director Karl Freund I don't know but Karloff gives a very understated performance that is necessary if he is to be believed. The understated performance without wild exaggerated movements is perfect for a 3000 year old mummy. His carriage suggests a very fragile being that fears crumbling with any strenuous action. To me Karloff simply is The Mummy.Every time I watch The Mummy I'm amazed at how little screen time Karloff has as Imhotep. To think that he spent 8 hours a day getting the fullbody mummy treatment only to appear for a few minutes in the final film and never a full body shot shows an amazing amount of restraint on the part of Freund. If you're a believer in the what's not shown is more frightening that what is theory of horror you'll appreciate Freund's decision. But the few shots where Imhotep does appear are for me the definition of movie magic. I'll never forget the first time I saw The Mummy. The scene where Imhotep slowly opens his eye to reveal for the first time that he is alive immediately became and remains for me one of the most memorable moments in horror history.".

The Mummy is very different from the clich image people have of it today. The bandagewrapped mummy slowly shuffling through the dark towards his victim would come largely from the later Universal series. There is one short but unforgettable scene at the beginning of this film that features the iconic mummy. The image of the mummy gradually opening his eyes is a classic. This scene is the highlight of the film for many showcasing makeup artist Jack Pierce's genius. The makeup holds up even by today's standards and outshines anything we have been able to do with computer imagery.The script is heavily influenced by Dracula which was released the previous year. The screenwriter John L. Balderston had written the stage play that Universal's Dracula film was based upon. It also has the cinematographer of Dracula Karl Freund as the director. It even features a couple of notable cast members from Dracula Edward Van Sloan and David Manners. I actually find it to be a superior film to Dracula in many ways. Freund's direction is better than Tod Browning's for starters. The stagey elements are gone. The story is very good. Unlike many future Mummy movies both at Universal and later Hammer the focus is not on a monster that kills people. Instead the focus is on slowly building a sinister mood. It's an atmospheric picture as all the truly great horror films are. The Egyptian visuals and mythology add something extra to the ambiance of the film. It must have been especially intriguing to audiences in 1932.Boris Karloff with his trademark voice and manner gives a subtle ominous performance as ImhotepArdeth Bey. It's a legendary performance by one of the icons of horror. The scenes of Imhotep's evil eyes glowing in closeups or the eerie scene where he chants over a scroll by candlelight are the stuff of legend. Zita Johann does quite well as do the aforementioned Van Sloan and Manners. Plus Arthur Byron and a memorable turn by Bramwell Fletcher as the man who actually revives the mummy He went for a little walk!.I love this movie. I love Universal horror films in general but this is one of the jewels in the crown. The acting directing writing and makeup are all excellent for the period.

	schema:headline " A classic film suitable for preteen children.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film features the story of a man Imhotep high priest who loved a woman beyond his social station.  Imhotep was punished for this crime by a suffering a living death.  A few millenia as an undead corpse have made Imhotep a psychopathic killer willing to do away with anyone who obstructs his obsession with reviving the lost woman as an undead creature like himself.An unwitting young archeologist without respect for the culture he studies animates Imhotep by reading the Scroll of Thoth and thus starting the action with his own mental collapse. He was warned by a more mature academic but hubris proceeds the fall.Unlike more recent psychopathic killers Imhotep exhibits cunning intelligence and restraint.  He restrains his murderous impulses whenever such restraint advances his own plans.  He even uses nonviolent means to have his deceased lover exhumed by an archeological team.  In this same scene he employs an ironic comment regarding the special privileges of foreign archeologists.  Without glitz and special effects the plot progresses when moved by the passions of each character.  Even the old professor attempts to destroy the Mummy's scroll for love of his son. Acting generates essentially all the action.  No doubt there was no budget to blow up vehicles and structures.  Dialogue explains the action atmosphere creates the mood and lighting and a few props stand in for the foreign locale.Several people are murdered albeit with limited or no graphic content. The story does incorporate social discrimination between classes and between Europeans and Egyptians but only as a fact and without celebration. Actually the film's limited commentary tends to discredit arbitrary prejudices based on class and nationality.  Imhotep himself seemingly condemns the double standard applied foreigners and native Egyptians by insinuation.The Mummy does not offer color computer graphic special effects or a catchy score.

	onyx:emotionText "This film features the story of a man Imhotep high priest who loved a woman beyond his social station.  Imhotep was punished for this crime by a suffering a living death.  A few millenia as an undead corpse have made Imhotep a psychopathic killer willing to do away with anyone who obstructs his obsession with reviving the lost woman as an undead creature like himself.An unwitting young archeologist without respect for the culture he studies animates Imhotep by reading the Scroll of Thoth and thus starting the action with his own mental collapse. He was warned by a more mature academic but hubris proceeds the fall.Unlike more recent psychopathic killers Imhotep exhibits cunning intelligence and restraint.  He restrains his murderous impulses whenever such restraint advances his own plans.  He even uses nonviolent means to have his deceased lover exhumed by an archeological team.  In this same scene he employs an ironic comment regarding the special privileges of foreign archeologists.  Without glitz and special effects the plot progresses when moved by the passions of each character.  Even the old professor attempts to destroy the Mummy's scroll for love of his son. Acting generates essentially all the action.  No doubt there was no budget to blow up vehicles and structures.  Dialogue explains the action atmosphere creates the mood and lighting and a few props stand in for the foreign locale.Several people are murdered albeit with limited or no graphic content. The story does incorporate social discrimination between classes and between Europeans and Egyptians but only as a fact and without celebration. Actually the film's limited commentary tends to discredit arbitrary prejudices based on class and nationality.  Imhotep himself seemingly condemns the double standard applied foreigners and native Egyptians by insinuation.The Mummy does not offer color computer graphic special effects or a catchy score.  However it also lacks political bias revisionist history profanity sexual innuendo or deliberate overt commercial ethnic racial social political academic or scientific distortion or bias.  Psychosexual pathology is also not glorified as in certain more recent horror films.

If you come in without an appreciation for atmosphere and subtle storytelling then yes you will not get why this is such a highly regarded film.The Mummy stands apart from most of the other Universal horrors with its slow dreamlike quality. Some complain that nothing happens in this film but that is only because they are looking at the surface. Really what's happening inside of the characters' heads is more fascinating than any generic horror movie killing spree could be. The reincarnation love story is interesting and the conflict between the ancient and modern world within the heroine Helen makes for good drama.Karloff's performance as the menacing but sympathetic Imhotep is one of his finest characterizations. Though the character and the movie overall are often compared to Dracula 1931 I think Imhotep has more in common with the 1925 Phantom of the Opera in that he is a grotesque figure out to claim the romantic love of a woman he feels he deserves.I believe Zita Johann as Imhotep's beloved Helen deserves special mention too for unlike most Universal damsels she gets a role with depth and plays it off beautifully. Unlike say Mary Philbin's Christine in POTO Helen is conflicted as to her feelings for Imhotep whose presence awakens a love from another lifetime within her. And yet she also loves her life in the modern world and struggles as to whether or not to give it up to resume a relationship cut short centuries ago. Johann underplays it coming off as more soulful than your garden variety horror movie heroine.Paired with a fine story and fantastic direction from the great Karl Freund classic horror fans should not go through life without at least two viewings of this wonderful movie. It takes multiple viewings to really grasp the genius at hand.".

What's more fresh from his iconic role as the Monster in 'Frankenstein' Boris Karloff is perfectly cast as the resurrected mummy of the title Imhotep who like the Monster looms large and stares menacingly as the ostensible villain but also conveys an essential humanity which by the end invokes more sympathy than fear and strikes a surprisingly poignant note by the time the credits roll.The story begins in 1921 when an ancient scroll The Scroll of Thoth is unearthed and read by an overenthusiastic archaeologist which inadvertently resurrects the mummy Imhotep who promptly disappears sending the archaeologist mad. He reappears a decade later going under the name Ardath Bay a looming enigmatic figure who walks among the living and aides in another archaeological so that he may pursue the reincarnated soul of the woman he loved over 3000 years before and employing magic to destroy anyone who hinders his obsessive aim.As is common with films from this era the film is slowpaced and is low on explicit scares by modern standards but firsttime director Karl Freund previously a cinematographer on a number of German Expressionist films such as Fritz Lang's 1927 classic 'Metropolis' as well as Universal's own 'Dracula' effortlessly crafts a suspenseful atmosphere which remains gripping throughout as Imhotep's motivations and fatal flaws are revealed. The cast are uniformly excellent obviously Karloff with the help of a makeup job from Jack Pierce who also transformed Karloff into Frankenstein's Monster owns the feature despite relatively little screentime but the rest of the cast flesh out the drama brilliantly.All in all 'The Mummy' is a remarkable film which will probably confound many expectations of what it will be like from the slew of popculture references most people will have accumulated regarding the theme. I know I was. However even though it may be a different film to what most would expect there is no denying the great movie that it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Mummy's place with classic monster movies is down several notches from the likes of Dracula Frankenstein and The Wolf Man seeing as the film features very little jolts a surprisingly slow narrative and some rather hokey acting by everyone involved. But the film deserves praise for Boris Karloff's unsurprisingly strong performance along with the makeup and set design which make the film an immediate if minor success.The story concerns Imhotep Boris Karloff an ancient Egyptian priest who is revived on an archaeological expedition conducted by Joseph Whemple Arthur Byron who discovers Imhotep's mummy. Imhotep attempted to resurrect his lover Princess Ankhesenamon and was mummified alive as a result. Joseph much to the dismay of his friend Dr. Muller Edward Van Sloan reads an ancient Egyptian script that brings Imhotep back to life which leads to the mummy roaming the area of Cairo to find his longlost love.Karl Freund's direction here is extremely meticulous  a trait many of these older monster films possessed. Freund's direction is very focused on providing efficient light and specific character placement which at least shows a distinct level of alertness on part of the filmmaker.If only director Freund and writer John L. Balderston had realized The Mummy was also a monster film instead of solely a slowburn drama. This is the kind of thriller that remembers it is part of the horror genre almost fifteen minutes before it's over leading to an identifiable panic to try and include some scares before the entire opportunity is missed. Because of this The Mummy is redundant and not very frightening or even remotely eerie.As a drama and a parable about revisiting and tampering with history I'll say The Mummy succeeds on that level. Universal monster movies seemed to always include some sort of realization or moral and this one in particular kind of keeps the film together and makes its existence as a drama more justifiable. However marketed and released like a monster film this poises an odd issue. When we have a film with its title character occupying roughly two minutes in the film than this is a problem.However when we do see the mummy the film becomes a bit more satisfying. Karloff's makeup job is extraordinary and his acting throughout the whole film is the glue of the film. I don't critique acting much because I feel a good story is made by much more than such a thing and to waste time by saying this guy was good this guy was bad makes for a lame overlysubjective general review. But Karloff works in the regard that he is a natural screen presence. His modesty such as saying that anyone could've done his job in Frankenstein only makes him shine more.The Mummy is an interesting piece of history welldirected mostly wellacted but falls short of monster movie standards due to its lame expository and reliance on drama rather than on tone and exemplified eeriness.Starring Boris Karloff Arthur Byron and Edward Van Sloan. Directed by Karl Freund.".

	schema:reviewBody "Egyptian Mummies doubtlessly range among the most fascinating Horror creatures and yet their overall representation in cinema seems a bit weak compared to that of other ghoulish fiends. This is not due to the lack of mummy films but to due to the small number of truly imaginative ones. Of all mummy films I've seen there is only one that is truly fantastic  The Mummy of 1932. And what a masterpiece it is! Karl Feund's brilliant milestone is not merely the greatest Mummy picture of alltime and one of the greatest of the Universal Horror classics it is doubtlessly one of the greatest Horror films ever made. Horrordeity Boris Karloff gives one of the most astonishing performances of his outstanding career in one of the Horror genre's most immortal roles  Imhotep. As Karloff's most famous role Frankenstein's Monster Imhotep is a tragic character though incomparably more evil than the predominantly woeful Monster. Though an incredibly haunting fiend Imhotep is driven by immortal love to a woman. In 1922 an archaeologist awakens the mummy of the Egyptian priest Imhotep by reading out a spell on an ancient scroll. The mummy disappears but returns ten years later disguised as Ardath Bey in search of his love  an immortal love which lasted thousands of years. Imhotep was mummified alive for committing the sacrilege of trying to awake his beloved a priestess of Isis and daughter of the Pharaoh from the dead. In the 20th century beautiful young Helen Zita Johann is the spitting image of the Egyptian priestess...Imhotep is doubtlessly one of the most haunting and memorable villains the Horror genre has ever seen and Karloff doubtlessly one of the greatest actors who ever lived is brilliant in the role. No one could possibly doubt that Karloff was one of the greatest icons ever in cinema and this role is arguably his greatest besides that of Frankenstein's Monnster in James Whale's Frankenstein 1932 and the even greater sequel Bride of Frankenstein 1935. Karloff looks incredibly creepy both as the mummy in the beginning and as Imhotep. The sequence when the mummified Imhotep opens his eyes in the beginning alone is incredibly haunting and unforgettable. Beautiful Zita Johnson is also great in her double role. Actually the whole cast is very good it most memorably includes Edward van Sloan the legendary classic Horror actor who also played Van Helsing in Tod Browning's Dracula 1931. Director Karl Freund was mainly active as a fantastic cinematographer. However the two Horror films he directed Mad Love of 1935 and this masterpiece to be precise he also served as an uncredited codirector of Browning's Dracula both rank among the greatest classics of the genre. The Mummy is brilliantly photographed and the makeup department did the job of a century  Karloff just looks uniquely creepy. The Mummy spawned many sequels and ripoffs none of which got anywhere near the brilliance of the original. In 1959 the British Hammer Studios made a remake starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing which is easily the secondbest Mummy film I've ever seen. The crappy new Mummy films with should be avoided at all costs. Incredibly haunting creepy and beautiful Karl Freund's 1932 classic is and always will be the one and only true Mummymasterpiece that buries all the rest. The Mummy is one of the greatest Horror films ever made and no cinema lover could possibly consider missing it. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1922 most of the events of the day were fairly dull. Example Lloyd George lost his majority in Parliament and was replaced as Prime Minister by Andrew BonarLaw. Only one event of that year has remained in our collective memories. The year 1922 was the year Howard Carter found the tomb of the Pharoah Tutankhamon in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor in Egypt. The only perfectly preserved treasure of an Egyptian ruler was uncovered and it's artistic glories stunned a fascinated world. And soon the brilliance of the discovery was complicated by a series of random sudden and frequently violent deaths supposedly connected to Carter's expedition. Among those who died was the Earl of Carnaevon who financed the expedition. Supposedly he died a few days after visiting the opened tomb. So did the American millionaire George Gould and a long list of others frequently by suicide one Prince Fahmy Bay by being shot by his wife at the Savoy Hotel in London in 1923. Supposedly the Egyptians who buried King Tut had put a written curse on the doorway. It was similar ironically to the one near Shakespeare's grave cursing he who moved the Bard's bones. Few noticed that the person who should have died from such a curse Howard Carter lived to spend the rest of his life cataloging studying and writing about his finds and dying finally in 1939 peacefully in bed! Finding a treasure of any sort is always fascinating. Finding one that causes disaster in it's wake is even more so. The Tut  curse story has never been dropped despite every attempt to do so. It was used in many films about Egyptology that cropped up. It was also borrowed in nonEgyptian expedition films. Witness THE GREEN RAY where a curse seems to be killing off members of an African expedition financed by a wealthy English nobleman seeking a treasure a rare element from a meteorite buried in Africa centuries ago sound familiar?.The 1932 film THE MUMMY properly kept the curse urban legend in it's proper section of Africa  Egypt. An expedition in 1923 led by Arthur Byron and Edward Van Sloan finds an unmarked grave. Van Sloan cautions his friend Byron not to violate the sanctity of the grave and Byron hedges. He has opened it and revealed a mummy which the viewers of course recognize as the star Mr. Boris Karloff but he has not decided if he wishes to examine the precious papyrus document that is in a jeweled case beneath the mummy's case. He leaves and only his jocular young assistant Bramwell Fletcher is alone with the case and the mummy. Fletcher decides to read the manuscript. He is so intent he does not see the eyes of the dead creature reopen and him start moving until the Mummy is just over Fletcher and snatches the manuscript. When Byron returns he finds the mummy gone the manuscript gone and Fletcher in hysterical laughter we later learn he laughed himself to death.It is now a decade later and we are now in Cairo. An Egyptian approaches Byron at the Cairo Museum about some antiquities concerning the grave of a daughter of a Pharoah and it leads to a new expedition and opening of the grave. The Egyptian named I'mhotep is the missing Mummy Karloff and he is involved in planning to resurrect the princess his lost beloved. He takes over the soul of one of the museum guards Noble Johnson and starts planning to use a manuscript at the Museum discovered with the Princess's grave.He discovers that a young woman named Helen Grosvenor Zita Johann is visiting Byron. She is attracted to one of Byron's son David Manners but she is the spitting image of his lost love Princess Ankesen  Amon. He schemes to bring her to the alter in the Museum so that he can reunite with his lost love.With it's use of the curse two more deaths at the museum and the idea of long lost ancient knowledge from the Egyptians the film manages to carry the audience very well. The photography in particular the rapid sequence of scenes detailing I'mhotep's loss of the Princess his act of ancient sacrilege and the hideous punishment he goes through and it's aftermath it looks almost like what we would imagine Ancient Egypt would have been like. The finale when the powers of the Mummy wear off is done with a still photo carefully reprinted and carefully cracked slowly to show decay. It was a perfect ending to a wonderfully shot horror film.".

	onyx:emotionText "In 1922 most of the events of the day were fairly dull. Example Lloyd George lost his majority in Parliament and was replaced as Prime Minister by Andrew BonarLaw. Only one event of that year has remained in our collective memories. The year 1922 was the year Howard Carter found the tomb of the Pharoah Tutankhamon in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor in Egypt. The only perfectly preserved treasure of an Egyptian ruler was uncovered and it's artistic glories stunned a fascinated world. And soon the brilliance of the discovery was complicated by a series of random sudden and frequently violent deaths supposedly connected to Carter's expedition. Among those who died was the Earl of Carnaevon who financed the expedition. Supposedly he died a few days after visiting the opened tomb. So did the American millionaire George Gould and a long list of others frequently by suicide one Prince Fahmy Bay by being shot by his wife at the Savoy Hotel in London in 1923. Supposedly the Egyptians who buried King Tut had put a written curse on the doorway. It was similar ironically to the one near Shakespeare's grave cursing he who moved the Bard's bones. Few noticed that the person who should have died from such a curse Howard Carter lived to spend the rest of his life cataloging studying and writing about his finds and dying finally in 1939 peacefully in bed!

I defy you not to think about A Clockwork Orange as you watch it.Some people have said that the film glorifies skinheads. I would have to ask those people WHAT FILM WERE YOU WATCHING? This film presents skinheads and their society and says this is the way it is. It does not glorify nor does it jump on a soapbox. Not to tip anything off but by the end of the film I don't think there are going to be too many people saying being a skinhead is a wonderful life. In fact I think that is why the film is so good. The subject matter is not black and white it is very gray. Skinheads exist for a reason they do things for a reason. The reasons might sound immoral to us but the world is made up of different types. In fact most of the movie deals with Hando Russel Crowe trying very hard to hold his skinhead bunch together. However the destructive nature of the characters is  bringing about the destruction of their lifestyle.The performances in this film are great. In particular Daniel Pollock is great as Davey. I was very saddened to hear that he died right after this movie. He is often silent during the film but his facial expressions are very powerful. For anyone that is interested in examining some of the darker groups that wander around this world Romper Stomper has a very interesting one for you to look at.".

They are living in a dilapidated old garage and scrounge off the system whilst hating it. They are portrayed as hopeless angry lost kids held together by a psychopathic and violent leaderHando Where to start with Hando seriously this is undoubtedly Russel Crowe's most unforgettable performance. Whether its his tattoo's shaved head unshaven face or cold eyed glare...you can't help but be drawn in by Hando. He is by far the most relentless and ruthless member of the gang and during the film you wonder whether or not they'd even exist without him.During the film things take a turn for the worse actually they take several turns for the worst...which has an increasingly negative effect on the gang.I rated this film a 9 as it achieves what it sets out to do. Give the viewer a noholds barred trip into the destructive lives of social outsiders and the violence and hatred that follows. Not easy viewing but I recommend this film to anyone who likes their movies gritty and upfront.".

Hando and Davey's lives revolve around collecting Nazi relics and attacking Orientals that have chosen to live in Australia. The two are very tight and big believers in the cause keep Australia free of outsiders. However when a girl enters the picture one will start to see that life is more than just mindless violence and the other will go mad as he sees that his small group of Skins cannot change the fate of his country. This film is not preachy and does not come across as black and white. Both Hando and Davey have positive and negative traits. Instead the picture tries to show what motivates Skins in doing what they do. The film has some violence but only in attempt to show how pointless violence is. In my opinion this is Crowe's finest performance. Moreover the actor that played Davey is brilliant as well sadly he died shortly after the film was finished.

Especially in the final scene where the music will stay with you for long after the credits end.The acting First rate across the board. These people could have been real for all I know.This film will divide audiences because of it's subject matter but it's one of the best lesserknown lowbudget foreign offerings you're likely to see. The current 6.8 rating is an absolute travesty. I was expecting to see about 7.8 and that's why I decided to write this review.This is a disturbing film and one that I can highly recommend.It IS better than American History X.86100You Might Like THis if you Liked American History Xgood but not as good THe Boys Next Doorperhaps the last time a lowbudget dramatic film disturbed me this much  not as good as this though American Menot quite as good as this Boyz in the Hoodbetter Tzameti 13not as good.";

	schema:reviewBody "The unstylized mindnumbing violence makes it a difficult experience but Romper Stomper somehow manages to walk on that thin line between edgy and selfserving. It makes fine observations while not crossing the line and that's what makes the difference between art and mere exploitation. Enjoyable like a smack over the head the film basically gives you the horrifying spectacle of humans trying to connect. To fill a void. Through violence.The major asset of Romper Stomper is a young Russell Crowe who already dominates the space with tremendous star power. If he's not perfectly credible in this role it's only because despite his tattoos and menacing physique he simply looks too intelligent too complex for a Skinhead. A real SkinHead as I imagine it would be nothing more than a braindead inarticulate brute with no intellect whatsoever. Russell's clear voice and eyes can't help but blowing his cover.But this is no dumb realityshow and the choosing of Crowe is a wise one. We are watching here more than mindless violence  there is something going on in these characters' minds after all. And it is interesting to get a glimpse. He's the leader so he has some degree of intelligence the rest are cattle. Nobody but Russell Crowe could represent an idea so convincingly the fascination of violence.By the end of the movie I was left with the impression that these people were just a bunch of confused kids who hadn't been fortunate enough to have better rolemodels. Violent as they were they seemed to be craving deep down for something else  for a family for love and friendship. The way it plays out certainly leaves room for more open questions on nature vs nurture. However the film doesn't make excuses for the gang's behavior. On the contrary it presents them as a dying species their ideology rendered obsolete by natural evolution. The movie only tries to identify the causes of this aberration. As I see it the ending comes as both an affirmation of faith and a much needed moral position. It's good seeing a filmmaker take responsibility for a change. The director could have easily turned Hando into a tragic hero wronged by society and only taking what's rightfully his. Fortunately that doesn't happen. Great acting and direction well developed and intriguing characters compelling social commentary and above all Russell Crowe's take on a difficult role make Romper Stomper an interesting exploration of the mind.".

	schema:headline " An Absolutely Superb Piece of Filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember when this movie came out in the cinema it was both praised and attacked for its violence. Then when it came out on video my group of friends watched it and loved it so much that they got themselves a copy of it to watch it constantly. The video then went missing after somebody lent it to their boss.When I first watched Romper Stomper I watched it through the eyes of a lout and thought that it was cool. This time I watched it as a piece of literature and suddenly saw that it is a superbly crafted film with very deep characters. The film revolves around a gang of skinheads who live in Footscray an industrial suburb in Melbourne. The leader of the gang is Hando Russel Crowe a neoNazi and his side kick is Davey a more quiet and passive skinhead. One day in the pub they meet Gaye a young girl who just left her boyfriend and is looking for excitement so she hooks up with Hando.It is the characters that really make this movie. The first thing to look at is Hando because his personality makes up the personality of the whole gang. He is the leader and what he says goes. Hando is a nativist meaning that the only native race in Australia is the WASP the White AngloSaxon Protestant. His neighbourhood is being bought out by Vietnamese and this he resents. He believes that Australia is a white nation and the Asians are corrupting it so they make a habit of beating them up. Hando is fighting a war that he cannot win because the more he attacks the Vietnamese the angrier he makes them and in the end he brings the whole community onto his gang. This riot signals the beginning of the end of his gang because up until that moment they have not been defeated.Hando suffers from a fatal flaw and that is his obsession with his hatred of anything Asian. At the opening of the film he encounters a couple of Asian girls at the railway station so he and his gang beat them up. This is not a noble thing to do but rather the result of an obsession. The furthest extent of his flaw is during a breakin he sees a Japanese car so he turns his mind from the job at hand to totally decimate the car. This leads to the owner of the house getting to them with a gun forcing them to flee and leaving all of the stuff behind.Hando is the ultimate in selfcenteredness yet he refuses to acknowledge his flaw. When Gaye exposes his flaw to him instead of listening to her he throws her out. In fact his obsession leads him to severely disrespect the woman that is supposed to be his girlfriend. When she cooks dinner instead of eating it he attacks it for being Italian and throws it away. Yet without his gang Hando is nothing. As we watch his gang diminish we see the once proud and menacing figure that is Hando also diminish. His clothes become more ragged and his appearance more desperate. The scene when he arrives in Davey's bedroom after his gang are all gone depicts a man who has lost everything. And his final death by the standard issue Hitler Youth knife is fitting for one who followed the world view of Adolf Hitler. Even then the knife was made in 1944 at a time when all was lost for Germany.Davey is Hando's best friend yet rather than equals he is the one that follows Hando everywhere. Hando treats Davey as a child and in a way he is. Davey does not have the burning passion that Hando has instead he quiet and very submissive. Yet Hando realises that he needs Davey's friendship. He lets him go easily yet when his gang is all gone he comes crawling back to him. Davey claims to be Hando's best friend yet there seems to be little interaction between them until right at the end. Hando does father Davey as seen when he makes Davey comfortable after finding him passed out on the stairs. Yet it is the scene of the beach when we really see the finest interaction between Hando and Davey.Hando is the one who has all the words and his words work to sink deep into Davey's minds. Hando believes that Davey needs him and tries to convince him to dump Gaye for she is only a burden too them. It is not Davey that needs Hando but rather Hando that needs Davey. As mentioned earlier without his gang Hando is nothing and it is when his gang is gone Hando comes crawling to Davey to plead with him to join him. Even then Hando kills a service station attendant to force Davey to stay with him. Davey is easily manipulated and persuaded and it is because of this that Hando wants him around because he knows that Davey won't speak back to him.Romper Stomper is seriously a superb movie. The script is finely crafted and a lot of thought has been put into the characters their relationships their traits and their flaws. Some have claimed that there is a lot of Hollywood sensationalism in the movie but after watching it recently I am very much inclined to disagree. This is not a Hollywood movie nor is it a movie exploring the world of Skinheads and squatters but it is the tragic story of Hando who through his obsession brings destruction not only onto himself but onto all of his followers.".

The first thing to look at is Hando because his personality makes up the personality of the whole gang. He is the leader and what he says goes. Hando is a nativist meaning that the only native race in Australia is the WASP the White AngloSaxon Protestant. His neighbourhood is being bought out by Vietnamese and this he resents. He believes that Australia is a white nation and the Asians are corrupting it so they make a habit of beating them up. Hando is fighting a war that he cannot win because the more he attacks the Vietnamese the angrier he makes them and in the end he brings the whole community onto his gang. This riot signals the beginning of the end of his gang because up until that moment they have not been defeated.Hando suffers from a fatal flaw and that is his obsession with his hatred of anything Asian. At the opening of the film he encounters a couple of Asian girls at the railway station so he and his gang beat them up. This is not a noble thing to do but rather the result of an obsession. The furthest extent of his flaw is during a breakin he sees a Japanese car so he turns his mind from the job at hand to totally decimate the car. This leads to the owner of the house getting to them with a gun forcing them to flee and leaving all of the stuff behind.Hando is the ultimate in selfcenteredness yet he refuses to acknowledge his flaw. When Gaye exposes his flaw to him instead of listening to her he throws her out. In fact his obsession leads him to severely disrespect the woman that is supposed to be his girlfriend. When she cooks dinner instead of eating it he attacks it for being Italian and throws it away. Yet without his gang Hando is nothing. As we watch his gang diminish we see the once proud and menacing figure that is Hando also diminish. His clothes become more ragged and his appearance more desperate. The scene when he arrives in Davey's bedroom after his gang are all gone depicts a man who has lost everything. And his final death by the standard issue Hitler Youth knife is fitting for one who followed the world view of Adolf Hitler. Even then the knife was made in 1944 at a time when all was lost for Germany.Davey is Hando's best friend yet rather than equals he is the one that follows Hando everywhere. Hando treats Davey as a child and in a way he is. Davey does not have the burning passion that Hando has instead he quiet and very submissive. Yet Hando realises that he needs Davey's friendship. He lets him go easily yet when his gang is all gone he comes crawling back to him. Davey claims to be Hando's best friend yet there seems to be little interaction between them until right at the end. Hando does father Davey as seen when he makes Davey comfortable after finding him passed out on the stairs. Yet it is the scene of the beach when we really see the finest interaction between Hando and Davey.Hando is the one who has all the words and his words work to sink deep into Davey's minds. Hando believes that Davey needs him and tries to convince him to dump Gaye for she is only a burden too them. It is not Davey that needs Hando but rather Hando that needs Davey. As mentioned earlier without his gang Hando is nothing and it is when his gang is gone Hando comes crawling to Davey to plead with him to join him. Even then Hando kills a service station attendant to force Davey to stay with him. Davey is easily manipulated and persuaded and it is because of this that Hando wants him around because he knows that Davey won't speak back to him.Romper Stomper is seriously a superb movie. The script is finely crafted and a lot of thought has been put into the characters their relationships their traits and their flaws. Some have claimed that there is a lot of Hollywood sensationalism in the movie but after watching it recently I am very much inclined to disagree. This is not a Hollywood movie nor is it a movie exploring the world of Skinheads and squatters but it is the tragic story of Hando who through his obsession brings destruction not only onto himself but onto all of his followers.";

	schema:reviewBody "There is tremendous controversy over whether or not this film is pro skinhead or not. Whereas American History X is obviously antiracist Romper Stomper is not and there in lies its greatness. In all fleeting appearances Romper Stomper seems like a romantic tale for racist skinheads but in actuality it is a tragic love story between societal outcasts two of which happen to be skinheads. In context the film is a commentary on humanity friendship and love. The skinhead aspect of the movie is technically trivial in comparison to the love triangle of the three main characters. I won't go as far as saying that Romper Stomper carries the same weight as a Shakespearean tragedy but the comparison is valid. Those growing up in urban regions would quickly discount that statement due to an inability of seeing past the political overtones of the skinhead theme but the truth is that a significant proportion of the world's population can at least identify with Hando and his friends. Thus the only two ways of really appreciating this movie is either by being a racist skinhead or by seeing beyond that issue and examining the relationship between Hando Davey and Gabe which happens to be brutally honest and human in my opinion. The score is excellent if not unintentionally distracting from the theme of the movie. The acting is extremely brilliant as well as is the cinematography which is appropriately gritty. Bottom line is do not read too much into the skinhead aspect attempt to understand the characters as human beings first and skinheads second and you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is probably the best movie about racism that I've seen chiefly because it doesn't try to explain anything.  It just presents these young white Australian guys who don't like the increasing presence of Asians chiefly Vietnamese.  Interestingly after the opening subway scene we don't even see them doing much racializing they just go about their grubby little lives. All that really happens is that eventually one of them dies.  There's no catharsis no great lesson learned the surviving characters stay locked in their limited lives.  Which maybe is the point any ism to which one subscribes is ultimately a kind of box.  One may freely take this lack of freedom to the grave.  The rest of the world goes on with it's business.Thenunknown Russell Crowe steals the show as Hando the most radical Skinhead.  Crowe has a kind of DennisHopperesque quality the ability to convey menace while seeming almost preoccupied.  His American roles have required him to interact with large numbers of characters e.g. Proof of Life Gladiator A Beautiful Mind in which he levels his RichardBurtonlaser gaze at all and sundry and flexes the occasional muscle when necessary.  In Romper Stomper he's mostly isolated his Hando has elaborate tattoos that only he and a couple others ever get to see.  The shortness of his fuse makes his time bomb tick all the louder. In a scene where he tries to explain his views to a mate while doing pullups it seems a shame that if Hando had only a little more insight into himself he'd grasp how he's wasting his life.  Certainly there's no one around him who'll point that out to him for various reasons. Americans should watch this partly to remember how horrible American History X was in comparison.  That latter flick DOES try to explain everything about the Skinhead played by Edward Norton and thus falls into a trap of it's own making.  When Norton's character says about blacks Slavery ended 130 years ago when are these people going to get their act together? it sounds like a not unreasonable question especially since blacks are also seen doing bad things.  But the point they should be making is that it's INDIVIDUALS who do good or bad.  In a neighborhood that's almost entirely black of course most of the criminals will be mostly black likewise most of the victims.  Romper Stomper cleverly steers clear of all that.Excellent use is made of a certain prop a World War II era SS knife without getting too allegorical with it.".

Yet in reality this is in essence a simple tale of good versus evil  the damned versus the saved  Hando versus Davey.SPOILER The lines may be blurred perhaps rendered almost unrecognisable by their mutual racism and violent tendencies but once Davey finds an opportunity for possible redemption in the form of Gabe it is this story's aim to establish whether he can overcome the true evil that personifies his best friend.I appreciate that Russell Crowe's Hando may be the stand out character for many but for me Daniel Pollack's wistful Davey and his inner battles provide the performance of the film and the hook upon which the storyline demands our sympathy.POSSIBLE SPOILER Without meaning to sound patronising the extent to which Pollack's performance was driven by his own demons the demons that led him to take his own life before the film was released is hard to know. Yet the anguish uncertainty and complexity of Davey's outlook provided a more pleasing study in disaffected youth than that of Hando's who was essentially an unreconstructed thug with empty pretensions towards intellectualising his violence.SPOILER You are always aware that Hando is heading in one direction only  self destruction but the flicker of selfawareness in Davey crystalised by his burgeoning love for Gabe helps us the audience to forgive him his sins which are plentiful.SPOILER Hando is beyond help but in comparison Davey is 'redeemable' and thus the film cleverly allows us to feel comfortable with our affection for a man who we have seen perform wicked acts.There are few better examples of this comparison than the two sex scenes  the first between Gabe and Hando is a soulless expression of dominance an almost brutal act lacking any affection. But when Gabe and Davey are together we are presented with the entwining of two people expressing nothing but love for each other.SPOILER And thus by the time we reach the denouement on the beach the battle lines have been drawn and we are in no doubt as to where our affections lie. We are presented with a Shakespearian tragedy as Hando demands loyalty from his friend and the destruction of the supposedly malevolent Gabe.That Davey rejects Hando's pleas is the film's great 'Rocky' moment  we are cheering for him! and yet we have conveniently disregarded his devilish acts in the films earlier scenes.YEP IT'S A SPOILER Hando's death is the only possible outcome and it duly comes  but to what extent Davey is now free is questionable. His involvement in a string of violent crimes would have to catch up with him.Nevertheless in the purest sense he has triumphed by rejecting the evil of Hando and embracing his more honest desires for Gabe. He has broken a wicked cycle and for that has allowed whatever latent morality he may possess to overcome his worst characteristics.SPOILERDavey  the lesser of two evils?

Years down the line I finally get around to seeing Romper Stomper and that actor is international superstar Russell Crowe! And he does give quite a excellent performance on par with everything he has made since. Actually everyone gave very believable and riveting performances with the very controlled and well timed direction of Geoffrey Wright. Overall the production and story are above par and it is very easy to get sucked in to everything. But I had to wonder what the overall purpose of the main characters being neonazi skinheads was. Although there was a sense of futileness to all the racial violence happening there didn't seem to be a statement at the root of the film. The story starts as a look at a pack of skinheads and ends as a human story of two friends and the girl that finally helped the follower become the leader in their relationship. The fact that they were skinheads did not seem to have relevance to the core story the two friends could have been mere thieves part of a gang or even wall street moguls and the story could have taken the same route. So in the end I was left wondering What was the point of adding the racial card if there was no statement being made? Nevertheless Romper Stomper was a riveting movie that portrays the selfdestructiveness that results from hatred with some excellent performances by the leads.".

This movie come out the same year as did Friday the 13th Part 2 my favorite horror film. They are so many horror films in 1981 I haven't hear see or they are forgotten. This movie however surprised me. It ripped off Friday the 13th no it didn't! This movie was different it was a revenge film but it was different than Friday the 13th. It is an original story not a copycat of other slasher films. Honestly I think this movie is much way better horror movie than Friday the 13th Part 2. This movie has a different story it is not that bad and it is a good slasher movie and it just become my favorite horror film.The story follows campers from summer camp goes with canoe trip to Devil's Creek once there they become targets from a former summer camp caretaker horribly burned from a prank gone wrong with a pair of hedge clippers to take revenge on the campers. Once there they are trapped while assailant is stalking them and kills them one by one. I enjoy this film it is not a bad slasher horror film it is instant classic and really puts most of horror films to shame. It has a lot of nudity with girls been naked and sexy. This days I don't see any naked girls in any slasher horror films today. They don't make horror movies like this one in the woods today. Back in the 80's was more work than today. Tom Savini from Dawn of the Dead makes special effect for more gory blood and they work. Just like he did special effects for Friday the 13th Friday the 13th The Final Chapter and Dawn of the Dead he makes effects for this movie and the gory kills really works. There is a lot of scares and twists in here that keeps getting you interested and intense. It doesn't allowed you tostop watching it. Friday the 13th part 2 My Bloody Valentine The Burning The Howling and American Werewolf in London are really in my top five favorite films from 1981 in horror genre. Why can't we get movies like this?Directed and original story by Tony Maylam who directed the film really good. I miss movies like this today and I think it is a really good movie.Brian Matthews Brian Backer Carrick Glenn and Carolyn Houlihan were believable at acting and they were really good. 810 this movie is an instant classic in the horror genre from the 80's for me.".

The late seventies laid the groundwork for what was to become a stable formula for these movies and for a minimum budget and isolated surroundings the films could provide some solid shocks and gore that pleased audiences.The Burning is nearly identical in plot and storyline to Friday the 13th. Here the bad guy is a burn victim as a result of a prank gone awry and years later he takes vengeance on unsuspecting campers in gruesome fashion. While the movie is pretty slow and the gore fest doesn't really start until an hour in it's never boring. Here's where the film is different from Friday the 13th and many others The teens aren't merely disposable pricks who you can't wait see get their grisly demise. They're actually a pretty likable bunch well played by some future stars Jason Alexander particularly likable here and Fisher Stevens among them and when some get slashed you kinda feel bad for them.Now for what really counts. Two things gore and mood. The Tom Savini gore effects do not disappoint. Keep in mind that this is 1981 and digital effects have improved horror gore somewhat but this is pretty impressive stuff. The raft scene is a particular standout. As for mood you can't beat these early 80's aloneinthewoods scenarios and they're all well played out here. Although there are a lot of false scares here they're buildups are great and the creepy surroundings go a long way. If films like Psycho made people afraid to take a shower and Jaws made people afraid of the water then films like The Burning and Friday the 13th must have made a few parents hesitant at sending their kids to summer camps.Fans of slasher films will not want to miss The Burning. Although Friday the 13th is more suspenseful and The Burning feels a bit too stretched it nevertheless has plenty of good moments and top notch kill scenes. What's not to like?".

The special effects were done by Tom Savini n he nailed it. The raft scene is the best highlight. Lots of stabbings via the gardening shears slashings severed fingers etc. It's definitely worth a view for fans of slasher movies. There is sufficient violence n nudity but the sex scene is one of the lamest. The plot a group of kids decides to play a prank on the caretaker of a camp. The joke goes bad n the victim sets himself on fire. He is released after five years from the hospital but his face has been deformed n he seeks vengeance. The cast included future wellknown actors. The movie is full of slasher clichs wandering away from everyone for a nude pond dip having sex in the woods going down to the basement alone not defending oneself but rather running helterskelter not making an effort to make sure that the killer is dead once its down. The movie has one very different aspect there was no waiting until the end for the big reveal of the killer's identity its fully revealed from the onset. The cinematography is decent with the lush greens of the camps surrounding forest n the images of flowing water.".

	schema:reviewBody "I believe I've found what must be the seminal summer camp slasher film of the 1980s. It captures every element of the decade's obsession with movies like Friday the 13th and Meatballs and puts them in one package. Shout! Factory has scored again with their Bluray release of The Burning.The caretaker of a summer camp is burned alive and left deformed after a prank goes wrong. Years later he's released from the hospital and returns to the area where the accident occurred. A new group of campers have arrived for the summer and he has horrific plans for them. Hedge clippers in hand the caretaker begins his reign of terror on the counselors and attendees.The Burning has the raunchy toilet humor of Meatballs mixed with everything you came to expect from slasher films like Friday the 13th and Sleepaway Camp. You have nice girls making bad decisions by hooking up with bad guys. Unfortunately the killer sees all and punishes them for their perverse deeds.I always thought the killer in Friday the 13th Part V A New Beginning was the first to utilize hedge clippers. I was very wrong as you can see in The Burning. It's obvious the psycho in A New Beginning took inspiration from the crazy caretaker.It's unbelievable how many big names are attached to The Burning. Harvey Weinstein created and cowrote the story. Bob Weinstein cowrote the screenplay. Special Makeup Artist Tom Savini returns to camp for a second time after his classic work on Friday the 13th. His handiwork keeps the blood flowing efficiently.Brian Backer plays a character more annoying than the one he did in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Jason Alexander yes George Costanza portrays a sporty and popular high schooler. He has a full head of hair and doesn't wear glasses. Holly Hunter can be seen briefly as a camper. She looks like she was maybe 13 years old.The Burning is another one of those cult classics many people forget about in the shadow of Friday the 13th. If you're a fan of 1980s slasher movies it's a mustown.".

OK not so original...in fact you might say that it reminds you of FRIDAY THE 13TH right? Duh by now you should know that this is an F13 ripoff. But here's the great part this movie is not only gorier than F13 it is better acted better paced and has better characters. Three of them are played by future stars Jason Alexander Holly Hunter with no lines! Ha! and Fisher Stevens! Alexander even has hair but he plays the typical fat guy jokester. He doesn't get butchered though.Tom Savini supposedly turned down F13 PART 2 to do the special effects for this film. It's pretty good that he did this since the effects are part of the appeal of THE BURNING. The highlight of the film the dispatching of an entire group of kids on a raft using giant shears! Truly amazing!THE BURNING was severely cut by the MPAA and international censors as well. It has yet to turn up legally uncut in the US other than a brief uncut video release and it is aching for a DVD release by Anchor Bay! Until then try to find a copy at your momandpop store. You will not be disappointed!".

	schema:headline " Overall Decent Slasher Fare";
	schema:reviewBody "The Burning showed up on Showtime late one night as I've noticed many rare films have one time I saw a really strange Italian actionadventure movie from the 80s complete with bad dubbing and all so I decided to tape it hoping to finally see the infamous raft scene which was probably the only reason I wanted to see this. Well let's just say the movie didn't live up to ALL my expectations but it wasn't terrible. The story is fairly generic complete with rehashed backstory about Cropsy being burned to neardeath by some mischevious campers. After five years in the hospital ! he's finally released so what's the first thing he does? Solicits a prostitute of course with terribly gory results. Eventually he makes his way to a summer camp armed with some gardening shears to do some dirty work as only a slasher movie villain can. The real deal doesn't start until some counselors and campers wellestablished in the Meatballslike interum of forty minutes head off on a canoeing trip down the river. Cropsy comes along and only then manages to do away with some not enough of our unlucky characters. So who are these people? Well there's Todd Brian Matthews the brawny head counselor who only wants everyone to get along Michelle Leah Ayres his likable cocounselor and girlfriend I suppose Alfred Brian Backer the weird outcast who seems to eternally annoy Glazer Larry Joshua our stock bully character. Rounding out the main characters are Karen Caroline Houlihan and her slimy boyfriend Eddy Ned Eisenberg kindly prankster Dave Jason Alexander Glazer's girlfriend Sally Carrick Glenn and Woodstock Fisher Stevens who...well who's just plain weird and he's got the stupidest laugh ever.Anyway most of these people are all killed before the credits roll and only the ones you really end up liking survive. As far as who survives well it's usually a bit more predictable earlier on in the movie. Took me a while to figure out who was playing who. I thought Karen was the final girl at first and Michelle was the slutty friend. In the end though there really is no final girl at least not in the conventional manner. Sure there's a female character left standing I wonder who take a wild guess but most of the climactic action is left to two male characters which while unique to the genre did not work for me. I mean I realize that Alfred's character was supposed to be sympathetic and we were supposed to worry about him during that delirious neverending run through the woods but that job is better performed by a token heroine. I guess I'm just oldfashioned. I don't mind a male hero sort of expected I guess but when all the heroine is given is one scene of peril and then some dull scenes on a boat the tension all but dies away for me. Anyway speaking of all this carnage the gore in this movie is unbelievable. I definitely winced a few times particularly with the prostitute's murder and would expect nothing less from Tom Savini. And that my friends leads me to the raft scene. It was I'm sorry to say a letdown. I mean the suspense that builds as you realize what's going to happen in the scene is really wellestablished and I was on the edge of my seat. But then...it's over in a few seconds. The scene is extremely rushed and while somewhat gory didn't really seem like a whole lot of carnage. Now I'm not a fan of watching mass killings or anything but I suppose I was just hoping the scene lived up to its reputation and it really didn't.As far as music there's an excellent score that works well with the movie and always adds a little edge to things. Actingwise everyone does pretty well. Leah Ayres was a little uneven. While at some points she was excellent and her delivery was righton at others like when she was angry she got a little melodramatic. Jason Alexander shines and it's no surprise he went on to be something big. Holly Hunter the movie's other budding star is barely in the movie. You see her a few times once they go on the rafting trip but she has very little dialogue and not much to do. Oh well. Everyone else is decent to say the least. There's quite a bit of nudity in this one more than I expected and the shot of people mooning someone a staple of camp slasher films is here and is quite hideous thanks to Fisher Stevens. Probably one of the most hideous butt shots in film history. Anyway The Burning isn't a bad movie but it isn't great. There aren't many genuine scares and towards the end things seem to inexplicably lose a lot of suspense. I suggest you see it though. It's probably required viewing for slasher fans.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Burning showed up on Showtime late one night as I've noticed many rare films have one time I saw a really strange Italian actionadventure movie from the 80s complete with bad dubbing and all so I decided to tape it hoping to finally see the infamous raft scene which was probably the only reason I wanted to see this. Well let's just say the movie didn't live up to ALL my expectations but it wasn't terrible. The story is fairly generic complete with rehashed backstory about Cropsy being burned to neardeath by some mischevious campers. After five years in the hospital ! he's finally released so what's the first thing he does? Solicits a prostitute of course with terribly gory results. Eventually he makes his way to a summer camp armed with some gardening shears to do some dirty work as only a slasher movie villain can. The real deal doesn't start until some counselors and campers wellestablished in the Meatballslike interum of forty minutes head off on a canoeing trip down the river.

The most important thing is that 'The Burning' has more likeable characters and they are killed off in gorier and more flamboyant ways. This makes it one of the few knock offs that I can think of that surpasses the original. The thing that really makes this outstanding isn't the handful of actors in the cast of unknowns that went on to bigger and better things Jason Alexander Holly Hunteretc. but Tom Savini's realistic and gruesome effects some of his best work.  I don't think you really watch a slasher movie for much more than some shocks and some gore and this has both in spades making it one of the very best slasher movies of the 80s. This genre isn't my favourite kind of horror but I enjoyed 'The Burning' a great deal and the uncut version is worth tracking down for the raft sequence alone which is unforgettable and very very cool.

	schema:reviewBody "Though the main draw of this virtual Friday The 13th clone is unquestionably the FX work of Tom Savini The Burning is an enjoyable slasher flick in its own right and it's likely that even without the maestro on hand this would still be a serviceable outing. With a couple of surprisingly effective jumpscares a fantastic score by Rick Wakeman and early appearances by some solid character actors like Larry Joshua and Ned Eisenberg there are some quality elements here that drastically elevate the rote material.Elsewhere most of the film follows the splatter movie guidebook to the letter right down to the campfire retelling of the killer's origin and the false scare that follows. Strangely an eerily identical scene appears in Friday The 13th Part 2 which even utilizes identical camera angles but since the films were produced at roughly the same time and released a week apart it's impossible to figure out who copied who. The characters are all timetested archetypes the prankster the bully the sexpot etc. and in keeping with the standard tropes of the genre most of the actors are clearly far older than the teens they play. Seinfeld's George Alexander is the most obviously out of place and he appears to be well into his 30's here. However his sophomoric antics and full head of hair offer genuine curiosity value and if you've ever secretly wanted to see George Costanza's bare buttocks this is the movie for you.The Burning does run a bit slow and the particularly nasty murder of a prostitute early in the movie seems tacked on to tide gore fans over for the 40 minutes of summer camp antics that follow since it makes absolutely no sense in the scope of the plot. While the first killing does augment the rather svelte body count the tone of the sequence plays out like an outtake from Maniac and this tidbit of gratuitous butchery is decidedly disjointed from the rest of the film. After this befuddling introduction the film spends far too much time developing the dynamics of the onedimensional campers. However when the fun with pruning shears portion of the program eventually kicks in The Burning starts unfolding like a topnotch slasher film and the ensuing splatter is offered up with reckless abandon. An extended throatslitting lingers on screen far longer than any fan familiar with the wimpy stance of the MPAA will be expecting and when you see how explicitly the death of the film's stereotypical machismoladen lunkhead is presented you'll reach the very pleasant realization that despite the R on the back of the case the DVD release of The Burning is actually the original Unrated cut. A nifty mass slaughter on a makeshift raft plays like a Tom Savini highlight reel and those who appreciate the artistry inherent in the days of classic gore effects will probably end up rewinding that sequence a few times.Though the killer's backstory isn't particularly novel Savini brings Cropsy to vivid life with the help of some great prosthetics and had this film been as successful as the Crystal Lake follies it blatantly emulates this would have been an interesting character to follow through a franchise.The climax where Cropsy is revealed in all his charred glory brings the affair to a sturdy finish though attentive viewers will spot a couple of glaring gaffes. The final scene suggests a sequel without demanding one which ends the film on a haunting note that ties things up in a tidy and satisfying package.The Burning isn't quite a classic but any fan of the genre has squandered 90 minutes in far worse ways than this. The best portions of this modest thriller are right on par with the most classic moments in the genre and since The Burning delivers all of the most crucial elements of a great slasher movie it ultimately ends up being a rousing success. For what it's worth this is a personal favorite.".

As far as 80s summer camp teenkill slashers go it's pretty standard on the surface. Mean caretaker is nearly burned to death by some rotten campers in a horrible prank gone wrong then returns years later to lay waste to a new generation of campers. However there's a sense that the Weinsteins wanted their summer camp slasher to turn up the volume a little bit. There's more nudity. There's the infamous raft scene which seems to say Kill two characters at once? How about FIVE? The kill scenes are great which should be expected after poaching Tom Savini from the F13 franchise. They last a little longer and go a little deeper and make us gorehounds a little happier.The characters also seem more realistic than in other similar flicks  for the most part they're flawed and have a little bit of character development. Three in particular stand out...Alfred gets picked on BECAUSE HE DESERVES IT. He's creepy and annoying and awful and he doesn't get Todd's protection because deep down he's an OK kid  he gets it because it's Todd's job. Speaking of Todd he's cast as our hero but he's got one heck of a dark past. And then there's Michelle who in spite of being our heroine spends most of the movie being a total bitch.So on the surface The Burning may be a bit of a letdown after years of building up expectations but once you start to compare and contrast and let its nasty little charms work their magic you may be like me and come to love it.".

This is probably the first though and it's famous for being banned although I can't see why yes this movie is quite scary and has the famous and always appreciated Raft Massacre which I found was brilliant I can't think of many other death scenes that inventive.In the mass quantity of Friday the 13th clones I must reiterate that The Burning is one of the best. In a professional outlook on the movie I could go on about the downfalls and that character development being hardly motivated however I know a little better. I appreciate The Burning for what it is. I do enjoy laughing at it but who wouldn't? Most early 80's slasher movies are laugh riots.As I stated before this film really crushes its competition. Peeping out from behind the massive shadow cast from Friday the 13th was The Burning. In its fall release of 1981 the movie was already on its way to being forgotten but not to those who mattered. The fans weren't knocking down the doors in 81' but they're here now and The Burning is in high demand. Why? Lets start with the obvious shall we? The acting...oh lord... the acting. I give whopping four stars to Larry Joshua for really stealing the show. In all seriousness Joshua's acting was so awful it had me in tears. you guys looking at girly magazines You might want to try the real thing let me tell ya. Shakespeare I know. Surprisingly the movie spawned an allstar cast no I'm not talking about Joshua. Jason Alexander and Holly Hunter both had their theatrical debut in this 80's gore fest. Brian Baker also had a little success in the future with Fast Times at Ridgemont High.".

In a professional outlook on the movie I could go on about the downfalls and that character development being hardly motivated however I know a little better. I appreciate The Burning for what it is. I do enjoy laughing at it but who wouldn't? Most early 80's slasher movies are laugh riots.As I stated before this film really crushes its competition. Peeping out from behind the massive shadow cast from Friday the 13th was The Burning. In its fall release of 1981 the movie was already on its way to being forgotten but not to those who mattered. The fans weren't knocking down the doors in 81' but they're here now and The Burning is in high demand. Why? Lets start with the obvious shall we? The acting...oh lord... the acting. I give whopping four stars to Larry Joshua for really stealing the show. In all seriousness Joshua's acting was so awful it had me in tears. you guys looking at girly magazines You might want to try the real thing let me tell ya. Shakespeare I know. Surprisingly the movie spawned an allstar cast no I'm not talking about Joshua. Jason Alexander and Holly Hunter both had their theatrical debut in this 80's gore fest. Brian Baker also had a little success in the future with Fast Times at Ridgemont High.";

	schema:reviewBody "Future Miramax honchos Bob and Harvey Weinstein made their big break into filmmaking with this movie based on the reallife roundthecampfire scary story of the Kropsy Maniac filmed in upstate New York around the same time as the thematically similar Madman.Here the psychotic killer is actually named Cropsy and was a drunken abusive caretaker at a summer camp before accidentally burning himself  badly  after a prank concocted by vindictive campers goes bad. Five years later poor Cropsy Lou David now deformed and loosed upon the world after a long hospital stay punctuated by unsuccessful skin graft operations returns to the area he knows so well to exact extremely brutal vengeance with a pair of garden shears.That weapon alone is enough to make Cropsy iconic and although this movie is very standard stuff story wise it's executed with skill by a crew headed by director Tony Maylam. Its biggest draw is undeniably the excellent makeup effects work by Tom Savini. Granted we do sort of get it in small doses until the one sequence that has basically cemented The Burning's reputation  the mass murder of the kids on the raft which absolutely must be seen in its uncut form. There's also a very intense full body burn early on and good atmosphere in the climax which appropriately takes place in a run down mine that the filmmakers had located. An appreciable stylistic touch are the movie's fades to red future director Jack Sholder Alone in the Dark 1982 A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 Freddy's Revenge The Hidden was the editor. The cool and creepy electronic music score is the work of Rick Wakeman.Brian Matthews as male lead Todd and Leah Ayres as female lead Michelle are okay but over shadowed by the supporting cast including some very familiar faces who went on to great fame in the years to come  Jason Alexander who's a hoot as smug lifeoftheparty type guy Dave Fisher Stevens as the amiable Woodstock Brian Backer Rat in Fast Times at Ridgemont High as nerdy outcast Alfred Ned Eisenberg as obnoxious aggressive Eddy and Larry Joshua who's a riot as domineering bully Glazer. Oscar winner Holly Hunter is in it too although just barely. Lovely ladies Carrick Glenn as Sally Glazer's girl and Carolyn Houlihan as Karen the gal whom Eddy pursues show off their fine bodies as a plus.As in any movie of this type the location shooting is impressive and the characters for a change are for the most part likable enough types even Glazer's not really THAT bad no way do they really deserve what happens to them. Not that it makes the gory mayhem any less enjoyable of course. Furthermore it's refreshing that The Burning departs from slasher convention in at least one respect the villain faces not a Final Girl during the climax but two Final Guys.It's highly recommended viewing for any slasher fan new to this particular sub genre. It is fun stuff.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "A bunch of kids at a camp decide to play a prank on Cropsy. The prank goes wrong and scars Cropsy for life with severe burns. Now he's back out of rehab and wants his revenge! Yes this is the full uncut version being reviewed but I don't see the big deal with the uncut footage. I'm sure the VHS copy I rented here in Australia had the exact same scenes. Yes the raft scene is ultimately violent and looks very realistic in most aspects but that's about the extent of its violence except for maybe the hooker scene and doesn't do much from other slashers considering all other scenes involved.There are a few young actors in The Burning who rose to fame many years later after this film had been released but contributed nothing to their popularity. Those being Jason Alexander you know George from Seinfeld and Holly Hunter who is hardly in this movie at all and not really worth mentioning. All of the cast give no great performances but do the movie justice for what it's worth. No awards to give here...I can't say the music is all that enjoyable to listen to either. This may just be me but I hardly ever enjoy 80's music in horror films. It just seems loud and noisy but if you like music in your older horror film the music here should be nothing to worry about. Tom Savini does a nice job on the gore effects here which don't seem to be all that different from his works on Friday the 13th which this film is strangely similar to in style as is most 80's slashers.The Cropsy character is an interesting character though gives no evidence of being a mean person before his accident. I wish I knew what he was like before he got burnt but then again maybe he was a bore and was better off not being showed before the prank. Either way Cropsy looks rather monsterish in his one and only film debut. I'd be interested in a sequel if that were to ever happen but most likely never.Overall The Burning is your standard slasher film that wins points for being one of the earliest 80's slashers and being so daring as to being so violent that the movie was actually banned in many countries. Unfortunately The Burning falls into the if you've seen one slasher you've seen them all category. If you don't like your mindless violence you're not going to love it...".

There's a couple of scenes of full frontal nudity. You get to see some annoying kids get violently dispatched.The problem is it's nothing new and nothing special. It felt like the Weinstein's wrote the script after reading Slasher Films For Dummies. If the only slasher movie you've seen before this one is the original Friday the 13th you can still predict everything that will happen. This movie isn't even a copy of Friday the 13th. It's a copy of a copy. It felt like the people making this movie didn't like or understand horror movies. They hit all the right notes for a slasher movie without seeming to understand the genre. It's no surprise that these guys would later head up Dimension films and churn out endless Screams Final Destinations and I Know What You Did Last Summers.When you think about it there's no rhyme or reason for anything that happens in this movie. An angry guy picks a bunch of kids at random and bumps them off. No never mind. That sounds like the plot to an okay movie at least. There is zero suspense or tension in this flick. For the first forty minutes or so at camp NOTHING happens. This time isn't used to foreshadow anything or establish the killer's motivation or anything. Just a half hour or so of weird looking kids at summer camp. At the end they sort of try to tie it back to the beginning but when the big 'revelation' happens you realize that even though you as a viewer can see a connection the killer wouldn't have this info.I don't know. Most of the other reviews I've read for this movie are pretty enthusiastic so maybe it's me. But aside from the overthetop violence and copious nudity this film was a total letdown. And is it just me or are garden shears just sort of a goofy weapon?".

	schema:reviewBody "I must have been in a mental fog when this came out initially as I just recently discovered it on Netflix Streaming. The beginning of the film opens with a camp worker getting pranked but then the prank goes awry by the juvenile boys that produce this prank and the worker ends up being engulfed in flames. The film starts like many of those slasher films of the early eighties like Friday the 13th Happy Birthday to me etc... BUT what transpires afterward  well I got to admit surprised me. I was expecting a slew of teen murders at a camp lots of blood and gore and some maniacal killer with almost inhuman qualities. I did get the second and to some degree the third BUT what I did not get was a bunch of teen characters cavorting in the woods and then brutally slain when about to have sex. You know those characters that you do not even know their names because they are just fodder for Jason or Mchael or Freddy. The camp in this film was humanized. The kids had names. We got to know them a bit. We got to care for some of them a bit. The girls were not wholly objectified. Don't get me wrong this is a slasher movie but it is better than most of the junk that was made in that period. Special effects maestro Tom Savini does his grisly best to supply vast bloodletting. There were a couple scenes where I had to turn awaythe hooker scene with the belly was for me the absolute worst and also the least necessary. The famous or infamous raft scene  well it was indeed something you would not forget. But the film does have a story beyond the killings. That may be because it was scripted by the Weinstein brothers before they started Miramax. They obviously have talent. The settings were very good and LIT  this film is pretty bright for a slasher film. The acting by a cast of then nobodies was very good. We get three future stars if you will here  all young enthusiastic and carefree  Fisher Stevens Holly Hunter and Jason Alexander WITH hair! I liked this film. The whole thing with Cropsy and his garden shears was effectively done. The story of his revenge was interesting and the film as a whole was entertaining and invested more from me then just a desire to see sick gutting on the screen. There is also just as a reminder again a lot of bloodletting in this film. It is a slasher film but just one of the better ones made. The print streaming on Netflix now is pristine too! the end of the film in the caves was very well shot and paced.".

	schema:headline " The Best 80's Slasher Since Friday the 13th!";
	schema:reviewBody "Put together the genius effects of goremaster Tom Savini a creepy killer gratuitous nudity and a likable cast including the debuts of very popular actors and what do you get? You get The Burning the best 80's slasher movie since Friday the 13th! After a prank goes wrong Cropsy the sadistic drunk caretaker is horribly disfigured after being burned alive. Five years go by and since skin grafts aren't working out for the caretaker of Camp Blackfoot the hospital has to let Cropsy go. As Cropsy goes back out into the world his feelings for revenge are more wild than ever. He heads to a new summer camp Camp Stonewater where it's all about having fun making friends and doing all the nonos in the slasher book. A group of freshfaced teensincluding Todd Michelle Glazer Sally Eddie Karen and Alfred are taking a trip to Devil's Creek which is on the other side of the camp. As expected kids have sex smoke some pot you get it. Well too bad for the campers of Camp Stonewater because they're very close to the old remains of Camp Blackfoot and Cropsy is watching them ready to tear them apart with his large garden shears.Tom Savini has said that The Burning is not a Friday the 13th ripoff even though it has those elements. He says that the Weinstein brothersThe Burning was their first movie already had the script for this movie before F13. That really surprised me since everybody knows F13 for being one of the biggest slasher movies ever.There are so many things that make The Burning stand on its own as a great slasher movie. First there's the excellent effects of Tom Savini who creates some of the most perfect kills of the 80's slasher trend including the infamous raft massacre sequence.Next there's an awesome cast of young talented teens. Brian Matthews and Leah Ayres are very good as Todd and Michelle Larry Joshua is so lovably hateful as Glazer Brian Backer of Fast Times At Ridgemont High fame makes a very good outcast as Alfred Jason AlexanderGeorge of Seinfeld is awesome as Dave and so is a young Fisher StevensShort Circuit as Woodstock and if you look close enough Holly Hunter is in there as Sophie. And Lou David is very creepy as Cropsy. The cast is gigantic so I don't want to drag this paragraph out.Also there's the great direction of Tony Maylam who never made another horror movie after The Burning. He actually has some style filming wonderful POV shots those amazing kills and he chose the right place to film the movie.And finally The Burning has a very creative techno vintage score by Rick Wakeman who is popular for being in the hit rock band YES!. His music creates a remarkable sense of dread and tension. God this guy should do more stuff in horror movies. Coming from The Burning he shows a lot of talent.Although the script is a little bit thin Tony Maylam's 1981 goreific slasher flick is one of the most awesome movies to come out of the genre. As much as I love Friday the 13th I'm considering that The Burning might be better than its predecessor. They're both equal so I'm not going to compare them. If you're a true fan you must have The Burning in your collection. This is slasher movie gold!".

	schema:reviewBody "By now we all know that FRIDAY THE 13TH was an extension of all those beloved hookhanded serial killer campfire stories and most everything since riffs on some twisted variation of those basic staples. SLEEPAWAY CAMP. JUST BEFORE DAWN. RITUALS. WRONG TURN.THE BURNING does the exact same thing with gruesome effectiveness. Although a lot of fans accused it of ripping off Jason and Company this is one sick little puppy of a serial killer classic that has its own nasty groove. Cropsy Lou David the nasty caretaker of a teen summer camp is constantly snitching lurking about and giving the snotnosed little bastards a hard time. So they decide to engage their chief tormentor in a little payback involving some lit candles and an appropriately horrific prop...which all goes predictably horrifyingly wrong. Cropsy is burned beyond even being recognized as human...and that's no exaggeration. The first murder in the movie  NOT a teenager mind you  establishes pretty much that his mood matches his new looks. His weapon of choice? The biggest sharpest nastiest looking pair of garden shears this side of the Home Depot from Hell. You almost feel sorry for the kids in this flick...Cropsy makes Jason Voorhees look compassionate by comparison. The first movie produced by Miramax's Bob and Harvey Weinstein and one of the earliest solo flights by makeup marvel Tom Savini THE BURNING fell victim to the Video Nasties controversy that raged in London during the Eighties and as a result a lot of the horrifying set pieces here were neutered down to a latenight shock show edit. The one and only version I saw released on EMITHORN Home Video on VHS!!! That's how long it's been! had been restored somewhat but the cuts made were so sloppy you could tell all the way through that there was TONS of stuff missing and hopefully not lost forever.Having said that there is one sequence in particular that gives this movie an original and truly gruesome flavor that even most of the FT13 sequels put together couldn't match. Even severely edited the scene still packs a pretty major gutpunch for audiences jaded by most of the poorlymade crap in this subgenre and I hope to see it in its jawdropping entirety one of these days.Taking yet another cue from FT13 the cast is made up mostly of unknowns though sharp eyed buffs will note early appearances of both Jason Alexander and Fisher Stevens. As the boxes advertised much later yes Holly Hunter does appear here but what she gets to do is look scared and cry a lot. I guess it won't spoil anything to tell you that she doesn't die so there is something to be said for not having a featured role in a horror movie...if you want your part to last for a while anyway.Anyway director Tony Maylam ups the ante when it comes to the viciousness of the death sequences since Sean Cunningham did raise the bar with his 'epic.' And THE BURNING'S goosebumpraising electronic score comes from YES's keyboard wiz Rick Wakeman no less. Some people prefer the chchchchhahahaha familiarity of Harry Manfredini's unforgettable themes but Rick does hold his own here.Here's hoping for a properly remastered and letterboxed version of this outdoorsy out 'goresy' classic.".

I think it's about what relationship is what love is and isn't and most of all about the experience it takes and the resulting wisdom to build relationship beyond an adolescent understanding of love and attraction. And the great value of the selfknowledge that results. For me that adult perspective was so refreshing and so rare that it beats out every other consideration. Especially given the idiotic popular fare we're used to these days which substitutes a junior high school age cynicism for the difficult work of love. Along with say Dodsworth for some reason Hollywood in this period was capable of some genuinely mature work for adults. The popular culture could use a little more. With Ogden Nash in the writing credits I shouldn't be surprised at what I found valuable in this film.".

Joslyn would like it to be the start of a marriage but his cynical frame of mind is not what Crawford can accept outside of friendship. She meets wealthy Wisconsin gentleman farmer Melvin Douglas and he gets her to agree to marry him Joslyn is uncertain about the wisdom of the move not only from selfinterest but from concern that Crawford will be a fish out of water. Another party who is troubled by the marriage is Douglas's brother Robert Young who thinks Crawford will be too like her friends. Despite this Young and Douglas marry and soon are in Wisconsin. They bring with them Hattie MacDaniel Crawford's smart maid.A small point about the film  MacDaniel had not gotten her Oscar yet for GONE WITH THE WIND but there are moments when the camera is concentrating on her and when she is involved in scenes where any other AfricanAmerican actress of the period say Louise Beavers playing a maid would not have gotten camera time  I wonder if this was because Hattie was photogenic and the movie crews were noticing this or because David Selznick may have noticed her and requested some additional footage for her. She handles the role with customary humor and spice. Crawford finds although she has had hints that Douglas' older sister Fay Bainter is cold and hostile. More about this later. Young's wife Margaret Sullivan is very friendly and sweet. But although Crawford warms up to Sullivan Young who had been initially cold to the marriage begins showing a different attitude he is falling in love with Crawford. Bainter takes an I told you so! attitude to this and Sullivan becomes increasingly miserable. Only Douglas seems oblivious  in particular because Crawford is making every effort to remain faithful.The climax concerns the dream house that Douglas and Crawford were planning to build a few miles from Bainter's home. Instead of being a solution to the twisted mess it becomes a magnet for the coming disaster. It is only with the disaster that the relations are sorted out.Now about Bainter This film was made within three years of the renewal and new teeth to the Hollywood Production Code. As such certain things could be said and certain things couldn't. In terms of the code the film fits properly. But with Bainter they managed or that fine actress did to push the envelope a little. In a confrontation scene with Douglas Bainter reveals something about her private feelings. She hates Crawford and tells Douglas to get rid of her eventually saying I'm your sister and I love you! Her character is a repressed spinster type she is the oldest of the siblings and she has never really been close to Sullivan although the latter grew up in the area. One gets the impression Bainter has certain incestuous feelings for Douglas and even Young and that the former chooses to overlook these and the latter resents them. This seems to be the first time this kind of situation arises in a film prior to Geraldine Fitzgerald's performance as George Sanders' possessive sister in THE STRANGE AFFAIR OF UNCLE HARRY but that at time was slightly more explicit.With Frank Albertson in a supporting part as a rustic with jazz trumpet ambitions who momentarily makes the situation for Crawford get a bit murkier.".

	schema:reviewBody "Joan Crawford disrupts a family in The Shining Hour a 1938 film also starring Melvyn Douglas Margaret Sullavan Robert Young and Fay Bainter.Crawford is Olivia Reilly a New York City dancer who works in a nightclub with a partner doing an act sort of modeled on Astaire and Rogers though it's clearly down several levels. Melvyn Douglas is Henry Linden a gentleman farmer who wants to take her away from all this to Wisconsin and sick of her present life she marries him. Arriving on the farm she finds herself hated by Henry's sister Hannah Bainter lusted after by Henry's brother David Young and loved and envied by David's wife Judy Sullavan. Before long David is making overt passes Henry has figured out David is in love with his wife and in spite of herself Judy begins to suspect the same thing.This film is a little overdone as it seems like the tension in the house never lets up. David always looks miserable Judy always looks nervous Olivia is always trying to be nice except when she's trading barbs with Hannah and Hannah is a bitch. How any of them stood one another for more than ten minutes is a miracle. We are never allowed to see any happiness. Also the entire end of the film is a mess  Judy takes a ridiculous step to make everything right but it all goes in the opposite direction. The most absurd part of the whole film without giving anything away is that one of the characters ends up wearing bandages  covering their nose and mouth with only the eyes showing. Now how is anyone supposed to breathe like that? How did the actor breathe in fact? Joan Crawford looks beautiful and is very good in her role as a city slicker who wants to love her husband and environment but is finding it difficult. Tall elegant Melvyn Douglas who thirty years later would emerge as one of the truly great actors in cinema does a wonderful job as the eventempered one of the family. For so many years he played the family friend the family lawyer the other man  how with all that magnificent talent did he ever stand it? Robert Young is fine as David though Margaret Sullavan is so nice and sweet and so much in love with him that he's somewhat unlikable for coming on to Olivia. As the vicious Hannah Fay Bainter is effective though I'd have thrown her out of the house.All in all it's just okay.".

Melvyn Douglas is Henry Linden a gentleman farmer who wants to take her away from all this to Wisconsin and sick of her present life she marries him. Arriving on the farm she finds herself hated by Henry's sister Hannah Bainter lusted after by Henry's brother David Young and loved and envied by David's wife Judy Sullavan. Before long David is making overt passes Henry has figured out David is in love with his wife and in spite of herself Judy begins to suspect the same thing.This film is a little overdone as it seems like the tension in the house never lets up. David always looks miserable Judy always looks nervous Olivia is always trying to be nice except when she's trading barbs with Hannah and Hannah is a bitch. How any of them stood one another for more than ten minutes is a miracle. We are never allowed to see any happiness. Also the entire end of the film is a mess  Judy takes a ridiculous step to make everything right but it all goes in the opposite direction. The most absurd part of the whole film without giving anything away is that one of the characters ends up wearing bandages  covering their nose and mouth with only the eyes showing. Now how is anyone supposed to breathe like that? How did the actor breathe in fact? Joan Crawford looks beautiful and is very good in her role as a city slicker who wants to love her husband and environment but is finding it difficult. Tall elegant Melvyn Douglas who thirty years later would emerge as one of the truly great actors in cinema does a wonderful job as the eventempered one of the family. For so many years he played the family friend the family lawyer the other man  how with all that magnificent talent did he ever stand it? Robert Young is fine as David though Margaret Sullavan is so nice and sweet and so much in love with him that he's somewhat unlikable for coming on to Olivia. As the vicious Hannah Fay Bainter is effective though I'd have thrown her out of the house.All in all it's just okay.";

Adapted from a wellmade Broadway play of 1934 the sexual tension between the two unloving couples could never be realized as it might have been had there not been censorship so instead of a little explosive adultery and fiery hankypanky as the plot seems to suggest we end up with a hot summer night instead with everyone complaining about the heat until the burning resolution but not the one you might think.

An actress of great skill and subtle intensity she makes her Judy a character that seems far more real and relatable than anybody else on screen.

Of course plans go awry and this intruder' into their pat little lives and old family ways unduly disrupts the farmer's whole family.Unfortunately The Shining Hour's structure is so episodic and choppy that none of the characters has time to be fully developed.  This is a shame as each of them appears quite interesting in the limited screen time allotted them.  A longer running time and more character exploration would have benefitted the film greatly.  As it is every time a new tidbit of information is revealed that may be of interest to the viewer some obvious plot point takes over and speeds things along toward the ludicrous ending. I was left shaking my head groaning and shouting NO! NO!' at the screen more than once.  Horrors.CASTPERFORMANCES Joan Crawford gives a good performance here and her beauty is almost overwhelming.  Melodrama which this film most definitely is was her forte and she excels as wrongsideofthetracks dancer Olivia Reilly looking to better her stature and improve her social standing through her association with new husband Harry Linden Melvyn Douglas and his wellestablished nonetoopoor family.  Crawford comes off very believably in this role and she's great in it.Melvyn Douglas does an excellent job as Crawford's husband.  I thought he was very adept at both the tender quieter scenes as well as the angrier ones.  As Harry Linden he is a very sympathetic character who tries to keep everyone happy and almost loses everything despite his efforts. Robert Young's character is an enigma and he plays the complex role of David Linden Harry's brother very well.  David is a moody individual and the viewer is never sure how he will act or react next. Young gives a thoughtful yet strong performance. Having had quite a few roles like this in his younger days it's unfortunate that he lapsed into mawkish television roles later in his career.I can't relate at all to the character of Judy Linden played by Margaret Sullavan.  I like her performance and think she does well with the words she is given to say.  She cries well too which I always admire in an actor or actress yet for me the role is too selfsacrificing and her unbelievable character is the downfall of the entire scenario.  Why why why???Fay Bainter is usually better than she is here.  I just didn't feel the menace that her character Hannah Linden was supposed to evoke except for the party and fire scenes  those were done very well.  Hannah's character seems to be the forerunner of Luz Benedict played by Mercedes McCambridge in Giant. There are several similarities between the two.  It's too bad that both performances are also somewhat lackluster.GOOD POINTS BAD POINTS If you can ignore the implausibility of the outcome and the fact that some of the action is simply mindnumbingly hard to take you might consider watching this film.  My advice is to give The Shining Hour a chance because aside from the goofy terribly abrupt ending it does have some elements to admire including some thoughtful dialog and especially the humanity of the characters which is surely the film's strongest point.  However this ruined potential makes it extra frustrating to watch so keep all heavy objects out of your reach as you tune in.".

Of course she gives David Taylor one of her signature slaps about 17 minutes in. Margaret Sullavan is Judy David's wife and she hits it off with Olivia right away. Even later in the film she has an odd strong friendship with Olivia. She is so sweet and friendly in this one much different than her role in Shop around the Corner. M. Sullavan has such an interesting story. Sometime check out her bio on IMDb... even her husbands were bigshots didn't end well died of accidental drug overdose at age fifty. Hattie McDaniel is the maid Belvedere and there are several jokes at her expense but she will have the last laugh in Gone with the Wind! Fay Bainter is the strange serious sister Hannah who likes things just the way they are and doesn't seem to accept Olivia. Hannah goes out of her way to be nasty to her every chance she gets. Clearly Hannah has emotional issues and Henry is the only member of the family that will stand up to her. As someone has pointed out the original play ended SO differently than the film but this was the LATE 1930s so the Hays code was in full force and everything had to be whitewashed and subdued from around 1934 to 1950. David seems to be getting too cozy with Olivia and Hannah and others are starting to notice. I'm guessing the scene where Olivia is up on a ladder and flirts with Benny was also originally much naughtier than we see in the film. It's a story of family secrets sacrifice proper appearances. Good strong script good acting. They pack a lot into 76 minutes. When its done it seems like it was much longer than that. I'm really surprised that currently this one only has 6 stars out of 10 on IMDb.Directed by Frank Borzage who had already won two Oscars a silent and a talkie. Borzage was the very first to win an Oscar for Best Director.".

	schema:headline " Fairly ludicrous and overstated and thus immensely enjoyable!";
	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps some audience members found this dramatic and sophisticated in 1938 though that is questionable but today this Crawford vehicle is entertaining for entirely different reasons its camp value its sets and costumes and its snippy dialogue. Crawford in an ironically autobiographical role plays a girl from a lowincome background who has reinvented herself as a cosmopolitan dancer complete with smashing wardrobe deluxe apartment and affected accent and manner. When Douglas heir and head of a major farm falls for her and needles her into marrying him she is transported to the country where she is faced with scrutinizing brotherinlaw Young his kind but demure wife Sullavan and downright hostile sisterinlaw Bainter who doesn't even let her get in the door before the remarks start flying! Crawford has devoted Douglas and even more devoted maid McDaniel on her side as well as easilyimpressed Sullavan but Bainter is in a power position and tends to ride roughshod over the others. When Young changes from judge to admirer where Crawford's concerned and she begins to reciprocate those feelings there's a lot of trouble in store for everyone. Crawford has many fine moments here along with many loving closeups. She's hardly an elegant enough dancer despite her history as a Charleston champ to warrant all the fuss she's given in the early part of the film but she gives a stalwart concerned performance. Her secondtolast outfit has the type of shoulder pads that she soon became infamous for perhaps to allow her male stunt double a little bit of visual leeway? Sullavan often shrouded in softer focus than Crawford is likable and natural. It's interesting to watch the Queen of controlled artifice square off against the stagetrained emotiveness of Sullavan and when it comes to commanding the screen it's pretty much a draw. She is generally effective up until her completely ludicrous final scene which can't help but elicit giggles thanks to the preposterous handling stylingwise. It's a wonder Claude Rains didn't enter the room and make a play for her! Douglas is appealing throughout though perhaps a bit more backbone might have been desired in his character especially with regards to Bainter and primarily with her during the denouement! Young tries hard and does well but simply does not have the looks or the magnetism to inspire the type of passionate feelings that Crawford and Sullavan are meant to have for him. Not only does he not resemble a sibling of Douglas or Bainter but also he just isn't a figure that would get the ladies this heated up especially when some of his pertinent closeups suggest a crossedeye. Bainter gets a rare chance to play a bitch on wheels and savors it. Her character has severe and mostly unjustified mood swings the side effect of a very unevenly written script rendering her character nearly unplayable but she gives her lines delicious nastiness and condescension. Her faceoffs with Crawford are a highlight. McDaniel is typically enjoyable as a dot of comic relief. A year later she'd be cuddling an Oscar for her role in Gone With the Wind. This film heavily echoes 1933's The Silver Cord and it's often easy to forget that Bainter is Douglas and Young's sister and not their mother. The storyline seems to be missing key moments that would explain radical changes in the characters' feelings but it remains compelling nonetheless. The parade of sometimes overly frilly Adrian gowns the detailed and nicely appointed sets the overripe dialogue and the verbal catfights between the characters make this a high camp masterpiece never more so than when Young enters Sullavan's room near the finale. One woozy drinking game could be played by downing a shot every time a character refers to how hot it is though they are always weighted down with heavy clothes!".

	onyx:emotionText "Perhaps some audience members found this dramatic and sophisticated in 1938 though that is questionable but today this Crawford vehicle is entertaining for entirely different reasons its camp value its sets and costumes and its snippy dialogue. Crawford in an ironically autobiographical role plays a girl from a lowincome background who has reinvented herself as a cosmopolitan dancer complete with smashing wardrobe deluxe apartment and affected accent and manner. When Douglas heir and head of a major farm falls for her and needles her into marrying him she is transported to the country where she is faced with scrutinizing brotherinlaw Young his kind but demure wife Sullavan and downright hostile sisterinlaw Bainter who doesn't even let her get in the door before the remarks start flying! Crawford has devoted Douglas and even more devoted maid McDaniel on her side as well as easilyimpressed Sullavan but Bainter is in a power position and tends to ride roughshod over the others. When Young changes from judge to admirer where Crawford's concerned and she begins to reciprocate those feelings there's a lot of trouble in store for everyone. Crawford has many fine moments here along with many loving closeups. She's hardly an elegant enough dancer despite her history as a Charleston champ to warrant all the fuss she's given in the early part of the film but she gives a stalwart concerned performance. Her secondtolast outfit has the type of shoulder pads that she soon became infamous for perhaps to allow her male stunt double a little bit of visual leeway? Sullavan often shrouded in softer focus than Crawford is likable and natural. It's interesting to watch the Queen of controlled artifice square off against the stagetrained emotiveness of Sullavan and when it comes to commanding the screen it's pretty much a draw. She is generally effective up until her completely ludicrous final scene which can't help but elicit giggles thanks to the preposterous handling stylingwise. It's a wonder Claude Rains didn't enter the room and make a play for her! Douglas is appealing throughout though perhaps a bit more backbone might have been desired in his character especially with regards to Bainter and primarily with her during the denouement! Young tries hard and does well but simply does not have the looks or the magnetism to inspire the type of passionate feelings that Crawford and Sullavan are meant to have for him. Not only does he not resemble a sibling of Douglas or Bainter but also he just isn't a figure that would get the ladies this heated up especially when some of his pertinent closeups suggest a crossedeye. Bainter gets a rare chance to play a bitch on wheels and savors it.

The cast is tops. Youthful Joan  the lovely Margaret Sullivan the excellent Robert Young the charming Melvyn Douglas and the superb character actress Fay Bainter. The script just does not properly develop why these characters especially Bainter's are so conflicted. And Joan seems too mannered in that way that made it look like she was just walking through the part. Not one of Joan's classics but watchable nonetheless.

In fact if it weren't for the generally good production values the film would merit a 1the writing was just THAT bad! The fundamental problem is that many of the characters performed almost like they had schizophrenia!! In other words they behaved so inconsistently and stupidly that being insane and unmedicated is one of the only explanations for the way they act. It is also possible that the writers wrote up a long list of plot devices and threw them into a hat and randomly pulled them out and put them in the scriptit's that confusing and inconsistent. Let's discuss some of the characters to illustrate why this movie irritated me so much.Robert Young initially hated his future sisterinlaw Joan Crawford. Their first meeting and most of their interactions through the first third of the movie are pretty volatile and this is all due to Young's actions and attitude. But then seemingly out of the blue he professes his love for her and ardently pursues her despite the fact that BOTH of them are married and inlaws!! This just didn't make sense and seemed more like a storyline from THE COLBYS or DALLAS than from a movie! There's also the young neighbor who loves the trumpet and seems like a nice guy. Joan buys him a new trumpet provided he agree to practice more quietlyan excellent way to handle the problem of having to listen to his playing. She treats him nicely but gives no indication she is sweet on this guy. So what does he do late in the film? Yep he attacks her and says that she wants him!! Get that man some medication please!Margaret Sullavan played a very sweet person and was at least as attractive as Joan Crawford. So of course her husband chases Joan. The whole time this is happening Margaret shows no indication that she knows her husband is a jerk. So towards the very end she runs into a burning house and tries to kill herself!! Huh?!?! Fay Bainter has the most interesting role in the film. She is the matriarch of the rich family that Joan marries into. From the second she meets Joan it is obvious that she detests her and does little to hide her scorn. She is totally judgmental cold and cruel throughout the filmand I liked this character a lotshe was mean and fun to hate! In fact she was so full of hate and evil that late in the film she burns Joan's and her husband's home to the ground and then admits doing it! So far so goodbut then it becomes totally INSANE! First while she admits to this evil act she suffers no consequencesno police or an admission to the Booby Hatch!!! If one of my family members burned down my home and admitted doing it I'd at least be a bit more miffed than this family!!! This is dumb but then comes the absolutely WORST momentthen only minutes later when Joan has had enough and leaves for what appears for good Fay's wish coming true Ms. Bainter chases after her and begs her to stay and says she's sorry!! Huh?! Crack addicts behave more consistently than this!! Then comes Melvin DouglasJoan's husband. While he says he loves her and chases after her like a puppy he also says and does nothing to stop his sister Bainter from mistreating his wifenothing!! What a fine caring man huh?! He only tells her off AFTER she burns down his home but even this is muted. No wonder Joan had doubts as to whether or not she loves him! Actually Joan Crawford comes off best in the film. While I have never been a huge fan of hers I must admit she did a competent job as a city playgirl who gives it all up in an attempt to radically change her soulless life. It must have galled Joan to have absolutely no support from the rest of the castall competent actors who were hamstrung by terrible roles.".

And where else do you get the added bonus of Hattie McDaniel and Fay Bainter in support of these leads? It certainly is a Shining Hour for all of them. What a pity then that this picture is not more well known because in this writer's opinion it certainly deserves to be.And when was the last time that a film made after the production code allowed someone to get away with a major crime? That is exactly what Bainter's character does when she is allowed to go unpunished for arson. Meanwhile Crawford's vixen will probably take up with one of the farm hands when she gets back from her honeymoon with Douglas. And Young's character will probably never stop lusting after Crawford even though he is married to Sullavan. Yes this is grand melodrama from a grand Hollywood studio performed with zest by a grand cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "When dancer Joan Crawford enters high society by marrying wealthy Melvyn Douglas his sister Fay Bainter sends their brother Robert Young to try and pay her off. But Crawford stands tall marries the brother sans the rest of his family and enters the social world run by the Mrs. Danvers like Bainter. Only Young's pleasant wife Margaret Sullavan likes her and they become quick friends which is a rare thing for Crawford who admittedly despises her own sex. Bainter is passively aggressively chilly with Crawford drops all sorts of innuendos of her disapproval and finally all explodes when Crawford obviously attracted to the indifferent Young convinces Douglas to move away seemingly for an extended honeymoon. Before you can break into a chorus of Burning Down the House Bainter turns into Norman Bates' mother and Crawford is ready to pack it in.Packed with major star power four Academy Award Winners The Shining Hour is a fastmoving camp classic where Crawford preCrystal Allen The Women gets to be pretty bitchy but not nasty. It is Bainter who wins that title giving a performance far from her kindly mother role which won her an Oscar for the same year's Jezebel. Working with Crawford AND Bette Davis the same year.... The following year's Best Supporting Actress winner Hattie McDaniel is amusing as Belvedere Crawford's faithful maid. The reason for Young's initial distaste for Crawford is never really explained other than being manipulated by his sister although there is all sorts of interesting characterization development for Margaret Sullavan's sisterinlaw who is seemingly overly noble but never sickeningly sweet.Worth repeated viewing for its cast melodramatic performances and a few funny lines The Shining Hour isn't a very sunny 79 minutes but moderately enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Shining Hour was adapted from a Broadway play that ran for a few months in 1934. Not one of the better works I've seen but at that time the studios were still buying anything they could to have words for talking pictures.Joan Crawford plays a dancer and one good thing about The Shining Hour is that we get to see her dancing which is how she started in film. She's just married prosperous Melvyn Douglas of the Linden family of Wisconsin. The Lindens are farm folk in fact Douglas is a lobbyist for said interest. Taking the new bride home to Wisconsin Crawford arouses the interest in brother Robert Young develops a friendship with Young's wife Margaret Sullavan and gets on the wrong side of the eldest spinster sister Fay Bainter.Bainter's character rang true for whatever reasons she just dislikes Crawford and throws her the needle on all occasions. She's one of those miserable characters who minds everyone's business but their own.Sullavan's character is a lot like Melanie Hamilton in Gone With The Wind. Olivia DeHavilland made Melanie work in her film but try as she may Sullavan's character came off as an unrealistic goody two shoes. In fact The Shining Hour in its dynamics comes off as the quadrilateral romance that Gone With The Wind does but far far less effectively.Raymond Massey played Robert Young's part on Broadway. I really couldn't see that.Fans of the four stars should like this but it's Fay Bainter who comes off best.".

	schema:headline " Boring Melodrama with Horrible Ending";
	schema:reviewBody "The Shining Hour 1938  out of 4 Rather bizarre melodrama from MGM and director Frank Borzage about a showgirl Joan Crawford who marries a man Melvyn Douglas but it's objected by his rather sinister sister Fay Bainter. The brother Robert Young and his wife Margaret Sullavan warm up to the new woman even when it appears that Young is falling in love with her. THE SHINING HOUR probably would have been a great movie had two things happened. One would be if the film was made during the precode era so that some of the weird love angles could have been better developed. The second way is if this was made in the 1970's and could have gotten a Rrating and shown the rather weird obsession that the sister has with her brother. This relationship is quite creepy at times and I'm sure an exploitation picture could have had a party with it. As is the film is just way too silly and boring to really work. The entire time I was watching the film I couldn't help but think that these were some of the most annoying characters I've seen in a movie from this period. None of their actions really make any sense and especially the crazy sister who wants Crawford out of the house. I'm not going to ruin what the sister eventually does but you'll be wanting to walk away from your televisions. I'm also not going to ruin the ending but it has to be one of the dumbest ones in the history of cinema. No I'm not being overdramatic. It really is a horrible ending. It's really too bad the film didn't work better and especially when you consider the talent in front of and behind the camera. Borzage keeps the film moving at a decent pace but there's just nothing to the story. Both Crawford and Douglas are good in their roles and there's no doubt that Sullavan and Young add nice support. Both Bainter and Hattie McDaniel are also good. Still this film is just going to appeal to those who must see everything these stars did in their careers.".
