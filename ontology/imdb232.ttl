Helen Hayes is Madelon Claudet a single mother in Paris around 1900 fighting to get ahead in life. Viewers will recognize Alan Hale as Monsieur Hubert playing  a gruff fat man that storms out of the room  must have been a real reach for him... he did that in every movie he was in from 1911  1950. Also look for Lewis Stone as Carlo Boretti he was the kindly Doctor in Grand Hotel. Robert Young about 25 at the time plays Madelon's son Lawrence Claudet in this film only his second credited role. From the castcrew list on IMDb it also appears a lot of material was deleted. Other reviewers have said how this feels like a Barbara Stanwyck film and I agree completely. Single woman up against the world hitting bad luck around every corner. But except for the last 2 minutes it's not as silly soapy as some have said it tells a pretty good solid story which probably happened pretty often back then and still does. The version I saw on TCM actually had good quality sound and picture. The play Lullaby on which this is based was written by the same guy that wrote Kismet in 1914  Edward Knoblock.".

She's a peasant girl from Normandy who is wooed by an American Neil Hamilton who loves her and leaves her for his fianc back in the USA. But not after getting her pregnant with a kid who grows up to be Robert Young. This is a four handkerchief picture ladies and even the men might be well advised to take some handkerchiefs along themselves. After being abandoned by Hamilton she takes up with a Count played by Lewis Stone who's willing to accept her with child. Problem is he's a nobleman who keeps up his style of living by being a jewel thief. When he's finally arrested the law doesn't want to believe she knew nothing about his activities.After prison it's prostitution and vagrancy for her. But every sou she earns on the streets of Paris goes to pay for her kid's medical school. It sounds terribly much and is terribly dated. But Helen Hayes makes this whole soggy tale believable some how. So much so that she got an Academy Award for Best Actress. This was also the film that got Robert Young his first real notice.The Sin of Madelon Claudet was one of the first of many kindly doctor roles that Jean Hersholt took a patent on. Later on he played the lead in the film series Dr. Christian and you can see from this why Hersholt was cast in that role.

	schema:reviewBody "This MADAME Xtype melodrama constitutes a record in Oscar history in that it marks the longest period between wins for any person Best Actress recipient Helen Hayes would be bestowed her second statuette a Best Supporting Actress one for AIRPORT 38 years later! Incidentally this being an MGM picture it becomes evident from checking the honoured actors during the first dozen ceremonies till the end of the decade that the studio made good its famous logo more stars than there are in heaven by copping as many as 12 Academy Awards! That said the title under review itself is hardly highlyregarded  though it is reasonably stylish and wellserved by a surprisingly strong cast in alphabetical order Alan Hale Neil Hamilton Jean Hersholt Karen Morley Lewis Stone Charles Winninger Robert Young etc. for a 75minute film. Hayes herself rises above the decidedly clichd material with a performance that does not feel dated even today. The episodic narrative involves a woman impregnated and left by her artist boyfriend Hamilton then marries wealthy but elderly Stone  who is subsequently revealed to be a crook! The woman is herself incriminated and sent to prison when her term expires she is unable to find work and actually gives her kid who grows up to be esteemed doctor Young the impression that his mother died! Before long she goes downhill  becoming a streetwalker easily the most laughable section of the film! and convincingly madeup aging prematurely. Eventually she breaks into her son's house rather than report her he takes pity on the woman and starts taking care of her without ever discovering her true identity!. Incidentally the plot assumes a flashback structure  in which Young's wife Morley is about to leave him because of his overdedication to dutybut is persuaded to stay by social worker Hersholt who recounts Hayes' sacrifice for her motherly love of the same man.For the record director Selwyn only directed eight films I also own his SKYSCRAPER SOULS 1932 and TURN BACK THE CLOCK 1933 and in fact was more renowned as a playwright besides the similarlygifted Charles MacArthur  Hayes' justascelebrated husband  served as dialogue continuity here!".

Incidentally this being an MGM picture it becomes evident from checking the honoured actors during the first dozen ceremonies till the end of the decade that the studio made good its famous logo more stars than there are in heaven by copping as many as 12 Academy Awards! That said the title under review itself is hardly highlyregarded  though it is reasonably stylish and wellserved by a surprisingly strong cast in alphabetical order Alan Hale Neil Hamilton Jean Hersholt Karen Morley Lewis Stone Charles Winninger Robert Young etc. for a 75minute film. Hayes herself rises above the decidedly clichd material with a performance that does not feel dated even today. The episodic narrative involves a woman impregnated and left by her artist boyfriend Hamilton then marries wealthy but elderly Stone  who is subsequently revealed to be a crook! The woman is herself incriminated and sent to prison when her term expires she is unable to find work and actually gives her kid who grows up to be esteemed doctor Young the impression that his mother died! Before long she goes downhill  becoming a streetwalker easily the most laughable section of the film! and convincingly madeup aging prematurely. Eventually she breaks into her son's house rather than report her he takes pity on the woman and starts taking care of her without ever discovering her true identity!. Incidentally the plot assumes a flashback structure  in which Young's wife Morley is about to leave him because of his overdedication to dutybut is persuaded to stay by social worker Hersholt who recounts Hayes' sacrifice for her motherly love of the same man.For the record director Selwyn only directed eight films I also own his SKYSCRAPER SOULS 1932 and TURN BACK THE CLOCK 1933 and in fact was more renowned as a playwright besides the similarlygifted Charles MacArthur  Hayes' justascelebrated husband  served as dialogue continuity here!";

The scene where she responds with a humorous puffy facial expression to a question about what someone is like is priceless. Her suggestions of lasciviousness using only her eyes are also great while the movie is preCode and has a suggestive title it's quite tame. We're all rooting for because she's been driven to such depths quite unfairly and because she's made the incredible sacrifice of separating herself from her son so that he can pursue being a doctor unencumbered by her shame which back then would have stopped him.

She gives birth to a son but soon is railroaded into prison where she comes out of and agrees to tell the child that his mother is dead. She then turns to prostitution so that she can give the son money to go through medical school. If you don't like sappy stories then it's probably best to stay away from this thing as there's so much sugar running around that many will gag on everything that happens from the opening scene to the closing one. I must admit that there were times where I felt the filmmakers were beating the viewer over the head with the sentimental moments but the nice performances make this film worth viewing. Hayes is exceptionally good here as her character goes from one abuse to another and she perfectly nails each emotion no matter how raw it is. I also found her to be excellent under all the make up of the older woman as she pulled this off as well. Lewis Stone has a brief role but he's his typical excellent self and Robert Young plays the adult kid. The ending is one you'll see coming from a mile away but I thought it packed a good little punch. The editing is something else that really worked well and this can easily be seen during the sequence where we cut back and forth to the mother working and the son getting the benefits of it. The biggest problem is that the film plays out like several 15minute short films put together as the story pretty much just builds itself up for a payoff and then we go to the next short sequence that will then build up for a quick payoff.".

Her next move is to marry a farmer a friend of her father's but he will not allow the baby to come along. So that's that. Hearing from her that she's to be married an admirer Count Boretti has sent her flowers after she turns down his proposal to be his mistress. Now she takes him up on it.She doesn't tell the Count about her baby so he lives with a husband and wife not too far away. The Count comes home one night announces he's rich and proposes marriage. When Madelon tells him about the baby he says he already knew and it's fine. A few hours later he's exposed as a crook. He and Madelon are both arrested the police believing she had knowledge of where he got his money.Madelon goes to prison for ten years. By now her child is in a charity school  more like an orphanage where he's welltreated and she's told she can't have him until she can prove she can support him. When she meets him she tells him his mother is dead and she's a friend.With no work to be had Madelon turns to walking the streets to give a doctor friend money for her child.There are so many of these stories about women turning to prostitution  it's so sad that women were extremely limited in those days and not only that banished if she had an illegitimate child.I don't believe I have ever seen Robert Young this young  his voice is unmistakable and he gives a warm performance as Madelon's son. He was not a superstar in films but on television  well he more than made up for it with two iconic roles. Helen Hayes is excellent  coming from the stage one might expect her to be too theatrical but she was not at all. A wonderful actress her career went from 1909 to 1985. Good movie  as far as pace this is one of the better really early talkies I've seen. Good direction by Edgar Selwyn who wrote the play on which this is based.".

He and Madelon are both arrested the police believing she had knowledge of where he got his money.Madelon goes to prison for ten years. By now her child is in a charity school  more like an orphanage where he's welltreated and she's told she can't have him until she can prove she can support him. When she meets him she tells him his mother is dead and she's a friend.With no work to be had Madelon turns to walking the streets to give a doctor friend money for her child.There are so many of these stories about women turning to prostitution  it's so sad that women were extremely limited in those days and not only that banished if she had an illegitimate child.I don't believe I have ever seen Robert Young this young  his voice is unmistakable and he gives a warm performance as Madelon's son. He was not a superstar in films but on television  well he more than made up for it with two iconic roles. Helen Hayes is excellent  coming from the stage one might expect her to be too theatrical but she was not at all. A wonderful actress her career went from 1909 to 1985. Good movie  as far as pace this is one of the better really early talkies I've seen. Good direction by Edgar Selwyn who wrote the play on which this is based.";

What immerses one more in the experience than pitching woo to one of the local French farm girls Helen Hayes as Madelon Claudet luring her away from her family and farm with promises of matrimony and excitement and then living with that girl in Paris while the art critics tell you what you don't want to hear  that you have no talent.Alan gets a cable from home  his dad has had a stroke. He promises to return shortly  maybe he even believes that promise. But once back in America Alan's spine of Jello wins out and he marries the girl his wealthy family wants him to marry. You only see one scene at his bachelor party with him discussing with a groomsman that his romance with Madelon was real. Yeah buddy  real pleasant and real over  for him. Meanwhile Madelon has discovered she is pregnant and waits for an Alan that never returns and probably never even writes he is that big of a coward. He probably just figures his silence is deafening. So there she is pregnant abandoned and shunned by her family back in Normandy.Now the actual film runs through this quite quickly. In fact the film is very quickly paced and if you don't pay attention you'll get lost. A very genuine precode moment in a film that insinuates a lot but really shows nothing  Madelon has just given birth. Knowing she is an abandoned single mother she wishes aloud that she would die and that the baby would die. But when she has the baby placed next to her that scorn turns to love. He is no longer an extension of Alan but her child. Helen Hayes makes this transformation with just facial expressions  no dialogue.The actual story that follows is everything that Madelon does and suffers for the sake of her son plus a few injustices thrown in for good measure that have her being a victim of circumstance that serve to separate her from her son for years. But she does what she has to do to get the boy a first rate education and for a woman like Madelon that means turning to the world's oldest profession and I don't mean farming.The end of her story has her used up and old before her years  probably being in her mid 40's but looking 20 years older  so desperate she is turning herself in to be a ward of the state so that she can at least get medical care and food. Meanwhile her son Robert Young as Dr. Lawrence Claudet has become a great young physician of Paris whose star is rising. He believes his mother is long dead and that his education and living expenses while a student were courtesy of her estate. Now this story is being told in flashback by an old friend of Madelon's Dr. Dulac. He has been a substitute dad to Lawrence all of these years and knows what Madelon has been doing to care for the boy. The point of the story was to convince Lawrence's wife who was getting ready to leave him in the middle of the night that her sacrifices as a physician's wife were nothing compared to what others Madelon had suffered. How will all of this work out? Watch and find out.The story is nothing that would win an award for best screenplay. Movies about suffering sacrificing moms are as old as filmmaking itself. The payoff is in how Helen Hayes convincingly portrays her character without the help of very good dialogue and with a film that moves quite quickly through everything. Helen Hayes' filmography is not very lengthy mainly because her forte was the stage. This makes her good performances as a film star even more impressive.My one problem with the entire film  the premise of the opening. As the film opens it is the middle of the night and Alice Claudet is creeping into her husband's study to leave him a letter saying she is leaving plus she leaves the key to the house next to the letter. Dr. Dulac sleeping in a chair in the study is awakened by her movement and thus starts the conversation between them and the story of Madelon. Why did Alice feel it necessary to leave behind the key to her own house? This is not the Holiday Inn it's her home too! And why is she OK with somebody unrelated to her and her husband sleeping in a chair in their house? Weird stuff from MGM but worth it for Helen Hayes alone.".

The name Helen Hayes may not mean much to people 40 or younger but to theatergoers of the 1930s to 1970s she was The First Lady of the Theater and to moviegoers they saw her lending her grace and scenestealing presence to the movies she was in.Usually I don't read other reviews so that it won't affect what I write but I did read one or two. The Sin of Madelon Claudet is about a young girl raised on a French farm who runs away to be married to an artist Neil Hamilton. The first 20 minutes seems relatively slowpaced and somewhat boring. But through developments and plot devices she goes through every scenario in the book mainly in the last 30 minutes of the movie up then down then back up and back down again and ultimately....After giving birth to a boy which Neil doesn't know about since he left her she vows he'll never know hunger that he'll never suffer and that he'll be a great man. That is the catalyst for all that follows.I personally like films that throw in everything but the kitchen sink just for the sake of entertainment. But this is obviously not very subtle. I read here too Miss Hayes didn't like her performance at all. That was before retakes were done of the last 10 minutes or so. I wonder what she would have thought afterwards. Granted it doesn't give Miss Hayes much to do in the beginning but in the whirlpool of change she is overcome with every emotional toll and breakdown her character is going through. Granted also is the fact this movie feels old in its portrayal of certain living conditions and doesn't date very well. Also it doesn't seem to be totally convincing that she could be a lady of ill repute.But overall if you like sentimental movies that don't hold back and like the sacrificial mother angle then this movie is for you. It's not without its good points and that's mainly good actors who know what they're doing especially Helen Hayes who won her first Oscar here. Almost 40 years later she would win a supporting Oscar for Airport which some say was given to her out of respect for her long career. But watch Airport and judge for yourself. And if you come across this movie watch it and judge for yourself. What is Madelon's sin? Is it one she can learn from? Is it one we all make? Is it something we can change? Or is it just second nature?".

	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere in the dark recesses of overfluffed and processed Stephen King movie adaptations there lies this jewel of a film The Dark Half. After having it watched it about three times I'm still quite at a loss as to why this movie has been more or less forgotten or simply passed over by the horror movie community. Not only is it a fairly neat adaptation of a great King novel but it's also directed and written by a true horror movie icon the one and only George Romero. Isn't this the kind of teamup that fans would under normal circumstances go absolutely bananas over? I know that I did.Anyway ... the movie is about a writer Thad Beaumont Timothy Hutton whose past  quite literally  comes back to haunt him. As a young man he wrote pulpy crime novels that I can only imagine were directly inspired by Richard Stark's hardboiled master thief Parker that sold well ... though his literary yearnings tended to veer toward a much less marketable direction. We learn that when he was writing those pulps his personality suffered. He drank yelled at his wife probably slept around too. Having successfully exorcised that particular demon when we meet him Beaumont has a couple kids and an office at some New England university teaching  you guessed it  creative writing. But when the bodies of folks close to him i.e. his agent biographer begin cropping up the smalltown police fun finger is pointed at Beaumont. But ... there's a much more sinister twist in this jetblack yarn. We learn that Beaumont indeed has a dark half.The direction is perfect the writing is perfect the acting is perfect. What more do you want in a film? I'm not exactly certain what King's response was to this film ... I've heard rumors that if he's not directly involved in the production process he generally scoffs at the final film product. For example ... he's all but urinated on all the goodness that was Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining which not only marked a substantial turning point in horror cinema but it's also one of my personal favorites. Then again ... from what I understand to be true of King and Romero both ... they're friends. Hell they made Creepshow together ... which is another favorite of mine though I'm more than just a little bit guilty about it. The Dark Half also does one hell of a job at creating a genuinely creepy atmosphere. And who could listen to Are You Lonesome Tonight again the same way ... after hearing its soft melodies during a particularly uncomfortable dream sequence?All of this compounded with the fact that Timothy Hutton is a damned fine actor albeit sinfully unknown by most these days ... makes The Dark Half an explosively well made horrorthriller. The proverbial mind meld of King and Romero made Creepshow an instant cult classic. So I ask again ... why was The Dark Half a blinkoryou'llmissit flop? Maybe these horror titans just can't share the same marquee anymore.I dunno.".

Not only is it a fairly neat adaptation of a great King novel but it's also directed and written by a true horror movie icon the one and only George Romero. Isn't this the kind of teamup that fans would under normal circumstances go absolutely bananas over? I know that I did.Anyway ... the movie is about a writer Thad Beaumont Timothy Hutton whose past  quite literally  comes back to haunt him. As a young man he wrote pulpy crime novels that I can only imagine were directly inspired by Richard Stark's hardboiled master thief Parker that sold well ... though his literary yearnings tended to veer toward a much less marketable direction. We learn that when he was writing those pulps his personality suffered. He drank yelled at his wife probably slept around too. Having successfully exorcised that particular demon when we meet him Beaumont has a couple kids and an office at some New England university teaching  you guessed it  creative writing. But when the bodies of folks close to him i.e. his agent biographer begin cropping up the smalltown police fun finger is pointed at Beaumont. But ... there's a much more sinister twist in this jetblack yarn. We learn that Beaumont indeed has a dark half.The direction is perfect the writing is perfect the acting is perfect. What more do you want in a film? I'm not exactly certain what King's response was to this film ... I've heard rumors that if he's not directly involved in the production process he generally scoffs at the final film product. For example ... he's all but urinated on all the goodness that was Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining which not only marked a substantial turning point in horror cinema but it's also one of my personal favorites. Then again ... from what I understand to be true of King and Romero both ... they're friends. Hell they made Creepshow together ... which is another favorite of mine though I'm more than just a little bit guilty about it. The Dark Half also does one hell of a job at creating a genuinely creepy atmosphere. And who could listen to Are You Lonesome Tonight again the same way ... after hearing its soft melodies during a particularly uncomfortable dream sequence?All of this compounded with the fact that Timothy Hutton is a damned fine actor albeit sinfully unknown by most these days ... makes The Dark Half an explosively well made horrorthriller. The proverbial mind meld of King and Romero made Creepshow an instant cult classic. So I ask again ... why was The Dark Half a blinkoryou'llmissit flop? Maybe these horror titans just can't share the same marquee anymore.I dunno.";

George Romero a man who has done a wonderful job with horror movies is the man in charge of taking this from a novel to a movie and he delivers.The plot revolves around author Thad Beaumont. Beaumont had written several best selling novels under the pseudonym George Stark. However a law student makes the connection and threatens to reveal it to everyone. Before this can happen Beaumont goes public and tells everyone he is Stark essentially killing off his pseudonym. Stark isn't content with being dispatched and he comes to life determined to stick around. Stark then goes around killing those responsible for his demise. Beaumont must fight Stark because only one of them can survive.Timothy Hutton does a spectacular job as both Beaumont and Stark. He really makes you believe the two are separate people but are tied together. The plot is suspenseful and full of unexpected twists. There are also supernatural elements such as the sparrows or bringers of the living dead.So to sum it up The Dark Half is one of the better adoptions to Stephen King's works. It follows the story accurately and succeeds in scaring the audience which is the aim for horror movies.".

But when he's Stark he really comes to life. He's both cool and creepy.  The sparrows are also a crucial part of the overall eeriness of the movie.  Although he will always be known for the unforgettable Dead trilogy this may be Romero's finest most highbrow picture to date.  The production values are the cleanest I've seen in any Romero flick the acting is topnotch and story is solid.  Getting a scare at the theater is fairly easily achieved.

Stephen King movie adaptions can be pretty damn good or really really awful depending on who's behind the camera. Well no worries here King and Romero have had a great working relationship in the past and I expect good things in the future. But give credit where credit is due it's Timothy Hutton's outstanding performance that really makes this film special for me. He's good enough as ordinary Thad Beaumont with just a hint of evil underneath his nice husband and father persona holding back the nasty as best he can. Then Hutton is George Stark and he doesn't even look like the same person. That's why Hutton is so damn good. With just a few minor changes slickedback hair and some facial stubble he's a completely different person. You have to see it to believe it he's that good. And he delivers the films darkly humorous lines perfectly What's going on out here? Murder. Want some?. I know the murderous joker has been done to death but Hutton's good enough that we can forgive it. I love love love horror movies and this is one of the reasons why. 810 stars. G'night!".

Married to Amy Madigan and a father of twins.When someone threatens to expose Thad for the pulp writer he is Beaumont decides to let the world know he is George Stark.

The concept isn't exactly new but it's creatively presented with a good balance between visual shocks and atmospheric tension. Timothy Hutton plays one of the most prestigious roles in his career as the tormented author Thad Beaumont who's forced to kill off his successful alterego when he's blackmailed with exposure. Right after the figurative burial of George Stark people close to Thad die violent deaths seemly caused by the fictional doppelganger that isn't supposed to exist Especially the first hour of The Dark Half is excellent frightmaterial with an obscure sequence about Thad's childhood and a delightful supernatural element involving sparrows.millions and millions of sparrows!! The second half is a lot less appealing and I wish Romero cut a few tedious sequences. The story begins to show a few holes and Romero attempts to camouflage them by adding more action and gory footage. The climax in particular is quite gruesome and not really satisfying in case you were hoping for reason or logic. All this probably is the reason why this film isn't mentioned more often. It features big names and clever ideas yet it's an overall shortcoming project. Too bad for George A. Romero who'll still always be one of the most important writersdirectors of the horror genre.".

When Thad reacts by killing off his pseudonym and posing beside a gravestone with Stark's name on it his alter ego manifests himself in the real world. Having crawled out of his grave and generated a body from the buried remains of an unborn twin once removed from Thad's brain Stark goes on a rampage slashing up all those involved in his murder and leaving Thad's fingerprints all over the shop. Sounds good no? King's novel discusses fascinating personal material and questions the responsibilities of the popular artist but it's also a bloated pretendhorror freak that fails to make any plot sense and goes on about 250 pages too long. Romero does his best to streamline the flabby storyline and gets some extraordinarily subtle performances from a great cast but King's malformed original keeps hobbling the film.This is too wellmade and acted to be a total failure and even the formulaic slasher scenes are handled with creepy aplombthe first 40 mins or so are genuinely creepy. Hutton in two complicated roles digs deeper into the characters than duty calls for and manages to make some of the quieter moments far more upsetting than the big shocks. You also get the excellent Madigan as Thad's devoted but apprehensive wife Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer's Rooker as a bewildered Sheriff and a genuinely haunting use of Elvis' Are You Lonesome Tonight? Certainly not one of the better King adaptations although i didn't think much of the book and it does do the book justice. If you are a fan of the book you might like this.".

As a thriller in it's own right however it's not all that bad. The story starts with a horrifying sequence that sees doctors open up a young boy's head only to find an eye sticking out from between parts of the brain. A good start. We later find out that this was a twin that hasn't been fully absorbed into the boy's body. The boy grows up to be a writer or rather two writers a serious one and an alter ego that writes trash novels. After someone comes knocking and threatens to expose him if he doesn't pay up our hero decides to kill off his alter ego and just stick to the serious but less profitable novels that he likes to write. This would all be well and good if it weren't for the fact that many of the people involved in this 'murder' weren't turning up dead with all the clues leading to the writer himself.George Romero may have made the 'Dead' trilogy and the excellent Martin but the rest of his director credits are lacking to say the least. This film is actually one of his better nonzombies nonMartin films maybe even the best one aside from those four although I admit to not having seen all of his films. George Romero wrote the screenplay and I think it's fair to say that he's not the most gifted writer in filmmaking. His screenplay is uneven and although it features many good  and exciting moments it also features many tedious ones and if he'd have streamlined it the film would have been better on the whole. If you're expecting loads of gore you'll be disappointed up until the end as even though the film features quite a few gory sequences there aren't any that are hideously gory...which is a shame. Still this is an inventive and largely interesting production that you can forgive for it's flaws thanks to a good base plot idea and the fact that it's a decent waste of time. Don't seek this one out but if you find yourself with nothing better to do...this isn't one of Stephen King's worst adaptations.".

It may be as simple as Thad being tired of the violent imagery.The second is that I don't understand why the sheriff doesn't arrest Thad on that first night. It seems like he has enough evidence. It would be more compelling if he had less evidence. It would be more tense if the killer's face isn't revealed so early. They should stretch out the questions until the third act.

One of the better elements in here is the rater ingenious way it builds up the alterego's identity and through this adds a rather haunting touch by keeping the mystery of it being alive rather well. The first half plays the murder mystery of it pretty well as they set up whetherornot he's crazy or really did those murders before and that leaves a pretty big impression here. His actions from the stalking to the way he's committed to the idea of how he came to exist in reality all makes for quite an enthralling mystery. Once it's all revealed and the body count begins to grow this does kick into a higher gear as the race to stop the rampage as well as trying to clear his name amongst the slew of brilliantlyorchestrated scenes that really hold this one quite nicely into the finale. This is quite fun as there's a lot to like about the finale and how it goes about finding a resolution to their battle as it deals quite nicely with the gore brought in along with the action for the scene which really helps this quite well by providing an ecstatically fun ending. That does help to even out the few flaws here from the fact that the killer here is a complete joke who's never in the slightest bit scary since he appears as a lame greasertype with a straightrazor for a killing tool which is quite lame all around so it's really hard to get any fear from him. This really has a toll on the beginning as it wanders around in so many extraneous scenes of him ending the ruse that it loses all meaning and drags this out probably about ten minutes too long. It's got a few too many story lines than it needs to have and it at times can be a little confusing. It also seems just a little bit repetitive in the middle which is no doubt due to the too long length. The same three general sequences of events play out several times over and it gets a little tiresome.

It's a bizarre story some great imagery and good acting.Thad Beaumont had twin brother that was never born in fact the brother literally lived within his brain. As a child the twin was developing inside his brain and Thad had to have brain surgery  the doctor calling it a brain tumor. Thad became a husband father and a writer. As a writer he created a pseudonym of George Stark to write under. Stark gave rise to a best selling pulp crime spree of novels but Thad decided to kill off Stark and write under his own name  a different set of novels. The problem is Stark becomes real and murders as written in the George Stark novels. The police think that Thad is doing the killings but only one policeman helps to keep Thad out of jail... yet he wonders if Thad is doing the killings and not George Stark come to life.Enjoyable watch really gets interesting.810".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dark Half is a film I wouldn't go out of my way to show to my friends for the first time like other films by George A. Romero Livingdead pictures and some of the obscurities or a few choice Stephen King adaptations The Shining and Shawshank Redemption being tops. But if it shows up on TV I tend to take a gander for a few and end up watching it till the unusual nervechilling ending. There's some part of King's writing that at times goes too much for the cheap scares or rather doesn't do enough to earn them. This time however Romero does catch enough of the smoke in the fire of King's book here I'd love to sit down and actually read the whole book myself to see how much was incorporated from King's often brilliant if perpetually odd writing into the final project. It's also territory for Romero that isn't very new though isn't one of his worst pictures either.Timothy Hutton usually in lesser quality pictures stars here as a writer who happens to have a certain 'alias' in his writing. Unfortunately whenever he hears a certain calling card being the sparrows it sets him off into territory he's afraid to go into especially with a wife and family. The divide between Thad Beaumont the common gardenvariety writer of Hutton's character and George Stark the madman writer of pulp fiction also played by Hutton makes for the more intriguing parts to the film. Thankfully unlike Secret Window the sort of duality of man or of the writer in this case isn't saved up for some overthetop climax. Here it's meant more as a psychological study and it's here that Romero scores his best points in his adapting the material. Like his film Martin he knows how to up the ante on the terror involved inside of the mind. In fact it's scenes showing BeaumontStark writing ala the birds that end up becoming more chilling than those with the usual horror violence in them.Thanks to Hutton a solid supporting cast and an ending that does keep one guessing more than could be expected of the material Romero has a pretty decent work here and a King adaptation that shouldn't be as much of an embarrassment as some of the others. Individual scenes end up even being minimasterpieces even amidst a script that loses its energy and goes into the mundane and usual. Besides any film with a line like this You always were the clumsy one old hoss deserves a little recognition however minor. Underappreciated and very watchable though nothing wildly spectacular. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This was an ItalianSoviet coproduction which should have made for an interesting production process. It also appears as if both countries must have thrown huge portions of their budgets in as the film looks incredibly expensive. Which is part of the issue with it. The plot concept a bunch of Italians here that there is some buried treasure in Russia they go there to look for it and are followed by an undercover cop  that's it is extremely simple and basically serves as a frame on which to hang some huge outlandish and probably extremely expensive setpieces such as an airliner driving along the highway cars jumping over each other filling stations blowing up lions roaming the streets of Leningrad and more. These are all fun and diverting to watch but as one movie they don't completely hang together. And they push out of they way much of what would have been there in terms of a plot or welldefined characters. I've seen two other Eldar Ryazanov films and in these regards this is nothing like them  I suspect maybe the huge amounts of time and money that must have been poured into this movie limited him. In a sense it's of a kind with other bigscale chaseheist movies of the 60s and 70s and their renaissance with films like Rat Race but it's not the best of all of them and remains fun basically on the one level. Antonia Santilli is a delight to watch though not least because she seems completely amused by everything that happens the whole time. And Andrey Mironov is extremely talented even if the fast pace doesn't give him as many opportunities as it could to display that. In all a fun movie that's very impressive for its bigscale stunt scenes and is never boring but not much beyond that.".

If you saw 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' then this is exactly what you would expect a movie about Aldos Snow to be like. This movie has a heart that I did not expect to see it's buried under lewd vulgar and brilliant wit but it's in there.Russell Brand just opens his mouth and his words are comedic gold. Jonah Hill takes a step out of his comfort zone a bit and plays a no confidence good guy. Usually he's the overconfident prick for all you naysayers. Diddy delivers a surprisingly strong performance that I'm sure shocked anyone who sees him. He's actually hilarious! His repartee with everyone he comes into contact with is spoton. The entire cast has hilarious oneliners and the two main characters really make this movie a joy to watch.The plot is actually a creative one something we don't see a lot of nowadays. Albeit the humor treads into familiar grossout jokes there are clever jokes too. But it's all you have to expect when following Rock and Roll personified. Another point I was surprised by was that a lot... a lot of the scenes from the trailers were not in the movie. I thought that was a good and bad thing. Good because it didn't show us stuff we've already seen and gave us the chance to see new stuff. But bad because a few of the scenes were real funny.For the critics who are hating this movie Do you like comedy? Do you like Apatow's stuff? Do you like Russell Brand or Jonah Hill? If the answer is no to any 2 of these... why are you reviewing this movie? Your opinion is pointless for the people that actually DO like these movies.".

	schema:headline " I sure did laugh but this spinoff eventually wears a little thin and sometimes gets kind of disturbing";
	schema:reviewBody "The now very famous but widely despised Russell Brand made his breakthrough in 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall in which he played Aldous Snow the lead singer of the fictional rock band Infant Sorrow. In this 2010 spinoff sequel the comedian got to reprise his role from the previous film but this time it was one of the two lead roles. As frightening as this may sound to a lot of people I do think Brand is a funny comedian and I found the 2008 Apatow Productions film he appeared in to be an overall funny and satisfying farce so I was obviously interested in seeing this followup. I wasn't expecting Get Him to the Greek to be as good and had noticed a lot of criticism of it making my expectations a little lower. It turned out that I found it a LOT funnier than many others have but it certainly doesn't stay as consistent as it could.Infant Sorrow frontman Aldous Snow whose current girlfriend is pop star Jackie Q makes an album with his band called African Child with the title track as a single but this turns out to be a critical and commercial disaster! The singer has now been sober for seven years but his relationship with Jackie fails and he relapses abusing alcohol and illegal drugs again after all these years! This makes him spiral out of control and ruin his career! Meanwhile Aaron Green is a lowly Los Angeles talent scout who works for Pinnacle Records a company which is currently in a financial rut. He is also a hardcore Infant Sorrow fan so he suggests to Pinnacle Records head Sergio Roma who is looking for ideas to save the company that they have Aldous perform at the Greek Theatre on the tenth anniversary of his big show at that venue. Sergio sends Aaron on a flight to London to escort the washedup rock star to Los Angeles and tells him he has 72 hours to get the man to the Greek Theatre. Unfortunately several complications will make it difficult for Aaron and Aldous to make it to this major gig on time! Aware of the criticism by the time I watched this I thought maybe it really would turn out to be lame and a major disappointment after Forgetting Sarah Marshall but that wasn't the case for me. I soon found myself laughing sometimes lightly as the film shows Aldous and his girlfriend and what goes wrong. More funny parts follow as we are introduced to Aaron Green and his life in L.A. and at this point it helps that Sean P. Diddy Combs is funny as the shorttempered Sergio Roma. There are times when the film lags around this point but not usually. I think it gets funnier when Aaron meets Aldous in London and we hear what Aldous' mother thinks of his father. On the flight back to the United States the conversation between Aaron and Aldous is another comic highlight with Aaron admitting what he really thinks of African Child and the Infant Sorrow frontman's reaction to this. The big laughs continue with all the problems these two characters face as the talent scout tries to get the singer to their destination before the time is up. Sure there are some pretty lame gags but these are fairly rare. However after a while it wears a bit thin and it sometimes gets kind of disturbing with Aldous' drug problems and what happens when he gets Aaron to smoke some of these drugs without the talent scout knowing though I'm certainly not saying that it's all straightfaced from this point on.Other viewers can hate this movie and look down on anyone who likes it all they want but after watching such lousy attempts at comedy as Ed My Boss's Daughter and The Master of Disguise recently I have to say that this one is a LOT funnier than those! Get Him to the Greek is the first comedy I've seen in a few weeks that has actually made me laugh a lot so I have to give it credit for that! Still even all those bad comedies didn't make this one look like a work of genius to me as I could still see the flaws in it which eventually get more significant as the movie progresses. Since this is another effort from Apatow Productions you can obviously expect it to be very raunchy and some scenes could gross you out but even if you can take this and are prepared for it and even if you like Forgetting Sarah Marshall you could find Get Him to the Greek disappointing. Still while many would disagree I certainly think it could have been MUCH worse and it can obviously please certain audiences.".

There are times when the film lags around this point but not usually. I think it gets funnier when Aaron meets Aldous in London and we hear what Aldous' mother thinks of his father. On the flight back to the United States the conversation between Aaron and Aldous is another comic highlight with Aaron admitting what he really thinks of African Child and the Infant Sorrow frontman's reaction to this. The big laughs continue with all the problems these two characters face as the talent scout tries to get the singer to their destination before the time is up. Sure there are some pretty lame gags but these are fairly rare. However after a while it wears a bit thin and it sometimes gets kind of disturbing with Aldous' drug problems and what happens when he gets Aaron to smoke some of these drugs without the talent scout knowing though I'm certainly not saying that it's all straightfaced from this point on.Other viewers can hate this movie and look down on anyone who likes it all they want but after watching such lousy attempts at comedy as Ed My Boss's Daughter and The Master of Disguise recently I have to say that this one is a LOT funnier than those! Get Him to the Greek is the first comedy I've seen in a few weeks that has actually made me laugh a lot so I have to give it credit for that! Still even all those bad comedies didn't make this one look like a work of genius to me as I could still see the flaws in it which eventually get more significant as the movie progresses. Since this is another effort from Apatow Productions you can obviously expect it to be very raunchy and some scenes could gross you out but even if you can take this and are prepared for it and even if you like Forgetting Sarah Marshall you could find Get Him to the Greek disappointing. Still while many would disagree I certainly think it could have been MUCH worse and it can obviously please certain audiences.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the trailers for Greek they looked moderately funny. I hadn't seen Sarah Marshal so I had no idea what that was all about. But reviews were good and I thought hey what the heck. What I found was a very funny Apatowfilmish take on the rock n roll film. All the elements of a usual Apatow troop film are there focus on unusual moments sex drugs and gross out humor friendship and some serious moments and the breaking down of typical film trappings. Suffice to say this is a great summer comedy.The film as many know charges Allen Green with getting washed up rock star Aldous Snow to the Greek Theater in LA for a 10th anniversary concert. As one would guess things don't go accordingly and a whole lot of comedy ensues. The film more than anything is essentially a rock pic. It's about the life of this rock star who has burned out his bulb and is attempting to put in a new one. And as Aldous Snow Russel Brand is fantastic. He truly embodies this rock star and you feel he really IS this character. He boozes it up drugs it up sexes it up and whatever other manner of things a rock star might abuse. He's a mess of a guy and like so many famous people who have gone south he's a complicated person who has let fame get the best of him. This is translated extremely well. Despite all the comedy this is an excellent rock and roll biopic type film. Jonah Hill is great as the lead character with baggage of his own and he does what he does best here although he plays a more awkward kind of character versus his geekin charge style that we're so accustomed too.Stealing the show however is Sean Combs who plays Green's boss Sergio. Every scene he is in is hilarious and he is surprisingly funny. It was definitely pleasant to see him pull off such a funny role. The other supporting characters are great doing a fine job of being very funny themselves. Most of the film falls into stages of comedy bits and all are pretty damned hilarious. There's nothing here that's too ridiculous which is nice. There is once scene that kind of makes you raise a brow but it's just so damn funny you forget how insane it is. And that's really the charm of the film. Everything about it is larger than life yet believable. This is exactly why it perfectly molds both the rock star film and an Apatow comedy so perfectly. It's the kind of comedy you would expect it to be while not knowing exactly what is going to happen. If you don't like these kinds of comedies this one may not be for you. But if you've enjoyed other films like Sarah Marshal Pineapple Express and other Apatow troop films you'll find Greek hilarious. I know I did.".

This is just 108 minutes approx of pure fun and a lot of crude humor.Russel Brand Jonah Hill and Diddy are flat out hilarious. I'll go far as to say that Diddy's character Sergio is to this movie as Russell Brand's Aldous Snow was to Forgetting Sarah Marshall. There are a lot of hilarious lines throughout the movie and a couple of awesome cameos.I haven't laughed as much as I did tonight since I first saw The Hangover last year.

Of course the comedy here is that Aldous is a druggedout rock  roller who cannot get enough booze and narcotics into his system while straightlaced Aaron does his best to keep him off drugs and get him onto the plane. The irony is that Aaron eventually winds up doing all of Aldous's narcotics. At one point Aaron has to stuff a ball of heroin up his anus so that the two of them can slip past the airport checkers. Aaron discovers what it is like to be a freewheeling drugged out guy and gets laid once in a bathroom by a woman and later is raped by a drugged out Vegas chick called Destiny who stuffs a dildo up his butt while she straddles him in bed. Indeed poor Aaron does virtually everything to nurse maid Aldous to the concert. The jokes are not that funny and the formulaic characters are far from sympathetic despite the fact that Aldous redeems himself and Aaron becomes Aldous' producer.

	schema:reviewBody "The comedy films of writerproducerdirector Judd Apatow have somewhat dominated the last eight years or so. As well as being commercial hits they have been lauded by critics for their sweet approach to comedy blended with grossout aspects and genuinely good scriptwriting. Apart from his best works  The 40Year Old Virgin Superbad Knocked Up  his films can often be lazy relying on quirky randomness to get through. The overrated Anchorman which has somehow become a massive cult hit was the biggest example of this and although I could watch Will Ferrell all day the film just felt like it was desperately trying to get through to the other side. Get Him To The Greek is another example of this.Music producer Aaron Green Jonah Hill convinces his somewhat angry boss Sean Combs that an anniversary concert for failing rock star Aldous Snow Russell Brand is the way forward. Convinced Green is sent to London to collect Snow and take him on a few promotional spots before arriving back in America for his concert. Snow would rather have endless parties take lots of drugs and sleep with lots of women  which is okay with Green only he has an angry boss on his ass and a girlfriend played by Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss who he's not sure has broken up with him or not.This is really a film of two halves. The first being genuinely funny  with Brand breathing likability into his somewhat loathsome character and the exchanges between Hill and Diddy being a particular highlight. This is coming from a person that hates Russell Brand. I mean I really really hate him. But the charm that everyone else seems to see only becomes apparent to me when on the screen. Here he reprises his role from Forgetting Sarah Marshall where I was surprised with his comic timing. When the second half comes around I began hating him again.The film simply runs out of ideas throwing in a troubled fatherson relationship between Brand and his Las Vegasbased father Jonathan Snow Colm Meaney that is of no interest. It also throws up one of the unfunniest scenes in the film with Hill being smashed on a 'jeffrey' a mix up of a variety of drugs smoked like a joint and stroking a furry wall while Brand and Meaney fight. It resorts to scenes like this because it has no more jokes to tell and combined with Aldous Snow's increasingly crap and unfunny array of songs it all feels like it just wants to end.Sadly a more interesting subplot that reveals Snow's serious drug habit crops up then seemingly fades out without being properly explored. It could have added another dimension to Snow's character and stopped him becoming a whiny and annoying protagonist. That said the first half is funny enough to make it worth a watch and Sean Combs near enough steals the entire film.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Russell Brand is near genius in his portrayal of an outofcontrol rock star has been and Jonah Hill for once plays the lowkey straight man. Another standout is Sean Combs as an overthetop music exec. My husband and I saw this on a date and we both loved it. Granted it has plenty of profanity and some grossout moments but I felt all of those contributed to the message of the movie which was about the extreme nature of the rock and roll lifestyle. Funny poignant and ultimately a feelgood story about friendship and forgivenessand rock and roll!".

By the one hour mark I wanted to leave but stayed which is a mistake. In the end when he finally got to the concert I thought it would be over but no they had to prolong it another little bit to extend the bore. I went in expecting something close to The Hangover and instead got 90 minutes of swearing and a few flashes of nudity. I don't know how anyone can rate this a 7 out of 10 or more.".

Jonah is funny to a point but what was fresh with him Superbadin the past to me has gotten old very quickly. There are a few instances that are funny but nowhere near enough tired old unoriginal bits we've seen before and nowhere close to as funny as The Hangover it was advertised to be Superbad or Forgetting Sarah Marshall. The whole bit with Snow and his father is pointless it's neither funny nor do they reexamine that relationship. The movie just drags on and on not being funny and they should have cut it by at least 30 minutes. After a short amount of time you just say Uncle and hope that it ends.".

As a producer he's as close as it gets to Mr. Automatic going from Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy to The 40YearOld Virgin to Talladega Nights to Superbad to Pineapple Express with only a couple Year One's and Walk Hard's to queer the run. Apatow's done it the right way by surrounding himself with a gang of truly funny people and by recognizing what a lot of timid glossobsessed Hollywood folks won't that guys like Jonah Hill Michael Cera Steve Carell and Seth Rogan could carry pictures. They're all... these are oddlooking dudes these Apatowian fellas and it's hard to make them look good blown up billboard size. But all of them can write their own jokes all of them are funny and as Hill proves in the new Get Him to the Greek all of them can carry the weight of a big film on their back despite their schlubbiness despite the films not being SNL spinoffs. There's just talent and comedy that's both fresh and charmingly oldfashioned. With Get Him to the Greek there's a weird bit of Hollywood storyactor oddness that evaporates as soon as the picture gets rolling writerdirector Nicholas Stoller is taking characters from a previous film that he directed that was written by and starred Jason Segel Forgetting Sarah Marshall keeping one intact Russel Brand's rock god Aldous Snow and slightly tweaking one other Jonah Hill's disturbedfan matre d' becomes a shy music intern and sets them loose in a completely unconnected narrative. Snow is the last true rockstar recently fallen hard off the wagon posta disastrous careerthreatening single about starvation in Africa called African Child. Worried about slumping record sales and a labelhead the surprisingly entertaining Sean Diddy Combs looking for the next thing intern Aaron Green Hill suggests the company return to its rock roots and sponsor a gig at the Greek theatre in L.A. to mark the 10th anniversary of a legendary Aldous Snow show. Green is sent to London to collect him packing an adrenaline shot and instructions to do whatever it takes to get the slippery deluded hardpartying rock god to L.A. in three days. Very funny hijinks ensue.Brand as Snow is the spectacle the wild spark that animates the whole film. Snow vacillates wildly from petulant artistic preciousness to aggressive junkie posturing to anarchic drug logic and back. Storywise tt's a dangerous thing to chance as the rockexcess thing has been parodied to neardeath. Brand though limns the edges of his chaos with occasional moments of human frailty. The film notes late in the going that Snow's selfappointed rock messiah is intelligent and it's a small ignorable moment that speaks to the subtle bits of originality in the film's script and in Brand's performance he's a pompous idiotic waster in true rock fashion but there's a cruel manipulative intelligence underneath it all that helps the whole film feel fresh and funny even if it's going over welltrod Spinal Tap ground.The discovery of the film though is Jonah Hill as Aaron Green the spectacular punching bag at the heart of a film that mercilessly visits every kind of humiliation and degradation on him. He stands square in the furnace blast of Snow's rocksuperstar excess and the shrivelling repeated mind fks of his conniving unbalanced boss he pukes he's sexually assaulted by more than one person he's threatened cursed party to a stabbing. But what makes Hill's performance truly funny is that while he is in essence a nebbish a victim a barfcoated illlooking cannonball of a man he nonetheless retains a really kind of compelling dignity and oddly endearing selfconfidence. There's a depth to Hill's performance in this film and in Forgetting Sarah Marshall as well that's actually special. He's not an oversize wildman he's not a tiny Michael Ceraesquire mumbler. He's doing something new and it along with everything else in this film is very very funny. 810".

Lets see....did I miss anything else? oh ya lack of creativity and originality. Seriously these movies that come out seem to have all the same old characters in them and its getting quite annoying. Cant they think of something new besides offending people? its just not funny. And the sexist crap can we really not get through a movie without throwing in naked women and strippers? its like the director makes certain that they humiliate the females and intentionally degrade them. I am growing quite tired of theses immature senseless sexist movies. Maybe if they were comical they would be more tolerable. I guess I could see a pubescent teen being excited about this movie cause like the others there is always the abundance of over the top sexual content but a person that is a bit more grown up and looking for adult humor and maturity I suggest you look elsewhere. Its embarrassing seeing movies where the adult men act like 15 year old boys. Its like we are going backwards in time and America is getting stupid from these movies.".

Its a train wreck and paying money for this or to even see this is a total waste. I think people should instead donate money to these guys in the movies for acting school and to the directors for a psychotherapist to talk about their women issues. Cause they are clearly angry women haters who feel to the need to humiliate degrade and insult women on a constant basis and who have absolutely no respect for women nor their bodies. Degrading a person because of their sex or their body is not funny its stupid and shows lack of character and immaturity. Can these directors seriously not make a movie without insulting women? are they incapable? Movies can be funny without belittling a sex. Where do they find these desperate women to take these roles anyway? Its truly sad. This movie is a disgrace and a waste of time.".

I would say this movie is a solid 7.5 out of 10 but that isn't really an option. The comedy in this movie lands well almost all of the time and the story more or less takes a backseat to the comedy until the final 30 minutes or so. That is really the only part where the movie falls short. The story putters along adding more and more along the way and the closing struggles to wrap it all up because it doesn't do anything to invest itself along the way. But the whole idea of the movie is to put the story in the backseat and have the audience enjoy the ride of the loosely stringed together jokes and that is where it shines.T.J. Miller notable from Cloverfield and She's Out of My League has a fantastic turn as a concierge that Aaron has a short runin with. Rose Byrne does a fantastic job of moderately offending you while making you laugh and it is a definite departure from her past roles. There are plenty of fantastic cameos that serve their purpose to elevate the comedy to another level. By far Sean P. Diddy Combs steals the show as Sergio. The natural biased to accepting him as an actor dissolves by the time his first scene is over and you're too busy laughing to care anymore. The power of the comedy that was wrote for him overpowers your want for an actor you thought would be better suited for the role. It isn't until the hotel chase sequence that you realize the casting was perfect for him.This film sets out to make you laugh and does exactly that in spades. The only qualms come from the story aspect and when you're going to see a movie like this you shouldn't ever expect too terribly much from the story. Get Him to the Greek is extremely funny easily watchable and does its semisource material Forgetting Sarah Marshall justice.".

Furthermore the train must make its journey across hostile Red Indian terrain where a fearsome ambush or a sabotaged stretch of track is only a spear throw away.Bronson plays a mysterious outlaw who is held prisoner on the train though there are plenty of clues that he may not be exactly who he says he is. Other well delineated characters are played by Richard Crenna Jill Ireland Archie Moore yes the boxer! and Ed Lauter. One truly amazing sequence involves a rooftop scuffle between Bronson and Moore.... indeed most people who have ever seen the film remember it for that sequence more than any other. All things considered Breakheart Pass is one of the better adaptations of a MacLean novel admittedly not quite in the same league as Fear is the Key or Where Eagles Dare but definitely worth seeking out especially on DVD.".

For the first time viewer 90 of the fun is figuring just who the good guys and bad guys are on this train to Fort Humboldt in the Rocky Mountains. It's not revealed until about 75 of the film is done and when it is revealed the action steps up considerably.A special train is being sent to Fort Humboldt with medical supplies and a relief force as cholera has broken out there. The territorial Governor Richard Crenna is taking personal charge of the operation the troops are commanded by cavalry Major Ed Lauter. Along for the ride is U.S. Marshal Ben Johnson Doctor David Huddleston the Commanding officer's daughter Jill Ireland. The engineer is Roy Jenson the conductor is Charles Durning. Governor Crenna travels in style with a private car with a cook Archie Moore and a server Victor Mohica. As you can see Breakheart Pass has a good cast.Marshal Johnson arrests a fugitive Charles Bronson before the journey starts and circumstances force him to take Bronson along. People start getting killed on this trip even before the train leaves and as I said no one is exactly who he seems to be.Alistair MacLean for a nonAmerican writer managed in this story to get the western ambiance down pretty good.

To me the main item of interest is that Yakima Canutt the first great movie stuntman and later a great stunt coordinator was the 2nd unit director. It was his last movie. He died the next year  1976. He started in silent movies worked with John Wayne on many occasions and staged the chariot race in the nineOscar winning Ben Hur. It's fitting that his last movie was a Western.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in 1873 aboard a train carrying vital medicine panniers along a long rout across snowy mountains and narrow passes . Then  the people on the train start dying mysteriously  one by one . The obvious suspense deals with a bandit who is detained by a Sheriff  Ben Johnson  as he is a mysterious outlaw  Bronson  as a killer under arrest . The mystery man results to be the main suspect but things go wrong . Then  at the Breakheart Pass a location in Nevada's Rocky Mountains through which trains must pass takes place moving and violent happenings . Stirring  exciting and consistently enjoyable Western  being an agreeable combination of mystery movie  Western and whodunnit  including thrills  violence  shootouts  a lot of killings and inherent dynamism as opposed to weightily set up action pieces . Aficionados of this sort of stories will know that's too easy  but the main problem is that  as soon as someone comes under suspicion  quickly gets bumped off . The action pieces are well paced  and filmmaker keeps the fastmovement tumbling across the screen . It includes spectacular pursuits on the train in which the pursued protagonists cross impressive wood bridges  landscapes  rivers and mountains  in addition  being set in Nevada  however  the film was actually shot in Idaho . This is a typical adventure with all the usual failings  minimal characterization  too much script  twists and too little real events . This one arranges to mingle essential Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians with murders on a train a la basic Orient Expressstylebeing set in the old west . Based on a novel by bestselling writer Alistair McLean  this American film packs habitual combination included on his books  as foolish as well as terrible dialogue  moving action  breathtaking locations and colorful characters . This film is particularly emphasized for some fight images aboard the train between twofisted guy Charles Bronson and the hunk Archie Moore  it was performed without stunt doubles. Other films based on his novels are the followings  Force 10 Navarone  Guns of Navarone   Puppet on chain   When the eagles dare   Operation Polar Zebra  Station 3 Ultrasecret and this Breakheart pass  among others . As always  Charles Bronson performs a tough and silent man in lame manner  as he plays an outlaw with a dak secret . This is one of a number of westerns that Bronson made during the mid to late 1960s and early 1970s . These include westerns made during the seventies such as  Red sun 1971 by Terence Young  Chato 1972 by Michael Winner  From noon till three 1976 by Frank D Gilroy  Nevada Express 1975 by Tom Gries and White Buffalo 1977 by J. Lee Thompson  being most of them produced by Dino De Laurentiis . Bronson is well accompanied by a fine support cast  such as  his wife Jill Ireland being ne of many films in which Charles Bronson costarred with his early deceased spouse  Ben Johnson  Charles Durning  Ed Lauter Bill McKinney  David Huddleston  Robert Tessier  Roy Jenson  and a previous light heavyweight prizefighter boxing champ turnedactor Archie Moore among others . Superbly photographed by Lucien Ballard on spectacular snowy outdoors and defiles from Camas Prairie Railroad Lewiston Idaho Kalibab National Forest Arizona Doubling for Nevada  and Williams Arizona USA . This cameraman when he's given the chance is awesome . Special mention for the rousing as well as evocative musical score by maestro Jerry Goldsmith  composed in his peculiar style . Goldsmith charging along to some of the best film soundtracks has ever written . The motion picture was professionally directed by Tom Gries  helped by his experienced secondunit aide Yakima Canutt  though flopped in theatres . Tom was an expert director of Western as this Breakheart pass also titled Nevada Express  100 Rifles  and Will Penny that is the best work ever made  Gries also directed other successes as Breakout The glass house  Helter Skelter and TV series as QBVII  but he also made some real duds . His later output in other genres was routine.".

	schema:reviewBody "A good time is guaranteed when one sits down to watch this exhilarating blend of action Western and suspense  largely set on a train. Based on the novel by Alistair MacLean and scripted by the author himself it has an engaging plot with twists and revelations along the way.Charles Bronson delivers a fine performance as John Deakin a wanted man who is brought aboard a train headed to Fort Humboldt which is supposedly experiencing an outbreak of diphtheria. We'll find that things are not as they seem and the characters cannot be taken at face value either.The phenomenal supporting cast is a pleasure to watch there are so many good actors in one place here. Ben Johnson Jill Ireland looking quite beautiful Richard Crenna Charles Durning Ed Lauter Bill McKinney David Huddleston Roy Jenson Robert Tessier who curiously seems to be dubbed by Paul Frees and Sally Kirkland are all present and accounted for the young trooper Rafferty is played by Paul Newmans' son Scott.The action is firstrate and the movie just like the prominent mode of transportation races forward. Tom Gries directs first unit with the legendary Yakima Canutt handling the second unit and the stunt coordination. Among the highlights are an intense fight between Bronson and boxing champ Archie Moore who plays the dubious chef Carlos and an incredible train crash. And it's all done in the classic tradition without the modern tendency to rely heavily on special effects.We already know we're going to have some serious fun with the opening credits courtesy of Phill Norman accompanied by a majestic powerful catchy main theme by Jerry Goldsmith which this reviewer can still hear in his head as he types this. The movie gets right down to business with a good solid story that has no need for filler and which moves right along to a nicely executed action climax. The movie's got something for a variety of tastes and makes for mighty fine escapism which manages to remain fun on repeat viewings.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "There came a point in the movie when I began wondering to myself how come John DeakinMurray Charles Bronson is running around loose without scrutiny or in the presence of any of the authority figures like Marshal Pearce Ben Johnson or Major Claremont Ed Lauter. After all his face was on a Wanted Poster and he admitted to being an arsonist and murderer. There was only the very loose explanation that the supply train was winding it's way through uninhabited and dangerous wilderness but a dangerous guy I think would have made a break for it at some point.But Deakin was not the dangerous guy the viewer is set up for. The picture jumps all of it's characters through some hoops so that they turn out to be somewhat different players than how they started. Only Miss Scoville Jill Ireland survives the trip unscathed as the same character but reviled by the idea that her fiance and Governor Richard Crenna is one of the picture's main villains. I always get a kick out of seeing Bronson and Ireland in the same picture knowing that they were married in real life and wondering if they played out their movie roles at home. You know like tying Bronson's hands behind his back and slapping him around for fun.Probably the most memorable part of the film is the fight scene between Bronson and Archie Moore! on the train rooftop hurtling along though the mountain pass. By this time Moore didn't look like he could make his weight limit as a light heavyweight and he didn't have much in the way of a speaking role but he did look dangerous. I wonder if that's how his ring opponents saw him without a knife.Overall a decent time filler for an action flick more of a mystery than a Western and suitably outfitted with rugged countryside that complements the characters of the main players. Aliatair MacLean wrote the screenplay based on his own novel utilizing some of the same elements that brought his more heralded war stories to the screen like Where Eagles Dare and Force 10 From Navarone.".

	schema:reviewBody "One is aware of some daunting negatives going against this film even before seeing it1. It's a Western made in the 1970s.2. It's a Charles Bronson movie made in the 1970s.3. It's an Alistair MacLean film adaptation made in the 1970s.Westerns Bronson movies and MacLean novels all bespoke a certain high level of quality in the 1960s and all made the transition into the 1970s about as well as the Beatles or the Green Bay Packers. Mindful of that you want Breakheart Pass to beat the odds and show you it has something in the tank or in this case the engine compartment as most of it takes place on a train traveling across the snowy mountains of Colorado.But Breakheart Pass is stupid turgid and poorlyacted at nearly every turn. Perhaps the nonsensical script kept Bronson and the other actors from taking anything too seriously though their tight expressions suggest no one was having much fun. A train carrying medical supplies and soldiers is on its way to relieve a fort wracked by a diphtheria epidemic. Bronson is John Deakin a wanted man being brought to the fort by a hardtalking deputy marshal Ben Johnson. Also on the train is the governor of the state Richard Crenna and his mistress Jill Ireland.There's a weird mean streak in this film that weighs down the lighterthanair storyline soldiers being slaughtered or having their brains blown out for cheap effect. About the only fun you can have is making a drinking game out of all the clunker lines here though you'd risk a coma before the second hour. I'm still trying to figure out which actor gives the worst line reading. Is it Ireland's Seven people my God Richard how awful! or Bill McKinney as a preacher exclaiming How dare you expose all of us to this dreadful pestilence!Of course lines like those tax any actor's selling ability and it's no wonder Crenna Johnson and Charles Durning as another of the train's mystery men are content to slouch their way toward a paycheck here. Bronson's his typically inert self taking only what the script gives him but director Tom Gries is no Sergio Leone and Bronson's acting has a laggard quality alltoofamiliar in his Death Wish days.Breakheart Pass was the last film for fabled stunt coordinator Yakima Canutt and one of the last Westerns for cinematographer Lucien Ballard who memorably shot The Wild Bunch and True Grit. Canutt with a fight on top of a rail car and Ballard with his views of the train chugging through snowy valleys give the best work here along with Ed Lauter who as U.S. Army Maj. Claremont manages to win our rooting interest. With everything else so flat though they are easy to miss. Gries' static exterior compositions his dull repetitious framing of the actors and scenes and his overreliance on MacLean's bland and pokey script all doom any entertaining quality this film might have had.SPOILERS FOLLOW  Why does the deputy marshal allow Deakin to freely roam around the train after taking him into custody for the murder of seven people? Why does the governor of a state who however corrupt would presumably have plenty of everyday opportunities for graft and embezzlement risk his life and office to help an Indian war party get ahold of rifles and explosives? Why do he and his evil henchmen leave the vulnerable and trusting Maj. Claremont alone while taking such chances to kill his troops? Why does a clearly American army officer have a daughter with a British accent? How come after being told how remote this Fort Humboldt is more than a day's journey by rail Claremont is able to ride off and bring back a Cavalry troop a few minutes later to save the day?  SPOILERS ENDIt's not that a film needs to make much sense to be entertaining. But Breakheart Pass doesn't have the craft to bluff past its silliness and doesn't have the charm to make you want to be gulled.".

Jill Ireland is mainly acceptable and Bronson etches out a solid performance.Director Tom Gries lets it move along quickly offering enough tension and action in some enclosed settings until it's chaotic but bangup climax. It's a competent display with little in the way of flair as there are a couple of pretty good setpieces involving two carriages of soldiers meeting an unpleasant end and a tussle between Bronson and Archie Moore on top the train. Underlining it all is a stirringly grand arrangement to Jerry Goldsmith's score.

However the story here takes us aboard a train traveling for a day or two from an oasis of civilization in the postcivilwar Northwest to Breakheart Pass an army post. Along the way we have spectacular vistas of mountains gorges snowladen firs and rickety wooden bridges. Throw in the derailing of some cars and a couple of dynamite explosions at the end. Add a good cast and a director who had done some admirable work in Will Penny and you have a generally satisfying movie.Railroad movies are usually satisfying in one way or another. The train rattles along everything inside tictocs from side to side. There is the distant rumble and measured clicks of iron wheel across iron rail. Spaces are small and cozy. Landscapes roll past the windows and there is the occasional clang and flashing light of a warning at a railroad crossing. Somehow it makes you want to curl up and go to sleep as if in a cradle.But truth be told things get a little hairy when you have half a dozen conspirators who have loaded the train up with arms to be sold to the renegade Indians. The Indians here don't get much respect anymore than they did in real life. In addition to illegal rifles we brought all kinds of 19thcentury infectious diseases to the West. Sometimes cholera or smallpox just wiped out a good portion of the tribe Blackfeet and sometimes demolished it entirely Mandan.The script is a little confusing and weakens towards the end after the Reveal. It turns from a mystery into a Western action movie. I don't need to tell you how it turns out. Well I'll tell you anyway. The cavalry ride to the rescue.The skill that the director Tom Gries showed in his earlier film is not on display here. He has an eye for the picturesque but dialog scenes are riddled with clichs. When one character has something short important and pithy to say the camera rolls in for a closeup. That camera movement tells us Listen up. The guy is about to say something important. The problem is that we don't need to have the camera spell it out for us. Why gild the flower? Of course clichs like stereotypes are functional otherwise they wouldn't have become clichs. Lesser imaginations use them all the time even though they condescend to the audience.For all its defects though the film captivates a viewer with its oldfashioned railroad story. Maybe it's just me but I love 'em. I like trains a lot more than I like airplanes which have an alarming tendency to fall down. Then there is the cast saddled though they may be with predictable and easily forgotten dialog. Jill Ireland is especially nice. She was never much of an actress but had a sweet face and endearing big ears. And she was a ballerina too which gives her bonus points in my book.Kind of fun to watch once in a while.".

The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial. In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind again I won't say who it seems artificial.I realize as a Christian it's unedifying for me to say I disliked this film but I can't in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done.

And considering that I used a free coupon to rent it that's saying something.However I must point out that I'm not objecting to the Biblical content. Viewed simply as a fictional text there's nothing wrong with the Bible this is a fictional movie so I don't have a problem per se with the content although IMHO it makes it more fantasy than science fiction.No the problem with Left Behind is just that the movie totally fails to excite. The plot dawdles along at a painful pace for far too long and even I figured out the Rapture part about ten minutes into it I didn't initially believe that they would try and use that as the REAL explanation but I wasn't exactly shocked when they did.The story is not internally self consistent. We're told about a world wide hunger problem but we're never shown this all of the cast seem well fed for example. We're expected to believe that the population of the planet buys the idea that some mysterious form of radiation has selectively wiped out millions of people in a wide spread area with no particular pattern they wouldn't especially considering that some of the world's top scientists are unlikely to have been chosen. Basically given the situation at the START of the movie we should see a very different society  one on the edge of survival with martial law and even open warfare and we don't America looks pretty much the same as it always does in Hollywood. AFTER the rapture it should be even worse  and yes we see a few signs that things are breaking down but it's still largely business as usual.Finally the story doesn't have an ending. Apparently there's a sequel but that doesn't excuse the lack of a finale in this movie. To all intents and purposes they figure out what's going on and then ... it ends. No confrontation. No payoff. Just the main character finally realising the truth of what the viewer noticed hours ago.I've certainly seen worse movies of course but if you happen to see a copy of this on the store shelves even at weekly prices... you would do best to simply let it remain Left Behind.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been a while since seeing this the first time so I watched it again with the second movie in the series. While I realize there is a 3rd movie out that I haven't seen yet I'll review under the original title...Just from the standpoint of production value screen writing and movie making this movie fails on many levels though it succeeds on a few as well. What can you expect from a lowbudget B movie? Not much and it works from the standpoint of production. However the writing is certainly disjointed with little in the way of character development...exactly what I'd expect when there is an agenda to a film. I didn't have a problem with the acting...the cast is solid however the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves. Because the film is Christian this is predictable as you can't very well portray violent chaos of the end times without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with Christianity. In other words the mistake comes in making this into a Grated film when the content even in the most conservative of Bible interpretations would be Rrated by any measure. So if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into Christian faith then the movie should be somewhat scary right? However you can't comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book or in this case series of books. There are certainly plenty of Christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies...but not the Left Behind series...and these movies ultimately fail because while being bestsellers they are poorly written novels based on bad theology.As a Southern Baptist minister I confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me though I have yet to finish the last two books of the series. I have described them as decent fiction and if the books would take the point of view that this is one possibility or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology study of the end times then I could live with that. However this series is divisive in Christian circles because it promotes the literalist interpretation of all Scripture above a more proper hermeneutic. Inevitably this leads to the pretrib premillenial dispensation point of view which confines an allpowerful God far too by humanity's world. In other words as I've always said God shouldn't need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work. But because many people particularly unstudied Christians can't think beyond their own worldviews we are left with a proconservative fundamentalist stance with regard to Bible interpretation and attempts to push it through as the only interpretation.Thus the books carry with them an agenda not so much to get the lost to understand their need for Christ but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the Bible. I recall very clearly reading several years ago in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was left behind BECAUSE of his nonadherence to this point of view as if real christians worthy to be raptured couldn't possibly hold to another eschatology. This is disturbing for several reasons the least of which is because a rapture is only briefly mentioned in Scripture and it's connection to real endtime prophecy is tenuous at best.But the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the Christian community and how they portray true Christian behavior. Ultimately I feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faithreligion instead of win people towards it. It turns all Christians into caricatures equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within Christian thought and practice. As a Christian body on the whole we've done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history...and we certainly don't need to promote it by film to thousands maybe millions of others.Thus the Left Behind movies fail because the Left Behind books aren't worthy to be interpreted into movies.".

And I know the books were best sellers. . .among believers anyway. And I mean no disrespect to all that.But I have to say they stuffed this movie into a sack and beat it with the Suck Stick.I'm sure the books are much better. Really.The plot needs no reprising.

Especially not by Kirk Cameron the creepy little Growing Pains gremlin who came of age on that show found Christ and decided that the SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well Kirk your career has gone to the dogs but now you can be happy that you're spreading the word of God in movies so bad they never even make it to theatrical release. Well that's not strictly true I guess this was the only movie ever made that went to DVD FIRST with a voucher for a free viewing of the movie when it was briefly released in theaters! I still have the voucher! How many people do you suppose showed up? I don't know about you but it never came to my town. Of course I live in NYC where we Godless liberals sit around tearing pages out of the bible and use them to roll joints. So there you go. In fact I'll bet out of three million people on Manhattan Island not one would be raptured.Check out the supplementary materials on the DVD where you'll learn the creepy behind the scenes details of these movies. . .the CAST and CREW all must be of the same religious mindset. They don't come right out and say this but listen closely to what the filmmakers say. It's like a bunch of Pod People got together to make a Pod movie. How creepazoid is that? Honestly this stuff just preaches to the converted doesn't it? Can you imagine anyone who DOESN'T subscribe to the whole apocalypse thing watching this slapping his forehead and saying HOLY HOOVER DAM! I better get saved PRONTO! Anyhow I'm hooked. I gotta see the rest of these Christian fiasco movies especially the one with Gary Busey which I think is TRIBULATIONS. At least Busey has an excuse for taking the part.. . .he cracked his head on some pavement when he crashed his motorcycle.Oy.Oh and one more thing. What's with all the shots of poorinnocent dogs whimpering their leashes dragging uselessly along the ground because their owners have been called to heaven? What's up with that? Are we supposed to feel badly for the dogs and if we do what are we to make of God? Doesn't it IRK people that there's no room in heaven for man's best friend?

If you want to touch a wider audience you have to be way more subtle. You can't have the dad waving the bible around and carrying it with him in EVERY scene. RIDICULOUS! Poor direction. The reveal of people missing should have been terrifying but it was laughable. They leave their clothes on the ground? It reminded me of old Ed Wood movies Oh my God! People are missing! That scene in the plane is just stupid. Think about it if you found your relative's clothes next to you you wouldn't just scream oh my god. they disappeared! they're missing! and start crying and yelling. You would first be in denial... you just wouldn't jump to that conclusion. Watch Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite shot is the dog sitting out on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him. I about fell off the couch I was laughing so hard.The music was so bad and so distracting. It was as if the composer was in his own world scoring his own movies. here's my chance to do a thriller here's my chance to do action! STOP TELLING ME HOW TO FEEL JAMES COVELL! A good score supports what's happening on the screen... this movie needed more of an UNDER score but instead it was as much in your face as the message was.The writing was bland. So was Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was the worse you don't understand! People are missing!. Brad Johnson was laughable. The two stand out performances came from the AntiChrist and the older guy sorry can't remember their names In watching the making of to answer my question of what were they thinking??? the producers and filmmakers and actors are just deluding themselves... saying we're gonna reach wide audiences and brad Johnson is amazing and this is just like a Hollywood movie. I came to the conclusion that they just don't know what the heck they are doing.I commend the effort. Getting the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea. Film is the best medium possible to do that. Look at movies like WIDE AWAKE SIGNS CONTACT PASSION OF Christ even O'BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? The bottom line is that the film needed to be made by people who have talent and vision. Unfortunately it was not.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know why so many people thought this was a bad movie. Some of the Christians who have reviewed it seem to dislike the Christian imagery present in many of the scenes but given the movie's subject is anyone really surprised at how ubiquitous it is? and such prominence may lead nonChristians to view the film in a light of detached skepticism which diminishes any film's audience appeal. The characters' conversions to Christianity had the proper emotional impact and while some might tire of basically hearing God is the answer to nearly every question the characters have postrapture you have to keep in mind that Christians really do believe that God can help you out of any problem.The movie is very true to the book. While leaving out minor details it includes many of the prominent aspects of the book's apocalyptic nature giving it an air of realism. I encourage anyone who wants to see the movie to read the series to find the whole story.

	onyx:emotionText "I don't know why so many people thought this was a bad movie. Some of the Christians who have reviewed it seem to dislike the Christian imagery present in many of the scenes but given the movie's subject is anyone really surprised at how ubiquitous it is? and such prominence may lead nonChristians to view the film in a light of detached skepticism which diminishes any film's audience appeal. The characters' conversions to Christianity had the proper emotional impact and while some might tire of basically hearing God is the answer to nearly every question the characters have postrapture you have to keep in mind that Christians really do believe that God can help you out of any problem.The movie is very true to the book. While leaving out minor details it includes many of the prominent aspects of the book's apocalyptic nature giving it an air of realism. I encourage anyone who wants to see the movie to read the series to find the whole story. So yes you may have to come off your high horse of being above such a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible's apocalyptic prophecies to enjoy this movie. But in the end your experience will depend on whether or not you are able to put any antiChristian inhibitions behind you.";

I have read the book several times and the movie somehow does not capture much of what the book conveys.  Maybe it is time constraints that come with making a movie within say 90 minutes to 2 hours.  But this movie seems rushed somehow.  It did not let certain plotlines develop.  In the book Rayford only lusted after the stewardess where in the movie it seemed like it went a bit beyond that.  Also early in the movie it seemed that Buck Williams already had a relationship with the Steele Family before the Rapture where it did not germinate until towards the end of the Left Behind book.Maybe it was because of the low budget and time constraints.  I remember when Kirk Cameron was fired up about doing the movie after reading the book. The funny thing is that this movie was produced without paying any attention to the details that made this book such a best seller.  The basic idea behind the novel held true to the movie but many key elements in the book were ignored.My advice  Read the novel series see the movie if you must for comparison's sake not as a viable substitute to the novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possible spoilers. Borrowing a line from Roger Ebert I hated hated hated this movie. I have seen over 2000 movies in my life and I think I may rank this one dead last. No matter what category you choose this movie is an inferior product. The acting is below the quality of most TV dramas. Never once did I believe in the characters as people rather than as actors being put through their paces. There is one scene where a young woman hugs her father with the same emotion as if she were hugging a telephone pole. The acting is so wooden that one is inclined to avert his eyes. The special effects were primitive even by 1950 standards. I was hoping to be entertained by the science fiction aspects of this movie but being disappointed understates my reaction. The main event of the story is the rapture  where all the good people are simultaneously taken to heaven by Jesus. In fact the good people do disappear about a quarter of the way into the film but not once do we get to see an actual disappearance. We just see clothes left behind. I always thought the idea was that people's souls ascended to heaven while the body was left behind. But in this movie it appears that Jesus wants naked bodies in heaven. Big opportunities were missed by not allowing us to see the immediate effects of people being yanked off the planet  cars crashing planes going down dishes clattering to the floor surgeries stopped in midstream nuclear power plants going unmanned dogs unleashed on their walks and so forth. We see none of this actually happening. At best we get shots of the aftermath like a multicar accident or passengers in a plane trying to figure out what happened. All the interesting stuff is left out and all we see is some obviously staged after effect shots. The only reasons I can think of for this are either a lack of imagination or a limited budget. The music is unremarkable  some generic rock music a transparent attempt to appeal to a younger audience and a few swelling crescendos to accompany the experiencing the awe of God scenes. But the worst thing about this movie is the horrendous screenplay. The script could have been written in a way to engage us in honest thought as to what constitutes a good life  the ultimate moral question. But judging from the people who are taken in the rapture in this movie it seems that the only good people are the devout Christians and children. This does not seem to me to be realistic. For one thing based on my recollections of childhood I recall an amazing number of acts of undisguised meanness. Should all children be given a free pass to heaven? And most of the people left behind seemed like pretty decent sorts to me  I would liked to have had more information as to just why they were left behind. We are given no firsthand knowledge of the people who were taken so it is hard to compare their qualifications for being taken with those who are left behind. And one has to question the beneficence of a God who would through an act of supposed kindness cause such chaos and grief on earth  a loving mother ripped from her family children taken planes crashing cars crashing communication broken down and so forth. The ultimate message seems to be turn to the Bible family and God. Is this message something we have never heard before? It is hard to know who this movie is aimed at. I guess for Christians the sermon delivered here is an affirmation of their faith but for nonChristians this is a sermon they have endured ad nauseam. Give your money to your favorite charity don't give it in support of such worthless nonsense as Left Behind. If this commentary can save one person from seeing this movie then the time I have spent writing it will not have been spent in vain.".

It's difficult even unfair sometimes but it's awfully hard not to especially if the books are phenomenal successes or classics or even just a book that is one of your personal favorites. For me...the Left Behind Series of books 12 of them in total were drop dead amazing. I was riveted for the year it took me to read them. I am now a huge fan of the series and I couldn't help but see the films. I had a lot to go on being such a fan of the books but I also know that the books AND the films are not for everyone!!! First of all..non Christians are going to be overtly critical especially if they go into it expected a science fiction End Of Days type movie event. This film is based on something that millions BELIEVE is truth so you have to take that into consideration. First of all for me personally I was blown away by Left Behind.Director Vic Sarin is no stranger to film making. He has worked in films for the last 4 decades at least. He has done pretty much everything so he is definitely a veteran film maker. I don't know if he had any contact with the original book by Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye but his casting choices were dead on for the most part and I stand by that. Kirk Cameron is the exception but I won't say he's bad. In fact he's quite good in the lead role of Cameron Buck Williams. Granted he's not quite as gritty or street smart as his book counterpart but he's decent and considering that Cameron is more than directly responsible for the creation of this film at all. Relative newcomer Janaya Stephens plays a strong headed and take charge Chloe Steele and does a good job. The real brilliant casting is in the role of leading man Captain Rayford Steele who was such a huge hero in the book. Brad Johnson puts a face to that role and does a great job doing that. I don't even credit his acting necessarily but his look nails Rayford's personality and his acting is alright too. The other person is the antiChrist himself Nicolae Carpathia played by Gordon Currie a character actor who's been around for a long time. He is brilliant as both the charismatic caring leader and the dark evil being he is to become.The story is very closely linked to the book and they did a good job of transferring book to screen and leaving the most important details in tact and only changing small details. I have heard complaints about this not being an original concept with typical government conspiracy and hit men and yadda yadda yadda well...first off NEWSFLASH nothing is an original concept anymore it doesn't stop people from seeing it. In fact it seems that more than half the films released now are not only not original but direct rehashes of original films or series. I happen to think Left Behind The Movie puts a new spin on the Christian theory and does it excellently. The budget is low but still managed to pull off some intense action scenes there are definite moments when the acting borderlines on campy but they are all not mainstream big actors and actresses and they do their best to make it real. The plot is actually quite complex and intriguing when you really watch. The whole concept of the antiChrist killing his parents which was brought up in films like The Omen and End Of Days is changed completely to have Carpathia murdering his parent figures the men who created him politically. The final scene in the film is disturbing and memorable with a powerful performance by both Cameron and Currie.The average person I can understand giving this a poor score...I could even understand someone being bored with it. It has it's moments. I think for me it's just a personal thing that I loved it and I loved the books and I hope they continue making the films. What I don't like is people nit picking it and saying how crappy it is simply because of it's basis in Christian faith. Grow up!! and open your mind even if you don't believe it you might be entertained. It's worth seeing and I know it's a cult classic so I'm not the the only one!! 8.510 For most probably a 510 but I still encourage reading the book and watching the movie...it's got a lot to offer".

And it is easy to imagine that the childish earnestness of those involved blinded them from critical vision  or perhaps that no great art can come from a fundamentalist world. Who knows?But there are other vapid movies out there too. What makes this and 'Omega Code' so fascinating is that they were not intended to entertain even to enlighten but to proselytize. And some day soon this crowd will cease to be so amateurish  down the street from me is Pat Roberstson's film 'university' with a virtual endowment of billions and the intent of being professionally slick. What then?It is an interesting question. As it stands now we have films that are made for profit. Most of these pander in some way. Then we have films that are made as art.

	schema:headline " God Awful Movie Based On A God Awful Book about a God Awful God";
	schema:reviewBody "Left behind is based on the first book of the popular bestselling series about the end of the world as told in the bible. When I first heard the words apocalypse end times good vs. evil and AntiChrist my first thought were of books and films like the Omen or The stand by Steven King. What I got in the book was badly written fundamentalist fear based propaganda. The film is not much different from my experiences with the book.The story stars Kirk Cameron The kid from growing pains as tough guy reporter Buck Williams and Brand Johnson as polite Rayford Steel who cheating on his overly Christian wife. It begins with Kirk reporting in Israel as the nation is about to be attacked by the Russians. The Russians? Some one's trapped in the cold war days. Anyway there reasons for waging war is for fertilizer. You read that right. They risk world war 3 for Fertilizer. Doom seem to be unavoidable as badly done CGI planes fly over the holy land but at the last seconded a strange force destroys all the planes. Killing all those men who dared anger God by joining the Russian air force. Then we moves into the to the true holy land. America! Ware we meet Brad Johnson character. His wife has become a born again Christian which seems to have caused trouble in the family. In the film they betray it as the family is having a hard time accepting what she has to preach Believe me there will be preaching in this film but in real life it would more likely be along the lines that people cant stand having some one ells trying to enforce religion down our Throats.She throwing there son a Christian themed birthday party Poor kid but that no good sinning nonbelieving father of there has to go to work and fly a plane. As he dose this he is having a little romance with the flight attendant. Nonright winged Christian Characters go on to be betrayed like this in the books and the films. The true believers in Christianity are betrayed as happy good and moral. Those who do not are portrayed as immoral unhappy angry or even naive.He flys his plane that happens to have Kirk on it when half the passengers disappear only leaving behind there cloths. In one night all born again evangelical Christian who believed the bible is the literal truth and Jesus is the only way to heaven disappear along with all children under 12 years old. Planes with out pilots crash cars with no drivers pile up on the streets causing a massive death toll to rise and parents mourn for the lost of there missing children. You think a loving God who cares for humanity would at least take people when they were not driving or flying anything that could get people killed! So thousands of people are killed in cars and plane crashs then sent to hell forever because they did not accept the God who just got them killed in the first place. As the story moves on our heroes discover that people were rapture in to heaven and now it's up to those who were left behind to convert the rest of the world to Christianity and battle the AntiChrist.Okay. One thing I usually cant stand in movies is when I am being preached at and Left behind the most preachy film I have ever seen in my life. Get prepared for endless lectures from the Characters about how great God and Jesus are How the bible the only truth and that it some how not God's fault that people are going to the hell he made for not being Christian. All the born again Christian characters are uninteresting and charters who were more complexes become uninteresting the moment they convert to Jesus.The acting and casting is just bad. I can't really get myself to believe that Kick Cameron is a big tough reporter. The guys still looks like the kid from Growing Pains. The movie is just the beginning of films that are all motivated to promote fear and some bigotry to those who don't buy into this particular brand of Christianity.

	onyx:emotionText "Left behind is based on the first book of the popular bestselling series about the end of the world as told in the bible. When I first heard the words apocalypse end times good vs. evil and AntiChrist my first thought were of books and films like the Omen or The stand by Steven King. What I got in the book was badly written fundamentalist fear based propaganda. The film is not much different from my experiences with the book.The story stars Kirk Cameron The kid from growing pains as tough guy reporter Buck Williams and Brand Johnson as polite Rayford Steel who cheating on his overly Christian wife. It begins with Kirk reporting in Israel as the nation is about to be attacked by the Russians. The Russians? Some one's trapped in the cold war days. Anyway there reasons for waging war is for fertilizer. You read that right. They risk world war 3 for Fertilizer. Doom seem to be unavoidable as badly done CGI planes fly over the holy land but at the last seconded a strange force destroys all the planes. Killing all those men who dared anger God by joining the Russian air force. Then we moves into the to the true holy land. America! Ware we meet Brad Johnson character. His wife has become a born again Christian which seems to have caused trouble in the family. In the film they betray it as the family is having a hard time accepting what she has to preach Believe me there will be preaching in this film but in real life it would more likely be along the lines that people cant stand having some one ells trying to enforce religion down our Throats.She throwing there son a Christian themed birthday party Poor kid but that no good sinning nonbelieving father of there has to go to work and fly a plane. As he dose this he is having a little romance with the flight attendant. Nonright winged Christian Characters go on to be betrayed like this in the books and the films. The true believers in Christianity are betrayed as happy good and moral. Those who do not are portrayed as immoral unhappy angry or even naive.He flys his plane that happens to have Kirk on it when half the passengers disappear only leaving behind there cloths. In one night all born again evangelical Christian who believed the bible is the literal truth and Jesus is the only way to heaven disappear along with all children under 12 years old. Planes with out pilots crash cars with no drivers pile up on the streets causing a massive death toll to rise and parents mourn for the lost of there missing children. You think a loving God who cares for humanity would at least take people when they were not driving or flying anything that could get people killed! So thousands of people are killed in cars and plane crashs then sent to hell forever because they did not accept the God who just got them killed in the first place. As the story moves on our heroes discover that people were rapture in to heaven and now it's up to those who were left behind to convert the rest of the world to Christianity and battle the AntiChrist.Okay. One thing I usually cant stand in movies is when I am being preached at and Left behind the most preachy film I have ever seen in my life. Get prepared for endless lectures from the Characters about how great God and Jesus are How the bible the only truth and that it some how not God's fault that people are going to the hell he made for not being Christian. All the born again Christian characters are uninteresting and charters who were more complexes become uninteresting the moment they convert to Jesus.The acting and casting is just bad. I can't really get myself to believe that Kick Cameron is a big tough reporter. The guys still looks like the kid from Growing Pains. The movie is just the beginning of films that are all motivated to promote fear and some bigotry to those who don't buy into this particular brand of Christianity. Ideas promoted in left behind are the reason why we have problems in place like the mideast to begin with. The simply message of love all as you love your self that Jesus taught is replace with a message that benefit mega churches and politicians.To top it all off we can't even have decent acting realistic characters and good special effects. Leave it to fundamentalist Christians to screw up there own end of the world movie.That why I give this holy message a 1 out of 10";

Although the messages they have tried to get across have been obvious the filmmakers have not conveyed those messages well. This however is usually not their fault as there is usually some sort of low budget handicap hindering these movies. Even keeping that in mind the movies are not enjoyable. Left Behind on the other hand is.In comparison to those previously mentioned other Christian movies Left Behind is a great effort to present the story of Revelation seriously and realistically. I have never had a chance to read any of the Left Behind books which I have really wanted to do so I cannot compare the movie to them. Granted it is not a perfect 10 or anything but I will say that it was a very well made movie. The acting was pretty good and the special effects were well decent. There were only two things I really did not like about the movie. One was the writing. It was simply not written as well as it could have been. It was somewhat cliched and there were a few groaner lines things that people would never ever say in real life. The other was the music. For the most part the soundtrack was pretty good but why in the world did they have to start cutting through the serious music for some soft rock type music? That was simply not appropriate. Also there were moments during which silence might have been more appropriate than any music they could have used especially during scenes of mourning. Apart from these points I thought the movie was pretty good. Even though it lacked technically it is still a great improvement over its predecessors. No matter how much room there was for improvement it must be admitted that there is an element of Left Behind that makes one think about the times to come and how to be ready for them. If you watch this movie with the right attitude not one that wants sensory overload but one that wants to be challenged even if only a little you may find something to chew on in it.".

	schema:headline " Interesting Look At The Political Intrigues Of The Tudor Court";
	schema:reviewBody "For anyone interested in the history of England's Tudor dynasty this is definitely a mustsee film. The most famous of the Tudors are King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I but this film offers up a look at the intrigues within the court in the period between Henry's death and Elizabeth's accession as Catholic Princess Mary strives to gain the throne after the death of her Protestant brother King Edward VI. The religious divisions caused by Henry VIII's embrace of the Reformation are well documented and believably portrayed.Helena Bonham Carter plays the title role  Lady Jane Grey  cousin of the young King Edward and a fanatical Protestant who is manouvered into taking the throne after Edward's death at the age of 15. Jane  also 15  is at first overwhelmed by the thought of being Queen but then embraces the throne. Her immaturity however and wilfullness not surprisingly for a 15 year old get the better of her and lead to her  downfall after only nine days on the throne and Mary's accession. Carter was excellent in this role. Cary Elwes also offered up a strong performance as Guilford Dudley whom Jane is forced to marry against her will but whom she falls passionately in love with. The supporting cast included performances  all of them quite good  by Sara Kestelman as Jane's mother Frances Patrick Stewart as her father Henry John Wood as the Duke of Northumberland Guilford's father Warren Saire as the young King Edward and  playing this role absolutely perfectly  Michael Hordern as Dr. Feckenham confessor to Princess Mary. In fact there really wasn't a subpar performance in this movie.It isn't perfect mind you. It's a little bit too long and I found myself particularly in the last hour or so wondering when it would end. Some of the history is questionable. Many historians think that neither Jane nor Edward were as innocent in the plot to keep Mary from the throne as the movie portrays them and the love story between Jane and Guilford is as I understand it largely fictional. But the basics are quite correct the behind the scenes plotting believably portrayed and the religious struggle of the time absolutely authentic. It's well worth watching this movie if you are interested in this period of English history.710.".

This ease is due not only to the gripping bit of history being told but to the superb acting by all the major players.While none of the performances are bad or even mediocre some bits manage to shine even brighter. Jane Lapotaire as Princess Mary is wonderfully haunted by longing and desperation behind the strong poised front. Patrick Stewart shows us ever so briefly that his Henry Grey is not only a coldhearted conspirator and dominating patriarch but a father who desperate needs to make things right for his little girl.

	schema:reviewBody "The next time I see your face I want it for eternity. If you know much at all about Lady Jane Grey and her unfortunate marriage to Guildford Dudley you must know this cannot at all be what she said to him as they were parted for the last time. Yet the story branches away from the historical aspects of Jane's life and builds up a romance completely created in the minds of the writers who have done an excellent job. In the beginning the scene at Bradgate in Leicester with the dance for the King is extremely well shot. The plot thickens between the cunning Earl of Northumberland and the cold greedy Duchess of Suffolk while Jane argues theology with the Catholic doctor. Comparing this with history I believe this was also very well written from what I've read on Jane Grey I have done extensive Tudor period research I know she was very Protestant and unlike the later Queen Elizabeth very willing to argue on the topic of religion. Perhaps my favorite scene in the entire movie is the one where Jane goes to visit the Princess Mary. In this scene the Renaissance class system is extremely well depicted. The outwardly friendly but rather sneaky nature the Princess' maid I believe that is Lady Anne Wharton conducts herself shows the subservience of the lesser nobility the proud way Jane speaks to the maid shows what the upper nobility could do and then the regal majestic icy cold way the Princess Mary enters the room and embraces her secondcousin is the perfect example of a Princess of two royal bloodlines. Later the love that blooms between Guildford and Jane will without a doubt sweep you off your feet. If you've ever been in love I guarantee you'll relive some fond memories there. Overall an excellent movie and highly recommended.".

Comparing this with history I believe this was also very well written from what I've read on Jane Grey I have done extensive Tudor period research I know she was very Protestant and unlike the later Queen Elizabeth very willing to argue on the topic of religion. Perhaps my favorite scene in the entire movie is the one where Jane goes to visit the Princess Mary. In this scene the Renaissance class system is extremely well depicted. The outwardly friendly but rather sneaky nature the Princess' maid I believe that is Lady Anne Wharton conducts herself shows the subservience of the lesser nobility the proud way Jane speaks to the maid shows what the upper nobility could do and then the regal majestic icy cold way the Princess Mary enters the room and embraces her secondcousin is the perfect example of a Princess of two royal bloodlines. Later the love that blooms between Guildford and Jane will without a doubt sweep you off your feet. If you've ever been in love I guarantee you'll relive some fond memories there. Overall an excellent movie and highly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult to know how to take a film that begins with a history lesson to the selfimportant sound of a beating drum no less and ends with a quote from Plato. Between the two is a narrative that wants to be both a conventional love story and an unconventional period film. It doesn't quite succeed at either but for viewers of LADY JANE the pleasure is in the details and there are plenty of those.To first dispense with the glaring historical inaccuracy that lies at the film's center Lady Jane Grey the NineDay Queen of England in 1553 did not in truth have a passionate love match in her husband Guilford Dudley. Theirs was an arranged marriage highly political in nature and masterminded by Dudley's ambitious father the Duke of Northumberland. In reality Jane resented and distrusted her husband who was a spoiled and rather emptyheaded young man with none of the high intellectual achievement so prominent in Jane.For the second dispensation Helena Bonham Carter who plays Jane is still unskilled at acting in this her first role. She can furrow her brow with admirable dexterity to denote every emotion from confusion to embarrassment to sexual fulfillment but there's little evidence of much going on behind in the furrows of an actor's brain. However since those aforementioned details surround her it becomes fairly easy for a more demanding audience to overlook her callowness.Now for the details beginning with everyone else in the cast. Has John Wood ever utilised his supercilious halfsmile to better advantage? As Northumberland he's perfect  driven by the need to consolidate his power when Jane's cousin Edward VI falls into a fatal illness he conceives a scheme that will require relentless control over nearly everyone at court. While his fellow ministers all burly toughs inevitably knuckle under to his combination of silken flattery and outright threats he's thwarted by two seemingly weak women  Jane and Mary Tudor played with real grit and bitterness by Jane Lapotaire. It's a tossup whether Wood is better at the threats or at two points of emotional breakdown  one when he must cast the die and order the agonising prolongation of Edward's death to complete his plans or when mudpelted and dishevelled following his defeat by Mary's army he ends up in the Tower where all he can offer to his sons and followers is a weary I'm sorry.' It's the rare film where Wood's comic instincts don't get the better of his serious performance  this is one of them.As Jane's equally controlling parents Patrick Stewart and Sara Kestelman are almost as good. Stewart's character the Duke of Suffolk isn't a bright man but his pursuit of his ambitions never quite overrides his notion of family honor and this keeps him sympathetic as all the supposed villains of the film remain. That's another of the details that deserves cherishing  the refusal to go for simplistic characters. Stewart is especially good when he throws all caution to the wind and raises an army to rescue his daughter overriding even the objections of his formidable wife.Other details are in the costuming the suitably squalid tavern and brothel scenes the bit where the aristocratic Kestelman chows down on her dinner gnawing on a greasy chop and wiping her mouth with her sleeve and the achingly beautiful winter deer hunt that runs under the opening credits. All this and more make up for a downbeat ending and a central failure to come up with a satisfying examination of that most enigmatic of queens Lady Jane Grey.".

	schema:headline " The Nine Days Wonder";
	schema:reviewBody "Lady Jane Grey the Nine Days' Wonder is a controversial figure in English history one of a small group of English monarchs whose right to that title is accepted by some historians and denied by others. Others include Queen Matilda King Louis and King Philip the husband of Jane's nemesis Queen Mary I. To some mostly Protestants she is Queen Jane the rightful Queen of England for the nine days between 10th and 19th July 1553. To others mostly Catholics Mary was rightfully Queen from the death of her halfbrother Edward VI and Jane a mere usurper.Legally in fact the position was complicated. Mary like her sister Elizabeth had been declared a bastard by their father Henry VIII. Towards the end of his life however Henry had passed the Third Succession Act which restored his daughters to the line of succession without formally legitimising them. Edward as he lay dying had executed a will excluding Mary and Elizabeth from the succession and naming his cousin Jane as his successor although because this will had not yet been ratified by Parliament at the time of his death Mary's supporters argued that it carried less weight than Henry's Act. Jane was proclaimed Queen by the Privy Council who then promptly abandoned her when they realised that Mary enjoyed more popular support and that attempts to prevent her accession were doomed to failure. Lady Jane was the third British film about Jane's life after a silent version from the 1920s and Tudor Rose from 1936 neither of which I have seen. It was made in 1986 during the Thatcher Years to a script by the wellknown leftwing playwright David Edgar so it is perhaps unsurprising that it is essentially Tudor history rewritten to suit the Guardianreading classes of the 1980s. It is a curious mixture of costume drama and political tract of fact and fiction. It follows the essential outlines of Lady Jane's story but contains two major divergences from historical fact. The first of these concerns the relationship between Jane and her husband Lord Guilford Dudley. At first Edgar paints them as they are portrayed in most history books Jane as intellectually precocious scholarly and devoutly religious Guilford as a debauched young man more interested in frequenting taverns and whorehouses than in reading Plato. Both are initially reluctant to marry and have to be coerced by their parents who see the match as politically and financially advantageous. In the film however Jane and Guilford quickly fall deeply in love although the historical evidence suggests that they disliked one another intensely throughout their marriage. Edgar's second major divergence from history is his attempt to introduce twentiethcentury politics into the period. During their brief reign Jane and Guilford are so shocked by the poverty of their subjects that they introduce a reformist political agenda distribution of land among the peasantry statefunded relief of poverty universal free education based upon progressive principles and the abolition of corporal punishment. At times I thought I was watching an alternate history fantasy about how England under the enlightened rule of Queen Jane the Good became the world's first socialist welfare state nearly four centuries before such ideas caught on in the rest of the world. In the film it is this reformist agenda as much as any popular support for Mary which causes Jane's Council to abandon her cause her Councillors all being wealthy Establishment figures with much to lose from such socioeconomic reforms. Also Mary's determination to marry Philip of Spain was due more to political considerations than to romantic love and Thomas Wyatt's rebellion did not aim to restore Jane to the throne. By 1554 England's Protestants had turned to Elizabeth as their champion. And yet despite Edgar's tendentious distortion of history this was a film which I enjoyed in many ways. The love story of Jane and Guilford however ahistorical it might be was touchingly handled. Helena Bonham Carter in her second major film role was not as good as she had been in A Room with a View the previous year making Jane perhaps rather too priggish. Cary Elwes however is good playing as Guilford as that familiar figure from comingofage dramas the truculent rebellious teenager who matures into a sensitive caring young man when he finds true love. Jane Lapotaire is also good as Queen Mary making her more sympathetic than one would expect given her popular reputation as the tyrannical Bloody Mary. It is a far more subtle portrayal of the Queen than Kathy Burke's demented fishwife in Elizabeth. Other good performances come from Patrick Stewart and Sara Kestelman as Jane's overbearing parents John Wood as her devious scheming fatherinlaw the Duke of Northumberland Warren Saire as the tormented King Edward and Michael Hordern as Doctor Feckenham the elderly Catholic theologian who vainly tries to convert Jane to his faith. Despite Edgar's modernising agenda he does not try to hide the religious controversies of the period with Jane's fervent Protestantism and Mary's equally fervent Catholicism much to the fore. The film was directed by Trevor Nunn bestknown as a stage and television director. It is one of only three feature films he has made the others being adaptations of Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Yet on the basis of this film and Twelfth Night I have never seen Hedda it seems a pity that he has not worked more in the cinema. Here he handles his material well the story moves fluently and there are a number of memorable scenes. I was particularly struck by the one where Jane and Guilford announce their wishes for the country with each wish smashing a wineglass with the exclamation Then it is done! Even though it might tell us more about the 1980s than the 1550s Lady Jane is still a very watchable historical romancedrama. 710".

This was the third filmed for the cinema version of the Lady Jane story . The tale had been filmed twice before for the big screen the most recent at the time was half a century earlier in 1936 as The Tudor Rose  and before that the first time in 1923 about sixtythree years earlier as Lady Jane Grey  or The Court of Intrigue.Colorful as well as glowing cinematography  being final British film shot by veteran English cinematographer Douglas Slocombe  the picture was also the penultimate film overall lensed by Slocombe whose final film was Indiana Jones and the last crusade about three years later .

	schema:reviewBody "To see the real story of where Lady Jane Grey's tragic life had it start one might look at the Disney film The Sword and the Rose. In that one soldier of fortune Charles Brandon Richard Todd wooed and won Henry VIII's sister Mary Glynis Johns. Their grand daughter was Lady Jane Grey who for a brief nine days was recognized by some as the Queen of England. Jane Grey 15371554 was a quiet learned and pious young woman who was a pawn in a power play by the Duke of Northumberland played by John Wood. The minor King Edward VI was a sickly lad who inherited the throne from his father Henry VIII. His original guardians were his uncles Thomas and Edward Seymour but they got to quarreling and both eventually made it to the executioner's block. In fact Lady Jane Grey opens with Edward Seymour's execution and the Duke of Northumberland assuming guardianship.But he knows he's got a sickly dying king and to preserve the newly formed Anglican church that will go by the boards if the Catholic Mary Tudor inherits the throne he needs a Protestant on the throne. Of course he wants to insure his own dominance. To do that he and Jane's parents get an arranged marriage with his youngest son Guilford Dudley who mostly is interested in sampling the fleshpots of whatever town he's in. Still he's a handsome bloke if I do say so.Lady Jane gives you the politics but concentrates on a legendary romance that actually developed out of this arranged marriage. Cary Elwes as Guilford and Helena Bonham Carter as Jane are one appealing pair. They may or may not have been that taken with each other as presented here but why let that get in the way of an appealing story.By all accounts John Wood as the Duke of Northumberland was as big an intriguer and egomaniac as presented here. Allegedly he had one overbearing personality and the royal council went to the Catholic Mary rather than deal with him any longer. A lot of them had reason to regret that shortly.Sara Kestelman and Patrick Stewart are Jane's parents a pair of greedy rogues if there ever were. Stewart gets his just desserts but Kestelman as Frances if anything was downplayed. She actually gave up her place in the line of succession for her daughter because between all of them they thought they could control Jane and Guilford. By all accounts she was one malignant witch of a woman who actually survived it all.The most touching performance here is young Warren Saire as the terminally ill Edward VI. The kid who changed places with a doppleganger beggar boy did not have a happy reign while he was in his minority. He so wanted to live and secure a Tudor succession.Lady Jane isn't accurate history but it's still a fine film with a good cast and thoroughly enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lady Jane had much going for it including a talented cast that it had Trevor Nunn directing and that it was covering an interesting but notquiteaswellknown part of Tudor history. And while it has its imperfections it is more than worthwhile. Some of the first part of the film is sluggishly paced the film is often overscored in both a bombastic and syrupy waythough also with some lovely moments and a lot of the supporting roles are written in a stock wayie. Duke of Northumberland as untrustworthy as the man was I'm not sure whether he was quite the scheming villain that the film made him out to be could be wrong though. There is also one unbelievable scene which was when Jane swore that her husband would never be given the title of king that would have made sense if the film had maintained that Jane and Guildford hated each other but instead it makes them madly in love which was rather conflicting.However there is much to recommend. If you're wondering how accurate Lady Jane is to history in places it does play fast and loosethe romance being the biggest one but most of the time it is accurateespecially with Jane's execution at least it didn't feel grossly distorted and gratuitous like Henry VIII with Ray Winstone did. First off Lady Jane is incredibly wellmade the costumes sets and scenery are colourful and immaculate in detailperhaps too much so at times the lighting is dynamic and the photography is beautiful. The script doesn't do as good a job with developing the supporting roles but does a wonderful job with Jane who goes through several character stages. The dialogue is thoughtful and avoids being too mawkish. The story is compellingly told and plausible on the whole despite a few pacing lulls and that one conflict in the central romance there's plenty to be entertained by and the ending is truly emotional. The romance is not 100 believable and has an 1980s feel at times but it was also rather touching and the chemistry between Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes smolders. Trevor Nunn directs beautifully and Lady Jane is very well cast and acted. Helena Bonham Carter is both sexy and fiery but in the later parts she's heartfelt as well while Cary Elwes is similarly excellent. John Wood's Northumberland is one of his serious roles and he does great at being sinister and Patrick Stewart plays a scheming coldhearted character menacingly and movingly. Jane Lapotaire is a haunting Mary and Michael Hordern and Sara Kestelman's performances are fine too.In conclusion imperfect but well done. 710 Bethany Cox".

Nearly every role in this film is filled by a seasoned veteran of the Royal Shakespeare Company and it is directed by Trevor Nunn one of the most celebrated of the RSC's directors. Bonham Carter and Patrick Stewart are well known to American audiences but John Wood Michael Hordern and others though justifiably famous in the U.K. are much less celebrated on this side of the Atlantic. More's the pity because unlike many American stars they play the character the characters are not arranged to suit their mannerisms. Unlike other dramas depicting the tumultuous period reigned over by the House of Tudor Lady Jane has a fanciful script which makes Lady Jane into a dedicated reformer who falls quickly in love with the young man she is forced to marry and their personal tragedy is elevated into something grander than it really was. Lady Jane in real life was a brief candle quickly extinguished in the struggle between the Catholic Church in the person of her cousin Mary Henry VIII's eldest daughter and the Church of England which subsequently triumphed when Elizabeth Henry VIII's younger daughter succeeded Mary as queen. Elizabeth is never seen in this film and more is made of the love affair between Lady Jane and her consort than of the intrigues which were at the center of this episode in British history. A film truer to the facts might or might not have been a better film  but it would have given us less of Helena Bonham Carter already near the peak of her beauty and her power as an actress.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love these historical Tudor dramas such as the earlier Mary Queen of Scots with Vanessa Redgrave and Glenda Jackson. However I confess that I caught this one on television and missed a few parts. Unfortunately I'm not an expert either on the history of its title character nicknamed the Nine Days Queen so am going somewhat by others' comments on the historical accuracy.The film chronicles the succession chaos following the death of Henry VIII. When the new king Henry's sickly teenage son Edward VI is dying a scheming minister John Dudley Duke of Northumberland concocts a scheme to ensure a Protestant succession by marrying off his own son Guildford to the young king's royal cousin Lady Jane Grey a devout Protestant. Lady Jane is merely a pawn forced by her parents to acquiesce to this arranged marriage and claim to the throne. Although at first she detests her new husband as time passes the couple fall passionately in love. However all is not well. Henry VIII's daughter Mary claims the crown for herself and must therefore eliminate the young usurper resulting in the execution of both Jane and Guildford.This is an interesting tale of Tudor court intrigue with the period costumes castles and scenes all beautifully done.Helena Bonham Carter a very young actress herself brings a sympathetic portrayal of the 15 year old bookish devout Lady Jane coerced by her parents into an unwanted marriage. Also this young queen's willingness to sacrifice her life rather than renounce her faith if this is indeed historical serves as an inspiration for us all. Patrick Stewart is particularly forceful as always in his role as Jane's domineering father Henry Grey who eventually springs to his daughter's defense by leading a rebellion on her behalf.My problem lies mainly with the historical accuracy. If there is no evidence of true love existing between Jane and Guildford Dudley it isn't acceptable to simply concoct a sort of Romeo and Juliet type romance out of the story in order to keep audiences entertained. Perhaps a bit of dramatic license is tolerable with historical figures but not to this extent. I remember being quite touched by Jane's genuine friendship with her cousin the sickly young King Edward which is perhaps more historically based.Lady Jane's claim to the throne was indeed a weak one and the crown went to Henry VIII's closer kin his two daughters first Mary and then Elizabeth. Mary was his older Catholic daughter by his divorced first wife Katherine of Aragon. This tragic much maligned figure who came to be known as Bloody Mary was poorly treated by both her father and her husband Philip of Spain with whom she failed to produce an heir. Elizabeth Henry's younger Protestant daughter and offspring of his second wife Anne Boleyn enjoyed a long reign as Elizabeth I. Lady Jane Grey's story is indeed a tragic one but she was merely Henry VIII's great niece a much more distant relative than his daughters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Having not read Sue Monk Kidd's novel I was expecting a sappy soulless chick flick that would have me rolling my eyes for a couple of hours. Instead director Gina PrinceBythewood Love  Basketball delivers a very engaging film with a message and some very strong performances.Dakota Fanning plays Lily who accidentally killed her mother at four and has since lived with her white trash redneck despicable father Paul Bettany. Lily and her nanny Rosaleen Jennifer Hudson runoff to some small town dot on a map thanks to a clue Lily's mom left on one of her few remaining personal items. They arrive at the homebusiness of August June and May Boatright Queen Latifah Alicia Keys and Sopie Okonedo who harvest and bottle the best honey in town. What follows is a smrgsbord of odd family life that slowly gives hope to young Lily.Based in 1964 the film dips its toe into the Civil Rights Act and the ongoing racism of the south but focuses more on the strength of love and family ... even in a Pepto Bismol home! The performances are all very strong but three standouts are Dakota Fanning Paul Bettany and Sophie Okonedo.Ms. Fanning is now 14 years old and she delivers a remarkable performance ... and what feels like the first where her screaming skills aren't overused War of the Worlds Man on Fire. She strikes me as a young Jodie Foster ... one who has just transitioned from child actor to real actress. I can't wait to see where her career takes her. Mr. Bettany is such a shock here as he typically plays a well dressed underspoken Brit which is what he is in real life!. As a southern redneck whose bitterness rages against the world he not only pulls it off but manages to make grits seem even worse than I previously thought. Ms. Okonedo so amazing in Hotel Rwanda pulls off the always difficult task of making a special adult seem very real and vital. A most touching performance from a top notch talent.This is a good story with strong performances though to take the next step as a film it needed to dig a little deeper into its wide range of characters and settings. Still definitely worth seeing.".

And what a career it had been for this child actress now an adolescent to have grown from scream queen no thanks to her stint under Spielberg's War of the Worlds to one controversial role in Hounddogs which I doubt would make it to our shores here.Based on a novel by Sue Monk Kidd and directed by Gina PrinceBythewood The Secret Life of Bees is one powerful drama above love and the looking for love as well as running along the theme of forgiveness and reconciliation. It's easy to dismiss this as a chick flick because of its predominantly female cast but that would be a mistake to make in making it an excuse to miss this film altogether. For all its worth it's chock full of extremely well delivered performances from veterans such as Fanning herself together with Queen Latifah Jennifer Hudson proving that she's no flash in the pan Sophie Okonedo Paul Bettany and even Alicia Keys!Set in the time of Summer in 1964 Southern USA where the Civil Rights Act was just signed and in effect the sentiments amongst the racist bigots still run high in a charged environment still hanging onto their old segregated ways. Fanning's Lily Owens carries the weight of her guilt buried deep in her subconscious from a tragic event that happened when she was four and ten years later after receiving the last straw of punishment from her abusive dad Bettany runs away with her caretaker Rosaleen Hudson.As if led by an invisible hand they soon find themselves under the extreme goodwill of the Boatwright sisters who earn a living through the cultivation of bees for honey and a series of incidents that bring about some tying of loose ends and the discovery that these strangers do tie back to Lily's own quest to finding out the truth about her mom to debunk the lies as told by her father. And of course this allows opportunity for some serious girl power bonding between the characters as they find that they have a lot more in common as well as the sharing and spreading of love through their ranks.The trump card that this movie has is the excellent performances by the ensemble cast. Fanning leads the pack and gives a wonderful moving performance as the gangling Lily who thinks that she's quite a jinx with plenty of bad karma to go around bringing about unfortunate happenings to her hosts which provide the dramatic twists and turns to what would otherwise be a flat movie. Jennifer Hudson had much to do in the first act though her character got quite muted by the time the trio of the Boatwright sisters August Latifah June Keys and Okonedo May come along. Queen Latifah brings about some serious gravitas in her role as the eldest with the largest heart and you cannot deny her chemistry with Fanning. Keys on the other hand plays the sister the exact opposite of August being aloof and starting off with intense suspicion as to the intent of their guests. And Okonedo's role could probably be the most unorthodox of the lot a fragile soul who has her own wailing wall to deal with the harsh realities of life.The Secret Life of Bees is well worth the admission ticket and you'll be hard pressed not to be touched by the film or moved by the themes it explores especially when the third act comes by leading to quite a number of powerful revelations and a solid conclusion. Set against its intended backdrop it's a reminder of tolerance which the world lacks these days and of course it's not always hammering in such heavy themes as it has its fair share of romance as well and for what it's worth Fanning has her first onscreen romance in this movie and if I'm right has her first onscreen kiss as well.You might be surprised when I say this but this film has won me over enough for it to be considered as a contender when I shortlist my list of ten top films of the year. Definitely recommended!".

	schema:headline " Solid film...";
	schema:reviewBody "I caught an exclusive screening of this film a week back and I must say it might be the best film featuring a mostly black cast since Antwone Fisher. The story centers around Lily Dakota Fanning a poor lonely little girl in the deep south who deals with a tragic past and a miserable cruel father Paul Bettany. Her life revolves around dreams of being every bit like her deceased mother and her relationship with her caregiver Rosaleen Jennifer Hudson.In the midst of the civil rights movement Rosaleen finds herself in some trouble with the locals inspiring Lily to flee with her to a South Carolina town that she believes holds the secret to her mother's past. In this town they find refuge with the Boatwright sisters Queen Latifah Alicia Keys and Sophie Okonedo who take them in on the strength of a story concocted by Lily. Through their cultured world filled with beekeeping a lucrative honey business religious beliefs and love Lily finds the security she has longed for and finds the answers to questions that haunted her for years.The director PrinceBrythewood did a great job at making us care about the characters even the miserable father played excellently by Paul Bettany. Alicia Keys shows that some RB singers can actually perform well in a movie playing the snooty June Boatwright. However the best performances has to be between Fanning and Okonedo who played the gentle simple minded manic depressive May Boatwright. If Okonedo reminded me less of Thandie Newton's character in Beloved I would've predicted an Oscar nomination depending on this year's competition. Maybe there's one in store for Bettany? Its all left to be seen.The film has its flaws. It dragged for a good portion of the first thirty minutes as we watch Lily and Rosaleen mill about doing mundane things in their pitiful lives. But then it really picks up when they meet the Boatwright sisters. The characters were balancing on a thin line between empathetic and sympathetic. You never want to be in the latter. And the filmmakers couldn't resist being a bit schmaltzy on occasion making most of it play like a good after school special with nothing beyond two dimensionality. And my biggest problem with the film... anticlimatic.Overall its a solid film and definitely worth the time in seeing.".

If the academy doesn't recognize some folks from this film they'd be remiss. I smell Oscar all over this film. Queen Latifah was wonderful as usual. Sophie Okonedo played an emotionally damaged woman with perfect pitch and demeanor. Paul Bettany's performance of the alternately hurt and hurtful father was a challenge. You needed to both hate him and sympathize with him for the role to be effective and I thought he pulled this off well.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is wonderful exhilarating joyful. The cast are all spectacularly talented and this film is another of those 'secret classics' which don't get the Oscars but actually deserve them. Gina PrinceBythewood the woman director has made an intensely sensitive film about women and it ain't no chick flic it is serious stuff. I was knocked out by the sheer talent of the actresses. An eye opener to me was the incredible Queen Latifah. Apparently she is some kind of 'hip hop queen' but I wouldn't know about that preferring Bach myself. She also 'raps' and I am one of those people who does not like or understand what they call 'rapping' at all so I am glad she spared us that in the film. I notice from her bio that she was a basketball star in high school. Now that I can well believe as she has the same 'body confidence' that another basketball player Barack Obama has. The director made a feature film about basketball earlier so maybe that is how she and Miss Hip Hop the Rapper came together. But this woman Queen Latifah is a major example of Something Else. She has superstar quality. Really I wanted to just rush up and hug her that is how wonderful I think she was. However the finest job of acting in this film full of genius is to my mind undoubtedly that of Sophie Okonedo who plays the character May Boatwright whose older sister and protector is Queen Latifah. She portrays a girl so tormented by 'not being quite right in the head' and so oversensitive that she bursts into tears at the slightest thing that it is hard to believe she is acting. It is a poignant performance expressing to perfection the desperation of such a person who knows there is something wrong with her but can do nothing about it. The third sister is played by Alicia Keys in real life a talented musician as well and she portrays an overintense hardasnails young woman terrified of marital commitment. Into this family comes the now teenaged Dakota Fanning 'running away from home' as it were. She is making some progress with her speaking. Instead of 80 percent of her words being mumbled it is now down to about 20 percent. If she could ever master speech so that everything she said was comprehensible and audible she could become a major actress as her acting abilities are coming along nicely and she effortlessly dominates scenes as long as Queen Latifah is not around who has a greater command of the camera. I must say however that Dakota Fanning looked very tired to me and maybe she ought to take a few months off as she could burn out if she doesn't watch it having worked nonstop practically since she was in the womb I'm amazed she didn't star in something as a foetus. As for the story it is very moving and emotional a study in human conflicts traumas and feelings. This is the kind of film that women make whereas men prefer making films where everybody gets killed. There's a gender lesson there somewhere! In this film not even hope gets killed. So that means there is still hope. Jennifer Hudson gives wonderful support as the character Rosaleen who accompanies Dakota Fanning as she flees from her father to take refuge with these women who had once known her dead mother. This is a happysad story that tears and warms the heart at the same time. Any woman would love it and even some men might like it in between all the crime movies and battle scenes which they normally watch where the quality is so often judged quantitatively i.e. by the body count or by the sizes of the explosions. Here the only quantities involved are the degrees of emotion which are in the upper nineties at least.".

The film takes place in 1964 in the southern US during the birth of the civil rights movement.Lily is haunted by the fact that she accidentally shot her mother when playing with a pistol as a toddler. She also develops a strange affinity for bees which is bewildering to her. Lily's violent father is abusive towards her. The Owen's black housekeeper Rosaleen is a mother figure and confidante to Lily.One day Lily goes to town with Rosaleen when Rosaleen plans on registering to vote. Racist white men confront them taunting Rosaleen. When Rosaleen refuses to tolerate their behavior the men give her a vicious beating. The police soon intervene. Rosaleen is arrested and held in custody at the medical ward of the local jail.Outraged at what happened to Rosaleen Lily goes to the jail and frees Rosaleen before the guards find out. Lily and Rosaleen then hit the road leaving Lily's brutal father far behind. The two come upon a store in a small town which stocks jars of honey. Intrigued with the unusual labeling on the honey jars Lily asks the clerk where the honey comes from. She's told that the Boatwright sisters make the honey. Lily then asks the clerk where they can find the Boatwright sisters. And she's told that they reside in a huge 'bright pink' house a 'ways up the road'. So Lily feels strangely compelled to find the Boatwrights for reasons that she doesn't quite understand. After traveling a long way Lily and Rosaleen spot a bright pink house in a remote area. Tired hungry and needing shelter they knock on the door of this house. The three women who answer introduce themselves as the Boatwright sisters named May June and August.At first the Boatwrights are reluctant to take in Lily and Rosaleen. They relent when they realize that the two have no where else to turn. August the eldest sister lets Lily become their beekeeping apprentice. Rosaleen is allowed to stay on as the Boatwright's housekeeper. While living with the Boatwrights Lily unravels the mysteries of her dead mother. Much to her astonishment Lily discovers how the Boatwrights are deeply involved in her mother's past.Above all this film celebrates love and its power to transform human lives in amazing ways. The brilliant performances by the female leads make this movie the gem that it truly is. Films with strong positive women in leading roles are still not as common as they should be. The Secret Life Of Bees is a powerful film that's heartrending uplifting and a definite mustsee.".

I was especially blown away by one performance in particular and that was the performance of Sophie Okenedo May Boatwrightshe is just a power house actress! I am a fellow southerner Alabama so this movie really was relatable for me. All three of the Boatwright sisters held a special southern quality that as a black female I grew up around. August Queen Latifah had the strength maturity business sense kindness  southern hospitality June Alicia Keyes had the proud nononsense attitude and May Sophie Okenedo had the homeskills innocence gentleness along with wisdom beyond her years which was so endearing which could also be said of June because she possessed what we call mother wit. They all three were refined and cultured. In my small town quite a few black people's homes had a piano or some type of musical instrument whether you were rich middleclass or poor or people in your family had some sort of musical or singing ability and this storyline was no exception. Dakota Fanning's character Lily and Jennifer Hudson's character Rosaleen quickly soaked this in like a sponge because as they both admitted they had never met negro women who were so cultured ended up rubbing a little off on Jennifer Hudson. And let's not forget the men in this moviethey were terrific also! Thanks to Jada PinkettSmith for bringing this story to the big screen! I encourage everyone to go out and see this movie and like me you will shed a tear or two and I am usually not an emotional personbut if you don't then you need to check the batteries in your tear ducts because they may be expired.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was disappointing. I had just finished reading the book which was excellent! when I watched the movie so I had very high hopes and expectations. Unfortunately the movie was just not true enough to the spirit of the book to do it justice. First there was not enough time spent on character development to make you really care about Lily's wellbeing or the tension between Lily  June or to truly despise T Ray and his evilness. August is not portrayed as being as wise as she seems to be in the book and I don't think that it was from a lack of acting ability by Queen Latifah. I understand that Hollywood sometimes feels it has to cut out or combine characters from a book to make a movie work but by minimizing the role of the Daughters in the movie and their impact on Lily we lost a large portion of the idea of sisterhood and family not only applying to blood relatives. Other things from the book were included without seeming necessary. Why bother mentioning Jack Palance and the colored woman who are expected in town? That information ultimately has no bearing in the scene where Zack is arrested although it is the motivation for the white men and black boys being in town outside the theater in the book. The final scene where Lily asks her father about her mother is also disappointing and has been Hollywoodized. In the book Lily did not ask if her mother had come back for hershe already knows that her mother was coming back for her the day that her mother died. What Lily asks T Ray is if she was actually the one who killed her mother since she has always been unsure whether or not T Ray was telling her the truth. It may seem like a minor difference but Lily has spent 10 years searching for the truth and questioning whether she is to blame for her mother's deathnot wondering if her mother loved her enough to come back for her. As a last note I will just say that if you enjoyed the movie please read the bookit is SO much better!".

Lily runs away from her abusive father T. Ray Paul Bettany taking with her their housekeeper Rosaleen Daise Jennifer Hudson. They find solace in the PeptoBismolhued home of the Boatwright sisters August Queen Latifah June Alicia Keys and May Sophie Okonedo.Fanning is now tall and gangly but is still riveting on screen with her amazingly controlled emotional range she seems to be one of those actors who can do no wrong. Bettany is a surprise playing a vicious redneck that can still manage to elicit some twisted form of pity from the audience for his lot in life. I was hoping his story could have been fleshed out further. Latifah has come a long way from comedy and veritably anchors her scenes while Keys transitions wonderfully from musician to movie star playing the beautiful but haughty June. Okonedo played the retarded twin May with great sensitivity and depth.A Hallmark sort of movie with a clear target market The Secret Life of Bees is a warm and toasty pause from the usual Hollywood fare.

Okonedo played the retarded twin May with great sensitivity and depth.A Hallmark sort of movie with a clear target market The Secret Life of Bees is a warm and toasty pause from the usual Hollywood fare. Recommended viewing with galpals when PMSing.";

Her smart remarks got a few giggles but her acting was very weak. Lily of cousre did well in her parts. you sure can tell real actors from people who are famous and just want a role in the movie. Queen seemed to try and act older due to the womens age of course but all she did was talk slow like she was trying to hard.Her words of wisdom was so slow and apart in the lines that you knew were she was going with it before she finished. This movie should have been a Sunday night movie are something on PBS. The plot was to far apart to really make someone want to get into this movie. I found myself looking and waiting to see if it was going to get better and it never did. This movie is like looking at a guy or gal and thinking wow their nice looking have a good job and appears to be so kind. But when you finally find the nerve to go up to them... their breath stinks. It kinda throws you off guard at first so you try and over look it but the more you turn your head to look the other way...the more they turn towards you even closer...yeah thats how the movie is.

I was especially impressed with Dakota Fanning's continued development as an actress. But Jennifer Hudson and Sophie Okonedo were incandescent. Alicia Keys was a revelation in this film though it took me a little while to warm up to her. And Queen Latifah...well this lady just seems to center everything.Movies to me are sometimes lifechanging events. The ones that resonate the best are the ones that effectively give lessons about life.I guess if I mention that my all time favorite film is A River Runs Through It it might begin to explain why I instantly fell in love with this film. It has something profound to teach. And it does it with unforgettable imagery. Only time will tell if this film will stay with me like River did but I suspect it will be a film I think about for quite some time.I have only watched the director's cut so my comments are based on that though I will go back and watch the theatrical version.This film truly is a gift.".

As said it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place. We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night and how they try to forge a bond even though they do not know one another. We see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment. There's song witty dialog poignant moments blending and comparison of new ways and tradition. Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story yet it is still a delight to watch.

Fardeen Khan does a great job and Isha Deol simply shines in this down to earth portrait of a middle class Indian girl. Her being gorgeous doesn't exactly hurt the movie either. Satish Shah and Kiran Kher play the grumpy tired yet in love couple with perfection. The movie is funny and provides some food for thought. I would recommend this to someone with patience and not looking for an item number.".

Fardeen Khan does a great job and Isha Deol simply shines in this down to earth portrait of a middle class Indian girl. Her being gorgeous doesn't exactly hurt the movie either. Satish Shah and Kiran Kher play the grumpy tired yet in love couple with perfection. The movie is funny and provides some food for thought. I would recommend this to someone with patience and not looking for an item number.";

Plus there was no addition to the main track.Raj Zutshi  ???? Hardly remember anything about it. Should have just edited out.Satish Shah  Kiron Kher Very much believable  provide screen relief. Folks get ready we are all going to look like them in a few years.The songs are good carrying the usual Gulzar touch but strangely not popular as they ought to be. And the climax.... was it warranted? Does it have to be OTT  Bollywoodish every time? Can't it just be a silent realisation? Finally about the director Bosky Gulzar  just like others I have seen her work with microscopic eye. Being Gulzar's daughter is a daunting task indeed. I was expecting her to go onenotch up postFilhaal but now I am confused. Regardless she handled the delicate subject very sensitively and should be applauded for that. Lets see what Dus Kahaniyaan has in store.Bottomline She sure has talent.PS Both Meghana and Vishal Bharadwaj draw creative input from Gulzar  strange!".

And what price did he end up paying for his total commitment? Haunted by his own demons the we experiences on close hand how a womanizer desperately searches to find love again a task only doable if he can fight his own past and redeem himself. After saving hundreds  maybe even thousands  he is challenged once more this time to save his newfound love from the death penalty issued by the regime. Another impossible task and a desperate chase against time. Based on a true story about a man that did what all of us only dreams of.";

It moves at a very fast pace for its short 79 minutes has lots of good action and a good sense of humor. What more could you ask for in an action movie. I don't know about youbut thats all I ask for in a action movie. Its not art and its not supposed to be. 3 out of 4 stars.";

	schema:reviewBody "This cheesy 80's classic with it's awful continuity dreadful script half baked story and wooden acting still rates as one of my favourite films of its kind.The plot is loosely based around Dolph Lundgren's character Kenner setting out for revenge on the Yakuza Oyabun Yoshida who killed his parents when he was a child. Years later Kenner is an LA cop and crosses paths once more with Yoshida when he comes to the USA to set up a drugs syndicate.As you'd expect you get to watch Dolph and his side kick played by Brandon Lee kicking ass and shooting holes in everything that moves. There are a bevy of good looking half naked women on display the most delicious of which is a young Tia Carrere.My personal favourite in all the filming errors has to be when Kenner sustains a gunshot wound and immediately clasps his shoulder in pain followed by the words ...Its OK it went straight through. A moment later the camera views him from the rear and there is no exit wound ! Even better though a few moments later the camera refocuses on Kenners naked chest and the bullet wound is no where near his shoulder its actually in the left lung  heart region ! I don't think he would be in any state to carry on fighting with that injury !!!Because Showdown in little Tokyo refuses to take itself seriously much in the same mould as John Carpenters Big trouble in Little china did all you have to do is relax and enjoy the total self indulgence that this film allows you ! Great fun. 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Showdown In Little Tokyo might be the campiest most hilarious classic eightiesearly nineties buddy cop film I've ever seen. I mean in all reality the movie is god awful!! The story is weak the acting is campy even the action scenes are done in such a cheap manner and some of the lines in the film are just downright laughable. So why is this one of the best movies I've seen in weeks?? For me it became an instant eightiesearly nineties classic. Some of the greatest most memorable oneliners and scenes an absolutely stoned faced and at the same time hilarious Dolph Lundgren blatant nudity and bad language and violence it's a rip roaring good time and I mean it!! Would be action superstar Dolph Lundgren plays Sgt. Chris Kenner. I say would be because despite his attempts and his typical action oriented look he never really struck big screen gold. Despite some high profile roles as Rocky's brutal Russian adversary in Rocky IV and Marvel's The Punisher he never really caught on but you'd never know it from this role because he is amazing. Yes the role is campy don't get me wrong there is a million things wrong with this role but Kenner is a stone faced samurai out for vengeance against the man who killed his parents and Lundgren is terrific. The man fills a screen like Schwarzeneggar and is just as tough. He tips over cars blasts away with machine guns and saves the girl all in one swoop. Brandon Lee is Lundgren's sidekick Johnny Murata. I say sidekick and not partner because Lee is really there strictly to support idolize and play funny guy to Dolph Lundgren. I liked Lee's character alright but he just wasn't there much didn't do a whole lot and even what was supposed to funny wise cracks weren't really. Although he does deliver the classic You have the right to remain dead line which still cracks me up. Him and Lundgren have decent chemistry and as some reviewers have pointed out a rather odd...perhaps slightly ambiguous relationship. Some remarks Lee make do indeed hint that perhaps Lee's character might like Kenner a little too much but I think the writers were just trying to be funny and establish a bond between them. CaryHiroyuki Tagawa is a terrific bad guy as he plays evil Japanese drug dealer Yoshida. This guy has no morals at all and hacks and chops his way through anyone. I remember him best as the bad guy TsangTsung in Mortal Kombat but he is even more evil in this. A young and slightly preWayne's World Tia Carrere plays Kenner's love interest Minako who he saves from the clutches of the bad guys. She doesn't get many lines and she is more or less there to be eye candy and strip naked sorry boys it's a body double when necessary but her and Lundgren actually fit together pretty well.Some might think in reading this review that I am being completely sarcastic and hated this film but that simply is not the case. I really truly enjoyed watching this but I guess I just can't explain why exactly?? Everything is in place for this to be a real crappy but somehow it makes you love every minute of it. The film is really short and the story is so simplistic that any action that does happen is just gratuitous violence and blowing things up. But hey guys or fans of action will just love the campy one liners and the hilarious action scenes. I think this is an absolute must see and for the few Dolph Lundgren fans out there this is the reason why he should be a star!! It's only too bad there was no sequel!! 910".

	onyx:emotionText "Showdown In Little Tokyo might be the campiest most hilarious classic eightiesearly nineties buddy cop film I've ever seen. I mean in all reality the movie is god awful!! The story is weak the acting is campy even the action scenes are done in such a cheap manner and some of the lines in the film are just downright laughable. So why is this one of the best movies I've seen in weeks?? For me it became an instant eightiesearly nineties classic. Some of the greatest most memorable oneliners and scenes an absolutely stoned faced and at the same time hilarious Dolph Lundgren blatant nudity and bad language and violence it's a rip roaring good time and I mean it!! Would be action superstar Dolph Lundgren plays Sgt. Chris Kenner. I say would be because despite his attempts and his typical action oriented look he never really struck big screen gold. Despite some high profile roles as Rocky's brutal Russian adversary in Rocky IV and Marvel's The Punisher he never really caught on but you'd never know it from this role because he is amazing. Yes the role is campy don't get me wrong there is a million things wrong with this role but Kenner is a stone faced samurai out for vengeance against the man who killed his parents and Lundgren is terrific. The man fills a screen like Schwarzeneggar and is just as tough. He tips over cars blasts away with machine guns and saves the girl all in one swoop. Brandon Lee is Lundgren's sidekick Johnny Murata. I say sidekick and not partner because Lee is really there strictly to support idolize and play funny guy to Dolph Lundgren. I liked Lee's character alright but he just wasn't there much didn't do a whole lot and even what was supposed to funny wise cracks weren't really. Although he does deliver the classic You have the right to remain dead line which still cracks me up. Him and Lundgren have decent chemistry and as some reviewers have pointed out a rather odd...perhaps slightly ambiguous relationship.

	schema:reviewBody "What a dreadful film! Yet I'm eternally grateful to my friend for suggesting it  I discovered Dolph!  This film is a must for all of Dolph's fans this is why...Surely the man is completely unbelievable!  I mean is he physical perfection incarnate or what?  He is an unending string of superlatives! He is epic.  He is mythical.  If I didn't refrain myself I would say that he is godlike  a great immortal Norse god champion of champions hero among heroes coming down from the eternal halls of Odin to grace mortals with his everlasting countenance!In any other context some aspects of the film's main character would have irritated me no end Come on!  Jumping over a car in motion beating up four guys while holding a tea cup smashing a door in one blow and from behind pulling out the villain onehanded jumping down a onestoryheight carrying Tia Carrere lifting a car as I lift my bed mattress physically freeing himself from a crumpled car breaking free by ripping through handcuffs etc.  In any other context I would have either laughed myself silly or simply switched off...  But I must admit that in this case I was completely mesmerized by Dolph's presence!  I mean all those feats of physical prowess are in no way less believable than Dolph's own physique! Should I then stop believing my own eyes?There are lots of guys out there with buffed bodies from trackandfield athletes to bodybuilders  and Hollywood has more than its fair share of them.  But what I realized on Sunday night is that by his absolute physical perfection Dolph is an order of magnitude above and beyond them all!  He is in a class of his own by miles and all the Apollos and Adonises of this world are flatly put to shame by the superiority of his presence!  Dolph's physique is no less than a symphonic hymn of titanic proportions where the purity and strength of each line echoes and announces the purity and strength of all the others in a manner as ineluctable as it is complete. The admirable achievement of each of the partseach supple tendon each contracting muscle fibre each throbbing vein the movement of each joint the intricacy of each cranny the smooth flow of each parcel of skin the precise curve of each feature whether small or overwhelmingthe unparalleled perfection of every detail tells of the greater perfection of the ultimate masterpiece which is Dolph's sublime body.The soft golden hair the deep and bright smiling eyes under the intelligent arc of the brows the delicate yet strong line of the nose the prominent and manly cheek bones the laserchiselled jaw the sweet curve of the chin the mesmerizing pair of full sensuous lips revealing a heartmeltingly disarming and immaculate smile... everything precisely brought together to compose the most supremely handsome face I've ever seen! And as Dolph speaks the unending sexiness of the voice its assertive manly bass combined with a bright resonant tone and a dash of youthful cockiness.And I haven't even reached the architectural fortress below... The marble of his neck and deltoidsartfully crafted solid buttresses bracing a tower of strengthoverlooking the pair of spotless shields which span the majestic pectoral expanse from strapping shoulder to strapping shoulder.  And to complete this mighty formation just picture towards the beginning of the film the interrogation scene when Dolph first sheds off the leather jacket casually revealing to us the full glory of his steel canons long and hard sinewy strong and loaded with power a breathtaking display of what must count as the most magnificent pair of arms and forearms ever to grace the world of men!And when in the night scene Dolph girds his finely sculpted loins.  What to say of the black tightlystretched lycra shorts?  Can they but reveal the most sensual curves of those firm and mighty buttocks?  Can they but strain as they suggest a package nothing short of superlative in its proportions?  It is now fairly clear to me that Brandon's rather lame comment about Dolph's Manhood owes absolutely nothing to fiction!  In any case it seems that in Dolph's presence fiction couldn't keep up with reality and was left well behind out of breath and exhausted!And when Dolph prepares to fight the intruders The closeup on the unassailable wall of abs plated with the warm bronze of his smooth flawless skin.  And as he moves or rather glides catlike through the room marvel at the supple dance of the Herculean pairs of his massive thighs and perfectly moulded calves the knees bending and stretching the ankles bouncing...  Yet not even Dolph's absolute poise and ease of movement can hide the geological forces here at play as each contraction of the pulsating quads matches each ripple of the abdominal armour in wave upon wave of earthshattering might.  Such stature and elegance at once the heavenly marriage of pure Grace with unbridled Power!I fall disappointingly short of the full truth if I say that in all Dolph achieves the absolute balance of disarming good looks and mindboggling handsomness entrancing charisma unearthly grace and stealth colossal size and perfect symmetry supreme muscletone unbounded energy and overwhelming strength.In view of the rather plain script of Showdown it's rather difficult for me to judge of Dolph's intrinsic talent as an actor!  But if I cannot form an opinion on Dolph's acting skills there remains however an unavoidable evidence  here Dolph's presence and charisma are absolutely completely and totally overwhelming.  And I think this charisma reaches to something deeper than purely his massive build.  There is some kind of almost animal magnetism to Dolph and also a sense of total control and virility combined with a Nordic cool as if to say  Yeah I am conscious of the extent of my utter superiority.  So what?  There's nothing I or even less you can do about it!  Just try to get over it...".

Dolph plays Detective Kenner a very angry cop who has a tendency to beat up any yakuza in sight coincidentally alienating all of his partners until his forced to pair up with Johnny Murata the late great Brandon Lee and the two go around kicking yakuzaarse together. The yakuza are running drugs and the headhoncho Yoshida CaryHiroyuki Tagawa just happened to be the man who murdered Kenner's parents. So maybe the plot is weak and the acting not much better but who cares when Dolph and Brandon are kicking arse and leaving a high body count behind them? Good action scenes and some great oneliners from Brandon Lee granted none of them are as classic as Arnie's remember when I said I'd kill you last? I lied! from 'Commando'. At less than 80 minutes it doesn't get boring and provides an effective way of killing some time.Of course its only for true action fans and if you don't like Dolph Lundgren you are not a true action fan.710".

At less than 80 minutes it doesn't get boring and provides an effective way of killing some time.Of course its only for true action fans and if you don't like Dolph Lundgren you are not a true action fan.710";

Showdown in Little Tokyo tells the story of two cops Lee and Lundgren who want to catch one violent yakuza gang that is selling drugs and doing other criminal activities in USA. Also the leader of that gang has done something bad to Lundgren in the past so Dolph has also some personal things to settle with the yakuza leader..What follows is nonstop action stupid dialogue violent fight scenes and firepower. In other words a perfect action turkey!This film is so bad it is great! The action never stops and there is all the time something going on. Also the film is very short uncut version runs only little over 75 minutes in Pal format! The screenplay is so ridiculous and tells once again that the foreigners are bad and Americans are good and that's it. But since the action is so over the top and the tune of the film is what it is I enjoyed watching this in the braindead fashion and without thinking anything because the film offers nothing to think about. Technically this is also very non professional looking and Maltin sums this up pretty effectively! The directing editing and other important elements are pretty soso. I think this had to be made in horrible rush and in order to cash in some bucks with two action stars of that time. Lundgren has acted also in Punisher a very noteworthy comic book adaptation directed by Mark Goldblatt the editor of several legendary action films. Both Punisher and Showdown in Little Tokyo are very violent but Punisher is so much better as a film and it can be taken seriously too. Brandon Lee is familiar name for all Bruce Lee fanatics so there is no question that he has also done much more noteworthy performances than this.Showdown in Little Tokyo is for action films what The Mutilator is for slasher films and what Beast in Heat is for exploitation films A very bad film but so enjoyable due to its turkey merits! But to appreciate these one has to be pretty wideminded cinema lover so I think that most will consider Showdown only stupid and unwatchable trash. But from me this gets 510 due to its stupidity and over the top action.".

Bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it.  The plot and I use that term loosely involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with the general whose daughter is missing at a church to kill a vampire who very conveniently happens to be traveling with the father and daughter.  I must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor.  The film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested.  Anyone older beware.".

	onyx:emotionText "In this strangelylackadaisical apocalypse the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires but no one seems to be too worried about it in this GradeZ film which bares less resemblance to Sheridan Le Fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna recipe.   Bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it.  The plot and I use that term loosely involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with the general whose daughter is missing at a church to kill a vampire who very conveniently happens to be traveling with the father and daughter.  I must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor.  The film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested.  Anyone older beware.";

Aside from the lack of plot the acting was atrocious the special effects were not so special and the writing was absolutely horrible.  The movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny.  You can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue.  I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about.  It's now a running joke among my friends and I. 1 out of 10.".

I don't think I can remember a movie being THIS bad in a long time and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies!!  Even that couldn't save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand or lay in this case in front of a camera.I was pretty much let down by the overall zombie effect. Since apparently in this movie zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there and casually talking about it at a gas station one with an inhouse windshield repair but no interior bathroom the zombiemovie genre isn't even a factor until the end. Even then a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girl's clothes doesn't really constitute being a zombie movie.On to the vampires Apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female which is OK by me. I'm not sure how vampires are out in the daylight or the whyhow of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road still holding his gun with a stake through his heart just waiting for the Queen of the Vampires to flick it all the way through. The last segment in the old nunnery made no sense and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire Do you think we did the right thing? by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie that about put it over the top.The acting and special effects were at an alltime low also. You could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the General. Speaking of the General where did they find THIS Kenny Rogers lookalike anyways? No idea what he was the General of aside of generally confusing and misplaced.All in all watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste 3. Just my 0.02.".

And yet this film doesn't even offer and attempt at humor and that is one of the movies grand achievements it becomes a comedy without even trying to amuse.Throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like Santa Claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground. This made me fail to believe the films title if this was vampires vs zombies why were vampires and zombies not fighting? Oh well whatever besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title. Such as this one there has been a virus sweeping through America creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist. However there are only four zombies in the entire film. Another problem is besides one shop the entire set is deserted. Surely you'd see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit? It honestly seemed like they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they didn't have a high enough budget to film in a wider location. It was that or the director didn't want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood. He was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters.Seemingly the director had so much fun doing this that he didn't have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor. And so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous whilst I assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels editing isn't a hard job anyway right? The only reason this movie found it's way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with Freddy vs Jason strange how these things happen isn't it? And the only way we made it though the night was by strapping gas masks on and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess.Oh yes we did laugh at the end but I'm sure one does that a lot when he has lost his sanity...................".

	schema:reviewBody "First off I must stress how rare it is that I take the time to comment on a movie that I have seen it takes a very special case for me to take the time and write about how I felt about a film. That said of the hundreds of movies I have watched I have seen some of the most brilliant Shawshank the scariest The Woman in Black the funniest Shark Attack III Megaladon and now the worst Vampires vs. Zombies.The first thing that must be said is that this movie is not funny! For those that are looking for a light hearted movie that will just be fun or at the very least so bad that it's funny look elsewhere. It is true that a movie such as this is not trying to be subtle and brilliant with a title such as this you should know what you're getting into. That said there is no excuse for a movie to abandon any and every rule that governs the movie making world. This is not an argument between the traditional movie making process and newer and more artsy methods to creating a film this is an argument between bad directors and companies being held accountable for making terrible movies.This movie suffers from the over used saying I don't know where to start. Truly everything about this movie is broken. From the acting and to the editing there is no reason any movie should ever fail to deliver a cohesive series of events such as Vampires vs. Zombies. Some of the following problems are 1. Scene misfires It's clear that the director the camera crew and the actors were not on the same page. In one scene in particular the scene begins with the camera resting on the ground looking at the passenger side door of a car. You are expecting the person inside to get out but there is a and this is NO exaggeration 10 second at least delay between the camera comes on and the director says action to where anything happens on screen. The viewer is left staring at a car door for the entire time with no sound no movement just the stereotypical dead air that radio or TV commentators dread. Where was the editing? 2. Acting A forgivable offense in most cases you can't expect a movie like this to have Oscar winners after all but Vampires vs. Zombies takes bad acting to a whole other level. These actors were barely able to read their scripts obviously because anyone with any ability to read and to speak would have been able to pronounce the lines better than these fools. My only comparison for acting would have to be the opening scene from Resident Evil on Playstation. But that acting was even better.3 Story Wait what? Story? Again you can't expect this to be The Greatest Story Ever Told but is it too much to ask that we have some semblance of a narrative? Why the Vampires? Who are the characters? Who are the bad guys? Are there good guys? Why all the lesbians? But most importantly what's the deal with the zombies? If you have seen this movie then you will understand what I mean but to those who haven't I'll be plain there are no zombies in this movie aside from maybe five minutes of it. It was almost as if the director forgot about the name of the movie and was forced to throw some zombies in without explanation at the very end.There's so much more but I hope I've done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie.".

Hell where were the Vampires at all... you really couldn't call any of the girls vampires. Whatever. Don't ever rent or buy this movie. If you are REALLY curious... okay I'll understand. Seriously even lovers of BAD movies won't be able to stand this one. It should be number 1 on the bottom 100.";

While watching it I had to pause every few moments to keep my brain from exploding. The scenes did not at all move together and it was in no way comprehensible. It seemed that the best the director did was build up to something during every scene but that something was never there.While some people say for a bad movie that the best part is the end I would have to disagree for this one. I waited an entire 85 minutes for some sort of rejuvenation from this movie but was only greeted by a spinning book displaying the words THE END. The movie's acting was like something out of a terrible video game's voice acting and the plot I'm pretty sure didn't exist. I was glad to see that the creators could let themselves go so easily but this doesn't even go on the list of Bmovies.I suspect that there is a secret companion film to this abomination which consists of all the other scenes that would coupled with many of the scenes in this movie form a complete pornofilm. Have you actually seen a movie that made your head physically hurt? This one did.I'm sorry but don't ever EVER EVER watch Vampires vs. Zombies. Not even as a way to pass time or laugh at how bad it is. It's nearly impossible to get through.".

On top of that we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to tone it down or make it realistic but it ends up just boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about either. Also there's no clear antagonist and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. However I will say that for a film this low in production value the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere. I'm all for independent films but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience if any. worse than Scarecrow slayer.".

Movie had some decent gore surprisingly and the storyline was not as confusing as some say. I got the movie for the most part I expected MUCH worse. The best thing is that the zombies and vampires never really fight! Yeah for like one scene...maybe 2...but barely any fighting. The zombie's make up was also bad...but funny. Especially the opening scene. I love the opening scene. If you don't like that crap don't be watching. Worth a watch dudes if you hate it you should of known better than to rent it in the first place! P.S. Keep an eye out for the special thanks to Lloyd the man Kaufman. Also get the DVD so you can see the short film HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL. Quite an interesting short.".

Sound confusing? It's not as confusing as you might think since none of the characters make any sense to begin with. There's no plot no character development and random people show up speak a few lines and then disappear never to be heard from again. There are also zombies who are possibly the enemies of the vampires but there's also a dreamwithinadream kind of sequence in a mental hospital so maybe none of this actually happened and it's all the main character's hallucination. The upside? Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly. The special effects are simply mindboggling I particularly liked the incredibly slow awkward fight sequences. Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent which adds to the general level of hilarity. Well worth the price of rental. We laughed until we cried.".

Unfortunately it only succeeded in being a giant incompetent mess with no redeeming values. For starters your jaw will literally be on the floor looking at how cheap the production values are the zombies and vampires are not convincing at all visually consisting really of actors with bad fancydresslike makeup and very fake teeth. The special effects are very poorly proportioned and textured the movie is too darkly lit throughout and baconslicereditedlike movies even look better than the editing here. The dialogue sounds stilted and made up on the spot much of it doesn't even make sense there is such thing as proofreading you know. And that's when you could hear it over the audio which managed to be pedantic and muddied. As for the story as has been said by other commentators what story. The whole movie is virtually plotlessand replaced with a brimfull of jawdroppingly stupid logical lapses and what there is of a story is tedious and incredibly vague reading of a lot of random walking around and posturing that you don't engage at all with whatever conflict or atmosphere there is. As has also been said the title does not match at all with what goes on in the movie or shall we say vice versa any conflict is not between zombies and vampires and when there is any you've just lost interest to care. The characters are annoying stereotypes with no personality and the zombies and vampires are not interesting or threatening in the least bit. The performances are charismafree and consist of the actors sleepwalking through their roles in fact the zombies actually look as though sometimes that they're about to nod off on the spot. The interminable pacing lack of tension or thrills and the amateurish direction further add to the long list of what is wrong with Vampires vs. Zombies and overall it's an unwatchably awful movie and one to avoid. 010 Bethany Cox".

It even fails to fail at film making in a Way the Hercules in New York could be said to do. It's not the film I like the least but it is the very worst film I've ever seen.The acting is the first thing that strikes you. I've never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography. In fact I've plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this. It really is awful.Technically it's terrible. The camerawork is amateurish. The editing is nonsensical. I presume they couldn't afford proper sound equipment and this meant that every scene in a car and there's a lot of them has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods and there's a lot of them too is actually dubbed from a studio again lending more to the bad porn vibe.The plot is nonsensical as many have pointed out. I'll defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by Nosferatu this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythos.Speaking of vampire mythos the writer had evidently read Carmilla or at very least seen The Vampire Lovers. I'm not sure how I feel about this swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a Gothic novel I'm very fond of or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material. At very least 'the General' is an insult to Peter Cushing though.It gets two stars however merely because I can't bring myself to vote one star for a film that has or at least purports to have both vampires and zombies in it. Incidentally I watched Lifeforce another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it on the same day as this and despite being a rather flawed film itself really comes out a masterpiece compared to this.So in the end this is not a film so bad it's good or so bad it's in any way enjoyable even drunk. It's just a mess and worth noone's time watching.".

There's a dog for no reason and thin orange blood that turns the stomach. The General and his catchphrase of Shut the fk up! is the only redeeming feature.

The dead are returning to life but nobody seems too concerned. We have construction worker zombies soldier zombies and even St.Trinian schoolgirl zombies. Apparently Santa Claus is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire. Oh wait there are no vampires the girl is in a lunatic asylum and Carmilla is her nurse or is she? The zombies are back and Santa's mad. Lesbian sex I like vampires and I like zombies but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to get the juices flowing. When are we going to see vampires fight zombies? Is she a vampire or is she a lunatic? Or both? Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse? More cunnilingus you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here come the St.Trinian zombies. Chainsaw time!! More lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires. I guess the zombies won or did they? Plot? Who needs a plot when you've got lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies? And cunnilingus?".

	schema:reviewBody "If you want to see a delightful musical comedy and with Lilian Harvey at her best look no further than 1938's 'Capriccio.' Imagine a French costume picture reminiscent of a Mozart comic opera about a woman Harvey posing as a man to escape an arranged marriage causing amusing situations a la 'Viktor und Viktoria' while advised by her dead grandfather who also relates the story and this comes close to describing the film's crammed plot. Besides the operettalike score there's a bit of anachronistic jazz music that somehow works well to add more laughs to the confusion and commotion. Everything about this film including the humorous songs  dance numbers rival the best of any Hollywood equivalent of that era. We watched this yesterday and were swept away by its inventiveness. Paul Kemp who almost stole 'Amphitryon' from his costars is almost as good here. One of several memorable bits edited for maximum comic effect concerns an anxious mother's attempt to marry off her daughters. What's most interesting is that the director Karl Ritter was known for making mostly militarypropaganda films like 'Stukas' so how he made a musical comedy this entertaining is a mystery. A comprehensive description is presented on the website below where you can see a clip from this very good quality disc The film was hated by Hitler and Goebbels but the director was powerful and it was released to glowing reviews and an enthusiastic public. After a very short time in theatres it was pulled out of circulation. I can't find their reasons for disliking this film because it makes fun of the French but maybe not enough to suit their propaganda needs. Maybe they disliked the farcical jabs at the institutions of marriage and courts nuns and convent girls and almost everything else in society especially character actor Aribert Wscher's portrayal of a bloated boozing government official being duped by everyone. Or as my wife said it simply Hitler and Goebbels had no sense of humor. I suspect the main reason 'Capriccio' had a short theatrical run was to punish Harvey for her defiant activities a year earlier. According to Wikipedia As she was still in touch with her Jewish colleagues Harvey was placed under close observation by the Gestapo. Nevertheless she pushed the career of her protg director Paul Martin performing in his screwball comedy 'Glckskinder' 1936... In June 1937 Harvey had helped the choreographer Jens Keith prosecuted under Paragraph 175 for his homosexuality by posting bail for him. Released from custody Keith escaped to Paris this led to a stern interrogation by the Nazi authorities. In 1939 Harvey was forced to leave Germany herself leaving her realestate fortune which was confiscated. Anyway this film is one to watch over  over because you'll miss some of the verbal  visual jokes the first time and maybe second while you're laughing. You can order a good subtitled copy at rarefilmsandmore.com".

LAND has hand puppet dinosaurs that don't move and look silly PEOPLE has men in rubber suits as dinosaurs that look silly. Both films change the Burroughs stories probably for budget reasons but PEOPLE does something interesting  it combines the 2nd and 3rd book in Burroughs' series using Act 1 of PEOPLE and Act 23 of OUT OF TIME'S ABYSS. The Weiros from ABYSS have been changed into Nagaas  a volcano cult dressed in Japanese Armor. The Weiros were humanoids evolved from Pterodactyls  hard to do on a 1.98 budget. This way they could take the old prisoner from ABYSS and turn him into Doug McClure's character.PEOPLE is much better than LAND for a couple of reasons. LAND not only had crappy FX it looked like it was shot on an indoor stage! So even when there isn't some bad process shot of a hand puppet TRex growling the movie looks fake. PEOPLE was shot on location in Spain and has some nice big panoramic shots  one amazing shot of the team crossing the crest of a mountain looks like something out of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. The other reason why PEOPLE is better  cavegirls! If you read the books with Frazetta covers there were always halfnaked cavegirls. As an 11 yearold boy reading these was like discovering your Uncle's Playboy collection. Half naked girls! LAND has no cavegirls at all PEOPLE has the Ajor character from the novel in a laced leather outfit that fits the drive in AIP scenario to a T.I love the books and would love to do a modern adaptation with today's FX.Bill".

The other reason why PEOPLE is better  cavegirls! If you read the books with Frazetta covers there were always halfnaked cavegirls. As an 11 yearold boy reading these was like discovering your Uncle's Playboy collection. Half naked girls! LAND has no cavegirls at all PEOPLE has the Ajor character from the novel in a laced leather outfit that fits the drive in AIP scenario to a T.I love the books and would love to do a modern adaptation with today's FX.Bill";

	schema:reviewBody "I am a sucker for Lost World movies. This one was made as a sequel to the Land that Time Forgot. The movie picks up with an attempted rescue attempt of Tyler who was left stranded on the lost land of Caprona. But let's face it The People That Time Forgot is not a good movie. It has some potential but overall the movie drags. And for a lost world movie the landscape and creatures are boring.The first 15 minutes of the movie were great and I was hooked. The props and costumes evoke the period of post WWI. The miniature ship and float plane are particularly interesting models and interact well in their miniature settings. Our adventurers enter the lost world by flying the float plane over mountains after getting in as close to the south pole as possible in a steam ship. Just as in the movie Land Unknown 1957 the plane is damaged and forced to land by an attacking pteronodon. Our adventurers have arrived in the lost world! From this point however the movie drops way down in quality. The landscape is bleak and uninteresting. I wondered why this boring heath and volcanic rock area was chosen over a lush jungle like the first movie. Worse the dinosaurs are a step down in quality from Land the Time Forgot which is saying something. They don't have much to do besides provide a glimpse of a threat through the trees and roar ineffectually. They don't eat anyone. Only one creature a cave monster actually gets to attack our heroes. The 'people' of this land are a let down. One group is the very silly ever chasing and yelling at a distance cave men. They capture the adventurers but we never get a close look at them nor do we get a glimpse of their culture. The other 'people' of this world are the skull collecting samurai. Again we see very little of what might make them interesting. OK there are a few moments where the skull samurai get to pose and preen a bit while preparing to decapitate the women. But really why bother calling the the movie 'The People That Time Forgot' if you are not going anywhere with the people? The first movie gave us so much more in terms of cultural groups. The expedition characters are purely stock and no interesting chemistry or conflicts develop within the party as a result of their potentially awesome contact with a prehistoric world. The expedition consists of a female photographer whose father owns a newspaper and is putting up the cash for this trip Tyler's BFF who is determined to rescue him his trusty halfdrunk comic relief sidekick and a notconvincing scientist type. Along the way they enlist the aid of a beautiful and scantilyclad cave girl Dana Gillespie. She carries the film with her primordial sex appeal. There are way too many padded scenes of the group strolling around the trees and hills. The fight scenes don't work because they are poorly done and they have no real drama because nothing seems to be at stake besides immediate self defense. There is no interaction among characters except for stock exchanges of uninspired dialog. Overall the actors seems confused and bored while they meander from point A to point B. But there are a few good scenes in the film one of the best being the meeting and rescue of Tyler Doug McClure in a skull infested prison cell. By the end of the movie you realize why the filmmakers chose the location they did. A nearly unlimited number of explosions are set off at the climax of the film. That sequence ended up being kind of fun. But final scene of the film...awkward and lame.".

Having seen it again over 20 years later I do realise that it's a very flawed moviesequel but it's not without some value Many of the problems are to do with the slow first half . We the audience know that the travellers are going to be meeting giant rubber dinosaurs but these rubber puppets aren't used to their real potential and the only sequence I can recall from over 20 years ago was when the pterodactyl smashed into the plane . What probably makes the sequence stick out in my memory is that this is one of the few times that a dinosaur does anything really bad in the movie but I guess that's because this isn't really a monster movie at all The movie is far more similar to a half forgotten Hammer adventure film called THE LAST CONTINENT rather than a sequel to THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT  it's an adventure story featuring a lost kingdom and you can't help thinking that perhaps the story was once intended to be an original screenplay since Doug McClure's character seems to have been resurrected to kick off the plot but he's not given much to do and his role is even more superfluous than that of Charlton Heston in BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES a film not a million miles removed from this one The film does improve in the second half as the expedition comes across a kingdom of pseudo Samuri warriors even if does lead to some plot holes  I can understand the concept of parallel evolution but why would this only apply to one race and not the others . Think about it One race in this lost land has the culture and technology of 16th century Japan but everyone else seems to be living in the stone age . Credible ? Probably not  Was it just an excuse to have a busty red head run around not wearing much ?  but it's not really a credible movie It is a fairly entertaining one though and better than I remembered from a couple of decades ago . The fact that you don't need to have seen the prequel is both a strength and weakness for THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT but it stands firmly on its own hind legs for a non discerning audience".

	schema:reviewBody "American International made four low budget films starring Doug McClure based on books by Edgar Rice Burroughs the author of the Tarzan books.  THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT and it's sequel THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT borrowed heavily from Arthur Conan Doyle's THE LOST WORLD but added it's own twists and turns.  THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT is a nonstop adventure in the Indiana Jones mode with Major Ben McBride Patrick Wayne son of the Duke out to rescue shipwrecked Bowen Tyler Doug McClure from the first film.  Among those along for the adventure is Lady Charlotte Cunningham played by a beautiful Sarah Douglas SUPERMAN II.  Despite Amelia Earhart attire she is definately hot.  She reminded me of Francesca Hunt in THE SECRET ADVENTURES OF JULES VERNE on the SciFi Network.  Along the way they meet Ajor Dana Gillespie friend of Bowen Tyler who looks and dresses like Xena Warrior Princess so this is where Xena got that look.  Dana Gillespie is stunning and like Xena and Sheena makes a great Jungle Girl strong smart gorgeous sexy...hey what else could one ask for?  Lady Charlotte and Major Ben create a romantic tension but when Ajor enters the scene Major Ben has eyes for Ajor and Lady Charlotte just goes with the flow chumming up with Ajor as well.  I found that refreshing and glad to see the women in this film be more than just damsels in distress there is a little of that toward the end but it all evens out with everyone being able to do something heroic. Jungle Girl films have been around for a long time check out the serials! and I truly love them because they show women to have strength beauty and brains.  This film is a worthy member of that genre.  Like the rest of the series the special effects are uneven but always entertaining the vehicles and sets are always stunning but these guys never did know how to make a monster.  The violence is very very low key the frights are made funny by rubber puppets and there is no swearing.  Appropriate for the entire family for those into Xena and The Lost World.".

Doug McClure Dana Gillespie that cowboy dude who was related to somebody they all traipse across the screen and shout Gawddammit! and have heavy monologues with an intensity akin to Shakespeare's MACBETH... instead of an obscure adaptation of one of ERB's less remembered stories. But it's all good fun especially the pilot guy who does his hash marks with five lines and THEN a dash and treats pterodactyls with the same ornery attitude he'd give crows in his cornfield. He looks like the type to have a cornfield. And TREMBLE at the fury that is confused 1970s gender commentary and barely simmering sexual resentment! I'd be resentful too if the other woman was Dana Gillespie and I'd been playing the 'headstrong hairinabun' type too long.Very briefly Doug McClure's character who got left behind in movie 1has got a buddy who sets up an expedition to find the lost continent of Caprona and save ol' Rawhide. There's the prerequisite gang of SF stock characters including the frosty professional lady and the saltofearth mechanic along with the scientist and McClure's buddy... who he knew in the war or something. Nuff said their plane crash lands beyond the ice mountains stranding them in Caprona where they find puppet monsters and evil cavemen. No not evil just misunderstood. Eventually the party picks up a cave babe and finds The Mountain Of Skulls where McClure has grown a beard and been imprisoned in that order. The Naga Samurai Type Guys will sacrifice the ladies and execute the menfolk unless Rawhide and Wayne can twofist a way out of there. Which they do. But then they get chased by a volcano. When's the last time you saw anything like that?Check it out. Dana Gillespie had cough personal relations with David Bowie and here she is waving a Bowie knife around. Coincidence? Most likely yes.The women are attractive the dinosaurs are nasty the plot moves along fast enough and you get unexpected samurai action though I just revealed the presence of said samurai... spoilers... oh well the whole thing's weird enough to warrant a look especially for someone not used to that sort of thing... weird dinosaurs I mean.".

	schema:reviewBody "The People That Time Forgot is an enjoyable sequel to The Land That Time Forgot and is the third scifi movie starring Doug McClure and directed by Kevin Conner.A party led by The Duke's son Patrick Wayne travels to Caprona to rescue Bowen Tyler Doug McClure. Joining them are a reporter played by Sarah Douglas and Thorley Walters who plays a professor. After the ship has reached as far as it can they transfer to an aeroplane which is piloted by Shane Rimmer The Spy Who Loved Me. After shooting down a Pterodactyl they land safely and start walking to search for Tyler. They reach the City of Skulls where he is being held prisoner. After fighting off several warriors they escape but Tyler is killed. The City of Skulls is ruled by a huge bald bloke who reminds me of Tor Johnson of Plan 9 From Outer Space fame. They escape the volcanic eruption at the end. Other Prehistoric monsters in this movie include a Stegosaurus a pair of Creatosaurus and what looks like an Ankylosaurus. These monsters don't look too bad but you can't beat stopmotion.This movie is worth watching especially if you a dinosaur movie fan like me.Rating 4 stars out of 5.".

	onyx:emotionText "The People That Time Forgot is an enjoyable sequel to The Land That Time Forgot and is the third scifi movie starring Doug McClure and directed by Kevin Conner.A party led by The Duke's son Patrick Wayne travels to Caprona to rescue Bowen Tyler Doug McClure. Joining them are a reporter played by Sarah Douglas and Thorley Walters who plays a professor. After the ship has reached as far as it can they transfer to an aeroplane which is piloted by Shane Rimmer The Spy Who Loved Me. After shooting down a Pterodactyl they land safely and start walking to search for Tyler. They reach the City of Skulls where he is being held prisoner. After fighting off several warriors they escape but Tyler is killed. The City of Skulls is ruled by a huge bald bloke who reminds me of Tor Johnson of Plan 9 From Outer Space fame. They escape the volcanic eruption at the end. Other Prehistoric monsters in this movie include a Stegosaurus a pair of Creatosaurus and what looks like an Ankylosaurus. These monsters don't look too bad but you can't beat stopmotion.This movie is worth watching especially if you a dinosaur movie fan like me.Rating 4 stars out of 5.";

The characters are wellthoughtout and believable the plot is entertaining and wellwritten and the music is good.

Since this is a sequel I guess it can be forgiven to an extent for not having much that's especially original in it. It's a typical story of a land filled with dinosaurs and cave people including a stereotypical and very well endowed cavegirl  played by an actress named Dana Gillespie  who speaks surprisingly fluent English  having been taught by the man they're searching for  and spends most of the movie looking like she's about to burst out of her costume as a search party heads in to find someone lost from the previous expedition. To give credit where credit is due the sets were realistic and the dinosaur effects were pretty well done. The pterodactyl attack on the small plane near the beginning of the movie was actually quite believable  at least in the context of this movie. The cast was not particularly familiar to me. The most recognizable face to me was Sarah Douglas as Charly  a well to do photographer sent along by her family's newspaper to document the expedition. I recognize her as Ursa  the villainess from Superman II a few years later.There's nothing very spectacular here. It's not a bad time waster although it seems to start rather abruptly even though it's not an especially good movie. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "The People That Time Forgot 1977 is the sequel to The Land That Time Forgot 1975. Both titles were borrowed from Edgar Rice Burroughs along with the basic premise a prehistoric tropical paradise in the heart of Antarctica inhabited by dinosaurs and cavemen. Burroughs detailed how volcanic activity kept the region warm and how a rim of mountains protected the land from the frozen temperatures that surrounded it. The film does not bother to include these scientific details nor much else from the original Burrough's stories so don't think less of him just because some hacks borrowed his idea and made this movie. The movie features an expedition to find Bowen Tyler Doug McClure the main character in the 1975 film. The rescue effort is not exactly massive it is a tiny four person expedition led by Tyler's childhood friend Major Ben McBride John Wayne's son Patrick. The pairing of these two actors was probably an effort to demonstrate to the world that there was actually an actor out there with less talent than McClure. Wayne peaked at age 18 with a bit part as the youthful Lt. Greenhill in his dad's film The Searchers and mysteriously managed to find a succession of acting opportunities in vehicles so bad that even he could not damage them to any great extent. The bottom line is that this movie works best as a mock party feature complete with laughably bad special effects Saturday matine serial quality production design and high school play quality acting. Also good for some laughs is Dana Gillespie as cave girl exploitation element Ajor. Dana was a British singer best remembered not for her tunes but for her lingerie clad presence on the cover of her album Weren't Born a Man. Despite her enormous talents I always thought she looked too Butch. A young Sarah Douglas of Superman fame plays the newspaper reporter accompanying the expedition. Douglas was extremely beautiful at that age and has a fair degree of acting ability as well. I'm not sure what is the most out of place a classy young woman heading into the jungle with this group or a competent actress being included in this lame ensemble. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Well pretty good it seems because it managed to float thousands of miles north and be found in England. So of course his friend decides he has to go find him and has no trouble doing so. Sadly this time they tried to add an element of comedy and it's extremely unfunny. So they crash land their crazy sea plane in this lost world and the plane is unmovable. So they tie their 500 foot rope to a dinosaur and have him drag it out. They brought a 500 foot rope? Of course.They even brought everything they would need to repair the plane a tent food I supposewe never see them eat some paint and even an extra coat. The first person they meet on the island is a cave woman with perfect hair wearing lipstick and eye shadow. And you see where this is going. The most interesting thing about this movie is all the similarities to Star Wars. They have a girl with her hair in two buns a villain that is very similar to Jabba and that villain even has a weird tiny side kick like Jabba did. Plus there's dinosaur snakelike things that pop out of holes. A lot of coincidences considering this was released the same year as Star Wars. Weirdly At The Earth's Coreanother McClure mess had a scene that was amazingly like the Rancor scene. But for the most part this movie is just a mess. It's worth seeing once if you saw the first one but have low expectations.".

The story moves along pretty quickly the flick's only 90 minutes long. Patrick Wayne and Doug McClure are Great and Dana Gillespie is aweinspiring in her skimpy cavegirl outfit in fact in my opinion Dana blows the more popular Raquel Welch in One Million Years BC out of the water Raquel is a bit too thin to my tastes Dana has far better curves.WHAT DOESN'T WORK The story is less serious than The Land That Time Forgot i.e. campier and not nearly as compelling in other words don't expect for a second to be enraptured by the story. The miniature sets are tooobviously unreal and the creature FX are only mediocretopoor for the time period.FINAL ANALYSIS If you're into these types of Edgar Rice Burroughs adventures People is certainly worth having in your video library.

They soon discover the same kind of prehistoric creatures and humans from the first film and eventually do find Bowen though he has a sad story to tell and they must all fight an evil tribe if they are to escape.Mediocre sequel doesn't have the drama or tension of the first and seems to waste Doug McClure in what amounts to an extended cameo.

	onyx:emotionText "Patrick Wayne stars as Major Ben McBride in this sequel to The Land That Time Forgot who leads a rescue mission in the Antarctic to locate his friend Bowen Tylerreturning Doug McClure who has been missing for several years. He and his team fly their plane onto Caprona where they are intercepted by a flying dinosaur and forced to land for repairs. They soon discover the same kind of prehistoric creatures and humans from the first film and eventually do find Bowen though he has a sad story to tell and they must all fight an evil tribe if they are to escape.Mediocre sequel doesn't have the drama or tension of the first and seems to waste Doug McClure in what amounts to an extended cameo. Still it was nice to see him again and film is certainly watchable as a doublefeature with the first even if it just misses the mark itself.";

	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW Major Ben McBride Wayne goes on a search and rescue mission to find and bring back his friend Bowen Tyler McClure still lost in the land of dinosaurs. A small expedition is mounted to rescue him but the group runs into all manner of trouble including cavemen dinosaurs deformed sword wielding pseudosamurai savages and a volcano god that demands female sacrifices. Excellent pulpy adventure movie.Patrick Wayne the Duke's son is excellent as the chauvinistic former fighter pilot. His many confrontations with 'Charlie' Cunningham Douglas are quite funny as each tries to one up the other in terms of who is superior man or woman. Wayne is a more commanding lead here than he was in the same year's SINBAD  THE EYE OF THE TIGER. He just wasn't convincing as Sinbad. It's a shame Wayne didn't do more fantasy adventure movies.Douglas is also good as the feisty magazine photographer who doesn't mind getting her hands dirty. Douglas also sports Princess Leia buns on her head. She does get to put her hair down during the big finale when the girls are about to be decapitated. Douglas would screen test for SUPERMAN after this movie as would her costar Dana Gillespie.Walters is his usual chipper self portraying another great and batty character role as the slightly nutty Dr. Edwin Norton. Walters also gets in on the action with his fellow costars. Walters is always reliable and plays very odd and eccentric characters in his movies. He doesn't disappoint here.Dana Gillespie is simply the hottest cave girl since Raquel Welch. Her breasts threatening to erupt from her 'barely there' top. A protg of David Bowie she still sings today I gather. She also tested for SUPERMAN and lost out to Sarah Douglas for the role of Ursa. There is a hint that Gillespie's character Ajor may have had some romantic involvement with Tyler.McClure has what amounts to a guest appearance as you do not see him until towards the end. He is held captive in the Mountain of Skulls which is ruled by the vicious Nagas samurailike warriors who have hideously deformed faces beneath their masks.Shane Rimmer has a very comedic turn as the bumbling pilot Hogan who must fix the damaged plane. As more pterodactyls pass over he shoots them down then marks them on the side of the plane. All his scenes are peppered with humorous bits of dialog. He is incredibly loyal to the Major. Rimmer also returned for the fourth film in the series WARLORDS OF ATLANITS the only one not a Burroughs story as a villain along with John Ratzenberger who went on to play Cliff on CHEERS.Frequent heavy Milton Reid has a role as the evil Sabbala and Hammer performer Dave Prowse plays the executioner.One of my favorite movies I saw as a kid it is still a favorite. The film sports an even greater sense of adventure than its two predecessors. A fine cast and very well drawn characters help enliven the film. There are less monsters on display here. Most of them are trotted out during the conclusion as the heroes are being chased by the live volcano and several different creatures including the sword wielding Naga's attempt to impede their progress.The score is very impressive and really needs a CD release It has since been released on the composers own label. I have a lobby set for both LAND and PEOPLE as well as posters. The film was shot in the Canary Islands and at Pinewood Studios. Love the volcano set and the Mountain of Skulls which is obviously a painting but the interior is quite frightening with the walls literally made up of thousands of skulls from victims of the Naga's.Two memorable set pieces involve the attack on the biplane by a pterodactyl near the beginning resulting in a forced landing and the finale where the heroes fight it out with the Nagas snake creatures inside a tunnel as well as a prickly monster in a cave adorned with stalagmites and stalagtites.The MGM DVD is gorgeous. I have one small problem though. There is one scene missing Posted a thread detailing the scene that is present on a recording I have of it from television from back in 1980. It's basically an extension of a scene in the DVD. About a minutes worth of dialog that further explains the volcano god Nagarumata.The film also won or was nominated for a couple of awards from the Academy of SciFi Fantasy and Horror IMDB says it was only nominated but I have read that the film did indeed win an award. Highly recommended if you like scifi fantasy adventure movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was a young boy of eight years old I saw this at my my local cinema . In those days it cost 15 pence  A fair amount of money for an eight year old child  to get in . I actually saw it two or three times which eat up my pocket money bit I certainly thought it was money well spent since in those days I enjoyed war films and monster films . Yesterday morning Channel 4 broadcast it at 6 am which seems a ridiculous time to broadcast anything never mind a fondly remembered fantasy adventure movie but I looked forward to seeing it again if only to see how well it stands up as entertainment today . Would my cherished memories be hurt ? Do I have nice memories about THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT simply down to nostalgia ? To be honest I think the answer is a resounding no . Right from the opening title sequence where Douglas Gamley's score sums up the downbeat feature of the story we the audience are treated to a fantasy adventure that is a little bit different . You could point out the first half of the movie is somewhat repetitive as the Germans and Brits get one over on one another but in amongst all this is some serious debate on wartime morality  allied civilian ships carrying weapons of war for example which shows no one has a monopoly on self righteousness when the battle lines are drawn and the theories of Nietzsche are also touched upon . What'd you mean this is a childish film ? No doubt the people who watched this at the cinema on its release where more interested in prehistoric monsters than 19th century philosophy and it's not till half way through that the Uboat reaches the ancient island of Caprona which is inhabited by rubber dinosaurs and troglodytes . Yeah okay the monsters especially the pterodactyls are not very convincing but I've seen worse . It's also interesting to that this part of the movie replaces Nietzsche with Darwinisnm and I don't know if it's deliberate but this concept fits in perfectly well with the sequel THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT . How many times have you seen a sequel that almost contradicts the original movie ? This makes THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT something of a stand out movie alongside the very pessimistic final act I fail to see how anyone can actively dislike this movie . I agree that the special effects are far from brilliant but look beyond the FX and you'll see a very intelligent piece of fantasy adventure . The very fact that it has a sense of wonder and a truly haunting ending sets it apart from many other movies of its ilk like WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS and AT THE EARTHS CORE and nostalgia or not I certainly enjoyed seeing it again".

	schema:reviewBody "The survivors of a doomed World War 1 ship manage to board and take over the German submarine which sunk them.  After a lot of disputing the sub becomes lost and before long the enigmatic  island of Caprona is sighted.  Due to desperately low supplies the two crews who call an uneasy truce are forced to land the sub and find themselves in a world where prehistoric animals still live.This is a wellmade and highly entertaining film.  Doug McClure makes a good hero and the other characters are also interesting and believable the story is wellpaced and the music is suitably atmospheric.

After a lot of disputing the sub becomes lost and before long the enigmatic  island of Caprona is sighted.  Due to desperately low supplies the two crews who call an uneasy truce are forced to land the sub and find themselves in a world where prehistoric animals still live.This is a wellmade and highly entertaining film.  Doug McClure makes a good hero and the other characters are also interesting and believable the story is wellpaced and the music is suitably atmospheric.  The special effects are not always as good as they might be the giant pterodactyl and the plesiosaur that gets shot at look decidedly fake.

I must admit I like them all with Warlords of Atlantis probably being my overall favourite. The script by James Cawthorn  Michael Moorcrock is based on the novel of the same name by Edgar Rice Burroughs  certainly moves along at a fair pace it's never boring or dull it's entertaining  good fun if you like these type's of films. It starts out like a war film  it takes a good 30 odd minutes before it gets to Caprona having said that the scenes on the boat are pretty good tense  well done. It is a bit on the predictable side although the ending surprised me a bit as it's not a particularly happy one. The Land that Time Forgot is good clean fun monster filled entertainment what more do you want?Director Connor does a good job  the film has a nice feel to it I don't think he knew how to shoot special effect scenes though. The monsters look pretty bad especially if they have to interact with an actor just check the Pterodactyl out as it just glides through the air like a paper plane  doesn't flap it's wings once! Having said that I thought they looked alright for the most part  the filmmakers probably did the best they could on a low budget at least they tried  you can't blame them for that.Techncially the film is very good some of the dodgy special effects excluded. The Spanish Canary Islands locations look nice the cinematography is good the production design is OK  as a whole it's generally well made. The acting is alright Susan Penhaligon is the obligatory female love interest  she's cute enough I suppose.The Land that Time Forgot is a good solid monster film that I think makes for great undemanding entertainment  that's what films are all about right? If you like the other similar films by Connor then you'll definitely like this but if you didn't then I'd stay away  watch something else instead.".

There are riproaring action spirit of adventure derringdo thrills and results to be quite entertaining. It's a brief fun with average special effects  passable set decoration  functional art direction and none use of computer generator. This fantasy picture packs thrills action weird monsters lively pace and fantastic scenarios . The monsters are the real stars of this production and its chief attribute. The tale is silly and laughable but the effects and action are quite well.

Some monsters are clumsily made but movie is OK . Highlights of the adventure includes a rollercoaster trip towards unknown land in South America  and appearance of prehistoric reptile such as Pterodactilus Stegosaurius and Tiranosaurious . In addition the final scenes where appears breathtaking volcanic eruptions and thunderous explosions .

The Land that Time Forgot is one of his lesser known works. Like most of his stories this one has some really bizarre notions about science. This story features a lost land where evolution actually runs...uh...backwards. Our brave explorers are a small group of British seamen and a German Uboat crew thrown together on the Uboat by highly improbable fortunes of war. Both factions vie for control of the Uboat ! which causes the boat to become hopelessly lost and the divided crew unintentionally discovers the lost world. How does this group handle entering a primeval world? They decide to temporarily set aside their WWI differences and work together to escape the lost land.There are plenty of interesting characters in this movie. Doug McClure does a great job as a brawling likable hero. There is a cute and intelligent scientist type woman as his girlfriend. She manages to keep all that's right all of her clothes on throughout the movie which is both a remarkable and regrettable feat for this genre. The captain turns out to be a better scientist than a submariner and the first mate acts like wartime allegiances are still important. The main dynamics between the characters are who is in charge the Germans or Doug McClure? Both sides are looking to turn the tables at the earliest opportunity and this provides a nice bit of ongoing tension in the movie.It is hard to comment on the 'science' of backward evolution in this lost land of Caprona. At least it provides a rationale for the abundant mix of dinosaurs and cave men. Now about those dinosaurs. They are cheesy puppets! 'Cmon people. It's 1975. What about stop motion? If only. However as poor as some of the dinosaurs look they do make interesting appearances sometimes including direct attacks on the crew. Everything else the lost world of Caprona the Uboat the costumes are all very well done and look great.What really makes this movie work is that the pace and action of the story do not disappoint and the plot never stagnates. The characters are compelling and have competing interests. The plot builds to several crises occurring at once including a discovery that the crew theoretically might not be able to leave the evolutionary pull of Caprona that the Uboat has the fuel needed to escape then a volcano erupts and an armed play for control of the boat occurs. The final scene is a wonderful blend of intensity and pathos as the Uboat heads to sea with flames and destruction all around. It is a spectacular finish and it wraps the movie up perfectly.This is a well written well acted 'Lost World' type movie. I love it.".

	schema:headline " Still a respectable Bbudget adventure";
	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie as a kid. Can't recall how many times I watched it on the late show in my early teens but it was more than a few. I hadn't seen it since about 1982 and was pleased TCM ran it recently so I recorded it and watched it last night.The scenes came back to me by rote though I definitely needed the refresher after all these years. Seeing it now at 40 it of course has become a little more quaint in the wake of the Jurassic Park series but it still held my interest as it WAS a very good effort in 1975 with limited resources at bringing to the screen an intelligent Scifi adventure with old fashioned heroics reminiscent of King Kong etc.The script though certainly not as good as it could have been stays true to itself and even though the SFX at times look primitive they still kick the snot out of the FX in Logan's Run the story is poorly paced after the UBoat reaches Caprona and the Neanderthals and the obligatory volcanic eruption are more than forced the film never becomes kitschy or laughable or outright uninteresting like dozens of other films like this made on the cheap. My only wish is it would have been a bit longer and included more thoughtful dialogue about nature and evolution and survival to give the story and characters more depth. And Ray Harryhausen could have done much more with the dinosaurs in the technical department.As far as leading men go Doug McClure is good in this and will always get my sympathy as that likable two fisted action star who had the misfortune of looking too much like Lee Marvin and sounding too much like Glenn Ford to ever get the kind of roles he deserved in bigger pictures. He was good in these Kevin Connor adventure flicks in the 70's and is eternally one of my favorite actors as a result.Lots of details about the UBoat and what not are probably inaccurate and the story itself is more than too similar to Verne's Mysterious Island with shades of 20000 Leagues Under the Sea but overall while I wouldn't call it great or even good it is definitely worth a look and still a nifty little piece of entertainment for the budget it had. Surprising a remake hasn't appeared in this age of CGI. Could be a dandy. Are you listening Peter Jackson?".

Seeing it now at 40 it of course has become a little more quaint in the wake of the Jurassic Park series but it still held my interest as it WAS a very good effort in 1975 with limited resources at bringing to the screen an intelligent Scifi adventure with old fashioned heroics reminiscent of King Kong etc.The script though certainly not as good as it could have been stays true to itself and even though the SFX at times look primitive they still kick the snot out of the FX in Logan's Run the story is poorly paced after the UBoat reaches Caprona and the Neanderthals and the obligatory volcanic eruption are more than forced the film never becomes kitschy or laughable or outright uninteresting like dozens of other films like this made on the cheap. My only wish is it would have been a bit longer and included more thoughtful dialogue about nature and evolution and survival to give the story and characters more depth. And Ray Harryhausen could have done much more with the dinosaurs in the technical department.As far as leading men go Doug McClure is good in this and will always get my sympathy as that likable two fisted action star who had the misfortune of looking too much like Lee Marvin and sounding too much like Glenn Ford to ever get the kind of roles he deserved in bigger pictures. He was good in these Kevin Connor adventure flicks in the 70's and is eternally one of my favorite actors as a result.Lots of details about the UBoat and what not are probably inaccurate and the story itself is more than too similar to Verne's Mysterious Island with shades of 20000 Leagues Under the Sea but overall while I wouldn't call it great or even good it is definitely worth a look and still a nifty little piece of entertainment for the budget it had. Surprising a remake hasn't appeared in this age of CGI. Could be a dandy. Are you listening Peter Jackson?";

What a lot of people complain about this movie are the dinosaurs which are some of the fakest you can find in a 70s dinosaur flick. And I have to admit they are correct. Heck the pterosaurs can't even flap their wings and only one of them the one that snatches up Ahm even moves its jaw. The Allosaurs are also pretty fake in some scenes but more convincing in others. One of my favorite parts of the movie is where the men that came onboard the Uboat are firing at the two Allosaurs. And also the brief yet bloody battle between a Ceratosaur and a Triceratops is very fun to watch. Also the scenes with the cavemen are convincing and entertaining as well as long as you don't mind seeing people either get shot or stabbed with axes and blades. What's more the music score for this movie is entertaining and moves along greatly with what's happening on screen. When the second Allosaur has been fatally shot it roars a strange elephantlike kind of howl of pain and falls back while a powerful score of music plays. Overall The Land that Time Forgot is a pretty entertaining 70s movie that I watch quite frequently.".

Her thoughts are only however for Doug McClure.By comparison to today the special effects aren't really up to snuff. Then again DeMille films which were the last word in special effects in their day are also considered old hat.

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people seem to criticize this movie for what they call its poor special effects. I think if that becomes the basis on which you're going to judge the movie you have to keep in mind that it was made 40 years ago long before the computer generated stuff that dominates today's movies came about. Personally I found the special effects to be fine  especially considering when it was made and in any event I don't think the quality of a movie depends on the special effects. Much more important to me are the storyline and the performances. The Land That Time Forgot certainly gets a passing grade on those.The story begins with a German Uboat sinking a British civilian liner. A few of the passengers make it on to the uboat and manage to take control of it for a while. To me far more than the special effects the idea that a ragtag group of survivors from a sunken vessel could take control of a German uboat was probably the most problematic part of the story. Having said that though there's an ongoing struggle to control the sub which was mildly interesting to watch. I wondered why the American who had taken command Tyler played by Doug McClure needed seven days to figure out that the Germans had sabotaged the compass so that they were heading south rather than west. Somehow that seemed to me to be something that probably should have been noticed earlier. In any event out of fuel and other supplies the uboat suddenly encounters Caprona  what had been thought to be a mythical island in the South Atlantic populated by dinosaurs and primitive humans all of whom exist together. The struggle for survival in a hostile environment is on!This was fun. It's not a masterpiece of movie making but it's a fun adventure and it even includes a little bit of ethical thinking about the morality of warfare  especially as Captain Von Shoenvorts John McEnery and Lisa Susan Penhaligon talk about why the Germans would have sunk a civilian vessel with women and children aboard. As the captain replied  the way the ship exploded made it clear that there were arms in the hold arms that would have been used to kill German women and children. Not everything is as clear cut as we want it to be!The performances were fine. Nothing outstanding but nothing that detracted from the movie either. It comes from a story written by Edgar Rice Burroughs who's better known as the author who created Tarzan. Frankly I enjoyed this more than any Tarzan movie I've ever seen. 710".

I wondered why the American who had taken command Tyler played by Doug McClure needed seven days to figure out that the Germans had sabotaged the compass so that they were heading south rather than west. Somehow that seemed to me to be something that probably should have been noticed earlier. In any event out of fuel and other supplies the uboat suddenly encounters Caprona  what had been thought to be a mythical island in the South Atlantic populated by dinosaurs and primitive humans all of whom exist together. The struggle for survival in a hostile environment is on!This was fun. It's not a masterpiece of movie making but it's a fun adventure and it even includes a little bit of ethical thinking about the morality of warfare  especially as Captain Von Shoenvorts John McEnery and Lisa Susan Penhaligon talk about why the Germans would have sunk a civilian vessel with women and children aboard. As the captain replied  the way the ship exploded made it clear that there were arms in the hold arms that would have been used to kill German women and children. Not everything is as clear cut as we want it to be!The performances were fine. Nothing outstanding but nothing that detracted from the movie either. It comes from a story written by Edgar Rice Burroughs who's better known as the author who created Tarzan. Frankly I enjoyed this more than any Tarzan movie I've ever seen. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "The Land That Time Forgot is arguably the most underrated dinosaur action movie of the 1970s. Good Bmovie fun for the kids and adults in the family that can't resist dinosaur fare.This Doug McClure vehicle about British sailors who capture a German UBoat that sunk their ship then get stranded on a prehistoric island think King Kong's Skull Island only to be picked off onebyone by ravenous dinosaurs and cave men has pretty high value special effects for a 1970s flick. It is an instant classic like Logan's Run which also featured some of the top special effects the time could muster  until Star Wars changed the whole game. Of course I am excluding 1968's 2001 here a Kubrick film so far ahead of its time that it stands in a special category of its own.Caprona actually has a plot unlike the Jurassic Park sequels for instance good actors in a fabulous ensemble cast character development and a great setup Germans and British who want to kill one another instead have to band together to survive ravaging dinosaurs.The special effects of course are not up to modern CGI but they are awesome in their palpable physicality glider planes disguised as pterodactyls that pick up a real actor in their teeth by swooping down ichthyosaurs that shoot out of the water next to the UBoat to feed on human prey prehistoric men that will bash your head in with an ax but also make dearest friends and love the Edison phonograph music tar pits bubbling and shooting natural gas flames. We must forgive a scene where two allosaurs still standing upright and tails down as was the posing custom in 1970s paleontology have strings attached. Puppetry still beats stop motion but take the kids to Dark Crystal if you want to see it done really well.The band of men and women is eventually defeated by their own infighting. The simple moral is that Nature will get us if we don't work together and get over our differences. As the U Boat goes down in flames the viewer actually feels sorry for the doomed characters and equally sorry for the lone couple that was left on shore to deal with the prehistoric mayhem.This film is good enough to deserve a remake but also good enough that it doesn't really need one. One the other hand many modern remakes were made from movies NOT good enough to need a remake or even to have been made in the first place.".

	schema:headline " The Ram that Tom Forgot";
	schema:reviewBody "The Land that Time Forgot is a likeably goofy and welldirected B movie with a few oddities to keep you watching despite uneven production. I recorded its 92 minutes off the MGM cable channel in 2012 nearly 4 decades after seeing it in the mid1970s in Piedmont North Carolina at the Graham Theater which stayed open long after most downtown theaters had fallen to mallplexes but remained limited to movies of this middling character. I talked some family and friends into going with me. Seeing the title on the way in my little sister announced she thought we had been going to see The Ram that Tom Forgot. A different title wouldn't make much difference for this film's reception but no one gave me a hard time even though I probably liked it more than anyone. Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote excellent action sequences and the initial capture of the submarine by a rowboat is wellimagined and wellexecuted. As other reviewers point out the film's direction is fastpaced. The talky parts are helped by a good cast7 or 8 years earlier John McEnery had played an electric Mercutio in Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet Susan Penhaligon was both babely and convincing as a femme paleontologist Doug McClure was born for twofisted roles and the remaining cast took acting seriously like good Brits do. The submarine scenes were all convincing enough especially the exterior shots of the sub entering the Land that Time Forgot via an underground river. Every reviewer justifiably gripes about the puppetdinosaurs and the boardstiff pterodactyls but the very first dinosaur shown the waterdwelling diplodocus hashing on aquatic vegetation is the best special effect of the whole movie perhaps because water provided cover for the dinopuppet's manipulations.The science fiction theme however preposterous worked for me. Odds are that half the folks reading this note think humans appeared by divine magic in the fairly recent past but a great gift of being born in the past century or so is that humans can begin to understand evolution which like God is a mystery to be learned one's whole life through. As I recall Burroughs's variation on evolution was that in the Land that Time Forgot every organism makes a complete evolution from microorganism to higher mammal in contrast to normal evolution through a species' genetic variation across generations. When that likable native is captured early in the movie for instance he seems to be approximately CroMagnon but by the end of the film he looks and talks and fights as homo sapiensa cool counterfactual thought experiment leading us closer to knowing how things really work enlivened by action sequences and fairenough acting on the way.".

You could certainly call these 1.5 hours a fantasy film so I am a bit surprised this genre is missing here on IMDb as it is maybe the defining genre in fact. Cast members are not known at all except the one I mentioned already but this should not be a surprise looking at who made this and that he worked together with Jrg Buttgereit too. Budgetet was minimal for sure so here we have an amateur movie and as such it really could have been worse. There is guilty pleasure potential here and on some occasions you get an entertaining moment. For T.G. it is probably his secondmost known work and an effort from relatively early in his career. This is the story of a bunch of aliens coming to the Earth to get in possession of its core and destroy humanity as well as the planet while running into many earthling who are a strong opposition to the invaders despite facing their very own problems like the woman who gets humiliated by everybody early on. One of the film's strengths is that it never takes itself seriously but if we are honest here it's also pretty impossible to do so. It may be decent for its budget but overall it simply isn't good enough for a recommendation even if it shines through its occasional randomness and absurdity. Thumbs down. Don't watch.".

But if you consider the budget with which the film was shot there are even some elements that appear quite inventivecreative in the picture. Thilo Gosejohann shot this film from 1992  1998 in Germany with a financing that actually didn't exist and a crew of volunteers who although most of them lacking theatrical abilities obviously seemed to enjoy themselves acting their parts and the movie manages to convey the spirit of enthusiasm during the production of the film with nearly no budget.

The Red Skull is the villain but in most of the movie he looks like a guy with acne problems.  However we do learn that the Red Skull had a hand in the JFK assassination.  How Oliver Stone missed that lead is beyond me.  The Captain's super powers seem to be limited to throwing his shield and faking car sickness.  On the positive side at times the film does have the feel of a 40's serial.  I would've liked to see that carried out but the film never decides whether to be serious or kindofcorny.

This movie could have been so much better set entirely in WW2 with the opening scene of Hitler screaming at his generals I could make that bellboy a better leader than any of you ! That is from the mythos of the comic book. After the opening credits we should have seen the process of Rogers becoming the hero who goes on to fight the Red Skull who through most of the movie should have been spoken of and referred to but not seen. This movie needed that sort of impact the indication of the sort of evil the Nazis represented but as it is it's just one big car wreck on the todo list at MST3K.".

	schema:reviewBody "Halfway decent adaptation of the classic Marvel comics character which many people either love or hate. Most of the halfway decency the film has it derives from star Matt Salinger the son of overpraised asshole writer JD Salinger. In a role that could have been made comical or just plain bad by many other actors Matt manages to imbue the character with an authentic feeling of sincerity similar to what Christopher Reeve gave to Superman and often missing from other actors in superhero films. Had this film been left with a bigger budget and gotten a big theatrical release it could very well have made Matt Salinger a star or at least establish his name and allow him some leverage to pursue other roles in bigger projects like Helen Slater after the endearingly classic disaster Supergirl 1984. Actually I think both Dolph Lundgren and Arnold Schwarzenegger respectively were both considered for this role but it's just as well that they didn't get it seeing as how their accents would have worked against them playing this AllAmerican hero. Although Arnold's name on the picture might have gotten it a theatrical release instead of going direct to video a similar fate befell Dolph's The Punisher.After Steve Rogers gets pumped up by the super soldier serum he becomes Captain America and gets into a disastrous first mission that ends with him getting his ass kicked by the Red Skull who straps him to a missile pointed at the White House. Cap narrowly manages to cut off the Red Skull's hand and wrecks the missile so that instead of hitting the White House it lands in the Arctic and freezes him there but not before he is spotted by a little boy who grows up to be President Ronny Cox. When Cap thaws out he finds that much has changed while he's been gone like his old girlfriend and her now adult daughter. He also finds out that the Red Skull is still alive and still out to conquer the world. Naturally Captain America catches up with the Red Skull and beats the crap out of him in turn Stop calling me your brother! before saving the world.The guy playing the Skull is ineffectual but he's got a nice looking daughter. Again the real saving grace here is Matt Salinger's sincere performance as the title character but even that can only do so much against a weak script and boring villains. Still I enjoyed this film and I feel that fans deserved a chance to see this in theaters. And now I hear that Brad Pitt wants to play Captain America! Oh the shame...".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember when this movie came out in 1990. It was released in Cannon Cinemas in Great Britain. Captain America himself was there on the opening night handing out shieldsflags and a big ol' slice of moms apple pie. I was expecting typical Cannon material cheap and cheerful and looked forward as the movie started. Then the lights went out the movie started and i had to sit through 90mins of the most uninspired trash. The problem lies first and formost with the script. It has awfull dialougue weak characters and worst of all no humour. How can we laugh along with the movie if there are no laughs?. Albert Pyun is the best director to be expected for such a project both Cyborg and Sword and the Sorceror were half decent but he has a really difficult time handeling this movie. Aslo Mat Sallinger is TOO bland as Captain America. Maybe if Cannon had forked out for someone like Dolph Lundgren or Miles O'Keefe both had worked for Cannon before we'd have sympathised with Cap more. Worst still is Scot Paulin as The Red Skull. A character as unbelievable as that needs a little humour. Just as Frank Langella was a good choice as Skelator in Cannon's earlier Masters of the Universe Paulin is bad. Thank god for Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox who just about rescue this poor film from dying. Also there is half decent special effects and a good version of Caps suit sheild. Overall though a disappointment. Possibly the most unrememborable film in history".

	schema:reviewBody "With a new SpiderMan movie due out this May an upcoming sequel to Blade and XMen 2 to start filming soon I thought it would be appropriate to review some of the previous attempts that Marvel Comics has made to get their characters onto the big screen. It's no questions that their films have never been as successful as their arch rivals DC Comics especially in the nineties. While there was a successful TV Incredible Hulk series in the seventies a neverreleased lowbudget Fantastic Four flick and an ahem film version of The Punisher that is not even worthy of mention at the end of the day the only cinematic interpretations of their heroes that are worth commenting on at all are Blade XMen and Captain America.In an earlier review written back in my naive lesseducatedinCinemadays I stated that Captain America was the greatest superhero film ever made. This is not a true statement and it was one I made having not seen the film in a few years and the flaws were lessapparent in my mind. Yes there are many flaws in this film Some of the dialogue is cheezy many of the characters are underdeveloped and there is simply not enough time spent with Captain America in costume. However in the heart of this film there is a very sincere very respectable tribute to the goldenage superhero and I feel that the movie is still very much worthy of praise.Without going too much into detail about the nature of the plot I will say that it successfully sums up sixty years of comics into one movie. Both the characters of Captain America and his facist counterpart the Red Skull brainchild of Hitler in the comics created by Mussolini and sold to the nazis here are depicted as much more tragic than in the comics. Both characters are wellconstructed and sincerely acted by Matt Salinger and Scott Paulin and the film is basically a tribute to old 1940's serials with two strong characters taking center stage.When I say a tribute to 1940's serials this is exactly what I mean. Every plot point every character save Cap and the Skull serve nothing more than to move the story along from action scene to action scene. Many things happen that make little sense for example upon being revived in the nineties after being frozen in ice for fifty years Captain America is found by a conspiracy theorist who has been piecing together his story for years. How does the guy find our hero? He just happens to be driving through Northern Canada and stumbles upon him. Once the Red Skull realizes that Cap is still alive he determines that the hero must be out to destroy him. Now Cap has been out of commission for fifty years and the Red Skull is now a mysterious Corleoneesque kingpin. In this film they only encountered briefly in the 1940's before Cap was frozen in ice. Why on earth would Skull jump to the conclusion that hey! Cap is thawed out and his first objective will be to stop the Red Skull? In another part realizing that the Skull is hiding in Italy Cap jumps on a plane fro the U.S. and flies there. Um.....how did he get on board of that plane? Surely his passport wasn't perserved with him in the ice?But nevermind....these plot holes and many like them are irrelavent to what this film is trying to do Put our hero in a series of spectacular action scenes and watch how he gets out of them. It is not trying to tell a serious story it is simply trying to give us some silly comicbook action in a movieserial kind of way and the movie does just that. Our hero is strapped to a German rocket headed toward the White House dodges nazi villians in Northern Canada is amazed in some cleverlywritten scenes how many American products are made in former enemy lands of Japan and Germany fights the Red Skull's henchmen in Italy and finally has an explosive showdown with the Skull himself in the kingpin's castle where the villian threatens to blow up all of Western Europse with an atomic bomb which he receives from a piano. All this combined with the fact that the Skull is responsible for the deaths of JFK RFK and Martin Luther King and now he plans to use a brain transplant to make the new economicallyaware U.S. President his slave.It is impossible to take this film any more seriously than you would take an old serial or a fourpart issue of the Cap comic book and this kind of treatment is exactly what a Captain America movie needed. As a result the lowbudget occasionally hammy acting and confusing storytelling only add to the film's effect and heighten director Pyun's wellchoreographed action sequences. There is just something grand and doggonnit patriotic about the President of the United States leaping from a tower in order to keep the Skull from using him in is experiments only to be successfully caught and saved by Captain America who is crawling up the wall vigorously. In real life this would have ripped both their arms out of their sockets but in this movie what difference does it make? It's such a wellshot scene!This said Cap and Skull are welldeveloped and they hold the film together when it threatens to go overthetop in its comicbook silliness. Cap fights the Skull and fails to defeat him in the 1940's only to be frozen in ice and thawed out in the nineties where he learns that because he failed to defeat the Skull his arch villian is responsible for the deaths of many historic figures. Feeling he has failed his country plus realizing his old girlfriend is now old with a family of her own Cap is a determined meloncholy hero with nothing to lose. There is a sincerity to the part that Matt Salinger brings and with his niavity and his boyishgood looks it looks as if Cap is truly a hero from the 1940's who has stepped out of his time and into ours and is truly amazed at the changes that have come though attempts to give him lines featuring old 40's terms such as Geewizz and holy mackeral don't come off so well. The Red Skull watched the slaughter of his family as a small boy in the 1930's and this tramautizing event that led to his transformation into the monster he now is has bittered him over the centuries. In a film which emphasized overacting he probably has the sublest role yet he still has the film's best overthetop lines Assassination isn't worth the trouble. It took two years to find Sir Hans. Three to find Oswald. The King job alone cost us over twenty two million dollars. What do we get for our troubles? Saints. Martyrs to the cause. Must like Michael Corleone in the Godfather 2 though on a much smaller level in the film's final scenes he builds himself up as a great powerful crimelord but to the viewer he simply comes across as pitiful.In the end Captain America is a fun lowbudget patriotic feelgood action flick which works in a Saturday Matinee sort of way. While never released to theaters here in the U.S. it made the theaters perhaps ironically overseas and as a result built the bridge for the biggerbudgeted moreserious Marvel Superhero movies that came years later and are still to come. Certainly worth watching certainly worth owning certainly a tribute to sixty years of Captain America comic books. out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "Before 1998's Blade Marvel Comics couldn't seem to catch a break when it came to movie versions of their different properties. In the wake of Iron Man 3 and The Avengers I know that's very hard to believe. There was a serial for Captain America released in 1944 through Republic Pictures. George Lucas executive produced a liveaction adaptation of Howard the Duck in 1986.The next few years up to Wesley Snipes' take on the legendary vampire slayer were plagued with lowbudget versions of the comic book publisher's characters. Dolph Lundgren's The Punisher couldn't even muster a theatrical release in the U.S. Roger Corman's The Fantastic Four never officially saw the light of day anywhere although bootleg copies float around.21st Century Film Corporation released Captain America straight to video in the middle of those two disasters. For many years the movie was hard to get a hold of and only released on VHS. Shout! Factory released it on DVD and made it widely available to those who sought it out for so many years as a sort of Nerd Holy Grail.Several years after being caught by Red Skull and left for dead Steve Rogers is found frozen in the ice and thawed out. He discovers Red Skull received plastic surgery to hide his true identity and is heading up a group of world leaders set on kidnapping the President of the United States for their own diabolical ambitions.Is Captain America filled with cheese? If you judge it from a modern standpoint of course it is. If you look at it as being a piece of World War II propaganda filmed in the 1940s you'll find it totally hits its mark. That's the standpoint I choose to view it from.My only real issue is that we only get about 5 minutes of face time from the real Red Skull. The rest of the film features actor Scott Paulin in fleshcolored makeup topped with scar lines. It's a real letdown for fans of the Red Skull who wanted to see the character the way he looks in the comic books.I still think that Captain America gets way more flack for being cheesy and low budget than it deserves. Is it on the same quality level as Captain America The First Avenger? No way! However it has an inviting and personal flavor to it that still works 23 years later. Real comic book fans will find value in this adaption and appreciate it for what it is.".

And anyone could say the same thing about my upcoming review you won't have to find it amusing. When this was filmed I think there was a long battle over the rights of Marvel Comics heroes. It was why you could see a lot of DC heroes but no Spiderman or XMen for years after. Spiderman would have been the biggest draw but even if anyone could have gotten the rights there was no Peter Parker or costume. Golan found a very good Matt Salinger and a good costume letting big brothers Warner do the heavy work on the onepiece latex. He found fun and famous American actors to costar Ned Beatty Darren McGavin Ronny Cox and an easytorootagainst villain Red Skull. The special effects are small compared to today. Of course no CGI no giant explosions. A lot of it is filmed in exterior locations and the scenes are usually wide shots. There's a girl who I think is helping Captain America navigate through the modern world. Had I seen more I probably would know more about her or the plot. But I've seen entire big budget movies and couldn't tell you more. I can tell you one particular chase scene looks like it inspired one found in Tomorrow Never Dies. Another interesting thing is that there is no postmodern angst in the script. No heavy brooding or moody atmosphere. No shrieking or screaming those are all pluses by the way. Don't judge this movie because it didn't have a big budget. It's fun to watch and I'm glad the fight to distribute it in the U.S. is over.".

	schema:headline " This 1990 version of Captain America can be pretty entertaining despite some noticeable flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay so after watching the Republic serial from 1944 in which Captain America's alter ego was Grant Gardner district attorney and then two TV movie versions starring Reb Brown as Steve Rogers occasional painter I finally watched this 1990 version from Menahem Golan's 21st Century Film Corporation starring Matt Salinger as the super soldier from World War II that gets frozen for several decades before being thawed out. I liked the beginning where we find out about both his and The Red Skull's Scott Paulin early lives and there was a quite entertaining fight between them during the WWII sequence though it would have been nice to know what dastardly thing the Skull did that lead to that battle. But then we're abruptly taken to the present day to when Cap finds himself waking up to and it takes a little time to once again find some momentum. That said having Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty as a couple of old pals now serving as president and reporter respectively was a nice treat for anyone who remembers them from Deliverance not to mention Beatty for his previous superhero encounter in the first two Christopher Reeve Superman movies. And how awesome it was to finally see the CA costume done right this time with both the wings on the cowl and the shield just the right size and color. Even more so was all the hot women that abounded though I have to wonder how any of them could realistically be daughters of the disfigured Red Skull! So in summation this filmed version of Captain America may be a little on the underwhelming side concerning story logic but the action for the most part makes it worth it for at least one viewing though I probably wouldn't mind watching it again. Can't wait for Chris Evans in Captain America The First Avenger later this summer.".

	onyx:emotionText "Okay so after watching the Republic serial from 1944 in which Captain America's alter ego was Grant Gardner district attorney and then two TV movie versions starring Reb Brown as Steve Rogers occasional painter I finally watched this 1990 version from Menahem Golan's 21st Century Film Corporation starring Matt Salinger as the super soldier from World War II that gets frozen for several decades before being thawed out. I liked the beginning where we find out about both his and The Red Skull's Scott Paulin early lives and there was a quite entertaining fight between them during the WWII sequence though it would have been nice to know what dastardly thing the Skull did that lead to that battle. But then we're abruptly taken to the present day to when Cap finds himself waking up to and it takes a little time to once again find some momentum. That said having Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty as a couple of old pals now serving as president and reporter respectively was a nice treat for anyone who remembers them from Deliverance not to mention Beatty for his previous superhero encounter in the first two Christopher Reeve Superman movies. And how awesome it was to finally see the CA costume done right this time with both the wings on the cowl and the shield just the right size and color. Even more so was all the hot women that abounded though I have to wonder how any of them could realistically be daughters of the disfigured Red Skull! So in summation this filmed version of Captain America may be a little on the underwhelming side concerning story logic but the action for the most part makes it worth it for at least one viewing though I probably wouldn't mind watching it again.

The hospital is underresourced and Newman scrounges what he needs with the help of his inventive staff especially Cpl. Jake Leibowitz. The military in general is only just coming to accept psychiatric disorders as legitimate and Newman generally has 6 weeks to cure them or send them on to another facility. There are many patients in the ward and his latest include Colonel Norville Bliss who has dissociated from his past Capt. Paul Winston who is nearly catatonic after spending 13 months hiding in a cellar behind enemy lines and 20 yearold Cpl. Jim Tompkins who is severely traumatized after his aircraft was shot down. Others come and go including Italian prisoners of war but Newman and team all realize that their success means the men will return to their units and combat.";

	schema:reviewBody "For reasons I don't understand Captain Newman MD has always been singled out for criticism most particularly directed at Gregory Peck saying he's too stiff for comedy. I don't agree on a number of levels and this is one of my favorite films with him.First and foremost Peck's role is not one of comedy. What he does in the film is serve as Tony Curtis's straight man. Now his role is a comic one and very funny indeed.Peck runs the psychiatric ward in an Army Air Corps Hospital out in the Arizona desert during World War II. There's no way a man like Peck would be in the command of George S. Patton who just didn't believe in Peck's whole profession. And in Patton like fashion if someone isn't shipped back to command in twelve weeks Peck hears about it.Captain Newman MD is a serious film about such people and they are at the heart of the story with Peck trying his best to fix the broken minds and psyches in our Armed Forces. Three of his cases are the drunken guitar playing corporal Bobby Darin the catatonic flier Robert Duvall and Eddie Albert the colonel who has gone psychotic. Peck has a mixed record of success with these three and with others in his ward.Bobby Darin got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor it's a fine performance but he lost that year to Melvyn Douglas for Hud. But personally I feel that Eddie Albert stole Captain Newman MD from the rest of the cast. It's a tossup between this role and Attack for the best performances of Albert's carer.Robert Duvall always credited Peck with giving him a good start to his long career with key roles in To Kill A Mockingbird and Captain Newman MD. Funny thing is that Duvall has little dialog here and none in To Kill A Mockingbird. Far from the well spoken attorney who was consigliere to The Godfather. He's matched in his performance by his wife played by Bethel Leslie who is apparently much influenced by Grace Kelly in her performance. She's his prim and proper wife who tries to stir his interest in an attempt at an unusual kind of shock therapy.Aiding Peck in his treatment of his patients are nurses Angie Dickinson and Jane Withers and orderlies Tony Curtis and Larry Storch. In his memoirs Tony Curtis says that he got along very well with Gregory Peck who he says was one of the best class acts in Hollywood. He didn't get along all that well with director David Miller who wanted Curtis to be more ethnic in his interpretation of Corporal Jackson Leibowitz. Curtis won out and I think he was right in this case. A friend of Tony Curtis's since childhood is Larry Storch and because of that Storch appears in a few films with Curtis. As Peck was Tony's straight man Storch becomes his comic foil in a couple of scenes and they work well together.Captain Newman MD is a classic film both entertaining and thought provoking about the treatment of mental breakdowns among our military. As we certainly now are a country at war Captain Newman MD has a relevancy today that is timely. Absolutely do not miss it when it is broadcast.".

Given the time the movie was made she was perfect. Gorgeous tender hearted sympathetic and a good backup for Gregory Peck.Tony Curtis' character was delightful and reminded me a lot of Jamie Farr's Klinger on M.A.S.H. Ethnic bright funny and mischievous to everyone's benefit. A good lift in spirit after some very heavy scenes.Remember this is not what we'reyou're used to in 2004.

Forester novel a trilogy really about a Royal Navy captain in the time of the Napoleonic Wars. And he was Commander Dwight Towers commanding the submarine USS Swordfish in On The Beach. The Guns of Navarone is another milestone in Peck's onscreen military career.In one of his later films he even portrayed General Douglas MacArthur.I have loved all of these films with the reservation that his accent made him unconvincing in his British roles.Captain Newman M.D. was an excellent if lighthearted novel before it was made into a movie and I recall reading it and enjoying it. I saw the movie on television one or two times years ago and found it a good adaptation of the novel. Recently I acquired the movie on VHS and enjoyed it immensely. While this is a great vehicle for Gregory Peck I felt the movie was in many ways stolen by two supporting cast members Bobby Darin mentioned several times and Tony Curtis.I highly recommend it for anyone interested in a good vintage movie with a military theme and a topic that doesn't get that much light treatmentpost traumatic stress disorder or call it combat fatigue.Not every Gregory Peck movie was great but several were and this might have been his best. It certainly ranks among his best performances and his best movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I previously gave a terrible review to Peck's movie Spellbound. This movie just goes to show that he CAN make a good movie about psychiatry unlike Spellboundyuck.Peck is an officer running a psychiatric ward stateside during WWII. He has a good heart and good intentions and tries a lot of different techniques to help these men. What I like is that although he is generally successful it is very clear Captain Newman feels at times over his head dealing with these many patients. He is not a SUPERMAN but a decent guy who's trying his best.Tony Curtis is the comic relief. So while the movie is VERY serious at times it also can be rather comical. This is a tough balance but it is done well and I liked Curtis in this film.However apart from Gregory Peck the real standout in the movie is Bobby Darin. Although he only is a supporting player his is the meatiest performance. He wonderfully plays a man suffering from PostTraumatic Stress Disorder though he outwardly hides it with bravado and obnoxiousnessthis is particularly true when he is under the influence of Sodium Pentathol or some other truth serum. I would say it is worth seeing the film just for this sequenceit's just so nice that there are many other good moments to recommend this flick.".

This movie just goes to show that he CAN make a good movie about psychiatry unlike Spellboundyuck.Peck is an officer running a psychiatric ward stateside during WWII. He has a good heart and good intentions and tries a lot of different techniques to help these men. What I like is that although he is generally successful it is very clear Captain Newman feels at times over his head dealing with these many patients. He is not a SUPERMAN but a decent guy who's trying his best.Tony Curtis is the comic relief. So while the movie is VERY serious at times it also can be rather comical. This is a tough balance but it is done well and I liked Curtis in this film.However apart from Gregory Peck the real standout in the movie is Bobby Darin. Although he only is a supporting player his is the meatiest performance. He wonderfully plays a man suffering from PostTraumatic Stress Disorder though he outwardly hides it with bravado and obnoxiousnessthis is particularly true when he is under the influence of Sodium Pentathol or some other truth serum. I would say it is worth seeing the film just for this sequenceit's just so nice that there are many other good moments to recommend this flick.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film with an outstanding cast Gregory Peck Capt. Josiah J. Newman MD Tony Curtis Cpl. Jackson 'Jake' Leibowitz Angie Dickenson Lt. Francie Corum and Robert Duvall Capt. Paul Cabot Winston to name a few. What is interesting is there are really two films in one. The first involves Dr. Newman trying to treat three patients Col. Norval Algate Bliss Eddie Albert Corporal Jim Tompkins Bobby Darin and Cabot all of which have severe psychological disorders The worst being Bliss who commits suicide. The other involves the relationship between Newman and Jake. It is very similar to the relationship that Curtis had with with Cary Grant in Operation Petticoat where his Lt. Holden was the comic con man serving under Lt. Commander Sherman. The only differences were the fact Jake is clearly Jewish comes from a lower socioeconomic background and they will both end up in a different setting then the career Navy men in Petticoat. Essentially Jake will turn Newman's life upside down and to be honest for the better. Newman is a career Army man who never got promoted higher despite always doing the right thing Such as trying to stop Bliss from active duty because he is insane or trying to go through correct channels to get needed things. Spoilers He had an real eye for Francine because of looks and ability and it was Jake who showed him how to get her and she eventually becomes his fianc. Jake also recommended that Newman quit the military and start his own practice and when he mentioned it to Francine she liked the idea. As she said I want to be having babies. Finally when the Army realized what an asset he was and wanted him to stay with a promotion he said no. I think a big part of his decision involved his patients Bliss in part died because of the difficulty in overcoming bureaucracy to get him in a hospital. Tompkins who although gets cured by Newman ends up getting killed in the warand to make it worse has no next of kin so he named Newman. Last but not least is Winston who Newman admitted to his wife Helene Bethel Leslie That I can't cure him only you can. Including not dressing like an old maid. Note Winston came from a upscale family and their marriage was political and he did not believe she really loved him and that his mental illness and hiding for two years shamed the family. At first she is offended but she realizes Newman is rightand listened to him. So although there is a long way back for Winston the film shows he is on his way One scene where Jake has Itallian POW's singing Hava Nagila and both Winston's are smiling is proof. Taking this back to Newman he knew that he would be better off having some happiness in his life with Francie He particularly did not want to end up like Tompkins What happened with him shook him up and by bringing Jake with him Jake was the one who saw the problems in Thompkins he could help even more people than before. It is an interesting film. 810 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Captain Newman M.D. 1963Almost twenty years after WWII a movie that reflected the growing public admission that there were many psychological victims from the war often ignored or minimized at the time unlike say Vietnam which was just unfolding and which demanded a different kind of accountability. And this one is set in the middle of the war though in an Arizona military hospital far from direct action.The star is certainly the title character played by Gregory Peck and Peck is his usual highly respectable self moral and a natural leader but likable and willing to take chances too. That is an ideal male in many ways the kind you might like to have as President or at least the chief doctor in your hospital. He is in particular in charge of the mental ward and his main intern played by Tony Curtis steals the show on purpose. While much of the movie is funny or at least peculiar enough to be ironic and wry there are moments of heartfelt tragedy and even heartwrenching trauma especially when a couple of the inmates go berserk. Third in line is a strong sympathetic nurse Angie Dickinson and these three run the ward with unusual verve and intelligence. It clearly is a case in favor of the military giving good psych treatment.There are several interesting patients as well as a band of Italian POWs brought in for some nice comic relief and for a reminder that people are people even if they are enemies. The most famous and unusual is played by Bobby Darin who I just saw in another movie from the period where he played a patient in an army psych ward the riveting Pressure Point. This is a whole different kind of movie though Darin's performance is strong in similar ways in both cases. Here he even plays an impressive ten seconds on the guitar and if you watch closely you'll see it's the real deal not recorded later.The color in the filming is unusually clear and vivid in a realistic way and Russell Metty behind the camera has made a number of really solid beautiful richly colorful films That Touch of Mink and Imitation of Life as well as the more earthy The Misfits. The lighting is usually fairly bright and broad though there are some scenes pumped up with shadows. A couple of shots toward the end are oddly filmed against an obvious back projections when they are rounding up the sheep which is too bad because otherwise the standards are very high. Director David Miller isn't especially legendary but he has one terrific film I'd recommend to anyone Sudden Fear made a decade earlier. Here he shows general high production values and a sense of humor mostly through the endlessly lively Curtis. A nice little colorful film with a gently persuasive subtext.".

	schema:reviewBody "Others have noted how this film's style hints of the blockbuster M.A.S.H. that would hit the silver screen in 1970 with its even greater blockbuster TV series that would rule the air waves for more than a decade. Perhaps it took another decade after this 1963 film which was still so close to the end of WW II and even closer to the Korean War not yet called a war for several decades before the American public could warm up to the idea of humor in wartime hospital settings. Captain Newman M.D. clearly set the stage and it did so in great style. And for its time it did so without a gratuitous Hollywood romance and without a running dialog of overly crude language that many filmmakers seemed to like once the language barrier was broken by the time of M.A.S.H. This is all to say that this film stands firmly on its own without extraneous scripting or gimmickry to lure viewers. The plot is excellent and has a perfect blend of humor seriousness and character study and development. Gregory Peck Tony Curtis and Angie Dickinson give toprate performances. Larry Storch Syl Lamont and the many minor roles are all very good. But I think three supporting actor roles stand out head and shoulders above all others. And that's what makes this film soar on top of the main cast and plot. Some have commented on Bobby Darin's role and a couple on Eddie Albert's role. Both were clearly worthy of Best Supporting Actor nominations for the year although only Darin got such a nomination. Add to that Robert Duvall for a firstrate early role in his career. Wow! What a tremendous film with great acting from a very notable cast. This film scores a 10 for the acting the subject the considerate way the script and direction handle such a sensitive subject and its overall entertainment. It's a classic and part of my war films library.This movie came out in December 1963. It was during the Cold War and not long after the Berlin Wall went up. I was serving in the U.S. Army in Germany at the time and didn't get to see many movies. I didn't recall this film at all and just learned of it in recent years.".

And that's what makes this film soar on top of the main cast and plot. Some have commented on Bobby Darin's role and a couple on Eddie Albert's role. Both were clearly worthy of Best Supporting Actor nominations for the year although only Darin got such a nomination. Add to that Robert Duvall for a firstrate early role in his career. Wow! What a tremendous film with great acting from a very notable cast. This film scores a 10 for the acting the subject the considerate way the script and direction handle such a sensitive subject and its overall entertainment. It's a classic and part of my war films library.This movie came out in December 1963. It was during the Cold War and not long after the Berlin Wall went up. I was serving in the U.S. Army in Germany at the time and didn't get to see many movies. I didn't recall this film at all and just learned of it in recent years.";

Fine support comes from Tony Curtis as a streetwise corporal and Angie Dickinson as a tolerant lieutenant along with Eddie Albert Bobby Darin and Robert Duvall as Peck's damaged patients.Without a doubt this is one that I recommend. Maybe it's not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird  a little silly at times  but still a solid look at the world with which the psychiatrist has to put up.Also starring Bethel Leslie James Gregory Robert F.

Albert is a crazed AirForce Colonel angry with Newman that then kills himself Duvall is a catatonic Army Captain that has problems to reintegrate to normal life even with his wife and Bobby Darin deserves a special mention because he was even nominated for an Academy Award. Darin stars as a shellshocked pilot that has his mind shattered because of his war experiences and his cured by a truthserum.Also James Gregory Vito Scotti Dick Sargent and Larry Storch are good in their roles.

If we get lost he tells a nervous Short we'll just pull into an island and ask directions. Whether he's rescuing Short and Place from a flooding shower stall Your folks were playing 'Hide the Salami' in the shower he calmly explains to their young son who promptly falls out of his chair or warning the family to keep an eye out for the Pirates of the Caribbean So you've been to Disney World Short quips...before pirates indeed attack the ship Russell's 'Ron' is a comic gem commanding the screen each time he appears.While CAPTAIN RON will never make anyone's list of 'Best Comedies' it is a pleasant diversion and if you're a Kurt Russell fan you won't be disappointed!";

The only problem is that they have to sail it from a small island in the Caribbean called Pomme de Terre to a port in Miami to have it surveyed in order to sell. However once they get there they find that the boat is in great disrepair and unable to sail it themselves they hire a local sailor named Captain Ron Kurt Russell to help them out. What they don't realize is that Captain Ron is a complete idiot and is liable to get them all killed before they ever get to Miami. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that a friend recommended this movie to me many years ago and upon eventually watching it I found it to be as good as he said it was. I especially liked the acting of Kurt Russell who was absolutely hilarious.

Not to mention Lee Marvin in Cat Ballou John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn and the best of all Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen.Martin Short and his wife Mary Kay Place inherit a yacht that was once owned by Clark Gable and I'm sure if the boat could talk it could tell some fabulous tales. It's in dry dock in The Bahamas and in need of repair to put it mildly. But fix it and flip it as they say in today's world and get someone to pilot it to Florida.Who Short and Place get is Kurt Russell the legendary Captain Ron who's seen and done all. At least according to him and the tales get taller as Russell imbibes. But he sure has Place enchanted their daughter Meadow Sisto is a believer and he's really got their young son Benjamin Salisbury ready to go to far away places with him.I won't go into it but the castaways on Gilligan's Island never faced anything like what Kurt Russell puts Short and his family through in their '3 hour tour'. I'm sure Clark Gable and Carole Lombard and anyone else whoever sailed on this craft never had a saga like Short Place and their kids have.Everyone performs well and I have to say Martin Short must have been a great sport about essentially being Kurt Russell's straight man. As for Russell you can see what attracted him to the part a chance to have a seven course meal on the scenery and not be criticized for it as the role calls for it. It's an actor's dream.Kurt Russell is having fun and the fun is infectious for the viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Captive' is about a group of tourists abducted by alQaedalinked Abu Sayyaf from a resort on Palawan in 2001. They were shipped to Basilan in the far south and then herded through the jungle for over a year. Some paid ransom money calculated on their profession and country of origin and were subsequently released some died from strain or disease some were killed by Abu Sayyaf some by the army in repeated rescue operations of which the last and bloodiest succeeded.The film drew a lot of fire from the press first of all because it was rejected by both Cannes and Venice which created a somewhat toxic whiff  after all Cannes built Mendoza's reputation with his win for 'Kinatay' so how bad could his first decently budgeted film be? As it turns out it's not half as bad as could be expected. Mendoza avoids two mistakes he could have easily made first of all the camera isn't glued to Isabelle Huppert's face even though she's the first star he's working with he allows her character to gradually emerge from the group of hostages which becomes decimated by disease ransom payments forced marriages as a shoddy excuse for rape and deliberate execution. And second he does not sweeten his barren naturalistic photography one bit because of the scale of the production 'Captive' is every bit as Cinema Verit as his earlier films. If anything the money allows for some disjointed wildlife intersections which however fulfill a dramatic purpose when for instance a lizard is seen hacked in two by a machete instead of the head of a hostage being chopped off.This kind of film language won't convince those who have their established ideas about what a Filipino film looks like  and to illustrate how fixated these ideas have already become another section of the Berlin Festival screened the film industry parody 'The Woman in the Septic Tank'. In that context I would count myself among those who appreciate that Mendoza who established these conventions tries to move onwards stylistically.However the story structure certainly puts the viewer's patience to test. There's zero background information about Abu Sayyaf and the domestic conflict in the Muslim populated islands in the south of the country. In one scene villagers feed hostages and captors alike and receive some money for their troubles making it seem that they are somewhat regarded as freedom fighters whereas in reality they also raided and killed Muslim locals. In the film Islam is used as an 'excuse' for criminal actions which is probably not so far from the disturbed mindset of these people but leaves room for controversy.The photography's realism makes the differences between truth and fiction appear a bit questionable Why for instance was the American hostage who was later beheaded cast with a Caucasian actor instead of a Hispanic one as it was the case? Also the Abu Sayyaf were far more ruthless in their dealings with hostages negotiators and villagers alike  while their brutality comes across most of them seem strangely boyish. That Huppert's character is fictitious may be explained by the logistics of the production but since much of the story follows reallife survivor Gracia Burnham's book 'In the Presence of my Enemies' it feels a bit unfair that her character is sidelined in the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as part of the the Competition section of the Berlinale film festival 2012. Running time was exactly 2 hours in my opinion much too long given its contents. On the plus side we had interesting shots of the jungle we met all sorts of small and large animals and we observed native ways to cure wounds. It helped us pass the time yet a fair bit of editing away some scenes would be helpful in appreciating this film.The story is based on the Abu Sayyaf kidnapping 2001 of a group of tourists from the Dos Palmas Resort in the province of Palawan. One of them got through the whole ordeal and wrote a book about her experiences. During the first four days the full group was cramped together in a small boat. The rest of the journey covers a whole year finding ones way through the jungle a seemingly endless series of moves from village to village.The first days after the kidnapping exposed linguistic as well as culturalreligious differences. The latter was clearly demonstrated when a box full of bibles was thrown overboard deemed useless ballast by the kidnappers. Another example was when a Christian group member loudly insisted on burying a fellow member though they really had no time for it and leaving the body behind would have improved their chances for survival. There were more such cases each offering the chance to feel with both sides of the argument.The journey itself took more than a year. It is difficult to imagine how a civilized person can survive that long devoid of any preparation or training to cope with that environment. The ordeal is not easy to watch from your comfy chair from time to time pondering how you would behave yourself in such a situation most other times considering yourself lucky to be at a safe distance.Starting with small time jumps in the beginning zooming in on the group and its cultural differences it was not more than logical that time jumps became larger and larger near the end the last 20 minutes covered day 157 and day 220.The hostages are clearly a trade object. Gradually it grew smaller during the journey due to ransoms being paid. Some group members were out of luck however because of their homelands like the US having a policy to never comply with ransom demands. And of course there were casualties some from fever or after an accident while others were killed during encounters with the army because of mostly failed rescue attempts.All in all I cannot recommend this film. I appreciate the effort made in showing us the jungle the people living there and various strange to us beliefs and traditions we observe. No effort at all is made to clarify the relationships with the army indeed rescue attempts or is there more to it?. Similarly I wondered how the kidnappers are regarded by the inhabitants of the successive villages they visit friend enemy neutral?. Or are they simply tolerated while they carry the most gun power? And which rule in which religion or culture deems a forced marriage to be an acceptable alternative for rape? This may seem a recommendation to increase the running time of this film even more than it already is in order to make room for such additional information. But that need not be since some scenes can easily be shortened without missing anything for example the convoluted way they occupy a hospital.".

	schema:headline " Breath of fresh air for Brillante's filmography";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie tells the tale of the Dos Palmas Kidnappings Dos Palmas is the name of the resort located in one of the Philippines' tourist spots where the victims were kidnapped which occurred in Southern Philippines sometime year 2001 and lasted for several months. Several victims foreigners and Filipinos were held hostage by Muslim bandits the Abbu Sayyaf and brought into captivity in the mountains. The movie didn't include the names of the actual victims. But places like the Dr. Jose Torres Memorial Hospital which was actually held under siege was included in the film. The movie didn't really feel indie to me despite the shaky cam poor lighting and unclear audio. Maybe because Brillante collaborated with some production companies which made it a bit more mainstream. And the overallall feel of the movie really was mainstream. It didn't have the usual Brillante signature of showing irrelevant random scenes. It was a total storytelling. This is surprising for someone who would usually raise her eyebrows to some of Brillante's scenes in his other movies which are pure RANDOM. The sex scenes there were none. There was one but it wasn't what you would usually see in Brillante's films. It wasn't explicit. Again surprising. Another reason why it wasn't as indie is the presence of some wellknown veteran actors of the country such as Angel Aquino Joel Torre and Raymond Bagatsing. It was probably done without so much costs by cutting their screentimes like some characters would just appear in the second half of the film. Usual indie personalities like Allan Paule Sid Lucero and Mercedes Cabral reminded me that it was a Brillante film. I don't think there's anything negative to comment about the acting part as the other lead actors especially Isabelle Huppert were also awesome. I like how the movie was very safe in its content. Note that we are dealing with one very sensitive topic here religion and I can say that the movie did justice in showing the other side of the so called antagonists. They're not really merciless individuals who would shoot for pleasure but they were provoked by their demands for autonomy If you're familiar with the whole Mindanao situation there's more to that but let's leave it at that as of now. The movie showed the other side of our Muslim brothers as opposed to the usual perception of them being heartless. Islam is one religion close to me and seeing how the movie accurately showed their practices and beliefs merits credit. One very strong point of the film is the nonuse of the overused WE ARE A POOR COUNTRY! statement shouting in almost all indie films. It's good they showcased another thing that's also present in the Philippines terrorism. facepalm Sigh. I can't fault the director though. They can't possibly paint Philippines in sunshines and rainbows when reality tells us terrorism is also around the corner. The movie is very graphic. There's a scene of beheading but it isn't as bad as what we see in the news. There's also this scene which deserves a standing ovation actual childbirth! It was very graphic it really showed how the child went out of the mom's organ. It didn't feel dirty it was just brilliant. My stomach plunged a bit but still brilliant. And speaking of graphic there's a closeup of a snake and whatever tonguestickingout thing he does! WTF. I had to rinse my brain at the thought of what that creature does. I have fear of snakes so I curse Brilliante Mendoza for that!!! Seriously. All in all I highly recommend this film. It's a good eyeopener. Heartwarming. Inspiring. Tragic. In so many words I love this film.".

In so many words I love this film.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is the very first film by Canneswinning Filipino director Brillante Mendoza that I saw in a movie theater. At the outset I am going to confess that I do not think I can judge this film very objectively. Watching this film with all its unsteady camera work made me very dizzy starting from the 40th minute. From that point I could not even look directly at the screen anymore. The shaky camera was relentless be it a frenetic battle scene or a quiet personal one. It certainly did not help that this was a 2hour long film. My head is still reeling as I write this review four hours after the end credits rolled! This is only the second time a movie made me feel sick the first one being The Blair Witch Project.The movie was based on the 2001 Abu Sayyaf kidnapping of tourists from the Dos Palmas Resort in the province of Palawan. Two of the kidnap victims then were Martin and Gracia Burnham. Gracia survived her ordeal and wrote a book about her harrowing experiences entitled In The Presence of My Enemies. I thought that acclaimed French actress Isabelle Huppert will be playing her but it turned out that Ms. Huppert's central character of social worker Therese is fictional. Another Caucasian couple played minor characters who seemed to be based on the Burnhams.After the abduction scenes in the beginning and four long days of sea travel the film became what seemed to be an endless series of hiking through the jungles of Basilan commandeering civilian places like a hospital or school getting attacked by the Armed Forces forcing a ceasefire by asking a victim to appeal and moving on to the next destination where the cycle began again. It became very repetitious. In between there would be interludes showing facets of Moslem culture or nature metaphors featuring wild animals. Since I could not look at the screen the whole time because of my dizziness and nausea I got confused what happened to various characters due to the episodic nature of the storytelling. How did the role of rebel leader played by Raymond Bagatsing become another one played by Sid Lucero? What was the point of having Coco Martin in a cameo? His look did not really fit into the film. I felt that was a little indulgent on the part of Mendoza. I fully appreciate the dedicated efforts of cast and crew in filming in such obviously difficult conditions. However the final product felt unwieldy and overstuffed. It seemed like they did not want any shot to end up on the cutting floor. The subject matter is heavy enough the senses need not have been assaulted any much more by the excessively shaky camera and the very loud explosions! I know Mendoza was most likely going for added realism for us to immerse into the hostage experience but I feel these vertiginous visual and sound effects should have been reigned in in kinder consideration to the comfort of the viewing audience.".

	schema:headline " Captive is a film about a long term kidnapping and hostage crisis based on true events";
	schema:reviewBody "Captive is a film about a long term kidnapping and hostage crisis based on true events that took place in the Palawan province in 2001. This drama begins with the hostage takers members of the Abu Sayyaf taking several people at gunpoint and quickly sailing off to their jungle hideouts. The captives are quickly assessed and their ransom values determined by their captors who are trying to maximize their profits and trying to avoid capture. The captives suffer a grueling and tortuous trek through the jungle with little provisions and no amenities while they hope for release or rescue. The rescue option however is fraught with danger as the captives are often caught in the crossfire between the government troops and the captors. This film thoroughly covers the plight of the captives but it also tries to shows us some insight into the minds of the captors as well. The film portrays the captors as violent of course but it also introduces the audience to their ideals and beliefs. In one scene a captor reads off a set of rules and explains some of the tenets of Islam. Some of the captors are even shown as hospitable and caring providing comfort items to the hostages blankets food and first aid etc.. One of the captives even starts liking one of the captors stating the he was just fighting for his freedom and that he was not really a bad guy Stockholm syndrome?. The film also shows us the realities of the cruelty of the Abu Sayyaf. Some women hostages are subjugated being forced to marry the captors in some cases and having to endure sexual assault. One thing I would like to say about the movie is that it was hard to determine how the common people of the villages felt about the entire ordeal. In many scenes the militants happened upon a village and asked to be provided a place to rest and some food. I had a difficult time to figure out if the villagers were just being hospitable to the militants or maybe they were afraid of all of the firepower and the reputation of Abu Sayyaf. Maybe some villages were sympathetic to the cause. Either way the militants usually got what they wanted and tried to move on before being caught by the government troops. The one character that stood out to me was the young fighter that was befriended by the French female hostage. He was a young orphan and fell into the band of fighters as he had no family or other options. He was a fighter for Abu Sayyaf but he seems young enough that he could change his ways if only he had a positive influence nonviolent. I actually hoped that he would survive situation and reform his ways someday. One of the themes of the movie I would like to discuss is that of the underdog. Some of the militants in the film are depicted as sympathetic and almost heroic. The militants endure the same harsh environmental conditions that the captives are in and in some ways their suffering justifies the way they live. In their view they are the heroes freedom fighters against tyranny. The armed struggle of the underdogs is a prevalent theme in Philippine films. Many Tagalog films depict the same type of asymmetrical power struggle and romanticize the rebel way of life. Struggle and perseverance are key themes both depicted by the captors and captives.

	schema:reviewBody "What Captivity lacks in innovation it makes up for in style. Say what you will about plot holes and struggling performances but the film looks beautiful sounds great and the atmosphere of the film will stay with you. Elisha Cuthbert's character is shallow but appropriately so as a naive fashion model who even while in the deepest pit of misfortune doesn't quite grasp what's going on. She keeps close to her teddy bear apologizes for no apparent reason and cries single tears... never ceasing to look picture perfect. This is one gripe I have with the film. The leading lady should show a little more wear and tear in my opinion. I understand that the writer of Captivity claims to have based the character on Paris Hilton and while I don't entirely believe that that's what the film was aiming for it's an interesting comparison. In light of Hilton's recent incarceration it's also a bit of commentary however unintentional on our culture's fascination with celebrities the desire to be close to them and to possess a piece of them.The looming black gloved torturer is a smidge clich but it does the trick. It's a genre film and certain symbols are to be expected and forgiven. Again the set and sound design are spoton and that carries a lot of weaker areas through to the end.The editing is very choppy due in part to the fact that a large portion of the original movie was removed and replaced with new material shot long after the original version ended production. The result is a cutandpaste appearance which actually works quite well given all the time Cuthbert's character spends going in and out of consciousness. It's almost an art film effect hypnotic and disorienting.".

Call me a dumb violence seeking goon but these movies are entertaining. What's this got to do with Captivity? Well nothing really. I was drawn to this movie because I thought it was going to be another retelling of this sick subgenre of horror that I do so love. I was sadly disappointed because this absolutely is not a torture porn movie. It would have been much more honest of the production company After Dark Films to say it was a thriller with slight torture porn inklings very slight.Maybe the folks at After Dark didn't actually see the movie. What I saw was psychological in nature and dealt much more with assaults on the mind of those captive than it did with actual assaults on the bodies of those captive. Yes there is some blood and some nasty gore but nothing like Saw or Hostel or even Touristas. Understand that if you don't like Saw Hostel etc. then this is a good choice for a horrorthriller to go see this weekend. Now that that's out of the way I'll just say It's not a great movie but adequate. A solid Bmovie endeavor. Fun kind of stupid at times pretty good acting by the luscious Elisha Cuthbert for the guysyour girlfriends might get jealous and the director Roland Joffe best known for The Mission The Killing Fields imbued the entire film with a look that worked very well to be creepy and ominous. It moves fairly quickly lags a bit in the middle and ends with a slightly predictable twist but really you don't care at that point because surprise you've been entertained. Well at least I was even though my hunger for gore was only slightly abated. B".

	schema:headline " Adds nothing new but it's a hell of a lot better than the Saw sequels!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that I probably wouldn't have gone to cinema to see this film if it wasn't for all the unneeded controversy surrounding it's marketing campaign in the USA but I guess that's a good thing as it shows that the people who initiate that sort of thing usually just end up helping the film in question to reach a wider audience. I have to say that whoever it was that made such a fuss about the posters did me a favour as while Captivity isn't exactly a modern masterpiece it's certainly a decent little horror thriller and I'm glad I went to see it. The film focuses solely around Jennifer Tree an actress who is abducted and thrown into a basement dungeon from which there is no escape and she is continually watched over by the psychopath who abducted her a man who also enjoys putting her through all manner of sadistic and brutal torturing. Hope arises when she finds a man in the cell next to her and together they attempt to escape from the dungeon. But as they face more sadism and torture it turns out that the situation isn't all it seems.This film is obviously catching on to the 'torture porn' film type that seems to be dominating the horror genre recently films such as Hostel and Saw being at the forefront but while this doesn't add anything new it is entertaining to watch and that is really all that is important from this sort of film. The film is surprisingly directed by experienced director Roland Joff whose only other film I've seen is the Oscar nominated The Killing Fields  and this is nothing like it! Though I'd say that's a good thing.... The screenplay was written by the great Larry Cohen who you can always count on for an entertaining thrill ride and while this isn't one of his best attempts I'd pretty much say he delivered it's better than Cellular too. The twist in the middle can be seen coming a mile off but that's not important either as the handling after the twist is good and with this Cohen succeed in racketing the film up a notch. Captivity is very short at just 85 minutes but I'd rather it be on the short side than feature a bucket load of filler like many films these days do. Overall I won't say this is brilliant or a classic but it's a more than decent horror thriller and I definitely recommend seeing it.".

Much as I enjoyed it this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film I've seen at the cinema an impressive claim as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen. The two leads Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst. Of course they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne  Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence. The plot to stretch the term slightly was thin to nonexistent and the 'gore' scenes whilst undoubtedly brutal were irrelevant and laughably formulaic. What plot there is revolves around a twentysomething model Cuthbert who is abducted imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. Whilst there really are very very few positives to draw from this film its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. Within twenty minutes the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. For my part I came out flushed with laughter buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling filmmaking. Whichever way you look at it this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film.P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film free...so I can afford to laugh about it. I was still tempted to ask for my money back...it really was THAT bad.".

Lets see an insane individual captures and tortures his her victim in inhumane ways seen it loads of times. More times then none it's a bad movie in this genre and this it just that. But what crappy movies make up for in script and acting is usually loads of gore this could have been pg13 I don't get why its not if they took out the f bombs in this done pg13 movie and it would have made more money reaching a younger audience. The acting also of Cuthbert is so cheesy and fake and all the event throughout the movie are unlike any other torture movies I've seen and that's not a good thing. I don't want to give anything away but I should give it all away so other people save their time and money. I'm going to stop there because all want to do is rip on this movie scene by scene. Also might add the garbage director seems to be obsessed with shooting off mirrors and windows its gives a real nice garbage view and its confuses you when he move form the mirror and films its straight on. Anyone in their right mind don't see this don't even think of seeing it because if you like this genre of film of kidnapping torturing and gore this movie is not that. it's a move of a dumb blonde and her dumb movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tortureporn has become immensely popular over the last few years. The Saw franchise has earned nearly 100 million dollars yearly since its debut back whenever the first one was released. Eli Roth's Hostel series has also been successful but hasn't entered public domain to the extent Saw has. So with the sudden success of this new brutish sub genre it isn't surprising that Lionsgate decided to launch its own film Captivity into the tortureporn sub genre. The result is well horrifying just not in the way intended. Captivity is a vile and worthless piece of cinema whose offensive material is only matched by its woefully inept production values.The film's protagonist is Jennifer Tree played by 24's Elisha Cuthbert a fashion model in spirit of Paris Hilton and the like. She is drugged at a promotional event by an unknown assailant and awakens in a mysterious room. She is exposed to various forms of physical and psychological torture including drinking a smoothie composed of various facial organs being drenched with an acidic substance and being forced to murder a dog. Throughout this entire process Jennifer is exposed to recorded interviews she has given in which she describes her fears and inhibitions. Her captor also entertains her with home videos of victims who are brutally tortured. Eventually Jennifer meets another prisoner named Gary with who she bonds. They attempt to escape and reach the captor's vehicle before sleeping gas emerges from the air conditioning vents. They awaken in a torture chair and Gary's molar is forcefully removed by the stillinshadows villain. After they return Gary and Jennifer copulate in the darkness and Gary leaves their nowshared cell with a key! Gasp you guessed it he is the villain! However his brother helps him with his hobby. Gary admits to his brother Ben who is introduced for the first time that he is falling in love with Jennifer. Ben doesn't like this plan and Gary kills him.A few minutes later the police arrive looking for Jennifer and Gary kills them. Anyone with any understanding of police culture will recognize how poorly these officers act. They allow Gary to leave the room for tea and ask to watch a ball game Maybe police training academies should show this clip on opening day. Anyway Gary returns to Jennifer's cell and admits he has killed the captors. He leads Jennifer upstairs but she discovers the slain police officers. Gary then chases her because she has discovered his secret and she kills him. She walks out and the film ends.As you might guess Captivity is a dark film but not a literary dark. It's literally a dark film. The first half of it shows Jennifer's or Gary's face in total darkness but with a beam of light focusing on her or his face. The background is nearly invisible. There is hardly any accompanying music to alleviate the difficulty of focusing on one point in the image I found the problem to be magnified when viewing the DVD on an HD television. At least the film brightens in its last half. Furthermore there is no expository detail provided in the first half of the film. Jennifer is abducted and we are forced to somehow sympathize with her. If only we knew anything about her maybe just maybe we could do that. The only information we are given about her life occurs via the interviews Gary plays for her. We also don't see Gary or maybe Ben?as the torturer until later in the film. So our freak show has no reason for wanting to kidnap her.The film does improve a little in its second half. When Gary appears Jennifer actually speaks something intelligible but most of the dialog until the ending standoff is whispered. You'll be adjusting the volume the entire time to hear what they say. Even though they speak we still learn nothing about either character. Gary isn't given any reason to torture his victims. His brother Ben is even more poorly developed than he is. Ben appears to tell Gary not to fall in love with Jennifer and then dies. Why is Ben even there? He doesn't add anything meaningful to the plot nor does he foil another character. Also the police officers are equally unimportant. They too are killed off before they can do anything meaningful to the story.Captivity has been seen as a pseudofeminist film and also as a critique of pampered female celebrities. While I applaud the effort if there was one from director Joff this film isn't either. Gary is revealed to have several other female victims. He keeps a detailed photographic journal of his endeavors. Perhaps he has a scientific curiosity about how soon women will give into consensual sex but it isn't clear. Jennifer nevertheless triumphs over him but the other victims hadn't the same luck. One woman's success doesn't justify several others' deaths. Jennifer's own personal torture doesn't acceptably critique celebrity culture either. Such inhumane treatment isn't effective individual criticism.When watching Captivity I couldn't help but notice its similarities to Eyes without a Face. Both films involve a young woman being held against her will and female disfigurement but the Eyes without a Face is an effective horror film. It balances its grisly images with proper character development chilling music and an eerie atmosphere. Captivity fails in all the aforementioned ways and the final result is a disgusting and bloody film. Final Consensus zero stars out of ".

I've seen something similar on a looney toons cartoon. 3. when the glass wall between the two captives is painted they have to yell and mime to each other though small scraped areas but when the area is scraped bigger the seem to be able to hear each other better too. 4. After yelling through the scraped area to each the male prisoner simply moves upward to speak normally to her through a vent. 5. as they are speaking in this scene he uses a match that can burn out and then reextend itself. 7. the unrealness of the calm almost normal how did you get here? conversation seemed horribly out of place. 6. after this scene then can just talk to each other normally through the glass and even from across their rooms. 7. with all this conversation between each other why did he not say anything at the beginning when the girl freaks out and screams her head off? 8910..... too many to list but fun to watch to see how many you can pick out. the whole film is kinda like a where's waldo of bad scenes.

Story Genre a Torture Horror a Suspense Thriller a Psychological ThrillerThe Story centers around two young people as they Endure endless tests of their inner strength It is disclosed that the tests hold a much deeper meaning as fears must be faced those unthinkable situations are presented.The movie held my interest as I learned more about their backgrounds and the very small hints only to the identity of the bad guys The characters were nicely portrayed and the plot was smoothly played out. Elisha CuthbertThe main female character was beautiful she had a helpless kitten way about her yet knew underneath she had a tiger that could emerge and attack. Daniel GilliesThe lead male wow now this guy is going to go far he can surly act with the best of them. He is built he has a confidant take charge manner with a gentle touch. He has an air about him almost aloof. I only felt a mild sense of boredom towards the middle it seemed more focused on trying to get a sex scene in the movie than the actual story line. And I found the many actual torture scenes to be enough to keep me squirming in my seat. The ending blew my mind I thought I had it figured out middle way through but was totally wrong Lol very well done. Even though the actual plot is not totally unique I felt this time the character was much better able to keep the facade going longer thus keeping the audience in suspense longer. I felt very entertained after viewing the movie the rest of the night was spent in discussion of the movie pointing out each characters strong points and how each scene played out. I know I will be telling all my friends about the movie and seeing if they won't watch the movie and join the discussion and appreciation of the work of art.".

Story Genre a Torture Horror a Suspense Thriller a Psychological ThrillerThe Story centers around two young people as they Endure endless tests of their inner strength It is disclosed that the tests hold a much deeper meaning as fears must be faced those unthinkable situations are presented.The movie held my interest as I learned more about their backgrounds and the very small hints only to the identity of the bad guys The characters were nicely portrayed and the plot was smoothly played out. Elisha CuthbertThe main female character was beautiful she had a helpless kitten way about her yet knew underneath she had a tiger that could emerge and attack. Daniel GilliesThe lead male wow now this guy is going to go far he can surly act with the best of them. He is built he has a confidant take charge manner with a gentle touch. He has an air about him almost aloof. I only felt a mild sense of boredom towards the middle it seemed more focused on trying to get a sex scene in the movie than the actual story line. And I found the many actual torture scenes to be enough to keep me squirming in my seat. The ending blew my mind I thought I had it figured out middle way through but was totally wrong Lol very well done. Even though the actual plot is not totally unique I felt this time the character was much better able to keep the facade going longer thus keeping the audience in suspense longer. I felt very entertained after viewing the movie the rest of the night was spent in discussion of the movie pointing out each characters strong points and how each scene played out. I know I will be telling all my friends about the movie and seeing if they won't watch the movie and join the discussion and appreciation of the work of art.";

It's much more psychological dealing with mind games and phobias that make you think about what scares you at your core. It moves really quickly jumping into the action before the credits finished rolling and didn't ever let up till the end of course. It was totally demented and sick but didn't simply rely on gore. It's a smart movie that's shot really well so that it looks unlike other horror movies.I thought I would hate it but I actually liked it a lot. Elisha Cuthbert is quickly becoming one of my top five not that that has any bearing on my review here and there's a sex scene that is pretty smoking hot. But surprise surprise it's not an exploitive sex scene. There's actually some refined taste here exercised by the film makers.The biggest surprise for me was this I think women will really like Captivity more than the other movies in the genre because this comes more from a woman's point of view and is much more internal in the way it deals with fear.All in all I have to recommend this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't typically go for the horror genre and don't keep up with movie reviews but I got off work early today and feeling daring went to see Captivity. And.... it was awesome. I'm not saying it changed my life but it was just what I was looking for. I was worried about all the torture and gore that was supposed to be in it but it turned out to be much more about psychological tricks than blood and guts. On the whole it's really not that graphic which I'm sure for some people is a drawback but I prefer to go easy on the stomachturning so it worked out for me. The story is quite simple but sufficient. It is more of a framework in which a series of emotionally traumatizing challenges can be thrown upon our sweet blonde heroine. Her costar is a brooding mystery man and it's fun to watch them interact in their concrete cell under the streets of New York. Anyone requiring a complicated two hour saga that requires a lot of concentration and brain power should know that this is one of those along for the ride flicks and if that is simply embraced it's a pretty good ride.".

Some of the shots are in my humble opinion absolutely amazing. Director Roland Joffe' really has an eye for adding an ultimate creep factor through the intricacy of the set design and shrewd subtlety of the lighting. I got a couple of really good scares from this movie and it definitely has a high gore factor. If you are into gore and suspense this movie is just what the doctor ordered. For me it was a good mix of the two. The movie was able to kept me on my toes the whole time! Go watch it if you dare!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "CarNapping  Bestellt geklaut geliefert or Escapade or just Carnapping is a West German movie from 1980 so it had its 35th anniversary last year. The director and one of the two writers is Wigbert Wicker and he was somewhat successful with his works from the 1970s and especially 1980s. The title already gives away that this is a film in which cars play a major role. And this is also why I believe that you have to be interested in motor vehicles or probably even better really love them in order to appreciate this movie from over three decades ago. I am neither and this may be one reason why I was genuinely bored watching this. The plot was only interesting for half an hour to me and all the characters in here seemed so bland and uninteresting that I just never managed to develop an interest in the story or its protagonists. It probably also did not help that I did not know any of the actors and couldn't recognize any familiar faces in here. Very unknown cast and I think I have only heard of Desny before oh yeah and Hoven of course. I have to say that I was pretty glad this film did not make it until the 90minute mark as it dragged so much and had many lengths that i actually wished it could have been 60 minutes only. So yeah I only recommend this to people who love the 1980s who love German cinema and who really love cars. Guess there aren't really that many left where all this fits. I myself must say I am glad that carthemed films these days aren't frequent anymore compared to the 1970s 1980s and also early 1990s still. For this one here 4 out of 10 is still a pretty generous rating in my opinion. Major thumbsdown.".

The director and one of the two writers is Wigbert Wicker and he was somewhat successful with his works from the 1970s and especially 1980s. The title already gives away that this is a film in which cars play a major role. And this is also why I believe that you have to be interested in motor vehicles or probably even better really love them in order to appreciate this movie from over three decades ago. I am neither and this may be one reason why I was genuinely bored watching this. The plot was only interesting for half an hour to me and all the characters in here seemed so bland and uninteresting that I just never managed to develop an interest in the story or its protagonists. It probably also did not help that I did not know any of the actors and couldn't recognize any familiar faces in here. Very unknown cast and I think I have only heard of Desny before oh yeah and Hoven of course. I have to say that I was pretty glad this film did not make it until the 90minute mark as it dragged so much and had many lengths that i actually wished it could have been 60 minutes only. So yeah I only recommend this to people who love the 1980s who love German cinema and who really love cars. Guess there aren't really that many left where all this fits. I myself must say I am glad that carthemed films these days aren't frequent anymore compared to the 1970s 1980s and also early 1990s still. For this one here 4 out of 10 is still a pretty generous rating in my opinion. Major thumbsdown.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie isn't for everyone. There is little action no sex nudity or violence no voluptuous bodies no chase scenes the fastest anyone goes is on a tandem bicycle no glitzy special effects. There are very few characters at all nearly all dialogue comes from the five top billings and most from the two central characters the old men played by Duvall and Harris.Yet it is one of the most engaging and thoughtful films I've seen in a long time. It deals with aging in a realistic way that isn't morose or gruesome but instead pulls you into the movie as if you're one of the cast who just doesn't happen to have any lines. You are there for the entire two hours and you don't want to leave. You quickly care about these people as if they're your own family members and you move through the movie with them.Neither do you want to miss a line. The acting is superb all the way around. Duvall's performance is incredible. I didn't come to IMDb today to write a review I came to see if Duvall won an academy award nomination for his performance. I'm disappointed that this film appears to have won no awards at all. This is probably more a result of the film's poor box office showing than the quality of the movie it only grossed 231700 not enough to even pay the crew let alone the cast. It's a shame that quality films such as this can't draw enough of an audience to be successful or to even attract enough attention from Academy members for them to even see it and vote on it.If you didn't know that Duvall was in this film it might take you awhile to even realize it's him. I can't say enough about it and am not a good enough movie reviewer to do his performance justice. I hope you'll just trust me on this one and rent this film. It's worth seeing for Duvall's work alone. The rest will be gravy.But what tasty gravy it is. If you like movies that draw you in and present characters who are real whom you care about who change before your eyes in ways you can relate to and understand then you'll really like this movie. If you like movies that change you a little that teach you something about life without being at all obvious about it that don't try to manipulate you that are sincere that elicit a range of your emotions without playing you like a cheap fiddle then you really should see this.I'm also disappointed in the movie's rating here on IMDb. I notice that the raw numbers are much higher but the IMDb special formula has adjusted it significantly downward to factor out the village idiots. While I'm sure there's a good reason for IMDb's secret adjustment formula and that it is appropriate for many situations I can't imagine that this is the kind of movie for which village idiots would try to stuff the ballot box. Most people who voted for this movie gave it very high ratings7 to 10and I'd recommend that you believe them. Wrestling Ernest Hemingway is a quality movie with broad appeal that will leave you feeling very glad you invested two hours in watching it.".

This is a just a small easy sliceoflife drama  a perfect example of a good little movie the kind to watch on a Sunday afternoon with someone you love. An actor who never stops taking chances and a master of understatement Robert Duvall slides into his role of a humble honorable respecting Cuban so perfectly here and he's complemented by excellent work from Richard Harris as the wellmeaning but coarse drunken loudmouth exsailor in the park he befriends out of a need to simply not be alone anymore. Because of their mastery we grow so attached to these fullyformed characters that it honestly hurts to leave. The film is exceptionally wellpaced and written with fresh dialogue and immensely touching observances. There's a scene where Duvall learns his favorite waitress is moving away Sandra Bullock with appropriate charm and the expression on his face and hesitance in his speech rips your heart clean out. Then there's the buried disappoint on his face when he sees her reaction to the farewell gift of vodka suggested by Harris. Where Duvall has his junior league baseball games and poignant dancing in his apartment alone Harris gets positively hostile towards a woman Piper Laurie in a movie theater where he works thanks to a spiffy haircut by Duvall and Shirley MacLaine also in his housing complex. The plot is thin but in the meandering vignettes there are superb moments like Harris accosting Duvall in the street about his fantasy of dancing whether it comes true you'll have to watch or later Duvall insisting that Harris be a welldressed gentleman at all times. The sentimental score and old time Cuban music enhance the movie it's quiet and wonderful  the years may fly by but the summer days are nice and slow. 910".

Each lives alone without any family around. They meet in the park at Franks' unwelcome prompting and with some real reluctance on Walter's part.  Shirley McClaine Coonie is the divorced motel landlord where Frank lives and they go toe to toe over one issue after another occasionally over a little Irish whiskey including whether or not she'll let Frank get his hands on her.  Sandra Bullock Elaine is Walter's favorite waitress at the Sweetwater Cafe and they exchange fond jabs each time he comes around.  Piper Lorie is a self respecting single lady on whom Frank clumsily works his flawed romanatic magic in their town's only movie house.At the center of this light drama is the unlikely and rocky friendship developing between Frank and Walter.  With the backdrop of a laid back little coastal town and moving to wonderful cuban music and rhythms each one of the characters and relationships unfolds a little at a time and begin to cross over one another.  Just as you get to know people in your life a little at a time these folks become more and more themselves as the story unfolds.The timing setting filming music and subtleties of the characters and the script work beautifully so that you fall right into it all.The ending is tender wistful and the characters just seem to go their own way.

	schema:reviewBody "Why is it that all the best movies never seem to make it big? Not enough explosions car chases exploding heads sex scenes? Sometimes it seems that way. Wrestling Ernest Hemingway got barely a moment in the theaters despite the presence of two heavy hitters like Robert Duvall and Richard Harris. It's a real sleeper.Harris plays Frank a downattheheels wreck of a dissolute old sea captain and Duvall plays Walter a retired Cuban barber  very fastidious and introverted and a bachelor. These two polar opposites alone in their old age develop a devoted but rocky friendship wherein they learn a lot from each other. The movie has a whole lot to say about loneliness friendship old age living life and caring and it says it in a strong yet understated and beautiful way.It is worth comparing with the glitzy and ineffective Grumpy Old Men which tried to be both serious and a comedy and failed at both. This is the serious' half of that movie done right even brilliantly.The odd title comes from Frank's story  repeated ad nauseum to anyone whose ear he can grab  about how he once wrestled Ernest Hemingway in 1936. The screenplay is touching in a restrained way that is all the more effective for its restraint.  No tearjerker scenes to wring the emotion from the audience and yet it is more emotionally powerful than a lot of runofthemill hankietwisters. The plot moves to a predictably sad ending but then moves beyond that to a quiet reaffirmation of life.The acting is topnotch as one would expect although Duvall's Spanish accent is better than Harris' American one. In particular I cannot speak too highly of Duvall in this role. This is the direct opposite of the Great Santinitype roles that he does so well and he is astonishingly effective in playing this fastidious gentle shy repressed softspoken old man. It is a joy to watch him make this character real.I once heard some critic remark that one mark of a good movie is if you find yourself caring about the characters. On that scale this movie is 12 out of a possible 10.Shirley MacLaine and Piper Laurie put in wellturned performances as well as Sandra Bullock in an early appearance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though Duvall's fake middle class Cuban accent was not right on the money all the time he portrayed his obsessivecompulsive retired gentleman character's odd and gentle affectations to the letter and was totally believable and the best thing in this movie along with Shirley Maclaine in her toughnice landlady role as Cooney. Duvall played his character Walt as an intensely honorable man raised in the strictest form of old Spanish gentilhombre tradition prevalent in preCastro Cuba. He left Cuba for America to see the Yankees in the 1958 World Series and never returned as the Communist revolution occurred at the same time preventing his return. As he was a true gentleman when there was such a thing he was not to be personally insulted or touched in anger by any man or be at all discourteous to women or tolerate such behavior by other men and any such coarse behavior in his presence was sure to cause an altercation and perhaps even a physical one. To him true gentlemen were protectors of the innocence and dignity of women in his welldefined world of gentility and respect.Harris' sloppy and crude character Frank who was achingly lonely but showed good reason for his aloneness in his selfishness and eccentricity was sure to aggravate Walt in short order with his cursing and coarse behavior. Harris' role was really not too much of an acting stretch for this famous rounder in real life but he was still very effective in conveying the angst of loss of a meaningful life and family love.Their short friendship leading to the inevitable conflict was so touching and sad in its honesty and spoton emotional accuracy when men of a very different style finally clash and part. The same or similar thing has happened to many of us at one time or another in life so most viewers will connect with its truth and emotional impact. It was nice to see them reconnect after Frank essentially apologized to Walt in the only way he could obliquely.The film had a relaxed and almost retired pacing never boring to me but perfectly in tune with day to day retired living in the Miami area or anywhere. Three scenes of the men together were particularly memorable for their sensitivity and insight.... the fireworks scene the haircutshave scene and the scene where Frank apologized to Walt after their argument and afterward they both danced with little girls in a park. Watch for these scenes as they come up as they are crucial to story development. Just great filmmaking.This film was one of the best I have seen in depicting how differing people retire from useful professions and then fade from being productive social contributors into their respective more or less useless retired ways with some fighting and struggling the whole way and others accepting their fate with gentleness and realization of the inevitability of life. We are all like these film characters in some ways or will be and seeing in the film what awaits us all in an older age was not always a pretty sight but it was always very engaging and touching. We truly cared for the characters in this film....the primary mark of a successful story.A wonderful film not to be missed by anyone over 50.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a big fan of Richard Harris but he unfortunately hasn't had interesting roles very often. Camelot was endearing Wild Geese was entertaining Cromwell was interesting but none of that showed his real power as an actor. This movie does at last! Alec Guinness said once that true comedians are theater actors because we don't see their faces upclose and they can act a different personality than themselves whereas cinema actors are often shot very close and therefore they show much more their own self think about Jimmy Stewart certainly very close from his characters. I think that Richard Harris was also very close to the characters he embodied and it makes me like him even more.But let's talk about the movie it's very well shot edited adapted superbly acted. The storyline is very well developed with an amazing character study very profound and very moving. Technically it's not very far from deserving a 10 out of 10 but I may give this grade for personal reasons because the movie touches me particularly. It talks about loneliness and the aging of the body the frustrations from both. Harris meets Duvall also amazing and become friend with him. Both are very lonely. Harris waits for his son who is living faraway and who planned to take him to the fireworks for the 4th of July. At the last minute the son cancels his visit. It leaves Harris devastated with disappointment and sadness. Maybe the character that Harris plays hasn't been a very good dad and this maybe why the son isn't very kind and caring with him but what about forgiveness? We obviously pick side for Harris' character because despite his flaws he's touching and endearing. I live very far from my dad he's back in Europe. He's aging he's lonely and even if we get along very well and I have nothing to reproach to myself I feel sorry for him and this movie reminds me of his life and breaks my heart. I am still young but I have known loneliness and I can imagine the difficulties of having an aging body. It scares me like most of us I presume. Watch this movie if you want to know a little bit more about life.".

The film takes place in Florida and traces the unlikely friendship that develops between a straightlaced Cuban retired barber Robert Duvalland a freespirited independentminded retired naval officer Richard Harris who brags to anyone who will listen about his wonderful relationship with his son who in reality is just too busy for him. This warm and engaging character study is not so big on story but on the relationship that develops between these two diversely different people who eventually find a way to connect with each other. Harris in particular is just remarkable in his gutsy totally unhinged performance that should have earned him an Oscar nomination. There are effective supporting turns by Sandra Bullock as a waitress Duvall has a crush on Shirley MacLaine as Harris' landlady and Piper Laurie as a local lady Harris fancies but this movie is mainly an acting showcase for two of the best...Robert Duvall and the sublime divine and deeply missed Richard Harris.".

He and Robert Duvall do a remarkable job of showing the joys and evils of aging complete with forgetful son.  For those of us on the same road and who is not this is a nice walk down prememory lane shades of 'Minority Report'.Harris and Duvall both play understated roles although I am inclined to think the boozing memories of Harris may be drawn from real life.  Duvall plays against type as a retiring modest withdrawn Cuban barber and the loving breakup they have is as heartbreaking a scene as you will ever see. Their loneliness is made so palpable it reaches out from the screen and grabs you.For us women the work of Piper Laurie and Shirley MacLaine are also reminders of how we age.  I wish they had put a movie with the young Piper Laurie in it up on the screen instead of one of her contemporaries.  She was acting as though she were still a beautiful young coquette which was not sad or demeaning but really cute.  Shirley does a great acting job as she relives the drunken abuse of her husband at the hands of a drunken Harris....yet reaches out to him as he falters and realizes the constraints of age.Certainly a great way to leave the scene of the living.  I strongly suggest it to you.".

It's not and if you're looking for a good movie don't watch this one.Sure Robert Duvall has a pretty good accent as a Cuban retiree and Sandra Bullock is well cast as a lowclass but kindhearted waitress but this movie is pretty bad. It could have been so much better if the screenwriters had thought a little longer. For example at the start of the film Richard Harris keeps talking about his son and how excited he is to see him for a visit. Wouldn't it be an interesting twist if Richard's son was dead but he had Alzheimer's and didn't remember? Or when Shirley MacLaine complains about her exhusband wouldn't it be clever if Richard Harris was her exhusband and that's why she's always hostile towards him? I won't spoil anything but this movie isn't very clever or twisty.It's also pretty depressing. Richard's always talking about how lonely he is and when he reaches out for companionship nobody likes him. It's not very inspiring to watch an old person living alone in a retirement community trying and failing to make friends trying and failing to have a romance all the while melting in the Florida heat because his apartment doesn't have a working air conditioner.If you like Richard Harris watch This Sporting Life. If you like Robert Duvall watch A Family Thing. If you like Shirley MacLaine watch The Apartment. You don't have to watch Wrestling Ernest Hemingway.".

Much has been written about Hemingway's sexual proclivity  the question of homosexuality. I see the questioned Hemingway in Frank's character a macho persona who overcompensates. His scenes with women are all aggressive not loving and has many failed marriages. In Walter's character Duvall I see a repressed man. Unable to live true to his nature he romanticizes his relationship with women. Does he really have a chance with Bullock's character? Has he ever closed the deal with a woman? There are a few sensual tender or close moments in the film namely the haircut and shave the synchronized swimming and the fireworks scenes and the type of bicycle they ride binds them metaphorically. Even the title's reference to wrestling could be metaphorical to an event that took place in Puerto Rico perhaps not with Hemingway perhaps not wrestling and perhaps not with a woman. The message if it is indeed there may simply be another unspoken element in the film. Which of course is the beauty of this film which I consider to be one of my top 100 of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few moviegoers would know that the real Caravaggio was a convicted criminal and even by today's standards a hell raiser. Rome's police records list fourteen citations in six years from public nuisance to several violent assaults. In May of 1606 he murdered a friend one Ranuccio Tomassoni in a sword fight. Added to these lurid details his sexual interests show that he freely drifted from the Vatican's ordained model. This makes Caravaggio an interesting person but a highly complex candidate for a biographic investigation on film.While Derek Jarman's film captures with delightful conceit many of the surface details of Caravaggio's life it's a work of startling genius because it succeeds on a far more profound level. Jarman tells the story of Caravaggio rather like Caravaggio would paint infusing it effortlessly with the central themes of his life's deepest convictions creating a portrait which reflects the subject and the artist with equal relevance. What's more many of the same themes that have been identified with both artists  sexuality transcendence violence censorship politics religioussexual and the tumultuous source of creative identity are present in both men. It works as very few films do. This is also an unusually accessible film for Derek Jarman. The performances are entertaining and it's filmed with astounding beauty and simplicity. This film is a masterpiece.However because of it's homosexual themes and personal tone Caravaggio is likely to be appreciated only by those viewers who weary of film as simple diversion and long for something more challenging. This is a powerful artistic statement but it flew under the radar during a decade of British filmmaking where Gandhi Chariots of Fire and A Room With A View represented the best of what was being made. While those films are great in their way this film value is greater in terms of bravura and personal expression. See it if you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "This beautiful visionary art film based on the director's take of the life of Caravaggio was worth the almost 7 years it took to make it. Derek Jarman had the brilliant sense to use Nigel Terry and Sean Bean as the lovers in this meditation on sexuality criminality and art. This film is more of a fictionalization on Caravaggio using the artist's works as a way to pursue the story of the artist. It is beautiful as are the actors and actresses and Sean Bean is a revelation in this very early role as he plays Ranucio the love interest of Caravaggio. When he is on screen he steals the movie as his animal magnetism sexual energy and wild persona grip the film and propel the story forward. This is an adult film with homosexual themes and might not be for everyone but if one is adult and has a sense of taste and loves art movies this is a 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "What we know of Caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and thieves and hustlers and put them on canvas. His works' themes were sex death redemption above all finding the sacred within the profane. He lived at a time where homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue normally involved fatalities in a society defined by the maxim strangling the boy for the purity of his scream.You can't fault Derek Jarman for his cinematography nor his recreations of Caravaggio's paintings and you certainly can't accuse the man of shying away from the homosexuality. But frankly Jarman never strays beyond 80s caricature. Italian patronage becomes the 80s London art scene complete with pretty waiters and calculators. Sean Bean is a sexy bit of Northern rough oiling his motorbike. Tilda Swinton performs a transformation worthy of a Mills and Boons Why Miss Lena without that gypsy headscarf you're beautiful.... Jarman provides Caravaggio with a particularly trite motive for the murder which left him exiled.This could have been a visually stunning treatment of a man whose life was dangerous exciting violent and decadent but who nonetheless elevated the lives of ordinary people to the status of Renaissance masterpieces looked on by Emperors and Kings. Instead what you get is Pierre et Gilles do Italy. The pretty bodies of young boys are shown to perfection but never the men who inhabit them. Jarman appears to satirise the London art scene showing it shallow and pretentious. To use Caravaggio and Renaissance Italy to make the point is to use a silk purse to make a pig's ear. In fairness this film remains visually stunning but ultimately as two dimensional as the paintings it describes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everything is divided in two concepts rule and transgression. That it's not a bad thing but for most people it's difficult to accept them to comprehend them and to make both things interesting. Most of the time we tend to only follow the rules and forget about transgression or even condemn it. Caravaggio was a transgressionist in terms of art with his painting evoking religious themes using as models simple people peasants prostitutes fishers creating powerful masterpieces and a transgressionist with his dangerous lifestyle sleeping with men and women getting involved in fights in one of these fights he killed a man reason why he ran away to other countries and then dying at the age of 38. Then we have a filmmaker an true artist named Derek Jarman who knows how to portray art on film breaking conventions trying to do something new and succeeding at it. To name one of his most interesting films his last Blue was a blue screen with voice overs by actors and his own voice telling about his life his struggle while dying of AIDS and he manages to be poetic real about his emotions and throughout almost 2 hours of one simple blue screen he never makes us bored. Who could be a better director for a project about the life of Caravaggio than a transgressionist like Jarman himself?The movie Caravaggio is wonderful because it combines many forms of art into one film capturing the nuances of Caravaggio's colors and paintings translated into the film art. It has poetry paintings music of the period of the story sometimes jazz music. All that in the middle of the story of one of the greatest artists of all time.This is not a usual biopic telling about the artist's life and death in a chronological order trying to do everything make sense. This is a very transgressional work very similar to Marie Antoniette by Sofia Coppola so it might shock and disappoint those who seek for a conventional story truthful to its period. And just like Coppola's film Caravaggio takes an bold artistic license to create its moments. Jarman introduces to the narrative set in the 16th and 17th century objects like a radio a motorcycle a calculator machine among others sometimes this artistic license works e.g. the scene where Jonathan Hyde playing a art critic types his review on his typewriter a notion that we must have about how critics worked that time making a comparison with today's critics but it would be strange see him writing with a feather even though it would be a real portrayal.The movie begins with Caravaggio played by Nigel Terry in his deathbed delusioning and remembering facts of his passionate and impetuous life his involvement with Lena Tilda Swinton and Ranuccio Sean Bean memories of childhood played by Dexter Fletcher and of course the way he worked with his paintings admired by everybody in his time.All of this might seem misguided some things appear to don't have a meaning but they have. I was expecting a movie more difficult to follow but instead I saw a truly artistic film not pretentious whatsoever that knows how to bring Caravaggio's works into life with an incredible and fascinating misenscene in a bright red that jumps on the screen with beauty. Very impressive. It's an unique and interesting experience. For those who enjoy more conventional and structured biopics try to watch this film without being too much judgemental you'll learn great things about the Baroque period because it is a great lesson about the period. For those who like new film experimentations or want to watch a Jarman's film here's the invitation. 1010".

You may be very distracted by the presence of jokey 20th century anachronisms in this otherwise grave movie about the artistic genius Caravaggio. 17th century merchants use handheld calculators modern instruments play at the parties local scribes use typewriters servants dress in modern dinner jackets. I sure don't know what it all means. I guess you can impute many meanings to it.You may also be irritated by the director in his insistence that everyone is motivated by homoerotic impulses. This facet of the presentation is really more about Derek Jarman than Caravaggio.Well I'm not sure that the movie has much to say about Caravaggio at all. After all Caravaggio shocked his era with his revisionist hagiography  saints with peasant faces torn clothes and dirty fingernails  probably realistic but iconoclastic in its time and contrary to a century of previous tradition. Moreover Caravaggio almost invented the modern system of a consistently represented light source showing the actual impact of light on his subjects. These key points are barely touched by the script.But I think you probably should just let those irritations wash over you and accept the movie for what it is. It uses the style and mood of his paintings to reflect his life and it incorporates that precise aesthetic into the movie's own visuals. The movie looks like what Caravaggio's own moving pictures might have looked like if he could have created them in 1600.Is it a good movie? Who knows? It's not so well remembered after a decade or so but it exhibits a memorable gift for creating and sustaining a mood and for breathing life into Caravaggio's canvases. It also speculates about the everyday life that must have circulated around the creation of those masterpieces.I was willing to forgive a lot of artistic pretension and rhetorical dialogue for the superb visuals and atmosphere and I took vivid memories away from the film. You may feel the same way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Derek Jarman has crafted a beautiful and unique work of art in Caravaggio. Perhaps the fact that I have a great love for the work of the real Michelangelo Caravaggio influences my judgment just a bit It was quite enjoyable to see the paintings come to life and to witness how they might have actually been created. In fact much of Jarmans poetic film has the look of a lush living painting. There is much to admire here besides the aesthetics the talented and beautiful cast led by Nigel Terry the intenselooking Sean Bean as Ranuccio and the elegant Tilda Swinton as Lena the woman loved by two very passionate and tormented men. The acting is all around excellent but Nigel Terry as Michelangelo really stands out. He is great to watch and brings life to a man the world knows not so much about. Also actor Dexter Fletcher was quite funny and likable in his portrayal of the younger Caravaggio. More than a historical biographical account of the painter this is more the study of a classic love triangle. Caravaggio's models were mostly street people many of them also criminals and it seemed that he often became personally involved with his subjects. His love for 'Lena' seems to be as strong if not stronger than his love for 'Ranuccio'. And this divided love has tragic consequences for all involved. I didn't find Caravaggio an overly gay film as the subject wasn't focused on obsessively like other films of this nature tend to do. The love affair between Lena and Michelangelo was given as much attention as the relationship between him and Ranuccio. Therefore those who might feel a little uncomfortable with the subject matter need not be as it is actually quite accessible. Recommended especially for admirers of the painter Caravaggio. As mentioned earlier there are scenes that are modeled exactly on the paintings. To see these come alive is really something to behold. There is a new region 2 DVD from Germany that features the most beautiful transfer I have ever seen of any film. It comes close to High Definition quality I recommend this as well.".

	schema:headline " A typically imaginative and highly idiosyncratic examination of the artist from director Derek Jarman";
	schema:reviewBody "Quite simply unlike any other biographical film you will ever see Derek Jarman's acclaimed production of Caravaggio 1986 is a lovingly constructed highly personal crossreference of tormented sixteenth century genius twentieth century iconography and a somewhat satire on the shallowness of the burgeoning eighties' art scene of which Jarman was very much part of. Exploring Caravaggio's life through his work the film distinctively merges fact fiction legend and imagination in a bold and confident approach that will probably leave serious art enthusiasts and casual viewers outraged by the complete disregard for accurate historical storytelling.Shot with a typically avantgarde approach directorwriter Jarman doesn't so much fashion a biography of the artist but rather creates a personal reflection of the man using intimate characteristics that appeal to his filmmaking sensibilities. This makes Caravaggio more of an interpretation of the filmmaker than the artist himself somewhat selfindulgently focusing on Caravaggio's struggle with bisexuality perfectionism and wanton obsession perhaps even glossing over the more intricate workings of the character for instance his own passion for art and his battles with the various religious and creative constraints of the period.It's a shame some of these ideas aren't further elaborated upon because at its heart Caravaggio is really an exceptional film. As I commented earlier it's perhaps unlike any other film you will ever see an iconoclastic vision with a cinematic imagination that knows no bounds. Caravaggio is a film in which a 16th century setting gives way to the various anachronisms of passing trains tuxedos motorbikes typewriters and chic nightclub settings. It is a film in which every frame is rendered in reference to the artist's work composed with rich shadowy colours that bring to mind the contrast between fresh and rotting fruit and an unrivalled interplay between sound and production design that is reminiscent in its intense savagery of two dogs angrily ripping each other to pieces.There is no other 'based on fact film' that has demonstrated such a wild and evocative recreation of reallife hysteria and events with the possible exception of Peter Jackson's masterful Heavenly Creatures 1994 or even some of Jarman's subsequent projects like Edward II 1991 and Wittgenstein 1994. With a cast of now very well known faces such as Nigel Terry Sean Bean Tilda Swinton Michael Gough Dexter Fletcher and Robbie Coltrane  not to mention some of the most beautiful photography ever committed to film  Caravaggio represents an impressive and enjoyable combination of art and cinema that is now twenty years on ripe for rediscovery.".

	schema:reviewBody "Caravaggio 1986It's easy to be frustrated by movie that seems by its title to be one thing but is so clearly something else. This is no biopic of the great artist. It doesn't even create to me a more abstract sense of what it might have meant to be such an artist or to be creative and tormented and a scrappy sometimes ill man. Instead it's a movie that uses some themes and some paintings of Caravaggio and builds a completely invented to my knowledge story line. For one thing it's set in some fairly recent timethe 1920s or 30s perhaps? And it's highly highly British which is no flaw but it feels part of a 1980s London underground in the expressions and vocabulary. If you can open up to all that you've made a first step. If you can't forget it. Run to another version like the terrific new Italian one from 2007.The second step is key too however for many of you. This is an overtly homoerotic or at least homosexually charged fantasy. It has no overt sex though there is lots of kissing all around and it does includes some female actors including a fabulous Tilda Swinton but there are lots of pretty boy scenes and a sensibility that is just frankly different than the usual film world mainstream.That's a great thing. That doesn't however make the movie completely work. It's worth watching if you are prepared for its tone and it's brilliant in some sense utterly original a kind of high production value high culture flip side to the films of Andy Warhol if that makes any sense at all. There are excesses in violence bloody death love corporal pleasure and corporal torturebut these are exactly what the 1980s were all about. Think of Robert Mapplethorpe. It's not my own world at all but I found it a kind of thrill to see made so rich and colorful so unexpected every turn. And so photographically beautiful. It is at times disturbing and moving but mostly it is pretty and fascinating. It lacks a more usual structure but you get used to that and learn to like it.".

This chaotic and bizarre interpretation of his life by avantgarde director Derek Jarman is like seeing art history on a bad acid trip. The story opens well enough around the year 1600 and I thought I was seeing things the first time I saw someone in a 20th century tuxedo. I scratched my head at the calculator but the motorbike and truck were too much. The use of anachronistic images and odd sound effects trains crashing ocean waves was too jarring and distracting for me. There is little dialogue and the narration was incomprehensible. As a fan of Caravaggio's work I did enjoy the scenes that showed models posing for his famous paintings but the rest  a montage of unrelated scenes showing his depraved lifestyle  was just distasteful and speculative. I learned nothing of the man and more about the director.Tilda Swinton made a memorable screen debut in the puzzling role of a young street woman and a very young Sean Bean is interesting as her companion but Nigel Terry was a confusing and offputting Caravaggio.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is No. 93 on the BFI's Top 100 and it was a great discovery for me. The only reason that I was even led to it at all was because it was on the BFI's Top 100. Caravaggio 1986 is a British film directed by Derek Jarman. The film is a strange sensual visually striking telling of the life of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio  with a great deal of poetic license.Jarman's movie is involved with the love triangle of Caravaggio Nigel Terry Lena Tilda Swinton and Ranuccio Sean Bean and dwells upon Caravaggio's use of street people drunks and prostitutes as models for his intense usually religious paintings. As with Caravaggio's own use of contemporary dress for his Biblical figures Jarman depicts his Caravaggio in a bar lit with electric lights or another character using an electronic calculator.The film is notable for its texture and attention to detail the intense performances and the idiosyncratic humor. By presenting Caravaggio as one of the founders of the chiaroscuro technique it helped give expression to the legend that was beginning to form around him. According to this film he died of wounds received in a knife fight. Jarman's Caravaggio also suggests that his legend ultimately eclipsed his enormous talent.Caravaggio was the first time that Jarman worked with Tilda Swinton and was her first film role. The film also features Robbie Coltrane Dexter Fletcher Michael Gough and Nigel Davenport. The production designer was Christopher Hobbs who was also responsible for the copies of Caravaggio paintings seen in the film.THIS Michelangleo is NOT the Italian Renaissance painter sculptor architect poet and engineer Michelangleo that we associate with the Medici Family in Florence the Piet the sculpture of David or the ceiling paintings of the Sistine Chapel. THIS Michelangleo emerged later late 16th and early 17th Centuries in Southern Italy. Little was recently known of him until his rediscovery in the 20th Century. Though he only left behind some 70 paintings he is virtually the father of Baroque painting. The original intention of this film was to make a conventional biopic of Caravaggio in Italy. However due to financial problems the filming had to be moved back to London. Here on a smaller budget and over a longer period Jarman loosely related events in Caravaggio's life by using imagined interactions of he and the models in his paintings. In this way much of the film centers on the daybyday workings in Caravaggio's studios ANDvery importantly to Jarman himself a painteron the paintings themselves. Thus this unique film recreates as part of its fabric Tableaux vivants of such paintings as Medusa Boy with a Basket of Fruit Bacchus St. Jermome and Saint Catherine. The entire film is told in flashback showing us Caravaggio's memories from his deathbed with his trusted lifelong assistant friend model and companion Jersualeme Spencer Leigh at his side. As revealed in flashback Caravaggio had purchased Jersualeme as a mute boy from his mother. From that time forward Jersualeme silently witnessedand participated inCaravaggio's life while preparing Caravaggio's paints brushes canvasses and set designs for his paintings.The structure of this film is never linear but rather made up of flashbacks within flashbacks. However one is never too confused since the paintings and their creation are always at the film's core. John Russell Taylor said of this film 'Visually almost every individual shot in..is stunning exquisitely composed in rich color and given plenty of time for us to appreciate its niceties.' Art and film lovers will love this film not only for its manylayered story and how it is presented but also for its acting photography Gabriel Beristain design and paintings Christopher Hobbs and Costume Design Sandy Powell. This is a film that should be seen over and over with more layers of meaning and visual beauty to be revealed by each successive viewing.".

I have watched many experimental ambitious and complex movies that demand much thought and attention from the viewer but this one was an inexcusable exercise in selfindulgence by the filmmaker. The voice overs contained language which was heartbreakingly beautiful and I wished that more of that intelligence and beauty had been transmitted to the rest of the movie. Instead we get a tawdry pastiche of softcore pornography which becomes so tedious that when another perfect male form was displayed I became numb and angry. One would imagine that Caravvagio created his work in a vacuum and that his art was a product of his violent and transgressive nature only. Having studied art and being an artist myself I was looking for some insight into this fascinating man and his revolutionary work. The scenes of him painting were unconvincing and the paintings in progress looked like amateur attempts in figuredrawing. I was able to wrest some meaning from Caravaggio but that occurred early on and the only reason I kept watching it was the thought that it would kick in and start making some overarching sense. Watching this would lead one to believe that Renaissance Italy was populated mostly by homosexuals with a strong predilection for violent sex and the clergy who exploited them for their private titillation. Caravvagio managed to demean the people it was trying to celebrate oversimplify a complex individual and bore and confuse its audience. Only recommended for a committed student of Jarman's work as the auteur was obviously more interested in himself than in the subject.".

Only recommended for a committed student of Jarman's work as the auteur was obviously more interested in himself than in the subject.";

	schema:reviewBody "Caravaggio 1986 was cowritten and directed by Derek Jarman. As a biography of the great Baroque painter this movie falls short. However it's full of exciting events color andyesactual scenes where a painter is working at his art. Most films about artists show everything but the art. This movie brings us into the artist's studio. We see the models we see him creating his paintings and we see the finished results. Caravaggio was the most gifted of the Italian Baroque painters. His artistic style influenced artists in all of Europe for generations. However his personal life was a disasterduels brawls murder and imprisonment. He died on a barren beach although his talent was recognized and he could have been wealthy and famous. Because he was so talented his patrons managed to keep him out of prison most of the time but after the murder he had to leave Rome. He wandered all over Italy and died in Naples far from his home near Milan.Several caveats about the film. It's bloody although not as gruesome as Longoni's film also called Caravaggio and also reviewed by me for IMDb. There's a good deal of suggested sex both homosexual and heterosexual. The director has chosen to add anachronisms for reasons best know to himself. Not only are these jarring but they are strange. If you're going to show a typewriter why make it an old Royal manual? Bizarre.The acting is uniformly excellent. The celebrated actor Nigel Terry plays Caravaggio and the equally celebrated Sean Bean is his lover Ranuccio. Tilda Swinton plays Caravaggio's muse Lena. This was Swinton's first acting role and she is superb. Even in 1986 her androgynous persona was in place. However in one breathtaking scene she has been given an elegant gown. She holds it up in front of her body and then suddenly lets down her lovely long hair. The androgynous look vanishes instantly and we see the extremely attractive woman emerge. That scene alone makes the film worth seeing.I saw the movie on DVD where it worked well enough. However this is a film I think would do better on the large screen. Caravaggio is a brilliant but flawed movie. It's worth seeing if you love Caravaggio's art as I do. It's interesting and it has flashes of brilliance. However if you want to get a better sense of Caravaggio's life and of the milieu in which he lived I would opt for Longoni's film. Bloodier and more violent but without typewriters automobiles and cigarettes.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was only after the first ten minutes I realised it was a biography and then another thirty minutes to notice the significant style of the film and I was pleased I watched it. Basically in the 16th Century in Italy there was Baroque painter Michelangelo Merisi Da Caravaggio Nigel Terry and this is a fictionalised for the latter amount of hoe he created some of his greatest works. The film begins with Young Caravaggio young Dexter Fletcher creating his first works including selfportrait styled Young Sick Bacchus before moving to his adult days where he became a highly regarded Renaissance painter including many erotic works of art. It sees his relationships with models Ranuccio Thomasoni Sean Bean who posed in his paintings of St. John and Lena Tilda Swinton the three caught in a love triangle experts aren't sure whether Caravaggio was gay or bisexual. Caravaggio also dabbles in prostitution and uses these prostitutes drunks and people on the street to create some of the most magnificent pieces all oil paintings on canvas. All this goes on until the point where he is forced to murder Ranuccio with a knife in the neck and he dies of severe illness in 1610 with his best friend Giustiniani Nigel Davenport by his side. Also starring Garry Cooper as Davide Spencer Leigh as Jerusaleme Robbie Coltrane as Scipione Borghese Michael Gough as Cardinal Del Monte and Jonathan Hyde as Baglione. Firstly I'll start with mentioning the brilliant art pieces featured in the film most being religion and mythology themed they included Medusa I instantly recognised it Amor Victorious the naked angel and Entombment the final piece featured. Terry excels in the leading role of the artist Bean and Swinton as the smitten couple who connect with him are really good and there is a great supporting cast but what I loved most about this biopic was that it didn't stick to the conventions of period like your supposed to. Even though it is meant to be the 16th Century the film slips in some small background and foreground modern day things i.e. deliberate anachronisms e.g. tuxedos calculators cars Christmas lights magazines typewriters motorbikes swearing and much more besides that manage to fit themselves in the scenes they feature. I believe this technique and style is called Mise En Scne which I looked at a little in Film Studies it is a brush stroke LOL of genius by accessible director Derek Jarman and this absolutely deserves its place as one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die it is a brilliant nonconventional biographical drama.

	schema:headline " Gay love is mute in a society that rejects it.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film deals with a painter of great fame from the end of the Renaissance. It is the story of a man of course but also of his assistant. He literally bought a mute boy out of his misery when he was a small child and took him to his studio to work for him to grind his colors and prepare his paints. He will of course use the child as a model for some exuberant bacchic scenes overloaded with fruits of all sorts. The mute boy becomes the friend of the painter and little by little this friendship must have become love real love the mental and sentimental passion.On the other hand the artist is attracted by male bodies mostly but in the strength they demonstrate when they are fighting. So he is looking for violence muscular tension aggressiveness in males one body against another and some compositions of several men demonstrating their power in some scenes implying violence and cruelty. This search for violent brutality excludes love. It is pure desire and one of these men will have a tragic ending because he understood this desire required him to love the artist back and thus to do what he thought the artist wanted him to do. His mistake especially since it was killing a pregnant woman.The only one who has the right the artists granted him that right the duty the artists expected him to do what's concerned here the obligation even to love him back is the young assistant because that assistant was bought and is the artist's possession the only person the artist has the duty and the obligation to take care of as if he were his own child. And in this case it is real love from the artist to the assistant and from the assistant to the artist to and fro and back all the time. This assistant will bring the artist to his own death on his own death bed and he will be the only one able to bring him to death in peace to grant him death in a way though it will be for the assistant a tragedy a drama with a phenomenal solitude afterwards though this is not explored in the film. All other men the artists selects on their own strength are supposed to accept his love but definitely not love him back. They do not have that right because the artist only satisfies his own desire but never ever anything that has any real sentimental or mental dimension. He uses these men as satisfying actors in his sexual desire just the same way as he uses them as props in his studio to compose a scene that he can then paint on the canvass. Living and working close to the Pope Caravaggio is classified a sodomite but tolerated because of his art because of the marvelous paintings he can produce. But in this extremely sectarian and fundamentalistic society he is living in he is obliged to mind every step of his and pay for his privilege a very high artistic price. The result is that he is locked up in his sodomite closet and he has no way to get out of it. So his love is nothing but a perversion and he cannot expect from anyone to love him since it would be a perversion too. Then his love is reduced to a gross physical and violent impulse and he takes what he needs to satisfy this impulse he pays for it since it is nothing but a forbidden fruit that has a very high price and it is finished. Full stop. Period.And that is the moment when you start wondering about his assistant. Man cannot live without any love. If any love between two men is impossible as a permanent and stable relation you have to disguise this relation in a way or another. The mute assistant is perfect since Caravaggio got him when he was six or seven and he has a very clear function and position to satisfy. The relation is seen by most people more like the relation between a father and a son and the possible sexual dimension of it might very well never have been consumed. Art least this part was not important. What was important was the tears shed by the assistant when his master died when he brought him to death. I would easily say that any man longs for such a relation that is not and cannot be carnal. Men finds that in younger people who are their sons or close male relatives at times younger men who need some mentor or leader or adviser. It is love but draped in some age or cultural dependency that makes it acceptable. Such a relation will never be sexual because it would be antagonistic with what the passion it contains means.And that distance in time between Caravaggio and us is clearly identified in the film with all kinds of anachronistic sounds or objects electricity at the end of the 15th century motorbikes cars trains helicopters cigarettes etc. Has the world improved or is it still the same? I would say that in 1886 it probably looked pretty the same as around 1600. But it may also mean that luckily progress will bring some new way of looking at life and love.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

	onyx:emotionText "This film deals with a painter of great fame from the end of the Renaissance. It is the story of a man of course but also of his assistant. He literally bought a mute boy out of his misery when he was a small child and took him to his studio to work for him to grind his colors and prepare his paints. He will of course use the child as a model for some exuberant bacchic scenes overloaded with fruits of all sorts. The mute boy becomes the friend of the painter and little by little this friendship must have become love real love the mental and sentimental passion.On the other hand the artist is attracted by male bodies mostly but in the strength they demonstrate when they are fighting. So he is looking for violence muscular tension aggressiveness in males one body against another and some compositions of several men demonstrating their power in some scenes implying violence and cruelty. This search for violent brutality excludes love. It is pure desire and one of these men will have a tragic ending because he understood this desire required him to love the artist back and thus to do what he thought the artist wanted him to do. His mistake especially since it was killing a pregnant woman.The only one who has the right the artists granted him that right the duty the artists expected him to do what's concerned here the obligation even to love him back is the young assistant because that assistant was bought and is the artist's possession the only person the artist has the duty and the obligation to take care of as if he were his own child. And in this case it is real love from the artist to the assistant and from the assistant to the artist to and fro and back all the time. This assistant will bring the artist to his own death on his own death bed and he will be the only one able to bring him to death in peace to grant him death in a way though it will be for the assistant a tragedy a drama with a phenomenal solitude afterwards though this is not explored in the film. All other men the artists selects on their own strength are supposed to accept his love but definitely not love him back. They do not have that right because the artist only satisfies his own desire but never ever anything that has any real sentimental or mental dimension. He uses these men as satisfying actors in his sexual desire just the same way as he uses them as props in his studio to compose a scene that he can then paint on the canvass. Living and working close to the Pope Caravaggio is classified a sodomite but tolerated because of his art because of the marvelous paintings he can produce. But in this extremely sectarian and fundamentalistic society he is living in he is obliged to mind every step of his and pay for his privilege a very high artistic price. The result is that he is locked up in his sodomite closet and he has no way to get out of it. So his love is nothing but a perversion and he cannot expect from anyone to love him since it would be a perversion too. Then his love is reduced to a gross physical and violent impulse and he takes what he needs to satisfy this impulse he pays for it since it is nothing but a forbidden fruit that has a very high price and it is finished.

Elsewhere in Mexico her nineyearold son still sleeps soundly in his bed. Before she left him over four years prior she told him that should he ever find himself lonely and missing her that he need only look up to moon in the sky and know that she too would be looking and thinking of him. In that thought both the title and the dualistic tone are set for a surprisingly poignant piece about the borders that keep both countries and people apart. Director Patricia Riggen's UNDER THE SAME MOON is a brave film that proudly puts a face to an issue that has polarized America. While the main focus surrounds precocious Carlito Adrian Alonso as he crosses the USMexican border to find his mother after a family death leaves him alone his journey draws attention to the plight of a people who want only to pursue a better future for their families. It is soft and sweet one moment difficult and tense the next but always subtle and sensitive. Its significance is found in its simplicity  while our heart strings are being tugged our eyes are also being opened.When Rosario Kate del Castillo stares up at the moon the longing to be with her son is matched only in magnitude by the constant wondering if all of her sacrifice is worth the trouble. The contradictory nature of her existence is a heavy burden to bear. She demeans herself daily cleaning the house of a wealthy woman who treats her like a second class citizen and then has to clean another house and sew dresses nightly in order to put any money aside. As every hour of every day disappears without notice or meaning years go by without seeing her son. She must work so hard in order to provide him with the possibility of a brighter future and this sacrifice is truly great. For as she slaves away the days sure to always be on the lookout for the Immigration and Naturalization Service her son is growing up without her. She has foregone the potential of her own happiness and cut herself off from the one remaining source of joy in her life. The decision she made years ago to cross the border has now drawn another line between mother and son that she knows may one day be too thick to be erased.When Carlito stares up at the moon the longing to be with his mother is matched only in magnitude by the bewilderment derived from feeling abandoned. He cannot reconcile his mother's love still felt in his heart and the reality of their situation. Four years after she left his faith is finally faltering. While Rosario's daily renunciation is a testament to conviction and hope Carlito's mission to make his way from Mexico to L.A. gives the film a heartbreaking tenderness while still tersely telling the truth of his tale. A boy willing to go to such great lengths just to be with his mother may sound saccharine in nature but there is nothing sweet about a nineyear old hitchhiking in Tucson working wherever he can to pay for bus fare or nearly being sold into child prostitution. Ligiah Villalobos's lean screenplay never loses sight of the prize long enough to find itself off course but it is also never afraid to talk about the reality illegal immigrants must face on the streets of a supposedly great country. The dichotomy between sappy and serious is what makes UNDER THE SAME MOON so effective. While we want with great desperation to see mother and son reunite we are also exposed to the reality imposed by our own ignorance upon such innocent hopefuls. Once upon a time America used to be the land of the free. People the world over would immigrate in pursuit of the elusive American dream. Things are very different now. Now there is the threat of terrorism economic unrest and generally widespread panic and fear. To be foreign is to be frightening. All of our misconceptions dehumanize those involved and in a backwards fashion somehow glamorize the experience. UNDER THE SAME MOON is a fine refreshing film that gives a voice to those who are so seldom heard in a fashion that will allow it be heard by many. And for all the tears and warmth it brings to the viewer perhaps its crowning achievement is that all who see it will inevitably find themselves staring up at the night sky shortly afterward realizing that we all live under that very same moon no matter how many lines are drawn between us.".

	schema:reviewBody "This certainly lived up to expectations of being a nice movie an involving story about a young Mexican boy who sneaks into the United States to try to find his mother in Los Angeles. She had been in L.A. for four years and frankly I forget why. They don't dwell on that but there must have been a good reason since she loves the kid and viceversa.

That's a key to the story.When the woman's mother dies Carlito's grandmother who had been looking after the young boy the kid decides his options aren't good at that point and he needs to take a big chance to see if he can find his way to Los Angeles. Yes you have to suspend your beliefs here a bit as the odds on a kid actually being able to do that  all with no money!  are astronomical but it's fun to watch him on his journey and how he makes do with what little he has. Some of the friendships he makes are truly touching and in a way the best part of the film.While writing this it makes me flashback to the film The Straight Story when an old man on a tractor drives 300 miles across Iowa to see his longlost brother. He is befriended by many people along the way some who go to extraordinary lengths to help a stranger. That's the case here too.We also get a good profile of the mother her best friend and a wonderful man she meets during this story which takes place in one week. Each chapter of the film is broken down into days. Yes the film is slightly preachy concerning immigration but the story is so good that one forgets about the political aspect no matter side one is on.This is a pretty solidlymade film from directing to acting to the visuals but it's the story that will hook you in early on and you aren't able to let go until the end. The last half hour will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering exactly things how will turn out. That's good because it means the movie is entertaining. Definitely recommended.".

The story carries extraordinarily well with a subject as touchy as illegal immigration and cannot exist without it. Utilizing a theme of abandonment the movie explores what it means to truly care for and cherish a loved one. With brilliant acting Adrian Alonso is incredible! fantastic direction and a terrific screenplay the movie is a wonderful heartfelt journey that brings laughter sadness and a sincere sense of happiness into an enjoyable moviegoing experience.".

It's a lot better than a lot of the American movies that have been coming out weekly.

	schema:reviewBody "Sensitive director Patricia Riggen has in LA MISMA LUNA UNDER THE SAME MOON succeeded in creating a story about the travails of the illegal immigrants from Mexico that serves as a reminder to all of us that one of the reasons for the obsession to take the risks of crossing the border is an attempt to find a better life. While this story concept is by no means a novel one writer Ligiah Villalobos has provided a script that avoids taking sides but instead concentrates on creating wholly believable characters caught in the web of immigration  from both sides of the wall. This little film from Mexico is above all a film about love about courage and about resilience and is portrayed by a very fine cast in every role. Rosario Kate del Castillo is a single mother who crossed the border four years earlier in order to support her young son Carlitos a superb young actor Adrian Alonso and her ailing mother by working double jobs as a housekeeper in Los Angeles. She keeps in touch with Carlitos with weekly phone calls and sends him gifts as well as money and love. When Rosario's mother dies Carlitos takes life into his own hands and plans to cross the border with a little help from his experience with a wise old lady Coyota Carmen Salinas who aids immigrants. With his savings in his backpack and his heart aimed toward Los Angeles he sets out on his journey and is thwarted at every turn. He is picked up by two Hispanic students from the US America Ferrara and Jesse Garcia whose attempt to transport Carlitos is halted at the border  with the little Carlitos hidden under the seat of the now towed away car. Carlos escapes from the car in El Paso meets up with some illegal workers who are arrested leaving the hidden Carlitos with a reluctant companion Enrique Eugenio Derbez who is able to aid Carlitos reluctantly! to escape to Los Angeles. Through many 'jobs' and untoward situations Carlitos finally finds his way to the spot where he hopes he will meet his mother. The rhythms of the cinematography the sets the flavors of both sides of the border and the music that accompanies the film all contribute to making this story real and believable  and VERY touching. While Kate del Castillo is the major star of the film it is the performance by Adrian Alonso that remains in the mind long after the credits are shown. Some viewers may find this film a bit too 'novellalike' but the magic that Patricia Riggen pulls from her large cast and verismo directing style will touch the hearts of most everyone. A fine little reminder of the other aspects of the Immigration topic! Grady Harp".

Because of her move to the U.S. she lives in constant fear of not doing the best for her child and to make matters worse her little boy feels like he is not wanted anymore. Things become worse as events develop in such a way that he is forced to follow the path of many other immigrants and endure a series of ordeals to reunite with his parent.Along the way we are witness to many situations undocumented aliens are exposed to and the film makes an honest attempt to present most people in a fair way though there are some characterizations that are at best sketchy. The main points are there but the subtlety is missed.There are some good performances here and the male actors do much better as the young boy easily explores an amazing range of emotions. In addition there are two supporting actors that don't quite succumb to the stereotypes of the uneducated immigrant that most people associate with this type of situation. Eugenio Derbez in particular does an amazing job as the hardened sidekick who discovers his heart might still be open to caring.The part of the mother is underwritten and opportunities are not fully explored as we wish we could know more of what propelled her into taking the drastic option of moving to the United States. She is a hard worker a loving mother but mostly a shell of character one who cries on cue but rarely projects any substance.In general the film is a lovely social commentary that might reach a few people and open the way to understanding the plight of some members in society. We only wish we could see a more real portrayal of them.".

	schema:headline " A terrific movie about hope love survival...";
	schema:reviewBody "A hit at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival first time director Patricia Riggen's Under The Same Moon or La Misma Luna in Spanish is that rare film that's about real people dealing with life's issues that resonate in today's hectic and cruel world. The drama centers on a little Mexican boy Carlitos Adrian Alonso who lives with his ailing guelita grandmother in Mexico when she suddenly dies in her sleep he sets off to Los Angeles to be reunited with his mother who's been working as a maid for rich folks. His plan to make the journey across the USMexico border doesn't pan out as easily as he had planned running into stumbling blocks that involve street thugs migrant workers a heroin addict near kidnapping and the INS Immigration and Naturalization Service. Under The Same moon is a fantastic little MexicanAmerican film that subtlety transcends the hot topic of illegal immigration. But it's the story of Carlitos and his mother Rosario Kate del Castillo that makes this film a definite must see. Child actor Adrian Alonso stands out and basically carries the film as he gives such a compelling and truthful performance it's one of those young performances of recent years that will be remembered. Kate del Castillo as well exudes that motherly instinct in her tired stressedout expressions with such sadness one can only feel for her. Eugenio Derbez adds some comic flair as the stranger that ends up helping Carlitos to find his mother. At first he wants nothing to do with him as he too is in the states illegally but then becomes a father figure realizing the chiquito needs all the help he can get. Ugly Betty's America Ferrera in a brief role is good as one who smuggles Mexicans into the U.S. in order to pay for her college tuition. No matter what you think about illegal immigration Under The Same Moon is a terrific movie about hope love survival and the yearning for family no matter what the consequences. It also pulls at your heartstrings. It's a powerful little film that will move you and perhaps bring you to tears. Note Under The Same Moon will most likely be playing in major Metropolitan cities so if you can find it I highly recommend this movie.".

Also they create suspense like in the scene where Carlitos is hiding beneath the seat in the car while attempting to cross the border. Watching Carlito's journey gives a sense of hope to everyone that if you persist and have determination you can accomplish anything. Despite all of the hardships that Carlos goes through he keeps a positive attitude and that is the most important thing you can learn from this film. Although I'm sure that is not the message that the director wanted to tell.

Wideeyed Adrian Alonso plays Carlitos the courageous and equally determined little man. Many will remember Alonso from The Legend of Zorro. He brings much more depth to this role and displays a certain quality that just forces us to pull for him.As good as those two performances are they aren't the film's best. That belongs to Eugenio Derbey as Enrique the reluctant hero. He is just tremendous as we see Carlitos soften up his crusty exterior and even teach him a few lessons along the way. Just a fun performance to watch.Director Patricia Riggen kind of skirts the immigration issue with a weak border crossing featuring a brief performance from America Ferrera. This part just never felt real. Still that doesn't reduce the entertainment value of this charming story ... and neither does the fact that we know very early on how the story will end.

	schema:reviewBody "People who were in praise for this movie should check out the message boards. There were issues raised by one user and I must say they were valid with regards to how realistic the movie portrayed the immigration system in the US and how the filmmaker disregarded it in excuse for creative license.Anyways Im not gonna dwell on that as a movie I partly enjoyed Under the same moon. There were effective moments in the film and the acting was believable. I commend the direction especially in the scene where Carlitos meets his dad for the first time and they have lunch nothing was much said but we get a lot out of the interaction of the two.The movie was contrived at times and I could feel that the situations and circumstances in the movie were a result of adhering to the rules of how a screenplay works. The appearance of the woman who took in Carlitos when he's about to be sold to the pedophile was an example. Though it was titled Under the same moon there were only a couple of scenes that showed them watching the moon at the same time I think the filmmaker forgot to take advantage of this very potentially powerful sub plot because the moon symbolizes loneliness and brightness in the dark. Also when the movie opened as the credits begin to roll I was kinda expecting some shot of the moon in there when the titles appear but there's nothing.I like the ending though that shot of the walk sign lighting up is so powerful. Even though we don't see mother and son embrace as they reunite we knew that they do and thats enough already. But the use of the walk sign was not organically integrated into the movie I wish that they used it earlier so when we see it again we'll appreciate it more.".

	schema:reviewBody "This semester I have had to sit through a bunch of notsogreat films in my global road movie class. The notsogreat ones have consisted of cheaply made documentaries and films that have conveyed the essence of a journey with little to no effect on the characters. With Under the Same Moon we get a story about a clear journey of a young boy Carlitos trying desperately to cross the border into the U.S. and finding his mother in L.A.Some may find this unrealistic but Carlitos is amazingly intelligent at the age of 9. He has a special way of connecting with adults and sometimes manipulating them in order to get what he wants. This is not to say there is a maniacal or evil motive behind what Carlitos wants from adults but he is a natural at convincing others to help him and he must be since he is limited due to his age.On the reverse side we see his mother living in L.A. in order to make money to support little Carlitos with not one but two jobs as a maid. She is constantly questioning what will help her son in the long run which is heartbreaking since Carlitos sometimes thinks that his mother abandoned him. What adds to the mother's struggle is the fact that she is an illegal so she must also decide what puts her in a better position to support her only child.While the mother's story is more dramatic Carlitos' journey is full of heart and many laughs especially after he befriends a man named Enrique. Basically Carlitos depends on this stranger but Enrique is reluctant to help since the kid annoys him. It is a great lovehate relationship which has us hoping Enrique will come to his senses and do the right thing.I love how the film combines aspects of the melodrama with the political issue of immigration which is tied to desperation for work. There is little to say about the film in a negative manner except that it may seem cheesy at certain points. Also if you're looking for a film with complexity you may want to look elsewhere since the plot for this film is simple and straightforward but it is a fun and touching story.3.54.0".

	schema:reviewBody "Bajo La Misma Luna Patricia Riggen 2007 MexicoBajo la Misma Luna uses a lot of realistic events to tell a story of how most people from the other side of the border struggle. Bajo La Misma Luna Under the Same Moon. Is a great film that depicts the constant struggles of millions of people that cross over the border to search for a better living. There are thousands of women that cross the border each day in order to provide for their families in doing so many of them leave young children behind. It is a sad but true reality they come here leaving everything in order to obtain a little something for their families. This movie tells a story of a boy who crosses the border in search of his mother. Certain term of events occurs and Carlitos Adrian Alonso is forced to go in search of his mother. On the other side Rosario Kate Del Castillo also finds herself with the struggles that occur to most Illegal immigrants when they cross the border. This movie focuses on the harsh reality of many of the challenges that immigrant face when they come to the United States. This movie tells a parallel story of both Rosario and Carlitos. Rosario lives in the United States and has been gone for a while. Carlitos has stayed back with his grandmother waiting on the arrival of his mother. Rosario works as a nanny and a housekeeper in the city of Los Angeles. While Carlitos works a little side job in Mexico with a women who organizes illegal immigration for people on the other side. Rosario calls him every Sunday at ten o'clock sharply. He awaits her call faithfully every week. Rosario vividly describes her location to him and this is something that he engraves in his memory hoping to one day see it himself. In Carlitos life a tragedy occurs his grandmother passes away and he sets out on a journey to travel to the United states and find her before her call the following Sunday. On his way he is faced with many of the similar struggles that most people encounter while crossing the border. He is first met up with a couple that he pays off to smuggle him across the border and then has to hitchhike himself in order to reach his destination. In some situations he comes across danger and other times he is lucky. On the other side is his mother who also finds herself struggling with coming back home or staying and being able to provide for her family. She encounters Paco who has his green card and considers marrying him in order to get her papers and bring her son but doubts herself in making this choice. She also struggles with her employer who is constantly treating her bad and who she cannot call the cops on because of her illegal status and fear of deportation. One of the scenes in the movie that shows one of the many struggles and dangers that people face while on their journey to America is when Carlitos is almost sold to traffickers this is one of the harsh realities that many children encounter in Mexico. Rosario also is faced with struggles of her own when the lady she works with does not pay her what she is owed and reminds her that she cannot do anything about it because she is an illegal. Another one of my favorite scene was the last scene. On one of Carlitos missions he encounters a migrant worker who is played by Eugenio Derbez. Derbez tries to get rid of the boy but ends up forming a bond with him. It is that bond that saves him at the end of the movie. I also really enjoyed the part when they both singing in the restaurant it reminds me a lot of my culture and how much music is a big part of it. In conclusion I thought the film was great. It showed many of the struggles that immigrant often encounter and also tells a wonderful story of the willingness to never give up and fight until you reached your goal. It shows us a parallel story of the two main characters and also shows the good and bad things that many illegals can face while on their journey to the land of dreams. I thought the film was very heartfelt and it should have earned more credit than it did.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd seen the name Swallowtail Butterfly mentioned in quite a few places always favourably.  I either didn't know or couldn't remember the slightest thing about it but decided to pick it up on an expensive whim.Director Shunji Iwai has done a few movies that don't seem to get seen much in the west but always draw praise when they do.  I will certainly be looking out for his work in future if Swallowtail Butterfly is a good representation of his talent.Since I didn't know anything about the movie and enjoyed it that way I won't reveal too much.  The main background to which the movie is set is the Yentown.  This is either the name that immigrant workers gave to the Japanese city to which they came looking for money or the name given by the Japanese that rejected them to that class of people.  It is also the name of the band that Shunji Iwai recruited for the movie and the original name of the movie itself in Japan just to make matters more confusing At the start of the movie we see the corpse of a Chinese Yentown being handed over to the authorities.  The other Yentown deny knowing her and the 16 year old girl looking mournful particularly denies that she might have been her mother.  This is untrue but if nobody claims the body then the state will provide a funeral that her friends and relatives could not afford.  The prospect of looking after the girl does not appeal to her mothers friends so she is handed on from person to person until a prostitute called Glico finally takes pity on her.The movie expands from this point in gradually widening circles paced with a precision that would make King Hu proud.  It's impossible to place the movie in one genre but socialrealism coming of age drama rockumentary and crime thriller all fit one part or another of the 2.5 hour running time. The whole movie is shot on handheld cameras sometimes in a dizzying documentary style sometimes in a tense thriller style sometimes in a gentle dreamlike way.  The use of filters and lighting and a nice grainy film stock all ensure that it looks wonderful throughout.  The soundtrack is similarly wonderful from start to finish  both the orchestral background music of Takeshi Kobayashi and the flat out rock n' roll of The Yentown Band and their wonderful singer Chara the new love of my life I think!.The different tones of the movie that follow the shift in genre and the sometimes radical changes of scale that the narrative takes in are all blended skillfully provoking a wide range of emotional responses.  The performances are all excellent and the characters very interesting and well defined.In essence this is basically a masterful film that shows extraodinary skill from Shunji Iwai as a director.  Watching it is a reminder of just how far from the potential of the medium most movies fall.  I look forward to following his career wherever it might take him.  It's such a shame that a movie that is such a work of art will probably be seen by a tiny audience in the USA whilst braindead Hollywood blockbusters pack multiplexes in every town.  I guess at least most people will never know what they're missing.".

	schema:headline " Excellent mixture of style and content.";
	schema:reviewBody "While I'm particularly fond of Japanese films I must admit quite a few of them are enjoyable only because of their unique style not because of their actual content. Films like Shark Skin Man And Peach Hip Girl are fun to watch but that's all there is to them. Yentown Swallowtail's original title on the other hand is a prime example of Japanese cinema at it's finest. Combining music and politics drama and action social commentary and humor art film and popular film Yentown is a true postmodern experience rich both in style and in content. The film takes place in the Tokyo of near future in a ghetto inhabited by immigrants from all over Asia. The status of immigrants is a touchy subject in Japan and it has been widely covered in many of the recent Japanese films. What separates Yentown from them is that it uses the ghetto only as a starting point and although the hardships of the immigrants and outsiders in general are a major theme it is only one of the numerous subjects the film explores. Basically Yentown is about dreams. The story revolves around a group of povertystricken immigrants to whom a sudden twist of fate gives the opportunity to literally make money and thus realize their dreams. Unfortunately their luck is not without it's consequences and even if they get what they've always dreamed of they may realize they've chasen the wrong dream. This may not be the most original of ideas but the story is told with such energy and originality and with such sympathetic characters that the viewer soon forgets the familiriaty of the basic plot.Yentown is a type of film that gets even better on multiple viewings. The story is told in a nonlinear way which can make the film seem a bit confusing at least when seen for the first time. There are elements and even characters in Yentown used mainly as metaphors and to careless viewer it may appear that the film doesn't quite properly tie up it's threads. But if the viewer has the courage and patience to watch a film quite different from our Western tradition Yentown will reward himher with an unique blend of emotion wit and beauty.".

Being a very big fan of Asian film I decided to find it cheap which I did on eBay and then buy it. One of the best buys I've had in a while. A few other good buys were DEAD MAN'S SHOES THE DESCENT BAD BOY BUBBY and A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS.This story pretty much has it all. It has all the elements of a great drama. To name a few it was funnylove how they spoke English tragic thoughtful violent and memorable. I apologize but I'm not going to describe the movie to you because it's slightly difficult to do. I can say that it's about people called Yentowns who live in a city named Yentown. Sounds simple but the movie delivers on so many levels that it's anything but.I hope you enjoy the film as much as me. If you enjoyed the movies I mentioned above there are not many reason for you not to. It's not a perfect film but it definitely gets the job done. It's really a fantastic film.".

It's close to the best thing I've ever seen. I like the style I like the fact that it's in three languages and I even like the fact that some in the cast were not speaking their first languages. I think that fit into the message of the film which is that everyone there was in some way or another displaced. I think the idea of a movie about immigrants trying to fit in where they're not wanted is perfect. I think that the speech by the nonEnglish speaking white guy who has never been to America was the summation of the whole film and Glico's rendition of My Way was its heart. Absolutely beautiful it encompassed so many different aspects of Japanese filmmaking and put unique twists on all of them. Excellent movie. If you find it somewhere watch it.

The turncoat news woman who seems almost a parody of what'shername who was in Tampopo A Taxing Woman etc. The George Carlinlike tattoo doctor intuiting that Ageha's tears aren't his doing.Unfortunate the maudlin replay after Feihong's demise.Touchpoints? Hugo's Les Miserables Notre Dame. Anything Dickens. Anything Iwai. Dark Side of the Heart you figure out whyit's swallowtail butter...fly. Heaven ditto. Ageha closer to Kiarostami's screen children than to the kids in Morita's The Family Game or its successors but Kiarostomi's children seldom or never manage to assemble the lessons he throws at them into something more in order to move on.";

	schema:headline " Celebrates the immigrant as a romantic figure in Japanese life";
	schema:reviewBody "In Shunji Iwai's Swallowtail Butterfly young Ageha Ayumi Ito is first a caterpillar who can do little else but crawl. During the course of this 145minute film however she is able to dash against her limitations and like the butterfly explode into a million colors. Spoken in three different languages Chinese English and Japanese Swallowtail Butterfly is a futuristic drama a fishoutofwater absurdist comedy a comingofage story a gangland caper and a musical odyssey. Popular in Japan but virtually unseen in the West it is a whirling cacophony of images and sounds that celebrates the immigrant as a romantic figure in Japanese life. Conceived when the yen was the most powerful force in the world the film speculates about a time in the near future when Tokyo is overflowing with immigrants looking to cash in on the economic boom. They came in search of yen snatching up yen the narration states. And the immigrants called the city Yentown. Residents were also known as Yentowns so the film is the story of Yentowns in Yentown. Set in the slums and back alleys of outer Tokyo and shot entirely with handheld cameras Swallowtail is an ambitious film about immigrants who are bonded by their dream of making quick money in the economic boom and then returning to their home country. The film's colorful characters are easy to identify with. They include Ageha a 16year old orphan Glico Chara an exhooker turned popular singing star Fie Hong Hiroshi Mikami a poor opportunistic immigrant from Shanghai who runs a junkyard Arrow Shiek Mahmud Bey a former boxer and Ran Atsuro Watabe a Yazuka gang leader with heart. After a young Chinese orphan identifies the dead body of her mother she ends up with a Chinese prostitute named Glico who gives her the name of Ageha Japanese for butterfly and sends her to work in a shantytown outside of Tokyo. There she works in a junkyard full of shady characters that shoot out people's tires so they can sell spares to them at double the cost. When a yazuka john is thrown out the window and squished by a passing truck the group burying him in the woods discovers a tape of Frank Sinatra singing My Way farcically sewn into his stomach. The tape contains a computer code that can multiply their money which they set about doing. With enough money to open a nightclub and start a band they hire Glico as the main singer and she is able to begin a singing career which propels her to stardom. In reality she is the immensely talented Japanese pop singer Chara real name Sato Miwa and her songs My Way Sunday Park Mama's Alright She Don't Care and Swallowtail Butterfly in the film were released in a successful CD called the Yen Town Band. Not long after the club is open to paying customers however the yazuka gang led by Rio Ranki Yosuke Eguchi comes after the moneymaking tape and the police close in on Glico's friend FeiHong. Nearing the end of his life FieHong acknowledges that he has regrets but in a dream sequence he pictures a banner labeled Yentown being sprung up over the city and remains upbeatAnd now as tears subside I find it all so amusing... To think I did all that and may I say not in a shy way Oh no oh no not me I did it my way As the Yentown Club disintegrates and the Yentowns go their separate ways the power that held everyone together disappears and what is left is a loss of innocence and a money burning ceremony that provides an anticapitalistic exclamation point. Meanwhile Ageha impresses some local delinquents with her boxing skill and becomes their boss transforming herself from a withdrawn child into a mature leader of neighborhood toughs. She also has a poetic side seen when she reminisces about her childhood as an underground doctor Mickey Curtis tattoos a butterfly on her chest. Like Ageha Swallowtail allows us to playfully soar like a butterfly and free the dreams within our heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not anything like Iwai Shunji's Shigatsu Monogatari with its rather innocent themes and situations.  In contrast Swallowtail Butterfly jumps right in with stylized shots of destitute living seedy shantytowns full of drugs and prostitution and somewhat gratuitous violence.  It was surprising that more than a third of the dialogue was in some form of English seeing as how the Yentowns all seemed to come from the lower rungs of their respective nonEnglishspeaking countries i.e. those not able to attend English classes at the grade school and higher level excepting of course the American boxer.  How ironic that they managed to speak better English than most Japanese who have taken several years of English in school.  The nonEnglishspeaking white guy was an interesting touch as was the casting of Yosuke Eguchi as an ethnic Chinese gangster.  By far the most confusing characters were Yamaguchi Tomoko and Watabe Atsuro cast as some sort of foreign US?trained counter narcotics operators. Obviously such a black unit would not be politically viable in Japan hence the presence of an Americanaccented squad leader and the exclusive use of bad English between Yamachan and Watabekun. I realize that their main objective was to terminate Rianki's counterfeiting ring but why would they do it by helping Yentowns scam millions of yen from cash machine owners? Don't even get me started on the impossibility of taking out a target on a moving train. Surely Iwai Shunji's watched La Femme Nikita too many times but even Luc Besson wouldn't have one of his characters pull off such an impossible objective. Overall the movie was depressing enlightening sad disturbing and in some ways entertaining Tomochan's scene with the antitank weapon was immensely funny.  Did i like it? Well yes.".

Also Chara who acts the role of Glico is cute as a button but I found her quite unfitting for the role as she really can't sing. However apparently that does not keep you from being a musical success in Japan in real life either as Chara is actually a pop star there... So it actually figures.  Due to the kaleidoscopic nature and excessive length of the movie I had real troubles focusing on the movie at times but at least it was refreshingly different and original  it was enjoyable for a change to watch a movie where every twist and turn was not predictable and customary. Swallowtail tries hard and has a lot of amateurish charm but in the end manages to be only a curiosity rather than a masterpiece. ".

The movie was doing fine up to that point but got bogged down in her twee Jpop idol whispering and ridiculous rock clichs. Shunji Iwai may have a great eye but his ears appear to be in need of a good syringing. The fractured narrative sometimes made the script seem like it was written in the editing suite and some of the jerkier cuts jarred badly with their artless futility. The characters struggled to inspire any empathyin the rush to bludgeon us with the message that Japanese society has a racist underbelly. A message effortlessly conveyed in much subtler terms in most of Takashi Miike's movies. The cinematography is sweet enough when it isn't succumbing to 90's MTV crassness. Perhaps I'm just easily bored by kaleidoscopic low shots of blurry knees and shoes. That said it's worth seeing. There's some interesting observations being made some flashes of sardonic humour and the bazooka scene might well have influenced other more radical Japanese directors. What I see is a film maker struggling to find his identity and overreaching himself both in the script and the direction. His ambition is admirable but the execution is merely respectable. I'm glad I saw it but it doesn't compare too well to Lily Chou or Picnic in terms of depth or beauty.".

At this point having just finished the movie I have lost all confidence in her ability to judge a movie. Granted I am not giving up on the latter director after one movie but you won't see me rushing out to follow up on the body of his work.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie mixes a plethora of genres into a psychotic brew. Here you will find comedy drama romance splatter music video and actioncomedy mixed together without any sense of direction. It seems that the director took seven different movies and cut and pasted them together into one flawed movie. It starts of introducing the viewer to the concept yentown where people from all around the world has immigrated to make some fast money. The people who didn't make it has become outcast also called yentowns The movie's focus lies on a group of yentowns especially a prostitute called Glico named after a candy bar played by a talentless Japanese musician called Chara. She later becomes a famous pop star in a pop band called believe it or not yentowns. Yentowns has to be the most talentless pop group in the whole universe and makes Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera look like musical geniuses. But the director applies no sense of irony to their musical performances and expects the viewer to actually enjoy these awful musical acts for example a coversong of Frank Sinatra My way witch must surely make him turn in his grave!. After that introduction the movie gets weird and it's hard to find any logic behind any of the scenes. A lot of them focus on characters that haven't been introduced and does not have any linking to the movie as a whole. The scenes are just stands there alone without any foothold on the internal logic or the movie as a whole. The movies is also unbelievable clichd the emotional scenes is laughable in their stupidity and shallowness. The filming technique has many similarities with 90's music videos with a handheld camera waging up and down into a chaotic flurry which doesn't contribute anything to the movie as a whole but only make the movie in certain parts of the film unbearable to watch. On the upside I haven't laughed as hard at the cinema for years...".

Sadly Ayumi Ito's chest is insufficient to redeem this clunker which at 148 minutes is easily 140 too long.

	schema:reviewBody "After having read that this film was such a masterpiece I was seriously disappointed. Mostly I bought it because I love actor Eguchi Yosuke. I was shocked to hear him speaking Chinese and some torturous and vulgar English. In fact I heard very little Japanese throughout the whole long long film. This film is much uglier than I had anticipated. Quirky pop star Chara who I've always suspected was more Philippina or Vietnamese than Japanese plays a kindhearted hooker from Shanghai. She takes under her wing a young girl who's lost her own hooker mother saves her from a life as a prostitute inspires this girl to get a tattoo and goes on to be a pop singer. Normally handsome good guy Eguchi Yosukein his long hair periodplays Chara's brother a Chinese gang leader. If you're used to seeing him in Japanese dramas you'll be in for a shock. Most of the characters on screen are anything but Japanese. There's the big black fella who teaches the young girl how to box the American Jewish doctor who has chosen to work in dirty conditions giving tattoos to other illegals the white guys who can't speak English only Japanese and somehow get by as musicians and assorted other Middle Eastern maybe? illegal aliens who live in squalid conditions and make money attacking passers by. Do not go into this film expecting to see or hear Japanese people or to see any of the hitech pop culture or traditional images one normally associates with Japan. Instead you are greeted by Yentownthe dirty world of illegals desperate to get rich in Japan by any means necessary. SPOILER SPOILER! The main story involves a cassette tape that allows for the duplication of the magnetic strip in money. Thus our heroes can counterfeit loads of money open a night club let Chara become a singing star watch for a cameo by her husband Asano Tadanobu and somehow save the day again when rival gangs threaten them. Overall the film was just ugly. Ugly people doing illegal things in the dark dirty corners of atthetime prosperous Japan. This is the kind of film that gets rave reviews by those who confuse ugliness for depth and beauty. Many readers will slam this review. Sorry but I had to review it my way.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the great satirical musical comedies of the 60s. Robert Morse in the lead role is not unlike a sophisticated version of one of the Jerry Lewis characters of the same era  with the exception that he sings. And he sings some wonderfully witty songs that must be very close to the bone in companies that take themselves too seriously. Sammy Smith is superb in his dual roles as the quarter of a century mail room head who plays it the company way and then later as Chairman Wally the ex window washer. The lyrics will never date along with the hammy caricatures of the self serving executives and staff.  Not all stage musicals have translated well to the screen but How to Succeed is a noteworthy exception  highly recommended.".

This prompted me to purchase the original musical with Robert Morse and I was not disappointed.  My wife preferred the live musical however what attracted me to the video was the performance of Rudy Vallee as Mr Bigly.  Frank Loesser's score is marvelous I think that the song The Company Way is a humorous parody of those corporate types who risk nothing that will damage their careers.  This video is one that I've watched over and over and I can recommend to any musical lovers other than ardent feminists who might be turned off by the 1960s type relationships between the men and women.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie on a local PBS station for the first time since it originally came out in the movies. I was only 10 at the time so I didn't get it and I remember not being crazy about it. ALthough the song I believe in you was a favorite of mine. I actually looked at the TV schedule to see what else was on. And I vowed to change the channel at 12 the coming hour. But a funny thing happened I forgot about the other movie and I remained glued to the screen and saw it to the end. The movie is about a window washer who pledges to become a CEO within a short time by reading a How To Book hence the title. How delightful to see Michelle Lee singing..what a voice. I didn't remember her singing I Believe in You. Then we have Robert Morse. I was never a big fan of the slap stick comedy ala Jim Carrey Chevy Chase and Robin Wiliams. Robert Morse could give them all a few lessons on playing broad comedy without going over board. Rudy Vallee and the man who played Big Deal in West Side Story one of my favorite musicals were hilarious. He was the nephew of the CEO Vallee so we all know what type of character he was playing. We also have the CEO's bimbo girlfriend who wants to get out of the Secretary pool. She actually is not as dumb as we are suppose to think she is. It was a very upbeat funny movie. And for some reason I believe a lot of people in the business world probably know even less then the Robert Morse character a window washer Maybe they should read the same type of book he was reading. This musical actually would be good if it was just the story. The book could stand on its own. I felt the same way about Carousel. Which deals with very serious issues. The music adds to the story which IMO separates a OK musicals from a great musical. This is a great musical. Oh beware a few songs were cut for the film. The Broadway musical was almost 3 hours as a lot are. They have intermissions on Broadway. So they cut musical numbers from movie musicals. They did that with Guys and Dolls one of the great songs at that. HTSIBWRT they cut the Coffee break scene a great scene. So just as a caution to people who look at movie versions of Broadway musicals. Don't expect to seehear all of the songs. It's a dumb practice because there are movies made now which are running 3 hours which have a whole lot less going for them then a Broadway musical.".

And while such '60s business staples as rampant sexism and smoking now look quaintly offensive the gleeful satirizing of backstabbing and skulduggery in business will always be relevant. David Swift whose training was in TV doesn't do much with the widescreen format except for the ingenious balletmechanique in A Secretary Is Not a Toy but he cuts cleverly away from the production numbers just as the musicalcomedy silliness is on the verge of becoming embarrassing and he splices in some delectable location shots of '60s New York. The color scheme is bright the pacing brisk the cast friendly the production values refreshingly modest.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a very successful Broadway comedy of the 1960s HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING was a marvelous look at climbing the corporate ladder at the height of American Business Success from 1945 to 1970. Instead of climbing by means of showing superior executive abilities the successful climbers make it by back stabbing asslicking and trickery. The hero of the fable is window washer J. Pierpont Finch who is played by Robert Morse who played the role on Broadway. Morse purchases a pamphlet entitled How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Throughout the musical and movie we see Finch making his plans while reading the pamphlet hearing a voice over telling us what he's reading. He starts off in the mail room and quickly becomes a friend of the retiring mail room head but also meets his archnemesis Bud Frump Anthony Teague. Throughout the film Bud constantly tries to thwart the rise of Finch but while his schemes seem foolproof Finch constantly outwits him.Complicating the story is the behavior of the President of the firm Jasper B. Bigley Rudy Vallee. Vallee too played the eccentric millionaire on stage  and it is wonderful that both these performances are preserved for Vallee's greatest film performance is as Bigley  the old Groundhog supporter of his alma mater Old Ivy as well as the man who relieves his tensions by either going out with his mistress Hedy LaRue Maureen Arthur or by knitting covers for his golf clubs.Finch too finds romance with Rosemary Michel Lee a secretary at the corporate giant WORLD WIDE WICKETS. But will he be single minded in his determination to rise to the top or will he take time out to marry the girl he loves? A splendid spoof which while exaggerated does suggest more of the reasons for promotions in the corporate and real world than we care to acknowledge usually.".

Instead it plays a lot like watching a playcomplete with many musical and dancing numbers where you can easily see how it was performed on stage. Now this is NOT meant an a negativejust stating how it's almost like watching a filmed version of the play. And because of this the sets are often very surreallike sets from a play that are easily moved and disassembled. And if you are interested this play is currently playing on Broadwaywith Daniel Radcliff in the revival. I am not sure if tickets are now so expensive because of its star or because it's a darn good musicalbut I suspect it's both.The innocuous looking Robert Morse stars in the film he played the same role on stage previously. He's a very very cynical young man who used a book entitled How To Succeed in Businessand follows it for his meteoric rise through the ranks of a corporation. In fact in only a matter of days he moves from the mail room to a vice president...and his stock keeps on rising. Along the way are a lot of peppy and cynical songsmy favorite of which is A Secretary is NOT a Toy though I Believe in You has become a standard. And to get ahead he sucks up manipulates and liesall which the movie seems to heartily endorse as in every case Morse is wildly successful! As a result it's a funny comedy and ultimate movie for cynics! I thoroughly enjoyed itand I really don't even like musicals all that much! Apart from good songs a fun and goofy plot and good acting the film manages to be entertaining and new. There just aren't any other films like itand it's a bit surprising that it didn't make Morse a star as he was very good here. Ironically he's been brought back to the small screen for a recurring role on Mad Mena drama that seems at times inspired by this film.By the way George Fenneman plays himself. If you wonder why his face is familiar he was the announcer for the TV show You Bet Your Life. Also doesn't the boss' nephew look a LOT like a 1960s version of Napoleon Dynamite?! Look at him yourselfyou'll see what I mean.".

Lee and Vallee also repeat their Broadway roles.With music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and book by Abe Burrows How to Succeed is the story of window washer J. Pierpont Finch who in a matter of days thanks to a book he carries around by the same name as the film title has risen through the ranks of the Worldwide Wicket Company without doing any work. He has his enemies but one very good friend in Rosemary Lee a secretary with a crush on him who wants Ponty as he is called to make good.I'm not all that familiar with the musical but I understand that there are several songs missing including Happy to Keep His Dinner Warm. The standouts are I Believe in You which became a hit song and the rousing Brotherhood of Man. What makes the music for me is the wonderful orchestrations.Sexist today in some of its themes this is a brightlycolored musical done the oldfashioned way without cutting the numbers to pieces. Morse is delightful and never had any trouble adapting to film. Ditto a young pretty Lee who sings I Believe in You like a dream. Vallee is well cast as the head of the company who has a girlfriend on the side. Anthony Teague is very good as the boss' nephew but Charles Nelson Reilly played this role on stage and I can only imagine how hilarious he was in the role.Good movie and director David Swift keeps the pace moving.".

It did have the longest run of any of his shows 1417 performances from 1961 to 1965.Though Hollywood was smart enough to retain Robert Morse and Rudy Vallee in their roles from Broadway the only flaw with this film is that I do so wish Charles Nelson Reilly had repeated his role as Bud Frump the rival to Robert Morse's J. Pierrepont Finch the upwardly mobile executive. It was the breakthrough part for Reilly in his career and it would have been nice had it been retained.Frank Loesser did it all in this show book music and lyrics in a wonderful satire on the mores of the business world. How To Succeed is one of the few Broadway musicals that succeeds more on its book than anything else. The songs from this production are more functional than anything else hits though some of them are. Unlike Guys and Dolls Where's Charley The Most Happy Fella there are no really stand alone ballads that could be enjoyed outside the context of the film or the stage show.Robert Morse never got a role like this one the man who starts out as a window washer and moves up the corporate ladder through careful planning and a lot of nerve. He follows carefully the advice of a book with the title of the show. By the way in the film it is Morse's voice used in the narrative as the character reads from the book. On stage the prerecorded voice of Walter Cronkite was used.Rudy Vallee is the company president and Loesser took advantage of Vallee's unique personality and style with his songs and character. A lot of people who did not grow up with Rudy Vallee today would probably not get a lot of the inside humor. Vallee's big song is Grand Old Ivy and the humor of it would be lost today unless you knew that Vallee had recorded in his career such song hits as The Maine Stein Song Betty Coed and The Whiffenpoof Song back when he was the reigning singer of the day.Though the jokes about Vallee are dated the overall humor of How To Succeed was ahead of its times. Can you imagine had this musical premiered in the Reagan years? It would have been deified by all those motivational speakers that started to become popular then.For that reason How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying is as fresh as when Frank Loesser put those first notes down for this wonderful show.".

Morse plays a scamp who picks up the real life! book How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. He goes from a window washer to a highlevel executive at the World Wide Wicket Company in record make that farcical time. Referring to the book for advice he plays out scenario after scenario to his advantage ruthlessly clawing his way to the top much to the consternation of fellow worker and management relative Teague while stopping occasionally for a flirtation with pretty Lee a secretary with the firm. Eventually and predictably however he realizes that success in business isn't all there is to life. The world this film takes place in is a dayglo candyconfection dreamscape in which everyone is clean neat stylish and always ready to break into song or dance. Morse whose stage version of this character was somewhat less sympathetic and more driven has here the role of his career. He perfectly suits the goofy ambitious resourceful part he was given to play. Lee is appealing and talented with a very nice singing voice. Oddly she receives some questionable lighting at times having a shadow over her face and with catchlights in only one eye during her solo. This is something she would more than take care of during her 12 year run on Knots Landing infamous for its flattering lights. Vallee appears to good effect as the preoccupied president of the company. Arthur provides plenty of pneumatic comic relief as his curvy airheaded yet resourceful mistress. She's a sort of goofy blend of Carol Channing Marilyn Monroe and Gracie Allen. Teague gives a broad but enthusiastic performance. Hobart who plays a stern employee with a secret soft spot would later turn up as a bus driver in Dirty Harry'! The musical numbers tend to be dispersed fairly evenly among the cast with many folks getting a crack at a song rather than the leads getting most of them. There's a lot of ensemble work both in the songs and in the impressively staged by Fosse dances. Sadly one of the memorable dances from the stage show  Coffee Break  was eliminated from the finished picture due to a quality issue with the film. Another A Secretary is Not a Toy should drop the jaws of some modernday audience members with its jubilant incorrectness. The script begins to overstay its welcome and veer off into tiresome subplots but overall it's a pretty lively and entertaining affair. The opening shots of a shimmering and vintage New York City are to be treasured.".

Clannad 20072008  httpwww.imdb.comtitlett1118804  The TV series Season 1.2. Clannad After Story 2008   httpwww.imdb.comtitlett1298820  The TV series Season 2.3. Clannad 2007  httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0997274  This movie.As you can see from above this movie came before the TV series but it is supposed to be viewed last. If you watch this movie and then the TV show it will spoil all the surprises. .The story  Its very simple a high school girl and boy meet and they fall in love. I am so sorry there is nothing more to say than this really. .....Because the movie and the TV series has the same story there are small differences though this movie may be redundant so the question is do you need to see it at all? I will try to answer thatQuality  The Clannad TV series I think is the best animemovieTV series that I have ever seen. It can only be compared to movies like Tokyo Story Spirited Away Life is Beautiful Its a Wonderful Life etc. Its just too good unimaginably. And because of that unfortunately this movie comes across as mediocre.The saddest thing about this movie is that it trivializes the lead actress Nagisa. Here she seems to be chasing after Tomoya. Pestering and pushy silly and dumb! But the real Nagisa from the TV series is the most amazing character that I have ever seen. She can only be compared to people like Avatar Aang Avatar the Last Airbender Belldandy Ah My Goddess etc. And those people are like super heroes with super powers whereas Nagisa is ridiculously frail of body and she is nowhere as beautiful as Belldandy yet somehow she is so strong with the most beautiful heart that you are in awe of her!I also felt that most of the emotions in this movie were forced and it seemed too artificial. Here Nagisa's parents seem like they are crazy and that they are desperate to set Tomoya up with Nagisa. In reality they are very mature people and important to the overall story. And not just the parents the many many characters that you will quickly see here they all have important roles in what happens between Nagisa and Tomoya yet they are all forgotten here.And the background music is it me or did it feel as if they were purposefully mocking the movie. It sounded like the silly sounds that we may make when we are trying to imitate a horror movie infront of our friends like where we are purposefully trying to be silly. In the TV series the music absolutely blows us away! It is so perfect that it seems to be flowing with our heart.Once we have seen the series each character in it becomes our friend and we will miss them. This movie was a way to see them all again. So yes its still worth to see this movie.Say you are someone who hates anime even then I can confidently recommend this series to you you won't be disappointed.Thank you for reading this. . Cheers.".

And because of that unfortunately this movie comes across as mediocre.The saddest thing about this movie is that it trivializes the lead actress Nagisa. Here she seems to be chasing after Tomoya. Pestering and pushy silly and dumb! But the real Nagisa from the TV series is the most amazing character that I have ever seen. She can only be compared to people like Avatar Aang Avatar the Last Airbender Belldandy Ah My Goddess etc. And those people are like super heroes with super powers whereas Nagisa is ridiculously frail of body and she is nowhere as beautiful as Belldandy yet somehow she is so strong with the most beautiful heart that you are in awe of her!I also felt that most of the emotions in this movie were forced and it seemed too artificial. Here Nagisa's parents seem like they are crazy and that they are desperate to set Tomoya up with Nagisa. In reality they are very mature people and important to the overall story. And not just the parents the many many characters that you will quickly see here they all have important roles in what happens between Nagisa and Tomoya yet they are all forgotten here.And the background music is it me or did it feel as if they were purposefully mocking the movie. It sounded like the silly sounds that we may make when we are trying to imitate a horror movie infront of our friends like where we are purposefully trying to be silly. In the TV series the music absolutely blows us away! It is so perfect that it seems to be flowing with our heart.Once we have seen the series each character in it becomes our friend and we will miss them. This movie was a way to see them all again. So yes its still worth to see this movie.Say you are someone who hates anime even then I can confidently recommend this series to you you won't be disappointed.Thank you for reading this. . Cheers.";

The end result was a rushed plot development and the movie ended without the audience being able to connect with any of the characters.The animation wasn't as impressive as the TV series and I thought there were way too many stillpictures which seemed like laziness. Lighting seemed too bright as well though I guess they were trying to illustrate the dreaminess of the story. Kyoto Animation which produced the TV series once again impresses me with the animation quality compared with Toei.Another fatal mistake was changing the Dango Big Family song which was a masterpiece to anyone who has seen the TV series.For those who has seen the TV series I'm sure this movie would feel lacking in comparison and those who hasn't probably can't keep up with the accelerated story development. Watch the anime series.".

It was a movie that was completely unpredictable. I felt I knew which way this film was going but then it would go in different directions to where I never knew how the film would end and I loved that about this Film.Some really deep concepts about the beauty of life dreams soul mates true love and living your lifeno matter what happens. Very deep film all around I was very delighted with this film.Also I love Hayao Miyazaki films but sometimes as brilliant as they are one gets tired of the constant theme that each of his films drive home about loving all creatures in life loving mother earth taking care of all living things etc.Of course all great things we should do as people though. So it was nice to see a story that was different along the lines of this kind of animation. Again I love Hayao Miyazaki films it was just nice and refreshing to see a different concept played out in an animation film like this.I would recommend this film for all ages as there is something for everyone in it. And who doesn't love the 3 lead characters in this one they're so much fun to watch! I highly recommend watching this one.".

I watched the movie first and with an open mind and found it amazing. Sure some parts got very goofy but most of the scenes did really well in giving the characters personality. Sure you didn't get back stories for anyone but that would make the movie too long. This was still a very deep emotional movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Clannad along with the After Story is my favorite anime series. This movie is a retelling of how Nagisa and Tomoya met in the beginning and that's about all I know because I couldn't even bear to sit through more than about 20 minutes of it. I'm sorry if the end is better than the beginning but I just hate how they completely switched way too much stuff. In the anime Tomoya is the one who makes the initial connection with Nagisa and decides to help her because he has nothing better to do or so he thinks and Nagisa is very shy in the beginning towards him. In the movie Tomoya seems like a complete jerk to me and wants nothing to do with Nagisa while Nagisa is the one who eagerly awaits him on his way to school in order to talk to him. The only nice thing Tomoya really does is just helping her a little in order for her to get up the hill to school as he does in the anime and he gives her some bread from the school that Youhei buys for him that Tomoya doesn't like and which doesn't happen in the anime. I first tried watching this film after watching the full Clannad and After Story series the first time this summer and couldn't get through much. One main thing that deterred me was the fact that Tomoya is the only character with a different voice than in the anime and one that does not sound similar to the anime series' voice. After watching them a second time later this summer I tried again. The final straw for me that makes me never want to watch this movie is the fact that they changed the Dango Daikozoku theme song. Was this necessary in my mind No. Was this song one of the best parts about the ClannadAfter Story anime Yes and many other people I've seen talking about it on Youtube agree. Basically if you haven't watched the anime I'm sure this is a fine movie but there are just too many changes. Everything from the minor characters Kyou is now helping Tomoyo because class President for some reason to the fact that they changed the Hidden World with the girl and robot I won't include spoilers there and now made it some weird dream that Tomoya has about him not having a body and finding some creepyass clown costume to inhabit. Basically I suggest watching the anime and skipping the movie though maybe watching the movie before the anime might not ruin the anime.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tagline An excellent film about the basics of human beings Review by Neo Sometimes a film does not need to do much nor does it require something extraordinarily to happen and it can still be a film that can relate touch and affect one life. While the usually dependable Ann Hui does not create a masterpiece but it is probably safe to say that The Way We Are is very much a success story. After the bleakness shown in the city of sadness Tin Shui Wai with likes of Besieged City the little Hong Kong city within borders of the mainland is filled with negative press distinguishing of hopes and pure darkness. Here director Hui is smart by going back to the basics of filming the very essence of human lives. The method taken is by filming a week or two in life of ordinary people. While it may seems that the film aren't doing much not going anywhere the film still somehow leaves the audience wanting more and leaving the credits with a glimpse of hope within the shambles.Casting a ballet of untried actors in the likes of Bau HeiJing as the happygolucky mother who works hard day and night to supporting her teenage son Juno Leung Chun Lung as a Duran fruit cutter and packer in the area's Welcome Supermarket. Life is not easy in fact it's difficult but yet Bau remains cheerful hopeful and most important of all she is content of herself. On the other hand we have her son a reclusive young boy who prefers staying at home than going out. Then there are people who they bum into within their lives like the lonely grandmother living close by or the random relatives who are much better off than they are. Not exactly a movie about the plot line or clever and intriguing premises rather it is about the little things that happen in our real lives.What makes the film work is that Ann Hui is very much a director who looks at human emotions and the very fact that she does not create or fabricate emotions to affect the audience but rather creates real emotions about the simple aspects of humanity and the happening. The casting of Bau is top notch as she is natural enough for the audience to relate towards. Her optimistic nature despite all that she has gone through makes her extremely human and ultimately realistic. Likewise as her son Juno Leung steps in with a good debut performance. In no situation does Leung tries to be acting but instead remains real and without a moment of laughable overacting. Other supporting actors such as the old granny repeatedly making the same dish further emphasis what happens when you get older and basically how people lives.The Way We Are is unlikely to splash any fire into Hong Kong cinema and nor does it attempt to. What Ann Hui is trying to show is that people in Tin Shui Wai are basically human and like all humans we all need to eat work and survive. There are little moments of happiness sorrow boredom neutral and ultimately it is there basic human feelings that make this film works. Sometimes criticizing something may well create some controversial but at the end of the day it remains rather subjective and opinionated. What Ann Hui is able to do is at its very best being able to show something that seem more objective and somehow able to make the audience feel as though they are experiencing the experience firsthand. All in all The Way We Are succeeds by showing the basic needs of humanity and ultimately it is a day of reflection of our lives  Neo 2009 I rate it 910www.thehkneo.com".

	schema:headline " Every story is worth telling as long as you have a wonderful storyteller";
	schema:reviewBody "Ann Hui an internationally acclaimed Hong Kong director is perhaps the closer soulmate to Mike Leigh in world cinema today. The Way We Are tells the story of a hardworking goodhearted widow Mrs. Cheung who is living with his teenage son Kaon in a housing estate in Tinshuiwai a suburb regularly featured in the news for all the wrong reasons  family suicide packs problem teens abusing drugs and massive unemployment.At the start we see the two circling around in a tiny apartment with little communication each trapped in their own worlds. Cheung works in the fruit counter in a supermarket while Kaon spends his summer vacation idling at home waiting for the results of his university entrance exam. Soon we are introduced to Cheung's extended family  then we learn that she spent her young adult life working hard in factories to support her two younger brothers paid for their education and they've both since moved upward. But before she has her chance her husband died and left her behind in a poor lowerclass suburb.Cheung soon befriends another widow Granny who's just moved in the same building. Granny has her grim tale  she was forced to live on her own after her only daughter died and her soninlaw remarried. Her grandson is now what remains of her family but he's sadly out of reach. She begins to imprison herself in her single elderly flat until Cheung slowly reaches out to her.Then the somber tone of the story takes on an optimistic note. Cheung ever so nurturing takes Granny in and they soon bond to form their own support network. We also learn that Kaon despite the earring and dyed hair has inherited the strong resilient and optimistic personality of his mother ready and able to take up responsibilities to keep his little family together.The relationship between Cheung and her brothers is also not as remote as it is suggested earlier in the film. While they're no longer as close and the brothers still put their own families before all else they're here to help Cheung and Kaon and willing to pay her back by promising to send Kaon to study overseas if he should fail his exam.At the end Granny's barriers have broken down implanting herself in her new family and treating Kaon like the grandson that she's no longer able to see Even when I die and become a spirit I will continue to pray for his well being.. and there's still hope for happiness for both women.Ann Hui's direction is bare but her fingerprints are everywhere. There are no comedic distraction to pull us out of the morbid tone of her characters' stories like she did in Summer Snow dealing with the grimmer topics of aging and Alzheimer's disease. We instantly know what is in Cheung's mind wonderfully plays by veteran TV actress Paw Heeching deservedly named Best Actress in the HK Film Award with every little gestures  that she's appreciative of having a good son with a hint of a smile a loving expression that knows how life is still good and a light assuring grab of Granny's hand to pull her up from the dark pit of remorse.While Hui is unique and successful in her own right I can't help but thinking back to similar characters in Mike Leigh's films  Cheung has the same stubbornness of Poppy in HappyGoLucky her relationship with the brothers is akin to the implicit bloodisthickerthanwater bond Cynthia has with Maurice in Secrets and Lies and the overall plotless structure of storytelling is very much like Life is Sweet.And its lesson and massage maybe the same  that although life is hard for Cheung Granny and Kaon it's still sweet and hope is everywhere as long as we still have the will to look for it.".

Leung Foon is typically protective and pennypinching but her heart will gradually open to Cheung and Ka on since a near neighbor is better than a distant cousin among them a sensitive surrogate family bond is developing and culminating after a tearjerking talking heart to heart on a bus back from a fruitless attempt to visit Foon's grandson. Meanwhile the backstory of Cheung and the tacit alienation between Cheung and her mother her welloff brothers are all steadily unraveling Cheung is a woman full of pride she can undertake hardships she never solicit any remuneration for bringing up two brothers but her mother thinks it is her tomfoolery to struggle in poverty this creates a knot between them but family is always family there is no grudges among them Cheung's swallow nest congee betokens that tellingly. Hee Ching Paw and Laiwan Chan are pitch perfect in their lifelike performances which incredibly counters their theatrical training newcomer Chunlung Leung is also a force of nature here is a young boy without any rebellious traits no gamble no girlfriend problem no drug abuse no religious hindrance his upbringing is the most laudable feat and yet Hui achieves that by no hyperbole at all. If you are a Hong Kong cinema connoisseur you will be thrilled to see a cameo from a comely Idy Chan 15 years after her retirement from the screen.Ann Hui is a tower of strength in current HK cinema scenery she is less internationally recognized than Johnny To but her cannon is so rich and diverse and her unique mastery of humanistic care should enlist her name among the most overlooked directors of all time!".

However after watching it with tear flowing out of your eye because you're bore to death will you started to like the main character. The strong point of this movie is about characterization making you feel for the main character and with it show you the good side of humanity. Even though this isn't base on real life story after you watch the movie it will feel like one which is another strong point. While I was watching it I was pretty much bore to death so I can tell why some people give this movie a 1 but if you actually finish it you will enjoy it like I did. In a sense this is like Twilight saga in which only some people like it while other cry from how worthless it ismy description The Way We Are will make some people feel emotional about it while other will just turn it off after 10 or so minutes. So if you really want a good movie base on characterization enjoy this one but if you want something surprising or out of place then don't bother with this one. It is just too simple for it to be anything....except a slice of life .".

The movie line is about life in a typical housing estate in Hong Kong of not outstanding people leading their normal ordinary lives. Its like a documentary fly on the ceiling type of docudrama the problem is this... nothing much happened just ordinary lives. I am sure if I were a Martian coming to study human beings in Hong Kong this might be interesting alas I am not. My be when this is broadcast to space someday some aliens might find it useful to see how we live. But I am sorry Miss Director this movie if you can call it a movie didn't work for me.";

	schema:headline " A sweet sad fable about the loss of innocence";
	schema:reviewBody "Korean actress Bae Doona is superb in Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda's latest film Air Doll. Shown at the Vancouver Film Festival Air Doll is based on the Japanese manga The Pneumatic Figure of a Girl and tells the story of a lifesize inflatable doll used as a sex object for a lonely waiter who finds a heart and becomes a real person. The film is supported by the enchanting photography of Mark Lee Pingbing who worked with Hong Kong director Wong Karwei in In the Mood for Love and poetic images abound. When the film opens Hideo Itao Itsuji returns from work as a waiter and begins a conversation about his day and everything seems normal until we discover that he is talking to a doll propped up in bed that he calls Nozomi the name of his former girl friend. Though she is a mannequin he tells her about his life gives her a bath dresses her and has sex with her each night.One morning Nozomi Bae Doona wakes up and finds her heart and is transformed at least as far as appearances are concerned into an ordinary human being. Displaying the innocence of a child Nozomi dressed in a French chambermaid's uniform goes out to explore the outside world and finds out what it means to be human and how society treats women picking up patterns of speech from neighbors but comes home each night to resume her roll as the compliant inanimate doll for her master. Nozomi soon lands a job in a video store and quickly learns about movies though she has never seen one and develops a friendship with the attendant Junichi Arata while continuing to believe that her only function is to provide sexual pleasure.Promoting the idea that everyone is empty at their core and must be fulfilled by the companionship of others Koreeda introduces a host of minor characters such as an old poet who feels betrayed by the world the doll maker who created her a woman fearful of being left alone and a bitter old woman. Junichi abruptly learns about Nozomi's nonhuman status however when she falls and pricks her arm and all the air is drained out of her. In a very erotic scene Junichi inflates her by blowing air into the plug in her stomach and their relationship is sweet. Nozomi discovers however that being half human and half doll is not fulfilling and wishes to become fully human but cannot find anyone to help her turning to her maker God? for assistance.Air Doll is a sweet sad fable about the loss of innocence and Bae Doona is funny and touching in the role of a childlike doll in the tradition of Pinocchio. While it is valuable to view the world from a childlike perspective and discover once again for example how beautiful the stars are having a mannequin eventually become a mirror of humanity's dark side serves little purpose. Yes life is ugly and beautiful sad and full of joy but this is hardly a revelation. The film which took nine years from planning stages until completion has important comments about alienation in the modern world but at two hours the simple premise is stretched too thin. Koreeda makes the point repeatedly about the emptiness of humans forgetting that cities are home not only to lonely alienated and empty people but to brilliant fulfilled and compassionate individuals who contribute much value to our world.".

	schema:reviewBody "Air Doll is a poetic unhurried beautifully shot and poignant movie which may remind you of Lars and the Real Girl Artificial Intelligence Enchanted Cyborg She Pinocchio and Toy Story yet it distinguishes itself by its poetic quality and focus on the emptiness of city life.Indeed city dwellers resemble sex dolls. Lacking souls and uniqueness they can be easily substituted by others. Nozomi's sex with three different men exploiting her and treating her as a substitute is one of the examples. Degrading themselves by treating each other as functional objects they will be forgotten once they become useless. A dead person therefore is depicted as a piece of garbage.Moreover some city dwellers prefer to live alone and sometimes they feel lonely. The movie reminds us that humans should have companions. DVDs gradually replacing cinemas also indicates that people nowadays prefer solitude.Apart from these city slickers value money and sex more important than soul and love. For instance a man prefers an air doll to a real woman and even a little girl prefers a ring to a doll given by her mother.Despite the gloomy atmosphere the movie reminds us of the cycle of life which consists of not only downs but also ups. Although plants wither in winter they grow in spring. Perhaps we should learn from Nozomi who tries to appreciate every moment of happiness be it fleeting or lasting for instance gazing at stars and even a raindrop admiring the breathtaking scenery in the city embracing a man she has a crush on while riding on a motorcycle etc. Indeed Nozomi is already happier than other real human characters in the movie.Starring as an inflatable sex doll with a soul Korean actress Doona Bae The Host Linda Linda Linda gives a convincing and dazzling performance in this Japanese movie. The audience will be amazed by every nuance of her expressions  movements and the daring naked scenes.The renowned Taiwan cinematographer Mark Pingbing Lee In the Mood for Love succeeds in capturing the mood of this lonely city by often panning his camera slowly to observe loners. The dreamlike music by World's End Girlfriend also adds much purity mystery and melancholy to this fractured modern fairy tale.Although the plot would become more substantial if other minor characters were further developed they help illustrate how lonely and alienated humans are.After seeing this haunting movie one may leave the cinema with a heavy heart and a deep sigh trying to feel one's longlost soul and pondering on the meaning of ephemeral life.Hirokazu Koreeda is one of my favorite directors and his previous movies like Maborosi Nobody Knows and Still Walking are highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Hauntingly beautiful film";
	schema:reviewBody "In short A deep thoughtprovoking beautifully filmed and well acted piece of Japanese cinema. Bae Doona is magnificent as an inflatable doll that develops a soul and falls in love. Hirokazu Koreeda wows once again with his deliberate film making effectively commenting on social problems dealing with urban life. Despite the fact that it is a bit slow and a bit long Air Doll is definitely one of the better films that I've seen recently.I was finally able to watch this film on DVD and was impressed more so than I thought I would be. To me Air Doll includes aspects that make it attractive to both film festivals and commercial audiences. With the quirky and interesting premise of a sex doll that comes to life Air Doll which is lightly based on a manga establishes itself as a film which seeks to appeal to modern audiences specifically Japanese. This doll named Nozomi played by Korean actress Bae Doona sneaks out of her owners house every day to go to work at a local video store. There she falls in love with her coworker Junichi played by Arata and learns about lifeboth the good and the bad.What separates Air Doll from some of Koreeda's previous work is his choice of Mark Lee as cinematographer. He films the city of Tokyo beautifully with long gorgeous tracking shots. This is a departure from Koreeda's usual style of which films like Nobody Knows and Still Walking are good examples both being pretty uncommercial. I enjoyed the cameo's by some wellestablished actors including Odagiri Joe as the doll maker Susumu Terajima as a police officer and Kimiko Yo as an aging woman obsessed with looking young although they were definitely not noteworthy performances. I also enjoyed the music which moved along with the pace of the film and effectively added emotional weight to select scenes.Where I thought the film faltered was in length. It was too long which is not a completely horrible fault in many cases but towards the end I felt as if Koreeda had already established his point and needed to wrap it up. Length is a characteristic problem in many contemporary Japanese films. I feel as if this works for some Love Exposure !? but not for most. Another fault that I'd like to mention was the odd Jdramalike breaks in the scene where Nozomi is being repeatedly drained of air then blown back up by Junichi in bed. The same shot was shown three times from different angles which I found unnecessary and out of place. But that's just me being picky.Air Doll attempts to illustrate to the viewer the loneliness that exists in an urban environment such as Tokyo. He does this perfectly with the inclusion of small side stories a nerdy otaku a lonely old man an aging woman obsessed with beauty a bulimic woman suffering from depression and other lonely people. These characters only briefly appear on the screen giving the impression of the fleeting encounters with strangers in a big city urban environment. Bae Doona's character of the doll Nozomi is the highlight of the movie. She plays the character perfectly often condensing many emotions into one and displaying all of the quirkiness of a doll that has recently discovered life. It is interesting and perfect that Koreeda cast a Korean in the roll of the doll as it further alienates the character from the rest of the cast as well as the audience. It is also interesting to note the fact that Bae Doona was very naked during the film being a sex doll and all a feat that not many Japanese actresses would even dare to do. She has been nominated forand won manyawards for best actress.John Kincaid  jkfilmjapan.wordpress.com".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Air Doll";
	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirector Koreeda has a strong fanbase in Singapore after his wellreceived Nobody Knows garnered him quite the following from a screening here years back. No sooner than the festival's tickets had gone on sale that it registered its first sellout session in Air Doll and two other subsequent repeat screenings released had all its tickets already snapped up. Either that or the appeal of watching a sex doll come to life under Singapore's R21 rating uncut is too hard to pass up. I had that opportunity to partake in a masterclass session with Koreeda during last year's Tokyo International Film Festival where three of his films got screened overnight with the director and his guests in attendance but alas I wasn't in top form to have covered it. I'm regretting it now.The other film I had watched with a sex doll featured prominently in the story was Craig Gillespie's Lars and the Real Girl starring Ryan Gosling where his character bought a custom made sex doll over the internet not for sex but for companionship. Personally I've always thought it creepy for anyone to own a doll to interact with and yikes to make love to and here even christening it Nozomi. But as a character in Air Doll puts it a real life relationship may be too hard for some folks to handle because it comes with inevitable problems warts and all. And yes while that's the truth I still can't fathom the necessity of owning a doll for sexual gratification but I digress.Koreda's Air Doll is a fantasy film along the lines of Pinnochio where an inanimate object comes to life and dreams of being a real boy. Here it's all the more creepier when the air doll Nozomi suddenly without reason nor forewarning starts to move on her own and develops heart and soul through the course of the story. She doesn't need to yearn to be real because she's almost real utilizing clothing and makeup to conceal portions of her that are telltale signs that she's a lifesized madeofplastic Barbie doll coming in the form of Korean actress Bae Doona last seen in the Korean monster film The Host. Bae brings her Nozomi a sense of that wideeyed wonderment of the real world and her performance as a plastic inflatable doll is flawless with Nozomi constantly in amazement from the assault of the senses of sight sound and touch. There's also a comedic innocence brought about through her zilch knowledge of the real world which of course we'll expect this to be exploited by nastier humans because the world is as evil as such where innocence has no place once her honeymoon period is over. Balancing her routine very carefully with that of her owner Hideo's Itsuji Itao in order to enable her to work at a video store in the day living an independent life undetected and then being back at home on time to fulfill Hideo's sexual needs things start to become a little more complicated when she develops feelings for her colleague Junichi Arata.Paced slowly to mirror Nozomi's journey of discovery of all things beautiful from cosmetics to toddlers to that proverbial flower along the sidewalk Air Doll contains a few scenes that provide that stark commentary about the emptiness of soul and the loneliness experienced in big city living. To Nozomi it's an abstract concept that she grasps only literally but for the rest of us we're likely to nod in agreement with the statements since we're experiencing such feelings day in and day out. It is these episodes and incidents through Nozomi's interactions with others that bring the film to life and some of these can be as short as one selfcontained scene like the one on the bus where she lends her shoulder to a sleeping man. It's all within our means to show a little compassion and to make the world a better place to live in.While yet consumed with a pop kind of feeling throughout and Koreeda's most erotic film to date the film is a meditation of life and the fragility of it where people are constantly in search of substitutes for things they cannot obtain to fulfill some need or want which reflects quite well of our modern life where distractions are many and substitution being a way of life from products to services. I absolutely loved how Koreeda provided us scenes of satisfaction with a montage of lonely people doing simple things to that switch later on with dissatisfaction with the same. It's a wonderful fantasy film that makes us reflect on our own parallels but doesn't do so in a preachy way instead relying on tragedy and especially comedy through the literal interpretation of things to lighten the mood. The sciencefiction equivalent will be something like Spielberg's A.I. where a young robot embarks on a quest to find his mother and become a real boy This air doll has plenty of humanity inside her full of soul and that neverceasing innocent curiosity that makes it a delight to watch maintaining touching aspects to tug at your heartstrings. I'm quite certain the audience who have snapped up tickets so eagerly won't be left disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Koreeda's newest is a touching and somber portrait of loneliness and life";
	schema:reviewBody "Koreeda Hirokazu's newest film Kuki Ningyo AKA Air Doll is a brilliant and sobering look at life alienation and loneliness in modern society. Its fantastical story while unconventional delivers a powerfully emotional story that will certainly have a lingering effect on viewers. The story seems like the plot of a Japanese AV Adult Video or anime  a blowup sex toy one day miraculously comes to life after gaining a heartsoul kokoro. Her owner is a lonely middle aged waiter named Hideo Itao Itsuji who lovingly talks to the doll whom he named  Nozomi and thinks of her as his companion and lover. While Hideo is at work Nozomi portrayed by the talented Korean actress Bae DuNa ventures out into the real world with childlike curiosity and wonder. During one of her outings she encounters Junichi a friendly video shop clerk handsome fashion model turned actor ARATAIuchi Arata. It is love a first site and Nozomi decides to work for Junichi and his boss Samezu Iwamatsu Ryo. Nozomi's unbelievable naivet and awkwardness doesn't seem to bother Junichi and he soon educates Nozomi on life and human interaction through foreign movies and TV. As Nozomi falls deeper into love for Junichi she becomes more distant and colder to Hideo who is oblivious to her adventures and newfound sentience. The bond with Junichi becomes even stronger when he discovers her secret and saves her life after Nozomi develops a gash in her body causing air to escape from her body. However Nozomi's happiness soon fades as fate deals her a number of setbacks and a tragic error in judgment soon shatters her life forever.While comparisons to Craig Gillespie's 2007 film Lars and the Real Girl and perhaps even in a looser sense 1987's Mannequin are likely Air Doll is more like a companion piece to that film and also goes beyond just dealing with a man's obsession with an artificial girl but explores the greater question of how people deal with loneliness and alienation. In fact amid Nozomi's quest to learn humanity she encounters various people along the way who cope with loneliness in different ways a senior who is at peace in the twilight of his life a woman who tries in vain to regain her youth a young woman who binges on food to fill her void a refined woman who involves herself in every little aspect in her neighborhood. As in his previous films especially Dare Mo Shiranai and Maboroshi Koreeda has a knack at exploring the lives of ordinary people and creating drama out of the mundane and ordinary. The screenplay adapted by Koreeda and based on Goda Yoshiie's short manga story Goda Tetsukaku Dou  Kuki NingyoGoda's Philosophical Discourse  Air Doll very much captures author Goda's quirky and satirical commentary on love and society but Koreeda adds in the human aspects and supplements the story with a remarkably touching look at love and humanity.Bae DuNa's Host Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance performance is endearing and lovely. Since her first Japanese film debut Linda Linda Linda Du Na has become even more confident in her Japanese language abilities and is able to project likable girlish charm in her role as Nozomi. DuNa tackles the role of Nozomi with impressive boldness she appears naked in a good portion of the filmand yet she doesn't make Nozomi sleazy or dirty in the least and in fact portrays her in a almost childlike fashion. ARAKA is also good in his role but doesn't really bring much to the table other than being a nice guy character who is incredibly tolerant of Nozomi and all her bizarre quirks his Jyunichi character doesn't even show any terror or shock at the site of Nozomi deflating in front of him or in the fact that Nozomi has an air tab in her bellybutton. Odagiri Joe Shinobi Tokyo Tower who makes a cameo appearance as Sonoda Nozomi's kindly manufacturer and father also puts in a great albeit short performance. When Odagiri's character asks Nozomi if she regrets gaining a soul it is a touching and tearful scene.Much has been said of Taiwanese cinematographer Pin Bing Lee's Flight of the Red Balloon The Sun Also Rises glorious and vibrant photography and indeed it is impressive. The film looks wonderful and has an almost fairy tale quality about it. Air Doll could have focused on the obsession with finding virtual and artificial love and the bizarre and perverted fascination with Real Dolls and other sex toys but thankfully Koreeda opted to instead focus on the loneliness and other human conditions that force humans into seeking love and affection however artificial. Air Doll is a reflective yet tragic story of a doll who somehow was blessed to find a soul but who ultimately fell victim to all the heartaches that came with it  ironic that while Nozomi was created to fill the void and sexual needs of others yet yet was ultimately unable to achieve that need herself.".

	schema:headline " Meditations reflections magical realism lyricism. Hirokazu Koreeda";
	schema:reviewBody "In the early 70's I used to wander in and out of sex shops in Soho London. One of the highticket objects that always caught my eye was the rubber blowup dolls labelled sailors help. I always tried to imagine a lonely sailor having sex with this travesty of an imaginary woman. What particularly puzzled me was how is the doll more satisfying than masturbation with the hand?. I concluded that all its contrivance was superfluous and that those that used the doll must need to create a highly complex artificial world. Koreeda's moviewhich I viewed exactly forty years since I last looked at a sailor's help features certain technological advances  the skin tones are more lifelike and the latex is less rubbery the hair and makeup is more convincing  apart from these minor alterations its the same old dumb doll.Koreeda whose poetic imagination is different to mine wondered about many magical and profound possibilities when he encountered his first sex doll. I can only analyze these from a Western point of view. A Chef is portrayed interacting with his doll. Apart from the sexual act in which we are introduced to the snap in snap out washable vagina we are made privy to his affection and warm intimacy with his inanimate doll. All his emotional needs are fulfilled in his totemization of his latex goddess. What gives the doll life is the blow job he regularly gives the doll in the inflation process. This introduction is well acted and convincing.Then the fairy tale begins as the doll is in the Ancient Egyptian manner transformed with pneuma into a living being. How is she different? Well for one her breasts change from the usual silicone bag shape the ubiquitous Hollywood look to a natural form of great beauty  this live doll is a magnificent apparition of womanly grace and archetypal form  she's not big brash and in your face but instead she has a birdlike elegance that lovers of the nude will find breathtaking at least I did. The fairy tale now progresses into a portrait of what this beautiful woman  who is still a doll but is also a gorgeous woman will experience in a world of intense emotional discipline. The Tokyo setting is appealing and the music has a wind up clock musical box feel imagine a twirling ballerina accompanied by the Nutcracker Suite on top of a musical box. This is very effective and calls ones attention to the mechanical in the doll.The director Koreeda ponders about the realities of urban Tokyo life with its density and its order. The life of the libidinous search for sexual gratification is controlled by the harmless sublimation of sexual energy into the doll with its washable vagina reminiscent of the condom  especially the female condom the femidom.The living doll has many adventures dressed in fashionable Tokyo style or amazingly in the nude as the slow but beautiful movie lets you see her evolution into a fullyfledged womanhood. Here we come to the genius of this movie which is the erotocization of air. It all makes logical sense that the air doll is turned on by air. Her tumescence and detumescence is a pneumatic event  while humans have blood running through their veins the doll has air. These sexual scenes portraying her sexuality illustrating the strength of her intake and the weakness of her air loss. It is so resonant of so much that is human that it is nothing short of dazzling.The Japanese samurai tradition see Paul Schrader's Mishima is confirmed in the fetish of the bellybutton solar plexus and the seppuku ending with the doll trying to reach her lovers life through the vestige of his umbilical cord.I am not sure whether I have done this lyrical poetic inspiration justice but it certainly is a touching paean to human frailty and the doll is an awesome vision to behold. She gives a moving performance in a difficult role to pull off convincingly. The director must be congratulated with his cinematographer for an intelligent excavation of the difference between feeling and lack of feeling. This movie will appeal to both genders as it navigates uncharted waters in the field of the human psyche. An exhilarating experience that lives on way after the curtain closes.".

	schema:headline " Probably never look at blow up dolls or people that use it the same way again";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard about this movie I thought it was going to be similar to LARS AND THE REAL GIRL. But instead of the plot revolving around the guy that is obsessed over a blow up doll the story is mainly told in the blow up dolls point of view when she comes to life and finds a heart. And yeah some aspects of the film is creepy as it's sounds kinda creepy version of Pinocchio and also seems to have more depth to it as well. The thing is for the most part the premise is sort of original and was pretty interesting for the first half of the movie but slowly started to lose my interest. Basically starts out with a living blow up doll that acts similar to a girl that has amnesia and has to learn everything all over again while falling in love than later goes in the darker parts of life direction. Which worked fine but didn't really grab my attention all the way through. The theme is about the value of life that makes us human and goes in the bright and dark side of life in a sort of a fairy tale manner. While also showing how people make substitutes for the stuff they want or have lost. From what I know blow up dolls are made for people that don't have a chance with a real girl so it's there to help satisfy the sexual desires. I am not sure if Doona Bae was the right actress for this role playing the live blow up doll but she did a fine job playing all naive and innocent. This is one of those movies where you have to just go with the premise of the movie although some of the character reactions just doesn't make sense or awkward at times your just gonna have to go with the flow of how the characters react to a live blow up doll. Although this has some bright elements to it most of it is pretty depressing while showing life in general in a realistic way and the loss of innocence. I don't know how many japs use blow up dolls as substitutes although I heard that a lot of them uses it. This movie did a decent job of portraying the sad parts of society. All in all it's pretty good fantasy film that reflects on some societies and some people in general. There is also a lot of erotic scenes in this.7.510".

	onyx:emotionText "When I first heard about this movie I thought it was going to be similar to LARS AND THE REAL GIRL. But instead of the plot revolving around the guy that is obsessed over a blow up doll the story is mainly told in the blow up dolls point of view when she comes to life and finds a heart. And yeah some aspects of the film is creepy as it's sounds kinda creepy version of Pinocchio and also seems to have more depth to it as well. The thing is for the most part the premise is sort of original and was pretty interesting for the first half of the movie but slowly started to lose my interest. Basically starts out with a living blow up doll that acts similar to a girl that has amnesia and has to learn everything all over again while falling in love than later goes in the darker parts of life direction.

	schema:reviewBody "If you're thinking Oh those wacky Japanese. A movie about a blowup doll who keenly aware that her function is to provide sexual pleasure comes to life. That'll be fun! you will be surprised if not disappointed by this film. Duna Bae does a few scenes in her birthday suit and spends most of the rest of the film in cute little outfits with very short skirtsone of them being the maid's uniform you see in the posterbut there isn't much that's erotic let alone prurient about this film at all. It's sad and melancholy. And innocent.There are three things that contribute to the superbity yep I'm going with it of this film. The first is the cinematography by Mark Pin Bing Lee. Remember that name. If he's the director of photography on a film you can count on it at least looking good. The second is the soundtrack by World's End Girlfriendwhich is actually just one guy who specializes in otherworldly noise experiments with hints of jazz and classical. His work here creates a hip contemporary and dreamlike atmosphere and since this is a film about the emptiness and isolation of modern life it's a good thing. The third contributing factor is the masterstroke of casting Duna Bae as the Air Doll. It's hard to think of another actress who could have made such a success of the role. Bae is a fearless talented versatile actress and she also somewhat looks the part with her large expressive anime inspired eyes. She's also Korean giving her a headstart playing a fish out of water in this Japanese film. There are few actors who can convincingly run through a range of several emotions in a matter of seconds without moving a muscle in their faces. Bae is one of those actors and she does it often.The film starts right off with the Air Doll inexplicably finding a heart and coming to life. She sneaks out during the day while her owner is at work to discover the world and its characters. She gets a job at a video store and when one day she accidentally cuts herself and starts losing air instead of bleeding a coworker who seems completely nonplussed by the event puts a piece of tape on the tear and blows her back up. They fall in love. If there is one sexy scene in the film in a sort of convoluted way it's when the two make love. The guy wants to take off the tape and watch her lose air and then watch her reanimate by blowing her up again. When the Air Doll wants to do the same by cutting the guy things don't turn out as she expects. Bae plays the scene in a very convincing way.Air Doll has a slow pace and a number of characters seem to just float by without explanation but when it's all over they will have made sense. The central conceit of the film doesn't hold up to scrutiny if you think about it too much so if any of these kinds of things bother you take a pass. There is also an extended scene where the Air Doll meets her maker. The director seems to have wanted to use this meeting to explain the film Aren't we all just empty vessels? Although the scene is a touching one I could have done without it not only because it would have tightened up the film but also because I don't like it when directors make beautiful films and muck them up with verbal explanations of what they are trying to present metaphorically.".

It is a sexual toy which gives him the comfort and release he would have to pay by visiting a 'real' person a prostitute who will provide what Nozomi gives him freely. The waiter's universe is centered in his small apartment in an unfashionable part of Tokyo far from the glitter and noise from more affluent areas. One day when Hideo is away at work Nozomi wakes up.

She meets a father with a young daughter a woman with eating disorders an old man at a park overlooking the water but it is Junichi the clerk of a video shop that captures her imagination. Junichi has a secret of his own and he identifies with Nozomi immediately. Nozomi feels betrayed when she returns home to find a substitute in Hideo's bed. She is not as important anymore. She decides to track down the man who made her. When she does she is in for another surprise. The doll maker is blunt in telling Nozomi what is basically his belief and what he hopes to accomplish by making the dolls. Eventually losing Junichi Nozomi's life is not worth living. She ends up among the discarded bags of garbage that are not recyclable.An interesting parable by Japanese Hirokazu Koreeda who wrote the screenplay based on a manga by Joshile Goda. The film examines the empty lives of people in a society like the Japanese where spending something like 5700 yen in the purchase of the doll for sexual gratification is something not too far fetched. In a city of such large population Tokyo must be a place where individuals without social skills can be ostracized from the mainstream which seems to be the theme behind the story. Although a bit long the film surprises in the way the subject matter is treated.Best of all is Doona Bae whose intelligent approach to Nozomi shows an actress with an amazing range who transform in front of our eyes becoming a woman. Arata and Itsuji Itao are good as Junichi and Hideo. The film kept reminding this viewer of another American film about the same subject 'Lars and the Real Girl' which had a different tone but dealt with a man that falls in love with an inflatable doll something that does not happen in this picture.".

	schema:headline " A Nice Vice";
	schema:reviewBody "Youth culture today is much like it was several generations ago in the early 20th century with one significant difference. We live in a more sexually relaxed society today which is ironically less promiscuous than it was for young adults in the 60's 70's and 80's. Indeed a higher percentage of children today reach their 19th and even 20th birthdays with their virginity than their parents did. It isn't uncommon if you speak to this minority of young people to hear outlandish fantastical or absurd descriptions of their ideal boyfriendgirlfriend or first sexual encounter. Childhood exposure to sweet romance films linger unhealthily and sabotage these older virgins. This is especially true in Japan where depopulation is a serious social issue.Hirokazu Koreeda's Air Doll is a film about this phenomenon or I interpret it as one. Unfortunately any review you read is going to be jaded by the film's abyss of ambiguity. A few of the director's intentions are identifiable but a lot of it features the titular doll wandering about and experiencing her new human life. These segments are wellfilmed and emotionally grounded in a generic childhood discovery theme lacking the more interesting focal points of the director's other films. The viewer is thus left to apply cultural implications to the film for it to be more than pure cinema.The air doll is an inflatable sex toy owned by a middleaged man who calls her Nozomi and treats her as his girlfriend. They eat dinner together walk through the park and have sex all on his schedule and he loves her a lot. Nozomi realizes she has a heart and wakes up one day when her master goes to work. She wanders around for a while taking everything in and visits a movie store. She begins working there and falls in love with one of her coworkers. More wonder sequences play this time featuring the pair's almostdialog free courtship. On paper it sounds mundane but lead actress Bae Doona bolsters the emotionality of these scenes with her performance which is reminiscent of a Disney Princess role minus the artificial sentiment. The camera frequently grants us a close ups of her and her boyfriend encouraging our intimacy with their romance.Koreeda overtly references Disney's version of The Little Mermaid specifically in Nozomi's observation of a girl who mistakes a fork for a comb.

	onyx:emotionText "Youth culture today is much like it was several generations ago in the early 20th century with one significant difference. We live in a more sexually relaxed society today which is ironically less promiscuous than it was for young adults in the 60's 70's and 80's. Indeed a higher percentage of children today reach their 19th and even 20th birthdays with their virginity than their parents did. It isn't uncommon if you speak to this minority of young people to hear outlandish fantastical or absurd descriptions of their ideal boyfriendgirlfriend or first sexual encounter. Childhood exposure to sweet romance films linger unhealthily and sabotage these older virgins. This is especially true in Japan where depopulation is a serious social issue.Hirokazu Koreeda's Air Doll is a film about this phenomenon or I interpret it as one. Unfortunately any review you read is going to be jaded by the film's abyss of ambiguity. A few of the director's intentions are identifiable but a lot of it features the titular doll wandering about and experiencing her new human life. These segments are wellfilmed and emotionally grounded in a generic childhood discovery theme lacking the more interesting focal points of the director's other films. The viewer is thus left to apply cultural implications to the film for it to be more than pure cinema.The air doll is an inflatable sex toy owned by a middleaged man who calls her Nozomi and treats her as his girlfriend. They eat dinner together walk through the park and have sex all on his schedule and he loves her a lot. Nozomi realizes she has a heart and wakes up one day when her master goes to work. She wanders around for a while taking everything in and visits a movie store. She begins working there and falls in love with one of her coworkers. More wonder sequences play this time featuring the pair's almostdialog free courtship. On paper it sounds mundane but lead actress Bae Doona bolsters the emotionality of these scenes with her performance which is reminiscent of a Disney Princess role minus the artificial sentiment. The camera frequently grants us a close ups of her and her boyfriend encouraging our intimacy with their romance.Koreeda overtly references Disney's version of The Little Mermaid specifically in Nozomi's observation of a girl who mistakes a fork for a comb. The girl's father tells her that a fork isn't for grooming which becomes entwined with the narrative when Nozomi punctures herself. Her boyfriend blows life into her through her air hole an indirect form of sexual expression but Nozomi doesn't understand its implications. This reaffirms the latent misogyny of the many Disney films where the woman character subtly confuses her psychological needs with those of society and her prince. A perfect conclusion follows Nozomi stabs her boyfriend in his navel to breathe into him and he bleeds to death. Her desire for mutual intimacy cannot be realized and she suffers for it. In her grief she throws herself in a trash heap.Perhaps Air Doll can thus be seen as an encompassing metaphor for coming social collapse brought about by youth's Japanese or otherwise alienation from itself.

But I should have known with a director like Koreeda it's wouldn't be exploitativein fact it was a poignant meditation on the preciousness of life. It also has the idea of finding the beautiful in the mundane that reminds me of American Beauty much like the subplot of the showing the quiet lives of desperation lived by many people in the city. Bae Doona Linda Linda Linda feels right for the role since she is an outsider in the fact that she is Korean. She inhibits the erotic role of the surrogate sex doll with an innocence that feels appropriate for the filmit never feels exploitative but natural. The film has a different visual look than the usual Koreeda film which is due to the fact that his cinematographer for this film was cinematographer Ping Bin Lee In the Mood for Love. It's nice to be surprised in a good way on occasion.".

It's all done with such honesty you soon forget this is a story about a sex doll.

Now if you're like me you might think that that's a laughably stupid premise. And maybe that could be a good thing! Maybe a movie about a sex doll's magical crash course in humanity could satirize an overplayed genre trope have a few laughs and maybe muster some heart in spite of its absurdity!Hirokazu Koreeda doesn't seem to think so. His laughless plastic person drama Air Doll fancies itself a whimsical portrait of love and loneliness thatwhoa ho ho!might just have something to say about the human condition. He plays this stupid idea completely straight and the result is an overlong selfcongratulatory pile of witless quirk and existential platitudes so over the top that it would be right at home in the filmography of Trey Parker and Matt Stone.It's a shame because Air Doll features a compelling performance from Bae Doona as the sex doll and it flirts with some interesting ideasmaybe the line between us and the refuse around us is a bit more arbitrary than we'd like to admit etc.but the film ultimately completely undermines any potential philosophical weight it might have had through its utter lack of any semblance of selfawareness.The film puts an embarrassing amount of effort into establishing the sex doll as innocent and naive and just the most precious thing you ever done sawlook the sex doll thinks the city is beautiful! look the sex doll is holding hands with children! this isn't completely effing ridiculous it's adorable! right? right?And then before it's even mastered language the sex doll starts musing on the nature of existence through suddenly omniscient voiceover because yeah I guess it's narrating this thing all of the sudden.And then character after character starts to notice that hey you know what we're not so different you and I sex doll. Humans and sex dolls that is.And I could enjoy this moviehell I could love this movie seeing as I have a capacity for irony that the filmmaking team apparently lacksbut then this movie starts rolling out the big moment ham fisted emotional beats and none of it hits me at all. This movie just simply fails to make me feel anything and it makes its intentions so clear and it tries so damn hard and it's aiming for tears every ten minutes and I just cannot take this sex doll odyssey seriously.Idunno maybe Air Doll has a future as a really bad cult movie all I know is that it has a present as a really bad bad movie.

He plays this stupid idea completely straight and the result is an overlong selfcongratulatory pile of witless quirk and existential platitudes so over the top that it would be right at home in the filmography of Trey Parker and Matt Stone.It's a shame because Air Doll features a compelling performance from Bae Doona as the sex doll and it flirts with some interesting ideasmaybe the line between us and the refuse around us is a bit more arbitrary than we'd like to admit etc.but the film ultimately completely undermines any potential philosophical weight it might have had through its utter lack of any semblance of selfawareness.The film puts an embarrassing amount of effort into establishing the sex doll as innocent and naive and just the most precious thing you ever done sawlook the sex doll thinks the city is beautiful! look the sex doll is holding hands with children! this isn't completely effing ridiculous it's adorable! right? right?And then before it's even mastered language the sex doll starts musing on the nature of existence through suddenly omniscient voiceover because yeah I guess it's narrating this thing all of the sudden.And then character after character starts to notice that hey you know what we're not so different you and I sex doll. Humans and sex dolls that is.And I could enjoy this moviehell I could love this movie seeing as I have a capacity for irony that the filmmaking team apparently lacksbut then this movie starts rolling out the big moment ham fisted emotional beats and none of it hits me at all. This movie just simply fails to make me feel anything and it makes its intentions so clear and it tries so damn hard and it's aiming for tears every ten minutes and I just cannot take this sex doll odyssey seriously.Idunno maybe Air Doll has a future as a really bad cult movie all I know is that it has a present as a really bad bad movie.

There is SOUL in the movie in reference to a supposedly soulless material that is the dollmannequin.Bae Doona perfectly breathes life to an otherwise lifeless doll. She best performs the part of a reticent woman who tries to figure for herself if finding a heart is a good thing or not. I love the way she carries her face that innocent lookingforanswers findingmyworthinthisworldofpeople look on her. Everything in the film falls into place. The cute jewelrybox background music the aspect of onesided love and the journey of finding the meaning of life and having a heart. The atmosphere and overall feel of the movie is just so cute and lovely. But its simplicity is overshadowed by the bittersweet theme that I came to the realization that it was not as simple as it appears to be. Koreeda hit the mark on this one. He has produced a product that is both perfect on the content and the execution.

In fact there are no scenes shot in HK at all. Nearly everything is on location in Mainland China. It's also the last Liu Chia Liang film working with his Shaw crew of cameramen and technicians. It's one of the first HK and Mainland coproductions and the first time Jet Li worked with anyone other than Mainland film crews. Jet Li has been unusually frank about his unhappiness with the work habits of the HK crew director Liu included.The story is clearly from HK as Jet Li gets into situations that would have been considered unacceptable in a Mainland production at that time. He plays a mischievous kung fu monk with an agenda for revenge against an evil warlord. He meets up with a girl with the same agenda but she's disguised as a boy which fools everyone but the audience. Many many fight scenes with a generous helping of lion dancing.The film is thematically the style of Liu's previous films for the Shaw studios right down to the woman dressed as a man plot device. If the story was a little bit more substantial perhaps this film would be as well known as Liu's other classics. It's easy to imagine replacing the entire Mainland acting company with the Shaw regulars. The camera work is in the Shaw style but with the added benefit of gorgeous Mainland landscapes and famous landmarks. The action is classic Liu Chia Liang choreography with a Mainland Wu Shu twist. The mass action scenes are exceptional. Great action Jet Li playing a comic character excellent photography. Recommended.".

The first was solid but nothing special. The second one was an atrocity whilst the third one is fairly enjoyable. Shaolin Temple III has a solid medium of drama  comedy mostly leaning towards the comedy side of things. The humor is quite silly and doesn't offer many laughs but at least it's not overkill like the second one or the cruel style of humor that the first one had. The action is the main reason to see this one. We get plenty of exciting fights which are expertly paced. Jet Li's acrobatics are out of this world and he made sure to make up for the second one's shortcomings in the fights department. I also dug the opening. Jet Li ferociously punching at a tree evokes memories of Rocky punching the meat. Final Thoughts It's not something I'll ever watch again but it's not bad for a one time watch. The fights deliver in a big way and I was entertained by them. It's worth a look6.410".

Unfortunately there is a great flaw in the plot since it is not explained why Sunyoung does not bring her own skull to Hyunmin. I understand that the spirit that haunts Hyunmin is the donor of Jin's heart Choyen Run. If Sunyoung was able to interact in the world of the living why did she get another skull?

I know that many people expecting a balls to the wall fright fest have are disappointed but this quiet little film is a wonderful change of pace. Indeed the monsters here are human and the ghosts are merely victims. Those looking for something like JuOn Ringu or other overt horror films should look elsewhere since this isn't that sort of movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film for the first time last night and I have to say it was as lovely as it was disappointing. One of the reasons I watch Asian films is to get away from the conventional pacing and 'scares' of American movies. Face has incredibly American pacing and predictable attempts at frightening the viewers. And I do mean predictable. Allow me to illustrate.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADIt was not long after the movie started... oh about 3 minutes or so... where I started calling the action and fright spots from my chair. Not that I'm great at that kind of thing though I've been getting better at it it was just THAT easy to predict. Every conventional spook they could throw in they did.There were two plot twists that I did not expect... the first skull being someone else and the big twist which I won't reveal. There was a great deal of Juon style scare tactics here lots of the same makeup... add a dash of Sadako for good measure and you have the horror part of the movie. Now if they had touted the film as a thriller with some supernatural overtones it would have been different... this was an interesting film.Well interesting premise. I loved the idea of the reconstructor but the rest was basic stuff. At least it wasn't a case of 'organ makes recipient do bad things' or anything. Mostly it was a murder mystery that happened to have a ghost in it and if you take it that way you won't be disappointed by the lack of scariness. The movie also dealt slightly with blackmarket organs and how far doctors will go to help their patients as it were. The movie touches on many small aspects without ever really delving into any of them which is unfortunate but understandable. The filmography the picture the handling everything was really well done. Korean films are often very pretty though with a great deal of potential delivering less than expected or worse less than they are capable of delivering. More than once has a Korean film left me mildly disappointed storywise though always satisfied visually. They also tend towards very good actors and music scores. All this adds to great padding and fluff gorgeous eyecandy and just a little weak in the script. The climaxes are generally less than they shouldcould be as well.All in all a seven out of ten. It's worth watching at least once and definitely enjoyable despite its story flaws.".

Every conventional spook they could throw in they did.There were two plot twists that I did not expect... the first skull being someone else and the big twist which I won't reveal. There was a great deal of Juon style scare tactics here lots of the same makeup... add a dash of Sadako for good measure and you have the horror part of the movie. Now if they had touted the film as a thriller with some supernatural overtones it would have been different... this was an interesting film.Well interesting premise. I loved the idea of the reconstructor but the rest was basic stuff. At least it wasn't a case of 'organ makes recipient do bad things' or anything. Mostly it was a murder mystery that happened to have a ghost in it and if you take it that way you won't be disappointed by the lack of scariness. The movie also dealt slightly with blackmarket organs and how far doctors will go to help their patients as it were. The movie touches on many small aspects without ever really delving into any of them which is unfortunate but understandable. The filmography the picture the handling everything was really well done. Korean films are often very pretty though with a great deal of potential delivering less than expected or worse less than they are capable of delivering. More than once has a Korean film left me mildly disappointed storywise though always satisfied visually. They also tend towards very good actors and music scores. All this adds to great padding and fluff gorgeous eyecandy and just a little weak in the script. The climaxes are generally less than they shouldcould be as well.All in all a seven out of ten. It's worth watching at least once and definitely enjoyable despite its story flaws.";

It is not your typical haunting ghost story it's more of a thriller with some supernatural elements thrown in so it is not very scary from a Westerner point of view.

The film shows our hero Lee Hyunmin Hyeonjun Shin being plagued by a demanding ghost and an assistant Jung Sunyoung Yunah Song motivating him to continue his work. He first believes his mission in finding the identity of a skull will lead to his daughter's health rejuvenating..the film points out the possibility that the ghost will not let his daughter's heart function properly unless her killer is apprehended. When our facial reconstructionist desires to know the identity of the donor whose heart resides in his daughter the master heart surgeon's resistance proves that there might be a corrupt means of obtaining these organs. Soon the surgeon is found hung by a noose and the whole film takes on an even greater hunt for the killer whose identity still remains unknown. An assistant shows up at our hero's door step claiming she's to help him put the face on a specific skull. When that skull isn't of the woman he was hoping a vision leads him to yet another one buried under sand rotted partially. Whose identity of the skull this entails is yet another twist that'll have you going Huh?! The whole film is really this building of a mystery..who is killing these poor girls and who is the ghost haunting Hyunmin. The payoff certainly is a stunner. Like I said this twist might be a bit too much for some viewers to accept. I liked this film myself. I thought it built the story along nicely with a lot of heart behind such a grisly premise. Not that violent as you'd expect. Does work more as a hunt for a killer with Shin and Song working beautifully together on screen as we witness their characters' blossoming love for one another. And I thought the film's following a facial reconstructionist was a great idea..it's rare that we get a film designed from this character's pointofview. Too often it's the detectives and forensic teams yet this film significantly focuses on the importance of a man who can put the face to a damaged skull. His role is even more important because the killer melts the bodies after removing the hearts. There's enough spooky ghost stuffimages of the female ghost pop up around Hyunmin as she appears in mirrors her shadows on the floor coming towards him crawling on the ceiling etc to hold viewer's interest I believe..that is what draws the audience into checking out the film and it's plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Face is an extremely underwhelming genremixture that doesn't do enough for either.SPOILERSTired of working a case Det. Lee Hyunmin Shin Hyeonjun resigns so he can spend time with his ailing daughter Jin Kim Seungwook who has just received a heart transplant. Trying to help her Jung Sunyoung Song Yunah arrives to ask his help for a police case in reconstructing an unidentified victim's face. As they continue their assignment together he becomes worried when her condition becomes more severe and suspects there might be more to the story behind it. Driven by research he finds something sinister occurring that involves her surgeon and a secret organdonating ring that supplies organs from runaways to surgery patients and they all race to stop their actions before they can happen again.The Good News There was some good stuff to this one. One of the best parts is that it features some really good attacks from the ghost where it gets somewhat exciting. There's a really brutal surgery scene in the beginning where the bound victim is seen to be cut open with a scalpel while still alive and is then maneuvered in such a way as to appear that a series of inner organs had been removed during the process which just makes it all the more creepy. Another surgery scene only one that doesn't involve the brutality of the earlier scene is just as good and actually has some rather uneasy moments to it. There's also a rather creepy scene where while stopping at a railroad stop a vision of a young girl being run over by a train completely unaware of the situation before seeing a series of dismembered body parts fly by before a vision of the disembodied head lands on top of the car and winks which makes for a startling scene. This one even has a topnotch regeneration scene within that looks incredibly welldone and freaky with the disjointed movements knocking the body into position the complete inability to determine what it looks like before the finale and a just overall outstanding scene make for a fun time to be had. Perhaps what makes the scene all the best though is the fact that it manages to do the whole thing during a thunderstorm outside which automatically makes it even creepier than it should be and makes the scene all the more striking. The way the mystery is built up in here is also quite nice as the different elements seem to have very little in common but are woven together quite nicely making for a welldesigned if slowbuilding story. The last plus here is the finale which is a lot of fun. From a fullon brawl to a series of closecalls on an operating table and the final shootout that results in a graphic demise this ending here is pretty exciting and gets a lot going for it. These here are what work for the film.The Bad News There was a couple of rather big flaws to this one that hold it down. One of the biggest issues is that the film is just so slowpaced that it's hard to get excited for anything in here. The beginning is mostly held up with the detective angle which is mostly because it just consists of endless scenes of his working on a clay sculpture of a human head lecturing those around him about whatever pops into his head from his daughter's condition to the finer exploits of the profession and none of them are particularly interesting. They take up so much time in the beginning that there's no time at all for anything creepy to happen unless a viewer is slightly unnerved by the sight of a human face without the skin attached. The extended nature of these scenes is where it goes downhill due to the fact that they take up so much of the time that there's just nothing left for any fun scenes to take over which is how these fail. Also taking up a lot of time in the film is the rather clich and totally unnecessary romance between the leads which is not only found in just about most of these films anyway but is done so haphazardly that nothing makes any sense as to why it would start. It's just completely unneeded and doesn't add anything to the film without having anything important being added to the film. The last flaw to this is the film's rather dull detective angle. Due to the fact that the other detectives are running around with the information manages to really slow this one down when it needed to pick up the pace and these scenes really just slow the film down. These here are the problems.The Final Verdict A not entirelyspectacular ghost entry mixed with a detective film making a film that's too slow for a ghost film and too dull for a detective film. Really only give this one a shot if you're into the style of thee or just curious while those who are much more onthefence should heed caution.Rated URR Graphic Violence and Language".

Lee Hyunmin Shin Hyeonjun resigns so he can spend time with his ailing daughter Jin Kim Seungwook who has just received a heart transplant. Trying to help her Jung Sunyoung Song Yunah arrives to ask his help for a police case in reconstructing an unidentified victim's face. As they continue their assignment together he becomes worried when her condition becomes more severe and suspects there might be more to the story behind it. Driven by research he finds something sinister occurring that involves her surgeon and a secret organdonating ring that supplies organs from runaways to surgery patients and they all race to stop their actions before they can happen again.The Good News There was some good stuff to this one. One of the best parts is that it features some really good attacks from the ghost where it gets somewhat exciting. There's a really brutal surgery scene in the beginning where the bound victim is seen to be cut open with a scalpel while still alive and is then maneuvered in such a way as to appear that a series of inner organs had been removed during the process which just makes it all the more creepy. Another surgery scene only one that doesn't involve the brutality of the earlier scene is just as good and actually has some rather uneasy moments to it. There's also a rather creepy scene where while stopping at a railroad stop a vision of a young girl being run over by a train completely unaware of the situation before seeing a series of dismembered body parts fly by before a vision of the disembodied head lands on top of the car and winks which makes for a startling scene. This one even has a topnotch regeneration scene within that looks incredibly welldone and freaky with the disjointed movements knocking the body into position the complete inability to determine what it looks like before the finale and a just overall outstanding scene make for a fun time to be had. Perhaps what makes the scene all the best though is the fact that it manages to do the whole thing during a thunderstorm outside which automatically makes it even creepier than it should be and makes the scene all the more striking. The way the mystery is built up in here is also quite nice as the different elements seem to have very little in common but are woven together quite nicely making for a welldesigned if slowbuilding story. The last plus here is the finale which is a lot of fun. From a fullon brawl to a series of closecalls on an operating table and the final shootout that results in a graphic demise this ending here is pretty exciting and gets a lot going for it. These here are what work for the film.The Bad News There was a couple of rather big flaws to this one that hold it down. One of the biggest issues is that the film is just so slowpaced that it's hard to get excited for anything in here. The beginning is mostly held up with the detective angle which is mostly because it just consists of endless scenes of his working on a clay sculpture of a human head lecturing those around him about whatever pops into his head from his daughter's condition to the finer exploits of the profession and none of them are particularly interesting. They take up so much time in the beginning that there's no time at all for anything creepy to happen unless a viewer is slightly unnerved by the sight of a human face without the skin attached. The extended nature of these scenes is where it goes downhill due to the fact that they take up so much of the time that there's just nothing left for any fun scenes to take over which is how these fail. Also taking up a lot of time in the film is the rather clich and totally unnecessary romance between the leads which is not only found in just about most of these films anyway but is done so haphazardly that nothing makes any sense as to why it would start. It's just completely unneeded and doesn't add anything to the film without having anything important being added to the film. The last flaw to this is the film's rather dull detective angle. Due to the fact that the other detectives are running around with the information manages to really slow this one down when it needed to pick up the pace and these scenes really just slow the film down. These here are the problems.The Final Verdict A not entirelyspectacular ghost entry mixed with a detective film making a film that's too slow for a ghost film and too dull for a detective film. Really only give this one a shot if you're into the style of thee or just curious while those who are much more onthefence should heed caution.Rated URR Graphic Violence and Language";

What one will get to see is long boring draggy dialogs showing the silly guy reconstructing and reconstructing the face over ten times.

You get to find out why the bad guy was murdering others because his son suffered some kind of illness and feels that life is unfair for him. I thought the storyline was OK. But the film was just terrible lack of adventure extremely repetitive. The atmosphere for this film was dark unclear and dull making the film undesirable to watch.

You can't do too much better than an Erich Maris Remarque novel and a screenplay by none other than F. Scott Fitzgerald. The whole thing is directed by Frank Borzage who is a master at directing tender romances.Erich Maria Remarque is better known for writing All Quiet on the Western Front. That story is about a group of young men who enlist in the German Army in World War I and the illusions that are quickly shattered with military service at the Western Front. Three Comrades essentially picks up where All Quiet on the Western Front leaves off. The characters played by Robert Taylor Franchot Tone and Robert Young could easily be those same kids grown up now three survivors of those who marched to war in 19141915.These are working class people who just want to get back to civilian life. They want to go in business together a car repair garage seems the thing taking advantage of something useful the military taught them. All react differently to the war. Robert Taylor finds the girl of his dreams in Margaret Sullavan and their love makes them both forget or at least put on the back burner the horror of World War I. Robert Young is an idealist who still looks for a cause to believe in and finds it in some of the left wing parties of the Weimar Republic. Franchot Tone acts like an older brother figure to both Taylor and Young. He's cynical but not bitter. He wants a life of peace but as we see in the film he's quite capable of using his military training to exact some revenge. Tone's performance in fact is the best in the film.I won't say more except that for two of the protagonists things end tragically. For which two buy or rent the film. The Nazis are there also their movement is just getting started. In 1938 with the Nazis in power in Germany the audience knew what the two surviving protagonists did not that their worst fears are realized.As we see the two survivors accompanied by the ghostly apparitions of their dead comrades the future is bleak and uncertain. The audience hopes that both survivors are in a place of refuge and peace as unlikely as that might be.".

	schema:headline " A sensitive and poignant story of love and friendship in postwar Germany.";
	schema:reviewBody "What a lovely movie with such touching performances by all involved it will fill your heart. The three comradesin post war Germany are Robert Taylor Franchot Tone and Robert Young. As the war has ended the three friends try to start life again by opening a auto repair shop. They are all three different in their ideals and their goals but are loyal to each other in a wonderful way. Along the way they meet Margaret Sullivan a young woman who's past is filled with illness and a mysterious friend by the name of Herr Schultz. He seems to be her benefactor but the relationship is never defined by more than that. She falls in love with Erich Taylor but does not want to marry him because she is ill and knows that she will ultimately die. Otto Tone persuades her to marry him because even if their time together is short love is all that matters. She marries him and falls ill having never told Erich about her fate. Gottfried Young is the idealist who falls the victim of the times and is killed which breaks up the three comrades. They continue on not telling Pat Sullivan he is dead so that she will take an operation to get better. She does but in the end sacrifices herself dying in the arms of her husband Taylor. It is all and all a beautiful movie that tells of love and friendship without selfishness or pride. Robert Taylor is great in what I would say is a refined and quiet performance. His love for her is shown in many ways without words just a kind of gentleness. This follows the 1936 role of the doomed lover Armand Duval in Camille which I consider one of his best performances. Armand was torn and unhappy Erich is blissful and ardent. Margaret Sullivan is beautiful and valiant as Pat and her performance gives to Taylor as did Garbo a chance to show what a fine actor he really was. A lovely film.".

	onyx:emotionText "What a lovely movie with such touching performances by all involved it will fill your heart. The three comradesin post war Germany are Robert Taylor Franchot Tone and Robert Young. As the war has ended the three friends try to start life again by opening a auto repair shop. They are all three different in their ideals and their goals but are loyal to each other in a wonderful way. Along the way they meet Margaret Sullivan a young woman who's past is filled with illness and a mysterious friend by the name of Herr Schultz. He seems to be her benefactor but the relationship is never defined by more than that. She falls in love with Erich Taylor but does not want to marry him because she is ill and knows that she will ultimately die. Otto Tone persuades her to marry him because even if their time together is short love is all that matters. She marries him and falls ill having never told Erich about her fate. Gottfried Young is the idealist who falls the victim of the times and is killed which breaks up the three comrades. They continue on not telling Pat Sullivan he is dead so that she will take an operation to get better. She does but in the end sacrifices herself dying in the arms of her husband Taylor. It is all and all a beautiful movie that tells of love and friendship without selfishness or pride. Robert Taylor is great in what I would say is a refined and quiet performance. His love for her is shown in many ways without words just a kind of gentleness. This follows the 1936 role of the doomed lover Armand Duval in Camille which I consider one of his best performances. Armand was torn and unhappy Erich is blissful and ardent. Margaret Sullivan is beautiful and valiant as Pat and her performance gives to Taylor as did Garbo a chance to show what a fine actor he really was. A lovely film.";

	schema:reviewBody "MGM pulled out the stops on this film because it cast four of its bigger starsRobert Taylor Franchot Tone Robert Young and Margaret Sullavan. It also featured good direction from reliable Frank Borzage and all the glitz and glamor the studio could give. So despite this why was the movie a bit of a disappointment? Well it all rests on the rather vague and sappy script. Sure there are some wonderful and interesting aspects of the plot but at times the impact is blunted because the film seemed unwilling to take much of a stand regarding the chaos in postwar Germany AND the script got so bogged down in soapy romance. I would have much preferred that the film focus on what was occurring in Germany in 19191922 instead of interjecting the romance. Or they could have made it a romance but a less silly one and skipped the postwar drama. But together there wasn't enough decent romance and the chaos in Germany was only shown here and thereI really wanted to see more of the social and political factors that later led to the rise of Fascism and Communism in the country. Instead it was just too episodic and dilutedperhaps because MGM was afraid of offending Germans or GermanAmericans. And as for the romance it got really really silly at the very end and ended on a sappy note. Why exactly Ms. Sullavan did what she did made little sense to me unless she was SUPPOSED to be a stupid person in the film.For a much better film set in Germany that actually DOES blend romance and postWWI drama see THE MORTAL STORM. It was also made by MGM and once again stars Margaret Sullavan and Robert Young and is absolutely brilliant thanks to a daring script and engaging characters.".

The husky calm of her unique voice could invoke so many emotional inflections that combined with her willo'thewisp beauty it's a shame she is not well remembered beyond her one indisputable classic Ernst Lubitsch's The Shop Around the Corner 1940 with James Stewart. Take for example this 1938 romantic drama based on Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front 1936 novel with a screenplay cowritten by none other than F. Scott Fitzgerald his only screen credit. Not surprisingly it's about the Lost Generation who came of age during World War I and she elevates the movie into something quite magical as Patricia Hollmann a beautiful aristocrat fallen on hard times and dying of tuberculosis. She becomes the center of gravity for three close war buddies eking out a living fixing cars and driving a cab in a preHitler Germany torn asunder by unemployment and economic strife.The main focus of the story is on the unbridled love that develops between Patricia and Erich the most openly nave of the three and probably the most in need of purpose in his life. Just graduating from his glamourboy phase swooning over Garbo in Camille Robert Taylor is no dramatic match for Sullavan but gives Erich enough sincerity to avoid embarrassment. Better are Robert Young as the headstrong Gottfried and especially Franchot Tone as wise Otto whose unconditional friendship is nearly as touching as the central romance. In the second of four collaborations with Sullavan director Frank Borzage imbues the film with his trademark romanticism particularly lush in this handsome MGM production captured pretty well in the 2009 DVD. No surprise the ending death scene may seem hackneyed by today's standards but it compares favorably to Bette Davis's similarly heroic demise in Dark Victory. This is well worth seeking out if only to rediscover Sullavan at her most radiant. She earned the New York Film Critics Award and an Oscar nomination and sadly made only 16 films in her career. Read her daughter Brooke Hayward's harrowing memoir Haywire to find out why.".

But that's just me.I thought that the film was carried by Franchot Tone and Margaret Sullavan. Tone's role is nicely played down he consistently does the right thing even when it might appear to be the morally wrong thing. He's sure calm and direct at every turn. I always enjoy watching him. Sullavan was fascinating. It isn't often you see someone who appears to be an intellectual in a role that didn't necessarily call for that type. She is lovely dignified but hardly the standard babe who attracts three best friends. They seem to like her for her complexity. And that in itself is unusual.This movie was strange. It should have been better than it was  the emphasis on the love story slows things up and even feel a bit silly. When Pat starts wearing traditional German garb in the kitchen just cracked me up.

The film is perceptive in diagnosing what will be the outcome of things from a 1938 perspective. But the film feels muddled nonetheless.An interesting sidenote Eric Maria Remarque who wrote the novels upon which both above mentioned films were based had to leave Germany because of his views. Later during the war his sister was beheaded by the Nazis as punishment for Remarque who they could not reach.";

When they meet the ethereal Pat Sullivan they all embrace her as a friend but it's she and Erich Taylor who fall in love. Only Otto Tone knows that she has tuberculosis he encourages her to marry Erich and be happy. On their honeymoon she collapses and Erich learns the truth.This film represents F. Scott Fitzgerald's only writing credit in Hollywood though he worked on other films including Marie Antoinette Red Headed Woman The Women and others uncredited in all. In Tender Comrades you can often hear his gentle prose.The original script was much more political but MGM careful of its foreign market excised all of that out. There is unrest in Germany postWorld War I but it's vague unrest Gottfried Young has involvement in a political group that's against the current government but we don't get too much info about it.I don't know if it's because the film is set in Germany a fairly depressing place until the '50s or because we know that though the Germans have been through a lot they ain't seen nothing' yet or Pat's discreet coughs but this movie is depressing even when the characters are having a good time. It's almost as if they all play their roles as if they know the ending. I'm not giving spoilers here  it's obvious from the beginning of the film what's going to happen. No surprises.Despite this sense of foreboding the film is very well done if a bit slow by today's standards. Robert Taylor had better roles and developed into a better actor postwar though he is a revelation in the film Escape but he is so handsome and sweet in this film. It's no wonder my mother was mad for him. Tone has the burden of some heavy monologues  some of the dialogue is tough going  but he is good nonetheless as is Robert Young.Margaret Sullivan was a wonderful screen presence pretty with a low voice and as a stagetrained actress she was always excellent. Pat is really the only character that has any business being depressed throughout the film and she comes off as a mystery woman at the beginning. It's obvious she has a secret and has seen bad times. She plays the role as if she's not really of this earth and she's wonderful.Recommended but don't see it if you haven't taken your antidepressants.".

Then again it might be hard to pull off something like it nowadays unless the setting was some place where paternity tests don't exist  its look on adultery isn't exactly PC and yet it was released while the Hays Code was still functional. Still the gags come sharp and fast particularly when Savalas and Silvers are on screen and Lollobrigida is as ever a beauty to watch and hear. Margolin isn't bad either whereas Lawford's subdued performance doesn't really sit well with the quick wit and great physical comedy delivered by his two rivals. But that's a minor flaw in a film that doesn't show up very often but when it does it truly is worth catching.

From Ms G.L. to S.Winters T.Savales P.Silvers P.Lawford and the rest of the unmentioned great ones as well. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to express my own comment and view...Joaquin.";

The only bad acting is by Margolin and Lee Grant as Savalas' wifebut she isn't given much to work with. And there's some hysterically bad process shots when people are riding cars. But these are minor complaints. This is just a silly fun comedy.Hard to believe that this was once considered risqu. It was originally rated M which is the R rating today. It's now been lowered to a PG. I admit is DOES make adultery look OK but who's going to take this film seriously? Recommended. I give it an 8.".

Between them aided by Anita Ekbert they dominated the sexual scene in Italian films but Loren pulled ahead slightly in dramatic fare  and copped an Oscar in 1960 for Two Women  something that Lollabrigida never got. Loren was also lucky enough to get a handsome leading man Marcello Mastroianni to complement her in several of her sex farces. Lollabrigida never had a handsome partner. It is a trifle unfair because both women were not only beautiful but quite talented as actresses. And both were first rate in comedy.Buono Sera Mrs. Campbell may be the best comedy Lollabrigida made  it is certainly the most accessible to English speaking audiences because it is in English. It's plot is reminiscent of the later American comedy Father's Day which is based on a French film wherein two men Billy Crystal and Robin Williams search for a young teenager who they both think is their biological son or so has the mother of the boy told them  she claims she is not sure which of them or her husband is the actual father. It is also reminiscent in a reversal of plot of Loren and Mastroianni's comedy Marriage Italian Style. There Loren uses money from Mastroianni's business to support three sons unknown to each other one of whom is Mastroianni's biological son. In Mrs. Campbell Lollabrigida is the mother of a beautiful young woman who is the daughter of one of three American veterans who helped liberate her town in World War II. The three Telly Savalas Phil Silvers and Peter Lawford romanced her and never knew of the other two. When she became pregnant she informed each and they promised to send her money to support the girl. As a result Lollabrigida has had a very comfortable lifestyle and the girl is well educated. She chooses the name of Campbell for her dead husband if anyone inquires from the name of her favorite American soup company. However the daughter is growing up and she is determined to have a sexual life free of her mother's concerns. Their discord is mingled by Lollabrigida's discovery that the American veterans are returning to her village after a quarter century for a huge reunion and she finds all three of her exboyfriends are coming determined to see their daughter.The complications are not only on Lollabrigida's side. Each of her three heros has married and the resulting marriages are not perfect. Silvers is married to Shelley Winters and they have children of their own including an obnoxious son. Lawford is married to Janet Margolin and don't have their kids with them  in fact they took the trip to supposedly get away from their kids. Telly Savalas is married to Lee Grant and they have the most strained marriage  Grant has wanted kids but Savalas never had any with her.The story pursues the attempts of the three exG.I.s in trying to resume an active relationship with Lollabrigida but avoiding their wives and in Silver's case his kids while Lollabrigida has to keep the three from discovering each other and from confronting her daughter  who always has thought her father died in the war. The film actually works quite well with all the principles even Lawford for a change being funny. I will not be revealing too much that eventually the men do meet and realize how two of them which two we can't tell were conned. Savallas makes the comment that I varied a little in the Summary Line.How the film ends I leave to the reader to discover when they watch it. It ends quite fairly with all the fathers discovering their fatherly instincts despite their mutual shock. It also ends by giving one other character a sweet moment of recognition that is totally unexpected  but thoroughly appreciated by the viewer. As a sweet and funny comic farce it is one of the best.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw a trailer for a new 2008 film called MUMMA MIA starring Meryl Streep in the Gina Lollobrigida role! Another remake! Well this original from 1968 is a very funny film and I guess an extension of the 'caper comedy' style so popular in the mid60s. I haven't seen the famous multi paneled trailer sounds very Mad Mad Mad World but we are in the cineworld of other adult level all star 'wacky marital mixups' with phrase titles like DIVORCE American STYLE WHAT A WAY TO GO NOT WITH MY WIFE YOU DON'T BOY DID I GET A WRONG NUMBER etc each the American idea of farce yelling and door slamming. However unlike some of those mentioned above MRS CAMPBELL is genuinely hilarious. In fact today would still make a good play if it wasn't one already. I believe however it was an original screenplay by Melvin Frank who had already excelled with many 40s and 50s comedies and in the early 60s with LI'L ABNER and later with A TOUCH OF CLASS in '73. I clearly remember sitting in a large suburban cinema with a very entertained crowd roaring with laughter and marveling at how gorgeous Lollobrigida was then. Lee Grant as always is superb as someone's wife and moaning Shelley Winters is a great foil even for comedy against Phl Silvers and Telly Savalas. Even the horrible presence of bland and pointless Peter Lawford cannot spoil the clever comedy storyline of this uproarious well written heartfelt comedy. The charming and catchy theme song still plays in my head. Forgotten by 1970 and much unappreciated today MRS CAMPBELL is by far the best of late 60s all star marriage farces and deserves a big new century DVD release. It makes you realize how these 60s films really knew how to entertain. It also makes one realize how far Holllywood has strayed from what worked. No wonder adults don't bother with going to the cinema much in 2005. However even if this film was remade today with 2005 swearing and punching it would still be funny such is the solid script and good story. Try and find this film and settle in for a great experience.".

Even if it stars three big Hollywood actors the film is hijacked by scene stealing performances from the 3 main actresses Gina Lollobrigida Shelley Winters and Lee Grant. Grant plays a smartass who's mouth would make a trucker blush. She plays her role as if she was afraid she would be eclipsed by either Gina or Shelley. It didn't happen. She clearly stands out in her scenes.Then there's the incorporable Shelley Winters who in her own style and fashion gives gravitas to a role that could have easily been bland and forgettable and instead is filled with warmth and genuine comedic understanding.But the best performance in this comedy belongs to sexy Gina. Gina was best in comedies and here she excels with unusual aplomb. The role was probably written with her in mind but Gina took it and made it her own. I can't imagine anyone else as Mrs Campbell. It's a role that could have been played in a trashy way but Gina is such a pro that she makes the story of a young girl who slept with 3 soldiers in a span of 10 days sound like clean cut fun. It's definitely one of Gina's best role in her entire career.The male cast is also good but their roles are somewhat underwritten and do the best with what they have. Surprisingly Phil Silvers AND Telly Savalas who both usually annoy me in other films are actually pretty good here. Lawford is the one that registers the least. Vittorio played by hunky Philippe Leroy who's Mrs Campbell's current lover is used as window dressing. The 3 bright performances from the actresses elevate it to an above average comedy.".

	schema:headline " Very funny wartime reunion and fathersdaughter comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Filmed entirely in Italy in 1968 Buona Sera Mrs. Campbell received mixed reviews and just a modest box office return. This was 23 years after the end of World War II. But was that enough time  or was it too long after WW II for the public to enjoy a comedy about American GIs fathering a baby in wartime Europe? Now decades later this film can be enjoyed as a very good comedy with some redeeming aspects of wartime dalliances. The film has a firstrate cast for a very good comedy. It received three Golden Globe nominations. While the plot centers around Gina Lollobrigida as Carla Campbell the film is several stories in one. They all get adequate time with three or more overlapping most of the time. Three men former WW II GIs who billeted in fictional San Forino were comforted by the 16yearold Carla whose father had recently died. That happened over a 10day period with each man assigned to her house and then being transferred on a mission. Three weeks later she found out she was pregnant but couldn't know which of the men was the father. These men have now come to San Forino for a reunion of the 293rd squadron of the Air Force formerly Army Air Forces. And they have their spouses with them as well as one family of three children. No one knows of the others and each man is looking forward to meeting his daughter for the first time. Telly Savalas is superb as Walter Braddock and Lee Grant plays his wife Fritzie superbly. Phil Silvers is in his usual screen character as Phil Newman and Shelley Winters excels as his wife Shirley. Peter Lawford plays Justin Young and Marian McCargo plays his wife Lauren. Then there's Carla's household. Her daughter Gia is played by Janet Margolin. Philippe Leroy does a superb job as Vittorio. He is Carla's vintner hired man and clandestine lover. And Naomi Stevens plays Carla's maid Rosa. Smaller stories within this menagerie include the Air Force reunion and the contessa of the village.The screenplay for this film is very clever. It is built around two major deceits that backfire. In turn that leads to discoveries that reveal the respective coverup. But much comedy and serious consideration of family and caring ensue. In the first deceit the three Americans send their wives to the beauty parlor so that they the men can sneak off to see Carla and Gia. But the wives run into Carla and Gia at the salon and hear Gia tell her story. In the second Carla has lined up Gia to be a guide for one of the tour buses on its visit to Florence. But at the express office in Florence Gia sees Shirley Newman discover that her husband and the other two Americans have longstanding accounts with her mother. The film has a warm and satisfying finish that includes bright outlooks for the three former GIs in their marriages and humbling of Carla with her final acceptance by the contessa as a result. Even though the story and film are fiction some things about it are confusing. This may point to screenplay goofs or oversights. For instance the GIs were in an air force squadron that would be stationed on or very near an air base with landing fields. Yet San Forino is a mountain village a good distance from any level terrain. Surely towns on the plains and closer to the air base would have been used for overflow troop billets. Numbers present several confusing situations in the film. The movie was made in 1968. The fictional town of San Forino in the movie is near Florence which was liberated by the Allies on Aug. 4 1944. The Allies would have taken over or built an air base and field shortly thereafter. The war in Europe ended on May 8 1945. So the American GIs would have been in San Forino in the late summer or fall of 1944 when their dalliances with Carla took place. And a 20th anniversary reunion of the squadron and town would have been in the summer of 1964. But Gia is only 18 years old. Allowing for the nine months pregnancy this would be the summer of 1963. Yet the three Americans had been sending checks regularly for 20 years. In the film Justin Young does some figuring about what the three men have paid Carla. Justin says All right gentlemen. Read 'em and weep. You averaged 85 a month you a hundred and 15 me a hundred and 40. Which over 20 years compounded at six percent interest would come to a hundred and ninetyseven thousand dollars. That figure is 40000 too high. The correct amount would be just over 157000. Justin didn't know his math very well. Neither did the screenwriter or director. Carla took her phony married name from the Campbell soup cans that Justin brought her. They weren't part of the C or Krations of the Army so he would have to have received them from home. One can think of many food and other items that GIs would like from home before cans of soup. Campbell's soup sure got great publicity out of this film. Here's one of my alltime favorite hilarious exchanges in films. For more funny dialog see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the film. Fritzie Braddock Whadda we do in the morning? Walter Braddock I can't. Fritzie You can't what? Walter Whatever it is I can't. I've got a meeting. Fritzie All right. Then I won't either. Walter You won't what? Fritzie Whatever it is you can't I won't. Walter Well then don't. Fritzie I won't. Walter Okay! Anything you say. Just let's have a good time. Fritzie All right let's have a good time. Walter Okay!".

	onyx:emotionText "Filmed entirely in Italy in 1968 Buona Sera Mrs. Campbell received mixed reviews and just a modest box office return. This was 23 years after the end of World War II. But was that enough time  or was it too long after WW II for the public to enjoy a comedy about American GIs fathering a baby in wartime Europe? Now decades later this film can be enjoyed as a very good comedy with some redeeming aspects of wartime dalliances. The film has a firstrate cast for a very good comedy. It received three Golden Globe nominations. While the plot centers around Gina Lollobrigida as Carla Campbell the film is several stories in one. They all get adequate time with three or more overlapping most of the time. Three men former WW II GIs who billeted in fictional San Forino were comforted by the 16yearold Carla whose father had recently died. That happened over a 10day period with each man assigned to her house and then being transferred on a mission. Three weeks later she found out she was pregnant but couldn't know which of the men was the father. These men have now come to San Forino for a reunion of the 293rd squadron of the Air Force formerly Army Air Forces. And they have their spouses with them as well as one family of three children. No one knows of the others and each man is looking forward to meeting his daughter for the first time. Telly Savalas is superb as Walter Braddock and Lee Grant plays his wife Fritzie superbly. Phil Silvers is in his usual screen character as Phil Newman and Shelley Winters excels as his wife Shirley. Peter Lawford plays Justin Young and Marian McCargo plays his wife Lauren.

Sure the concept is routine and fairly drawn out but it does offer up an impulsively shady twist that actually comes off. By virtually turning everything upside down. Even if the screenplay is ludicrous and possibly forced but further along the story goes the more engaging the plot becomes. After somewhat a bland beginning. Eight strangers are given an invitation to become part of a survivor type reality TV show set in the remote desert of Australia with the winner taking away one million dollars. But it doesn't take long for the contestants to realize the game has life or death consequences. The story starts backwards kind of switching back and forth between time lines. I thought it was going to be a smarting social commentary with psychology brushes on the manipulative nature of reality TV and society's unhealthy obsession in becoming nothing more then a spectator but that's left behind when the twists occur. Still the selfish side of humanity plays a big part in the story's progression and revelations.I think the biggest problem here is the characters themselves. They're are poorly written character arches and quite unlikable. You don't really connect but you feel like you're suppose to. You're simply compelled to what's the bigger mystery the motivation to it all not for their wellbeing. The performances are hard to judge because of it. The choice of location is effectively brought across on the screen. Dangerous forlorn and open but still with a great sense of isolation. Direction is competent even with its cheap look. However the director doesn't really generate much in the way of suspense even his attempts of violent shocks lack any real impact. It's meanspirited but there's no real punch to it. I just got that blank feeling. Curiously watchable if senseless survival thriller.".

When a ticket inspector takes issue with a young woman over as little as 40p George helps her out and lets her get away. Later the Nicaraguan exile finds George and gives him a gift to say thanks but doesn't stay around any longer than that. George is both concerned for her and attracted to her and keeps pushing but she withdraws more and more. Messing up her lodgings George gets Carla a new place and tries to get to know her unaware of where his relationship with her will take him.A hard sell back in 1996 when it was released not many people paid to see this and in a way it is still a hard sell now perhaps appealing most to those who will always make the effort to see Ken Loach's work. The reason that it perhaps failed to grab an audience is that the film itself isn't sure what it is trying to do  and as a result is a bit fragmented and split. The film opens in a faltering way and it didn't convince me in how quickly it brought along George and Carla in the first stages. After this their relationship is a bit more convincing as it is brought on naturally as trust grows. At this stage Nicaragua is part of her character rather than the whole story. Gradually then suddenly the film becomes more about Nicaragua and George  Carla's relationship becomes the device to get him the audience's eyes into the country to learn all about it. I felt a bit like my interest in the people had been thrown out the window and the vague attempt to make it about them towards the end didn't convince me. Loach directs with earnestness but he cannot make this work as either a political education or a character piece varying wildly between being preachy and being touching.The cast try hard to find this middle ground and to their credit they do pretty well. Carlyle does well to bring out a real person in George covering up the question marks early on. He is left a bit high and dry in the second half but does his best. The same could be said of Carla who is a person in the first half and a journey in the second. Cabezas delivers the role as well as she can and is natural and convincing throughout. Glenn has an obvious role but he is a good presence. The rest of the support cast is solid enough but the problems is with the material not with any of the cast.Overall then a fairly mixed affair that is as affecting as it is preachy. Easy to see why it failed to get much of an audience as it makes for an uneasy mix of ideas that don't really come off  failing to educate much more than on a superficial level and failing to produce a real character piece that would have been better.".

When it turned out that Carla was from Nicaragua and it was taking place in the time of heavy war I didn't imagine the masterfulness with which he recreated the events.  Since I live in Honduras I was very well informed and concerned about the Nicaraguan revolution.  All the scenes the music and the whole environment really caused a great impact on me.  I could swear I was watching a documentary instead of a movie.  Living near that country and being in contact with its people helped me understand the hardships they went through.  And the situation painted by Loach of how the Nicaraguans felt and reacted about the war was incredibly realistic!!Carlyle's character was superb!! He showed emotions that were very pure and sincere not only to Carla but to the whole situation.  He was just too good a person he showed us unselfish feelings that nowadays are very hard to find in our society which is oriented mainly to material purposes rather than spiritual fulfillment.This is the kind of humanistic films that should be made to  teach people about the real world and true unselfish comprehensive and devoted love. A love that goes so deep that one is willing to do anything for the other's happiness and wellbeing... even if it means letting them go.".

Although to some people it might appear as propaganda my own experience tells me that everything that was depicted in the film as far as the situation in Nicaragua in 1987 is concerned was very realistic. The enthusiasm especially among the poor and young for the revolution was true I saw it with my own eyes. The fervor of the literacy campaign volunteers was admirable even though some of them were targeted as strategic targets by the contra forces. Also targeted for destruction were health centers which had never before existed in many remote villages grain silos tobacco sheds etc. in the areas bordering Honduras which is where Carla's family lives. The nighttime contra raid was very realistic I must say even though I myself never had to live through one. But I knew people who did. The cruelty of the contras depicted in the movie was well documented by American and other media at the time.Oyanka Cabezas' portrayal of the young woman is remarkable and Robert Carlyle's young bus driver is spoton. The role of Scott Glen as a reformed CIA agent although good is the only one I could find fault with for being a little political and perhaps preachy but I think his comments were based on facts.In summary I enjoyed the film very much. You don't have to be political to appreciate injustice poverty love and human decency. These human vices and virtues are all very well portrayed in this story. Kudos to all involved in its making.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ken Loach is a remarkable storyteller.  Notice how subtly Carlyle's George changes from a loveable lout to noble lover now find a recent Hollywood film that accomplishes something even close.  Moving dramatically from the grey grime of Glasgow to the green pandemonium of Nicaragua in 1987 this film charts a remarkable story of how international politics becomes an international dance of love becomes international politics.The reviewer who argues that the film glorifies the Sandinistas has it all wrong except perhaps in the world of doublespeak where simply to treat the Sandinistas with sympathy is to glorify them . . . Loach rather glorifies the kind of loving devotion that leads George to make a remarkable selfabnegating gesture at the end of the film.  Even as I believe that the film is primarily about the love between Carla and George I am happy for the legions of viewers in the U.S. who upon watching this film might be inspired to investigate what the U.s. was up to in Nicaragua in the 1980's.  As Noam Chomsky so calmly puts it U.S. involvement in sponsoring terrorism against the Sandinista government is a completely noncontroversial issue underlying strong though naturally unenforceable acts of censure against the U.S. from both the World Court and U.N..  In the film Scott Glenn has a few nice moments articulating this position. Very worthwhile.  And when we finally hear Carla's song it is moving indeed.".

Moving dramatically from the grey grime of Glasgow to the green pandemonium of Nicaragua in 1987 this film charts a remarkable story of how international politics becomes an international dance of love becomes international politics.The reviewer who argues that the film glorifies the Sandinistas has it all wrong except perhaps in the world of doublespeak where simply to treat the Sandinistas with sympathy is to glorify them . . . Loach rather glorifies the kind of loving devotion that leads George to make a remarkable selfabnegating gesture at the end of the film.  Even as I believe that the film is primarily about the love between Carla and George I am happy for the legions of viewers in the U.S. who upon watching this film might be inspired to investigate what the U.s. was up to in Nicaragua in the 1980's.  As Noam Chomsky so calmly puts it U.S. involvement in sponsoring terrorism against the Sandinista government is a completely noncontroversial issue underlying strong though naturally unenforceable acts of censure against the U.S. from both the World Court and U.N..  In the film Scott Glenn has a few nice moments articulating this position. Very worthwhile.  And when we finally hear Carla's song it is moving indeed.";

That movie is called 'Kes' and is about a boy and his falcon. Criterion even added it to their collection. It was then that Mr. Loach came into the spotlight from directing television series to feature films and fell into his own unique style which was focusing more on characters than anything else really.Over the years Loach has shown us the good and bad sides of ourselves usually using some sort of political or social backdrop to tell his story which is the case in his 1996 film 'Carla's Song'. This film is almost like two films in one as it drastically takes a turn mid way through and offers up something different. The film follows a Scottish bus driver named George Robert Carlyle who wants more out of life than driving a bus and coming home to his fianc. He seems to be a good man and thoughtful as he allows people who can't pay the bus fare on his ride. Perhaps he feels like a superhero to them making the world a better place for people less fortunate than him.He soon crosses paths with a Nicaraguan woman named Carla Oyanka Cabezas who he immediately seems very fond of even though she can't afford to pay the fare for his bus but he looks the other way. After their first encounter he begins to see her everywhere which we soon realize he is pretty much stalking her. He never releases a creepy vibe but we all know it's there as he is very persistent to get to know her without being violent. It's a very strange and odd feeling to watch this character unfold as we might expect something awkward or sadistic to happen at any moment.Even when Carla pushes away his advances and tells George that she has a boyfriend back in Nicaragua that she hasn't seen in a while he buys her and himself tickets to go find him even though they are having a very weird love affair. This is where the film changes as these two people enter Nicaragua during the U.S. backed Contra war against the Sandinistas. George finally sees all of the horrible chaos an destruction that Carla has been through by traveling to her home as they look for her family and lover.This is where George sees Carla for who she really is and it takes a toll on him. Carlyle is great in this role and very different from his work in 'Trainspotting' and '28 Weeks Later'. You never know if you want to like or root for George and Carlyle plays this mysterious every man to a tee. While the acting is spot on the story and narrative loses its balance from time to time here. It's hard to focus on the first half of the film and then change into something as drastic and chaotic as these two characters wander the streets of a war torn Nicaragua. Loach does tend to surprise us though with the abnormal ending and twists which most filmmakers and studio executives today would not allow which makes 'Carla's Song' such a unique film despite its flaws.".

	onyx:emotionText "Back in 1969 director Ken Loach made one of the best coming of age films which is currently ranked in the number seven spot of ten films for the British Film Institute. That movie is called 'Kes' and is about a boy and his falcon. Criterion even added it to their collection. It was then that Mr. Loach came into the spotlight from directing television series to feature films and fell into his own unique style which was focusing more on characters than anything else really.Over the years Loach has shown us the good and bad sides of ourselves usually using some sort of political or social backdrop to tell his story which is the case in his 1996 film 'Carla's Song'.

Where she got the money for her long journey? Who helped her to get through the British customs? Did she get any sponsor to help her making all this possible? By viewing this film we could easily see that she was totally alone a stranger in a strange land.By judging from the film's scenario background we also easily understood that she was just an ordinary country girl in Nicaragua so where she learned the English language and could achieve the level of even an interpreter to be so fluently to translate between two totally different languages orally? We didn't see any proof that she got a very good education background where she grew up yet she could speak and understand English so well.Then let's talk about this bus driver's character. By judging his job performance he could barely stay with his job as a bus driver suspended due to his so opinionated attitude to almost anything. He was just a poor sod with limited means for a normal living. Yet during this insecure period he seemed to be not worry at all and still could afford drinking coffee or beer as other guys in Glasgow. He already got a girl friend who loved him very much yet he changed his heart and fell for an illegal alien from Latin America. A guy who got limited means even for his own living yet he still could afford buying two tickets for this Nicaraguan woman and accompanied her to go back to her country.Then another of the unavoidable logic problem comes up He already knew she got a lover in her motherland. One of the main purposes why she wanted to go back was to look for her boyfriend Antonio yet this Glasgow native who once was a bus driver would have such a big heart and interested in helping her finding her old boyfriend? This guy is either a peabrain moron or a complete idiot there's nothing in between and where's the logic? Now here comes my last logic101 question Why Carla escaped from her wartorn country and migrated to England what's the purpose of doing so? By finally made a friend with the bus driver who later became her temporary lover then with his support for her air ticket fare and other general expenses she would again return home with this white man. What made her consider running away from her Nicaraguan country in the first place would have become no big deal once she made acquaintance with the skinny and jobless white guy and then made her strong enough to go back to her country? Why she left and why she decided to go back? Why she simply stayed in her country and did the search by herself? Did she use the bus driver only for her financial support? By making a new boyfriend in England then it would make her going back to where she came from? Why she chose England to escape to? This film in certain way is not a bad film but so many nobodyquestioned against the basic logic questions simply put me not to be so easily convinced of its believability besides its absurdity.".

Hoping to help Carla find the answers to vital questions George brings her back to Nicaragua to find her former lover who was wounded and captured and who may be dead.This is the first movie I've ever seen that depicts the Contra war for exactly what it wasa U.S.driven attempt to crush the Nicaraguan revolution. It wasn't subtle at the time and it isn't subtle in the film. The CIA and the White House considered Nicaragua The threat of a good example and they used force to reestablish U.S. dominance.I was in Nicaraguaalthough not in the war zonein January 1988 just months after the events in the film were taking place. Loach got it rightthe enthusiasm of the people their hopes for a better future and their attempts to survive continual attacks from the U.S.trained and U.S.supplied Contras.The drama of Carla's lifepast present and we assume futureis the link that holds the film together. Nicaragua wasand isfilled with women like Carla. There are ten thousand movies that someone could make to tell their stories. Ken Loach has made this film about Carla and he has done a service to all Nicaraguans and to us.Notes We saw the film on DVD. It would work better on a large screen but I don't know if it is ever shown at festivals or even at Nicaraguan solidarity events.The Glasgow dialect is almost incomprehensible to our ears in this movie. It was much easier to understand the Nicaraguan Spanish!Personal note one of my friends Anita Setright plays the part of a member of the U.S. solidarity organization Witness for Peace. Anita is a U.S. citizen who drove an ambulance in the war zone during the Contra war. She never knew whether the road in front of the vehicle contained a land mine.

	schema:reviewBody "Lets be honest Mike Leigh's films are not for everyone. No effort is made to make them commercially viable the cast are almost always largely unknown and certain scenes are so harrowing that even the strongest viewer can find themselves distressed and perturbed. While these factors keep some people away they also keep many others coming back time and time again. Mike Leigh is quite simply a national treasure. And I don't mean that in the same fluffy Gawd Bless 'Em manner that people applied to Thora Hird and the Queen Mother. I mean that he is simply one of the finest and most honest chroniclers of contemporary Britain that we have produced.Make no mistake the British have always enjoyed social realism. We can gauge that through that great yardstick of social selfperceptions the soap opera. While the Americans produce soaps full of tanned successful oil barons and their supermodel  actress mistresses and the Australians show us their blue collar bungalow owners who like a beer with their mates and a barbecue on Sundays the British make soaps full of characters who are little more than diluted softened incarnations of Leigh's own subjects. People who work at checkouts and in launderettes people who are trapped by poverty alcoholism violence and stifled or strangled ambition.But through it all  there's a hope an anticipation of a better day just around the corner and that's what makes these films ultimately uplifting. Leigh has always shown that no matter how dire the circumstances how forlorn the existence love and hope friendship and family will find a way to offer support comfort and succor.In achieving this Leigh has the assistance of another of the U.K.'s finest  Timothy Spall. If ever an actor was capable of portraying at once the fragility insecurity and yet the potential for sheer stubborn strength of the British psyche its Spall. His character in All or Nothing Phil is an incredibly vulnerable man. A pensive gentle man trapped in his own doubts and in a world of people who react by lashing out verbally or physically and so compounding his doubts and fear. He apologises constantly and often appears to be apologising for simply existing. An undereducated but intellectual man he even apologises for having an extensive vocabulary a character trait which Leigh uses cleverly but subtly by having Phil precede each big word with wotsitsname. It appears that Phil is searching for the word he isn't he knows exactly what he's about to say but is reluctant to say it in case he appears educated or articulate. We hear Phil talk about destiny and saying It's...wotsitsname..kismet. In a world of expletives and harsh words he's ashamed at his verbal dexterity viewing it as a weakness rather than a strength.Devices such as these help us understand technically why Leigh is just such a good writer and the way in which these devices are performed help us understand why Leigh constantly looks to Spall to anchor his scripts with his marvelous humanity. All or Nothing is a vicious gut wrenching graceful uplifting gem of a movie from a master filmmaker. Its is performed by a marvelous leading man and a collection of wonderfully talented supporting actors. In a world of blockbusters and multi million dollar opening nights Mike Leigh continues to give us humanity despair courage and beauty. And do we ever need him.".

The Father Phil Bassett Timothy Spall works as a Taxi driver while his wife Penny Lesley Manville is a checkout operator at a local supermarket. They are unmarried but have two children Rachel and Rory the former being an angstridden overweight layabout who is key to the film.Acting is superb. It is that simple. All but one performance is utterly convincing especially Timothy Spall with his constant bemused grimace which sets the mood of both his character and the film. The one exception is Donna played by Helen Coker. Her role is played up too much and seems rather forced. Now if by any chance you're reading Helen please don't be disheartened I merely saw you as the least best of an excellent bunch and I have to criticise something!The script is authentic witty and full of emotion while not being repetitive barring the word alright!.All Or Nothing is one of the greatest portrayals of what it is REALLY like to be part of a downonyourluck working class family. I even believe the film ended too soon there were a few ideas that could have been developed further. I mention this not as a criticism but as a tribute to Mike Leigh who actually made we wish this 2hr 28 minute film would go on!Fantastic! Eight out of ten!!!".

	schema:headline " Powerful and Moving";
	schema:reviewBody "Phil Timothy Spall is an overweight taxi driver who gets up late in the day and works intermittently barely communicating with his family except for a few grunts. His philosophy of life is expressed as We're all born alone. We die alone. There's nothing we can do about it. Mike Leigh has given us powerful portrayals of the underclass in his previous films Naked Secrets and Lies and Life is Sweet but none more powerful and moving than his latest All or Nothing. In this film Leigh looks at three families living in a dreary South London housing complex and captures their lives with an intimacy that is almost unbearable. All or Nothing has a documentary feel almost as if the camera was just planted in the middle of the living room to observe. The conditions are familiar unemployment and underemployment alcoholism teen pregnancy isolation and the inevitable loss of selfesteem and despair. It is however more than a drama of oppressive social conditions but also of lack of communication between people who desperately need love but are too afraid or lethargic to ask for it. Spall's performance is a revelation. His unshaven face disheveled hair and hangdog expression communicate deep resignation. The film is bleak but Leigh mixes its heartbreak with joy. When a neighbor Maureen Ruth Sheen sings ''Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue'' at a karaoke bar her eyes shine with a glow that seems at odds with the rest of her life but is so contagious that even her most dispirited friends take notice. It is obvious from the start that something is amiss. Phil says nothing when his obese son Rory James Cordon hurls words of abuse at his commonlaw wife Penny. Rory is an overweight bully who does nothing but lay around the house watching TV and hurl insults at everyone in his path. Sister Rachel Alison Garland has a job cleaning up at a nursing home but also seems to be going through the motions of living except when she is interacting with patients. Penny works in a supermarket and does just about everything to keep the family going but it never seems to be enough. The film's subplots add to the feeling of life reeling out of control but none of these are fully developed and are just dropped without tying up the loose ends. Maureen's teenage daughter is pregnant by some lout that doesn't give two hoots about her. Another resident unemployed Samantha Sally Hawkins hates her parents and finds herself seducing a very strange young man Ben Crompton lurking in the shadows of the complex grounds.The second half of the film concentrates mainly on Phil and his family. When a medical emergency occurs the family begins to open up and express long buried feelings of hurt and resentment. The final confrontation between Phil and Penny achieves an explosive power. Phil tells Penny that when he's had enough he just switches off the meter on his taxi. Penny responds that she doesn't have the luxury of turning off a switch and making everything go away that she is still responsible for the daily chores and the condition of the family. After Phil finally reveals his deepest fears a transformation occurs that is unmistakably reflected in the family's facial expressions and body language. Leigh does not offer simple solutions but seems to be telling us that although life is painful we can reach beyond the pain to get in touch with the beauty. He shows us that love is the glue that holds families together and that either there is love or there's nothing. As a result All or Nothing pulsates with a humanity that in spite of its bleakness is life affirming and ultimately uplifting reminding us that beyond bitterness there is love and beyond suffering there is grace.".

There used to be flats on our estate that although not the same in appearance where practically the same in their inhabitants the drunk family the quiet family Phil's and Penny's family the druggie families the slightly odd kid the angry violent boyfriend the single mum with foulmouth daughter. They were all there. Anyone who knows life on an estate like this would wonder how Mike Leigh can put together such an accurate snapshot into the lives of these families.Mike's films are totally captivating. To some it might appear like nothing really happens in them but what I see in them is a reality that is like nothing else on film. Sometimes they're funny sometimes so almost unwatchably painful but never ever dull or predictable.Once you're a Mike Leigh fan you're taken to a different level. I just can't take American movies seriously anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "All or Nothing certainly isn't a movie for the masses and I'm sure that many people will never see it or even think about seeing it and that is a shame. It's true that it is a rather depressing movie at first sight when you don't look closer and don't get involved in the story. When you take the time to dig deeper you'll not only see the misery but also a beautiful thing called love.In this movie we mostly follow Phil a gentle guy who works as a taxidriver and who lives together with his wife and two children in some social housing complex in London. His daughter works in a retirement home his son hasn't got a job and his wife works on the checkout at a supermarket. They have the biggest problems to make both ends meet every month but that's not Phil's biggest concern. He doesn't care much for life anymore because his wife no longer loves him. But than something terrible happens to the family bringing them all together again as close or perhaps even closer as they have ever been...This movie is very realistic hard and dark but in the same time it is also very heartwarming. This certainly isn't a sugar sweet love story like we get too often from the big Hollywood studio's. This is what real life is like for many people. It has a social engagement showing that even in biggest misery people still care for each other and help each other that probably will never be found in a Hollywood production.I guess it will be understand and loved more by people who like realistic movies in general and socially engaged movies in particular. I might even say that it will be loved more by the people who are used to watch other European movies Scandinavian Spanish French... movies often have a deeper meaning included. Personally I liked what I saw and that's why I give this movie a 7.510.".

But it lacks the more comic characters who have often adorned his work. In their absence the result is one of his most understated and downbeat movies since his debut feature 'Bleak Moments' and in spite of little jewels in the script at times its almost painfully hard to watch. Additionally the portrait of a very white British underclass and the empty streets of the estate where they live doesn't quite seem in tune with life as it is actually lived today. To my mind and despite the Oscar nominations won by 'Secrets and Lies Leigh's best contemporary portraits remains his early 1990s trio the bittersweet 'High Hopes' the hilarious 'Life is Sweet' and the coruscating 'Naked' but as he followed this film with the brilliant period drama 'Vera Drake' maybe he simply needed a change of scene to refocus his vision. Still this film is definitely a minor entry in his canon.".

The main focus is on their relationships inabilities to communicate and articulate and their individual outlooks. All or Nothing is extremely successful at conveying all of these aspects.Of course Leigh being Leigh also extends his portrayal to take in other dysfunctional characters living in the same demoralising highrise housing flats. These include alcoholics abusive partners in relationships and a young woman who uses her sexuality as a tool to escape the grim reality of her environment family situation.His bleakest since Naked but perhaps better realised and more coherent. There are thankfully! some moments of hope and optimism which are characteristic ingredients of his films but the abiding impression is one of hopelessness in the face of grinding poverty and ruined lives.

In each case there are characters and sub plots that come along and start to look interesting but just as they seem to be going somewhere they are forgotten about as the main characters  storyline take over for about the last 20 minutes and everything else is just left unresolved. I have finished each of these films thinking why??! What is even more perplexing is that the sub plots and sub characters are usually more interesting than the main plots  characters. But even if they weren't it's not very good writing or film making to start a storyline and just leave it mid air. It doesn't make any sense and yet it seems to be a theme in his films.Aside from that I struggled to enjoy All or Nothing. James Cordon's character was great and interesting but the remaining 3 family members were dull weak mopey and annoyingly subordinate. I found the reconciliation between the wife and husband at the end to be weak and unconvincing.I wish there had been more time spent on the 2 trashy girls who live in the same block of flats. Both them and their families were a lot more interesting.".

But I mean that more as a compliment to Leigh than as a criticism of the film because its quite good by any normal standards. There's an odd quality to its narrative structure. The film has two distinctive halves. The first deals with the collective life of a housing project in Kent and seems almost like a Britishization of Bela Tarr's Satantengo. It's relentlessly bleak miserable people screaming at each other in conversations that go nowhere and at times comes close to selfparody. I don't think I've ever heard the phrases F off! You make me sick! and Care for a cup of tea then? so many times in one hour. Yet it retains a grim power if for no other reason than the moments of mesmerizing cinematography by Dick Pope its Leigh's visually splashiest film since Naked and the characteristically wonderful score by Andrew Dickson. The second half focuses much more conventionally on one family and is taken in and of itself one of the most warm and sentimental works Leigh has produced. Timothy Spall gives another great performance as a genuinely philosophical and lazy man. His marriage is put to the test. You feel happy at the outcome but not sure its in anyone in the family's bestinterest.".

I always thought Leigh did these films the way they should be done unlike the hopelessly overrated Ken Loach. Naked was excellent Meantime and Bleak Moments were very good Life Is Sweet was good but All Or Nothing?... Merely average and quite forgettable. Spall's comedic potential is wasted. He plays a miserable ultradepressed overweight cabdriver who suffers from the fact that his wife apparently no longer loves him. His kids are extremely overweight the son is a lazy unmannered slob and the daughter is hardworking but withdrawn extremely shy. His wife is miserable too  but you could have guessed that. The other characters? Mostly miserable frustrated Londoners  you know that sort of thing. Leigh covers no new ground here. It's just another family drama targeted at female audiences and pretentious male ones. It is a bit annoying that Leigh opts for the safe and easy route by doing an allout drama. We all know that writing a drama is incomparably easier than writing one which has comedy in it. Leigh has become lazy. Either that or he wants to be even more recognized as an artist and what better way to do that than by making allout drama like that abortionrights movie he did recently. The critics loved it  predictably. An interesting cast the acting is quite good but where are the laughs?".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone knows Mike Leigh is a great filmmaker and I think his modus operandi where the actors get to know their characters and are then given scenes to play but without knowing how they fit into the overall story is unique and brilliant.  How better achieve a naturalistic style than by taking away the element of crescendo that usually operates in conventional filmmaking?  Even though most films are not shot in sequence the actors always know whereabouts in the story the scenes occur with the Mike Leigh method they don't know and are forced to play the scenes as they come as we all do in our lives  after all when I have an interaction with a shopkeeper I don't know whereabouts in the story it occurs!Anyway what about this film?  If I had to use only one word to sum it up it would be exhausting.  The drabness is relentless and raises a question as to whether the depiction of drab lives needs to be drab itself.  I don't think it does and Leigh himself has shown us this in many of his earlier works.  The pace is slow throughout.  I don't have a problem with that quite the reverse.  However at some points it virtually grinds to a halt. Unlike some I found the moneygathering sequence almost excruciating and the climactic for want of a better word scene between Tim Spall and Lesley Manville was skating on thin ice too.That leads on to something I never thought I'd see in a Mike Leigh film a pat unearned happy ending or happy relative to the rest of the film.  In that long scene between Spall and Manville he says something about their relationship which strikes me as being very true  and yet this is negated by the film's ending.  I don't know if Leigh bottled out or wanted to provide some light at the end of what has been such a sombre story  and maybe it's perverse to decry such a ray of hope in the midst of such bleakness  but it felt to me that he hedged his bets.  Both I and the friend I went with found the ending unbelievable and I'd be interested to know if others felt similarly cheated.On the acting side there are credits and debits and a couple of notsures for me the best thing in this film is Ruth Sheen as Maureen. she seemed the most rounded and appealing character and also provided many of the films funnier moments.  I wasn't so sure about Donna Coker as her daughter though she put me in mind of Greg Crutwell in Naked  too much scowling!  Sally Hawkins was good as the despairing daughter of hopeless parents  but Marion Bailey as the lush mother was beyond caricature and reminded me of Joanna Lumley's Patsy Stone in Absolutely Fabulous in her most grotesque moments.  And Kathryn Hunter's fauxFrench Cecile was unforgiveable Has Mike Leigh ever met a French person??  NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT Mike!What of the central family?  Tim Spall is a national treasure and does some good work here however I found his character infuriating and his gnomic utterances it's Kismet innit? jarring.  He was so inert that I wanted to give him a good slap.  Lesley Manville is a hugely likeable and warm actor and gives her all in this part but somehow I didn't connect with her. Maybe it was because playing opposite Tim Spall's character was like playing to a blank screen with nothing to play off.It was their children who struck home for me David Corden was both revolting and heartbreaking as the enormous manchild of a son his tantrums totally believable and Alison Garland as the equally overweight daughter was very touching caring sweet grounddown and trying to be take up as little space as possible a cruelly ironic fate that can indeed be the fate of introverted and overweight children.  These two young people provided the emotional core and pathos in a film that spent a lot of time and it was surely half an hour longer than it needed to be grovelling around in the bilges of the human experience without finding much that made the search worthwhile.".

Maybe it was because playing opposite Tim Spall's character was like playing to a blank screen with nothing to play off.It was their children who struck home for me David Corden was both revolting and heartbreaking as the enormous manchild of a son his tantrums totally believable and Alison Garland as the equally overweight daughter was very touching caring sweet grounddown and trying to be take up as little space as possible a cruelly ironic fate that can indeed be the fate of introverted and overweight children.  These two young people provided the emotional core and pathos in a film that spent a lot of time and it was surely half an hour longer than it needed to be grovelling around in the bilges of the human experience without finding much that made the search worthwhile.";

It's a very difficult unrelentingly bleak film to watch with no humour black or otherwise to leaven the experience.I suspect that the development Leigh has in mind for Phil's family is that they learn to value one another through the events of the film. The issue I have is that they seem unhappily resigned to a situation of mutual coexistent alienation in the first place. Unlike Leigh's other films the drama is externally applied rather than coming from one or other of the protagonists.

That emptiness I suppose is meant to comment on the lives his crushed characters lead but for me it almost felt like the camera was just not that interested in following said characters. I confess I often wanted to sneak off with some of Phil's fares when they exited his taxi.I almost feel badly writing a negative review of this film as an affront to the working poor. And trust me I'd rather see a film about tenements than penthouses. It's just that I think a greater affront is offered by showing so many gloomy glimpses of the three families here. That being said Ruth Sheen as Maureen does shine when on camera. She displays some verve and some sense that I would suspect is a lot less rare no matter where one East or West Ends up.I've no doubt that financial constraints can lead to an impoverishment of the soul...but we jump in midstream here. Midstream in a story that sorely lacks a rudder.The daughter's creepy coworker the selfinflicted scarletletter stalker the accidentprone cab driver and his boozy loser of a wife...what do these add to the film?Again there are touches that I admired from this film. The sister steadfast by her brother's side but almost unable to directly communicate with him was well captured. The rapport between Maureen and her daughter was sweet and bitter. The aftermath of one crisis sparking an argument between husband and wife as if the tension teased more trouble out of them I thought was telling. These scenes had their own individual power...but offered little in the arc of the story or even message here.Perhaps if I understood Timothy Spall's Phil character better this would have worked. He commits a form of suicide killing his twoway radio and cellphone what brings him back? At several points he affirms his love for his wife but this feels about as empty as the coffers of the couch he scrounges for change.I wish Maureen had been around at one of those points for a more honest accounting of his emotional currency.

Veiled by its effectively subversive humour this difficult film challenged the audiences to confront boundless human pain headon which may explain the need for some comedy to soften the blow I think. But if one rises to its enormous challenge this film will deliver a catharsis not matched since the wildly swirling epic Magnolia.Many have commented on the quizzical reaction most everyone got from this obviously depressing film very willing laughter. Outwardly we can't help but laugh at its weirdly rhythmiccomedic presentation of depression in all its different shades and facets. Some dramatic set pieces even seemed intentionally tweaked to make us laugh. Perhaps Leigh trusted or was willfully testing the limits of a cinematic paradox that the audience may laugh at a film's characters throughout a movie but given half a chance they may too have just as much capacity to cry with them. What can I say? In the assured hands of a master story teller like Leigh this calculated gamble paid off big time.I was a devastated liquified mess after being confronted by the exponentially overwhelming sadness and piercing emotional truths this film dished out. The hurt and despair the film's ordinary people bore could just as easily be transplanted onto anyone who had parents or children siblings or relations friends or loved ones. In other words its incendiary resonance  relevance was heartpoundingly honest and universal whatever our social class divide.And frankly to say the last third of this film packed a wallop will be like a monumental understatement. By then I was already bleeding inside out. I was an emotional car wreck. For before I realised I was hooked by its imperceptible sea of sorrow it was too late. I was already marooning in the deep end struggling to stay afloat. Put simply I was mercilessly pounded into submission by the sheer human pain with which each and every character in this film endured concealed. And guess what I was still miraculously laughing throughout this ordeal? Either I am a masochist or this film do indeed possesses the uncanny gift to force us into keeping up appearances no matter how bad it all seems....Spoilers aheadIn fact the final breakdown and confrontation between two key characters in the film was the most heart breaking moment I ever had witnessed in all the films I've seen. This whole film seemed logically setup builtup to usher us all into this crescendolike breaking point. Hence imagine my immensely grateful relief when the film so mercifully ended on a positive note of catharsis.End of spoilers IMHO All or nothing may have been a top notch ensemble drama I felt it would not have reached its full dramatic heights without the Best Male performance of 2002 that of Timothy Spall's Or at least he'd have my vote anyway. Spall's sad puppy face incited the most laughter. His welltimed reaction shots to the situation around him were often pricelessly funny either as a disillusioned loser London cabby or a disheartened loser father husband at home etc. But it was also his emotive face and his fearless performance in this thankless role that sealed the audiences' full sympathies with his character and by extension our wild abandoning regard for this stirring dramedy. In closing I can safely say now that All or nothing can proudly stand alongside a film like The Insider Another one of my all time favourite films. For it too possesses that rare quality of a 'slow burner'. This film's strong legs meant I won't tire of it. I will only grow to love it more with each ensuing revisit. So folks if my above slobbering words are to be believed you have been informed. Go hunt for this highly recommended title now and be richly rewarded.".

Gerd Oswald besides this film also directed A Kiss Before Dying and Fury at Showdown the two of them remarkable. I saw this film yesterday and was amazed at how actual it seemed also full of the unexpected in a genre where there is a lot of routine. There is Donald McDonald as Clay Gipson the little boy that makes you realize how far from Shane this movie is. Millie Street Rebecca Welles is outstanding  the prostitute with no gold in her heart. Raymond Burr as Tris Hatten gets you scared just by looking at the camera you know you can expect the worst from him. Hugh O'Brian all in black is the perfect Sheriff. Great showdown halfway through the picture. After you see this movie which caught your attention full time with no break you wonder how come it is so ignored. Two words only Great film!!".

	schema:headline " An Underrated and Overlooked Classic Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Gerd Oswalt's modest but compelling oater The Brass Legend qualifies as a vastly underrated and overlooked western that probably didn't create much of a sensation when United Artists released it in 1956. Some fifty odd years later however this lean mean Bmovie with sharp black and white photography and memorable dialogue not only looks splendid but it also is genuinely entertaining because it contains realistic characters that you care about. This law  order frontier saga pits squarejawed good guy hero Hugh O'Brienwho must have done this movie while on hiatus from his TV show The Life and Times of Wyatt Earpagainst evilastheycome villain Raymond Burr before he achieved fame on TV as Perry Mason. Although this is clearly a formuladriven western Oswald treats the script written by Jess Arnold of The Eagle and the Hawk Don Martin of Arrow in the Dust and Don Zuckerman of Ride Clear of Diablo with respect. Basically nothing in The Brass Legend comes off either looking or sounding cheap campy or tawdry. Several things stick out about this sagebrusher. First Oswald stages a terrific shootout in a saloon about threefourths of the way into the action. What distinguishes this gunfight is that we see both the lawman and the bad guys in the same image when the shooting erupts. Clint Eastwood has often said that most Hollywood westerns tend to cut from shots of the man doing the shooting to shots of the man getting shot. In other words you don't see both combatants in the same shot. Consequently The Brass Legend differs from most oaters where the combatants are separated onscreen during the gunplay. Second The Brass Legend violates another of those unwritten rules when it shows a youngster getting blown off his horse by a bushwhacker. Children under age sixteen are typically not the victims of onscreen violence but you get to see the youngster here knocked off his horse by a rifleman who deliberately wanted the youth killed. Like most westerns of the 1950s adult males serve as role models for juveniles. In Shane for example the hero teaches a little boy how to draw and shoot a pistol. Most of these westerns preach against life by the gun. In The Brass Legend adults teach juveniles how to shoot and advocate that they carry firearms and that they are proficient in their usage. Essentially no adults in this movie admonish the juvenile about toting firearms or using them. At one point the hero warns the youth that he must know how to shoot correctly or he could be killed in a gunfight.The Brass Legend opens with Sheriff Wade Adams Hugh O'Brien watching young Clay Gipson Donald MacDonald of Two Guns and a Badge practicing his fast draw. Clay's target is a wanted poster of notorious outlaw Tris Hatten Raymond Burr who has a 5thousand dollar reward on his head. Later Clay's father widower Tom Gipson Robert Burton of The Slime People rides back to the Gipson ranch where Wade is supervising Clay's target practice with a white horse that he bought from a Yaqui horse trader. Clay names the horse after its trader Sinoye and saddles him up to ride. Needless to say Clay is very proud of his horse and spends a lot of time exercising his new Cayuse. While Clay is off riding Wade and Clay's father clash on his future. It seems that Wade and Tom's grownup daughter Linda Nancy Gates of Magnificent Roughnecks plan to get married. Tom wants Wade to turn in his badge and become a partner in his ranch. Linda also wants her future husband to quit being a lawman. Temporarily Wade and Tom are at loggerheads over this issue because Wade has no intention of giving up his job.Meanwhile everybody mistakenly believes that Tris Hatten is long gone and dead until he turns up unexpectedly in the Mexican part of town and sends Sanchez Vincent Padula of The Three Outlaws out to contact saloon hostess Millie Street TV actress Reba Tassell about seeing him. The sight of Hatten alarms Sanchez because he had heard that Hatten was dead. Millie hires a horse and buggy and rides out to meet Hatten. At the same time that Millie is driving off to rendezvous with Hatten Clay spots her and hides. Afterward he follows to Sanchez's place and spots Hatten. Clay hightails it back to the ranch. On the way home he crosses trails with Wade. Wade finds it difficult to believe that Tris Hatten is not only alive but also in the town of Apache Bend. Back at Sanchez's place Hatten sheds his gun and shell belt and makes out with Millie on the bed. Wade storms in with his gun drawn and takes Hatten prisoner. When Hatten in handcuffs tries to resist Wade our hero slugs him over the head and deposits his unconscious bulk in Millie's rental wagon and orders her to drive him into town. News spreads like wildfire about Hatten's capture. Initially the villain thought that Millie turned him in but he knows better later on after he thinks about it. When the editor of the local newspaperThe Bladegets the story from Wade Wade refuses to name his informant. When Tom pries the truth out of Claywho promised Wade that he wouldn't say a thingTom goes to the newspaper editor and they publish all the facts. A gunman ambushes Clay and the boy manages to pull through despite a severe wound. Hatten's former associates try to kill Wade in a saloon shooting. Wade jails the man who shot Clay but this fellow smuggles in a derringer and Hatten escapes. Wade and Hatten shoot it out on horseback and Hatten dies grateful that he won't swing from the gallows.Oswald does an outstanding job with this black and white western. The performances especially Raymond Burr as the villain are uniformly excellent. The following year Oswald helmed another Spartan western entitled Fury at Showdown.".

Hugh O'Brian looks just right for the part of a sheriff whether here as Wade Addams or as the lead character in The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp. Can you believe that series is over fifty years old?For a Western that follows a fairly standard formula director Gerd Oswald provides some interesting scenes that were never staples of the genre. Like young Tom Gipson Robert Burton getting shot off his horse or how about that fancy showdown in the saloon when the Sheriff takes out all three Barlow brothers? That scene came off as totally realistic vindicating Addams' tarnished reputation in bringing outlaw Tris Hatten Burr to justice in the first place. Even the ending was done differently instead of your standard showdown in the middle of a dusty street you have both antagonists riding toward each other like jousting knights but with guns blazing instead. There seemed to be just the right amount of satisfaction in Hatten's dying breath as he figures he outlived the hangman.But you know I keep wondering about one scene. How many takes do you think it required for Burr to find his mark when he threw his holstered gun against the wall?".

The characters are onedimensional and with one or two exceptions such as Burr's jaded killer Tassell's ruthless saloon girl the playing lacks sparkle although it's nice to see Russell Sinpson as Pop Jackson one of the jailers and Norman Leavitt as a deputy who even covers out hero in a saloon shootout.Production values are very moderate and credits undistinguished.

The film explores the idea of growing up  when does this moment come? What should happen to finally show us that we are adults ourselves that there is no other grownup around? This process of maturing of a person totally locked into her shell is very interesting. Secondly I must say that I've never been Jessica Alba's fan but now I can say that she's not only pretty but she can act. Hope that she will have more films coming that actually involve acting. Thirdly the ensemble cast gives a really good impression. There is no one who seems out of place. And finally the film itself leaves you with such a warm and positive aftertaste that any faults that it has seem totally irrelevant. Not a masterpiece but still a very good movie. 810".

In reallife NONE of these eccentric characters would come across as likable and so one has to force himselfherself into finishing this film.Jessica Alba Fantastic Four Sin City Never Been Kissed plays Mona Gray an oddduck of a character who is kickedout of her house by her parents years after her genius mathematician father has suffered a nervous breakdown she is kickedout for no real reason other than she is 20 and her mom isn't likable. Lucky Mona though ! as her mother has helped get her daughter a job as the math teacher at the local elementary school ... Mona having no degree isn't a problem Mom lied saying she had one as the school never looks into her past I'm not kidding.It is at schoolwork surrounded by kids with greater problems than her own that Mona begins to wakeup to life and find purpose and meaning beyond a search for numbers. Mona also meets a fellow teacher played by Chris Messina Julie  Julia Monogamy Vicky Cristina Barcelona who becomes interested in her odd manners and seeks out her friendship. Just as these last few sentences suggest An Invisible Sign IS oddly disjointed and filled with scenarios and situations that don't really go together. It is as if the film were pieced together because of cute little moments ... instead of giving us a cohesive and plausible story.There is littletono charm here and the entire thing feels tried and odd to me. I believe Messina's character was writtencreated for the sole purpose of having a sane individual in the film yes ... groan. Alba has tried drama in the past and has come across marginally successful at times but An Invisible Sign doesn't help her resume. It is almost too bad this one wasn't invisible.".

	schema:headline " A very good change of pace for Jessica Alba";
	schema:reviewBody "If you have not read the book An Invisible Sign of My Own or bother at least to read the book reviews of this 2001 fiction by Aime Bender you may very well be disappointed by the movie it most certainly is not a commercial or popular storyline producers would try to outbid themselves for the movie rights. It is a charming tale of a quirky young woman Mona Gray played by Jessica Alba who has not grown up yet but is pushed into the real world and must learn to swim or sink metaphorically speaking. She lands a job as a math teacher at an elementary school with false credentials it is the only job she seems fit for.The ever slow process of Mona's selfdiscovery begins in earnest with her new job with the help of a new found friend a very patient and kind science teacher Ben Smith played by Chris Messina and an older one Mona's own former math teacher turned hardware store owner played by J.K. Simmons she had dismissed from her life a while back. The trauma of her father's mental illness is at the core of Mona's cocoonlife and behaviour. The interest Mona takes in one of her pupils Lisa Venus played so believably well by Sophie Nyweide starts Mona's process of maturing Lisa's single mother is dying of the rarest of cancer and Mona is the sole person who ever expressed care for her daughter.There are a few beautiful lines and memorable in the movie the movie has narration by Alba. In one she says Life is much harder than math and another I liked but must paraphrase I did not write it down You know you're grownup an adult when you look around and you're the one in charge. This is the first time in my recollection I've seen J.K. Simmons play a role that was not that of a tough codger or extremely witty guy here he plays a role of a kind simple man you can expect in a fairytale. The direction by Marilyn Agrelo was excellent as I see the attention paid to details.Mostly I was blown away by Jessica Alba's performance one that did not require her to take her clothes off or do some phony martial artsy high kicking or one of the roles she so often has played. Here she shows facial expressions of innocence bewilderment fear caring and love like you expect from a really good actor she does not overplay her role and she is believable. As much as I liked her shower scene in 'Machete' I loved her acting here. I hope producers and directors take note and send worthy scripts her way. I knew she had the potential when I saw the film Sleeping Dictionary perhaps motherhood she's a real mom now has allowed her to find character depth we now know she can deliver. This movie somehow reminds me of I Am Sam and Skellig for the mood of the movies or the one I had to be in to watch them. So basically as the ratings indicate this will not be a commercial hit and many will find fault with Alba showing no skin and mock her acting that's too bad. Other reviewers who read the book recommend the movie that's usually good.".

	schema:reviewBody "There comes a moment when you look around waiting for the person in charge to help you and then you realize your the person in charge. After her father suffers a breakdown Mona Alba becomes obsessed with math. Using it has an escape she becomes distant from reality until her mother kicks her out. After taking a job teaching math to elementary school kids she learns to grow up and help others. This movie started off very funny and entertaining then really started to drag. The ending was OK very predictable though. The middle of the movie seemed to repeat itself and drag on and on and on. For those who like off beat quirky humor this is a movie for you. I would compare the humor to 500 Days Of Summer but not as funny. This did have some very touching moments in it but overall this movie had the potential to be very good but it never got what it needed. Overall a good movie that could have been better. It was just missing something. I give it a C.Would I watch again?  I don't think I will.Also try  500 Days Of Summer  Music Never Stopped".

	schema:reviewBody "This was unbelievably billed on Sky Premiere as a lovable comedy. I found it a load of badly put together claptrap smattered with some laughs one of which was the hairstyle bestowed on Jessica Alba. I can see how Mona would be unbalanced by her father and the hairstyle particularly in the opening scene where he tells the story of a family who each agreed to amputation of one part of their body so that noone would be killed. Her behaviour throughout the film including 'tapping out numbers' was verging on psychotic rather than nervous and shy.Her mother came across as unbalanced too when she told her to go because she couldn't help her dad and allowed Mona to sleep in the street outside for three days with her possessions before having a cosy chat on the sofa together with her dad and saying that she had some savings that would get her a place. She couldn't have done that in the first place? She then lied to the headmistress of the local school saying that Mona had a degree in order to secure a job for her. It seems that the headmistress didn't bother to check Mona's credentials ooer could that really happen these days? then accused her of lying after the axe incident when in fact it was her mother. The axe incident where Mona ended up with an axe embedded in her leg was the point at which my everpatient husband finally conceded that it was a ridiculous film. Her mathematics teaching was run of the mill rather than inspired by a buff and in fact I am sure that she was demonstrating maths too basic for the grade.Then there was Mr Jones former maths teacher and present neighbour whose car she bombarded every year with eggs for a reason which wasn't properly explained at first. When a reason was finally given to the effect that he hadn't cared when her father fell ill it wasn't really borne out by the flashback. He knew it was Mona who had bombarded his car and yet he let it go unpunished for years despite his annoyance and ignorance of the reason. Really? Though it might be down to the fact that he too was unbalanced enough to be taking refuge behind numbers in the form of pendants which told Mona how he was feeling every day. Was there anyone normal? Only the audience I think.".

Ruffalolite tells him to get another seat throws popcorn at him and then nearly starts a fight with him.I mean c'mon! Do they honestly think that movie fans watching the film are gonna warm to that kind of aholeish behaviour?! Just seemed to me the film showed utter contempt for people who actually want to watch films without jerks talking over them. Why get so bent out of shape over one particular scene? Cos it's a waste.

The heroine is a socially inept third grade teacher Jessica Alba a weirdo to the apparently well adjusted children and their ordinary dysfunctionally functional parents. It is a quirky story that gets off to a jumpy start. I almost stopped watching then realized I was enjoying the mess. In an early scene the first day of school the children are arranged into a human equation. It escaped me then that was a play on the theme. When I notice that a film I like is receiving mixed or bad reviews am compelled to contribute my own evaluation to assist those on the fence. This isn't for everyone. Anyone who doesn't grok the human equation probably won't get the result. The other extreme might find it overly simplistic.

Unfortunately they both missed the mark and Jessica came across as simple almost to the point of retarded.The school head was a caricature figure as was the 'bad girl' an issue that was dismally not addressed. Indeed the whole film seemed a bit like a caricature which is disappointing since all the ingredients were there to produce something a lot better  a real missed opportunity.

The story seems all right doesn't it? And from the beginning of the movie you think that it will be something like Amelie well not as good but still good enough. Well I certainly thought so at least. And I was wrong. Mona Gray is a loner all right but she also acts oddly in every situation. And if the story was supporting that behavior it wouldn't be a problem but the film seems to focus on her relationship with a student which is fine and the romance between her and the physics teacher which is not fine at all. Now I haven't read the book which I hope is better than the movie so I can't make any comparisons and I don't know if this is how the story should be but still I didn't like it. The ending was good so I must give some credit for that and the performance by Alba was great and the costumes were really nice. But the narrative and the story line reaped the chance from the audience to understand the character who can't develop well. So 3 out of 10 because I didn't enjoy it and I didn't get it.".

When Marty is robbed by a gang of outlaws one of them hides the money in the church altar.

First as Mickey Rooney who is supposed to look considerably younger than he does journeys to a small out of the way cowtown he's an idealistic frontier preacher even the youngest among us burst out in laughter when we see an airplane in the sky. What we were too naive to know at the time was that on low budget features like this there was only enough time budget and film stock for one take  so if something like a plane happened to fly by in clear sight of the camera it ended up in the finished film. Moments later when Mickey did arrive there supercool but also supersleazy owner of the saloon was played by none other than . . . the same man who incarnated wholesome teetoltaler Wyatt Earp on TV every Tuesday night Hugh O'Brian. Eventually we settled down to enjoy this mild oater in which Mickey wins over Hugh in good time and the sinful saloon gives way to a nice church. Undemanding in all respects this film will be most enjoyed if and when it shows up on some nostalgic movie channel or VHSDVD by those of us who loved it all flaws aside way back when.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the President of the United States is touring out west a sniper is awaiting him with his Europeanmanufactured rifle pointing down from a high window.  The assassin is a mentallydisturbed exserviceman in the pay of powerful vested interests ...  However this is not Dallas in November 1963 but an eerily accurate foreshadowing made nine years earlier.    Suddenly is a drowsy little Californian town whose peace is broken one sunny Saturday afternoon when it transpires that the President will step off his train here to transfer to a limousine for the journey into Los Angeles. Frank Sinatra plays John Baron the psychotic killer who arrives in town intending to kill Suddenly's most illustrious visitor.    Todd Shaw Sterling Hayden is the town sherriff and like western sherriffs of an earlier age he is strong decent and resourceful.  He is courting Ellen Benson Nancy Gates Suddenly's beautiful widow whose husband died a war hero.  Being a regular kind of guy Todd is trying to fix up a date with Ellen which will involve accompanying her to church on Sunday morning.  Ellen's sixyearold son played by Kim Charney is known by the nickname 'Pidge'.  Pidge is a good kid who wants to be a peace officer when he grows up and on the strength of this career ambition Sherriff Shaw buys him the cap pistol which Pidge's mother has steadfastly refused.  In Todd's eyes it makes no sense to disapprove of firearms Guns aren't necessarily bad.  Depends who uses 'em.    Pop Benson James Gleason is an Eisenhower lookalike and Pidge's grandfather.  Formerly a secret serviceman he is renowned far and wide for his probity and straight talking.  I'm an American aren't I? asks Pop needing no other philosophy in life.  Within seconds of making his first appearance in the film Pop is sounding off about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  When his home is being searched without warrant by men he takes to be FBI agents he welcomes them with I get quite a kick outta this!    And so the scene is set.  Baron's small team of crooks will occupy the Benson home in order to set up their sniper's nest.  Ultrapatriotic Pop and his family will do their best to resist the invaders.    Suddenly has some very noticeable flaws.  The labouring of the 'dangerous electricity' point is clumsy.  Though this tiny 'burgh' is crawling with state troopers and secret servicemen nobody hears the gunfight in the Benson livingroom.  Todd lamely explains it away by surmising that a passing train must have 'muffled it'.  What possible reason can Baron have for sending Benny down into the town?  Nothing can outweigh the risk that he will be detected  as indeed he is.  And how come Baron the man who feels like God when he has a gun in his hand fails to notice that Pidge's cap pistol has been exchanged for a real revolver?  How is it that minutes after the end of this dramatic siege life in Suddenly is back to prosaic normal?    Despite these infelicities and the mystery of how Baron knew the President's schedule so intimately Suddenly is a very enjoyable film.

	onyx:emotionText "As the President of the United States is touring out west a sniper is awaiting him with his Europeanmanufactured rifle pointing down from a high window.  The assassin is a mentallydisturbed exserviceman in the pay of powerful vested interests ...  However this is not Dallas in November 1963 but an eerily accurate foreshadowing made nine years earlier.    Suddenly is a drowsy little Californian town whose peace is broken one sunny Saturday afternoon when it transpires that the President will step off his train here to transfer to a limousine for the journey into Los Angeles. Frank Sinatra plays John Baron the psychotic killer who arrives in town intending to kill Suddenly's most illustrious visitor.    Todd Shaw Sterling Hayden is the town sherriff and like western sherriffs of an earlier age he is strong decent and resourceful.  He is courting Ellen Benson Nancy Gates Suddenly's beautiful widow whose husband died a war hero.  Being a regular kind of guy Todd is trying to fix up a date with Ellen which will involve accompanying her to church on Sunday morning.  Ellen's sixyearold son played by Kim Charney is known by the nickname 'Pidge'.  Pidge is a good kid who wants to be a peace officer when he grows up and on the strength of this career ambition Sherriff Shaw buys him the cap pistol which Pidge's mother has steadfastly refused.  In Todd's eyes it makes no sense to disapprove of firearms Guns aren't necessarily bad.  Depends who uses 'em.    Pop Benson James Gleason is an Eisenhower lookalike and Pidge's grandfather.  Formerly a secret serviceman he is renowned far and wide for his probity and straight talking.  I'm an American aren't I? asks Pop needing no other philosophy in life.  Within seconds of making his first appearance in the film Pop is sounding off about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  When his home is being searched without warrant by men he takes to be FBI agents he welcomes them with I get quite a kick outta this!    And so the scene is set.  Baron's small team of crooks will occupy the Benson home in order to set up their sniper's nest.  Ultrapatriotic Pop and his family will do their best to resist the invaders.    Suddenly has some very noticeable flaws.  The labouring of the 'dangerous electricity' point is clumsy.  Though this tiny 'burgh' is crawling with state troopers and secret servicemen nobody hears the gunfight in the Benson livingroom.  Todd lamely explains it away by surmising that a passing train must have 'muffled it'.  What possible reason can Baron have for sending Benny down into the town?  Nothing can outweigh the risk that he will be detected  as indeed he is.  And how come Baron the man who feels like God when he has a gun in his hand fails to notice that Pidge's cap pistol has been exchanged for a real revolver?  How is it that minutes after the end of this dramatic siege life in Suddenly is back to prosaic normal?    Despite these infelicities and the mystery of how Baron knew the President's schedule so intimately Suddenly is a very enjoyable film. Lewis Allen's terse direction keeps the story taut and dramatically interesting and Sinatra is excellent as the psycho.  Watch for his sick smile as he hurts the man with the broken arm!

Without his presence in the film Suddenly with its length of 75 minutes on my VHS version would be a B film even with Sterling Hayden starring in it as the sheriff. My guess is that Sinatra wanted to expand and test himself as an actor something he did less and less of in the following decade.The President of the United States is coming to the small town of Suddenly where he will leave the train he's traveling on and proceed by motorcade to a vacation in the Sierras. The Secret Service has come to town to do their usual thing in protecting the Chief Executive.But three contract killers headed by Frank Sinatra are in town to kill the president. We're never told exactly who is paying for this contract but the inference is that it is our Cold War enemies. Through a combination of circumstances the sheriff is wounded and the head of Secret Service detail Willis Bouchey is killed. And the killers are holed up in Nancy Gates's house with her her fatherinlaw James Gleason and child Kim Charney and the wounded Hayden.Most of the film is taken up with the wait for the train to arrive where a lot of souls are bared open including Sinatra's. It's the one and only time that Francis Albert ever essayed the role of an out and out villain. He does it well but I suspect he didn't want to push it with his public too much so he never did anyone as evil as this again.Of course history tells us that the president named Eisenhower at the time never was an assassin's target so we know Sinatra's efforts will fail. However it's rather ingenious as to how it does fail.I think more than fans of old Blue Eyes will like Suddenly.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like The Desperate Hours with Humphrey Bogart Suddenly depicts 1950s American conformity facing forces of chaos that threaten to destroy it completely. The peace and tranquility sought after during those postWorld War II years is symbolized by the quiet rural town of Suddenly a western community formed by explorers hunting for precious metals. Suddenly finds itself the unexpected host of the President who is making a brief stop by train during a crosscountry trip. In this town lives Ellen Benson widowed mother of 8yearold son Pidge. In residence with the Bensons is Ellen's fatherinlaw Pop an admired World War I vet Secret Service vet and bodyguard for Calvin Coolidge in the '20s. Courting Ellen is Tod Shaw yet another war veteran and the tall fit and honest sheriff of Suddenly. Tod is so loyal to his country and president that he orders a car rental guy to get his limousine ready for use no questions asked and no fee exchanged!!! It's interesting to note that Sheriff Shaw is played by Sterling Hayden who went on to play another uniformed man in Dr. Strangelove the crazed General Jack D. Ripper.But the pleasant community of Suddenly finds itself menaced by a strongwilled opinionated and toughtalking criminal the chief officer of ruthless forces that intend to eliminate the very symbol of American political and historical might  the President himself. Leading his small band of hoods John Baron has been hired by an interested party to organize the assassination via a sniper rifle bullet shot from the Benson house which lies high on a hill. Baron coldly and rudely commandeers the Benson household in the course of his work and isn't afraid to use force against the family members. I suppose the fact that the villain is played by a nonWASP ethnic actor could be interpreted a certain way too.The film is full of patriotic proUSA messages that are so heavily delivered as to be laughable and reflect some of the conservative interests that were prevalent in the 1950s. All of the honest lawabiding characters are simply bewildered that anyone would even conceive of killing the President of the United States who to them plays the same godlike role that the ancient pharaohs of Egypt did it would seem. Apparently they haven't considered how money politics and a number of personal interests could persuade some people to do that kind of thing. The TV repairman presents one of the most outrageously dewyeyed flagwaving gushing movie characters since Jefferson Smith. When he learns about the intentions of the assassins he blurts out They're commiesthey're enemy agents! Patriotic Pop likes to recite US rhetoric and looks down on Sinatra and his thugs as traitors to their country. Pop is also quite convinced that his dead son Ellen's husband died a good death by getting killed on the battlefield while defending the values of America. Even though the death has moved Ellen to view war guns and violence as methods that lead to the pointless waste of life Pop criticizes her and implies that his son's actions were not only honorable but necessary and that he wouldn't mind seeing the same thing happen to his grandson! In fact Ellen is portrayed as timid and weak though her eccentricities are at least wellintentioned. She's the stereotypical '50s mother  hysterical fainting misguided and inferior to men when the going gets tough. Pidge is upset at her because she won't buy him a toy gun and wants to shield him from violence which has caused him to look like a sissy in front of his classmates. Tod meanwhile scolds her for her antigun views and extols the merits of firearms. A firearm even plays an integral part in the downfall of the assassins. Good ol' Pop keeps it in his bureau though it's a mystery why the assassins never found it during their search of the house and never asked about it. Of course it's up to the leading man to fire the final shot to take down the ringleader after Pidge shoots and misses and after Ellen wounds him but then breaks down. Yes Tod does mighty fine despite his broken arm and sling. Funny how those guns never recoil too.But in spite of this hokey fun Suddenly is surprisingly tough and frank for its time. You may be taken aback by how some of the strong words made it past the censors. The sordidness of Sinatra's parents and his unglamorous life are touched upon. And the action includes the closequarters shooting of a federal official who's hauled away afterwards in a carpet if I recall correctly. Meanwhile violent threats of murder are made towards the 8yearold with talk of knives throats and such  and in the boy's presence.It remains a very good suspense movie and will provide a healthy dose of good entertainment for classic film fans that are looking for an old thriller. It's also a great chance to see Sinatra in action and as a vicious villain no less. He provides an energetic memorable performance and Gleason and Charney are good as well. While you watch just remember the different characteristic of the era during which the film was made.".

The boy tells mom his classmates call him sissy for not having one.

The ending is telegraphed far in advance when the little boy shoots the assassin but just barely misses the gunhating mom picks up the gun and shoots him but just wounds him and then the macho sheriff takes it and does what only a man can do  justifiably kill a bad man with one shot. Well the boy and mom didn't get the kill but at least now they are men well sort of in a way. Oh brother.".

	schema:headline " Sinatra Outstanding In Tense Low Budget Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "In lesser hands this rather stagy low budget thriller could have been a tedious affair but thanks to the work of director Lewis Allen who injects great pace and tension into the drama the end result is a gripping account of the events that take place when a suburban family's house is invaded by a group of men who've been hired to assassinate the President of the United States.As well as depicting the action that takes place on a Saturday afternoon in the small Californian town called Suddenly this movie also includes some 1950s attitudes towards women and the plausibility of a successful attempt on the President's life which now seem very outdated.Tod Shaw Sterling Hayden is the town sheriff who receives a confidential message that the President is due to arrive in Suddenly at 5.00 pm and subsequently assists the advance group of Secret Service agents who swiftly move into action to secure the area surrounding the train station. Dan Carney Willis Bouchey is the Head of the group and shows an interest in a house that's located on a hill overlooking the station. He's rather amused when Tod tells him that the house belongs to Pop Benson James Gleason because some years earlier Pop had been Dan's boss.Shortly after Tod and Dan's conversation a group of three men arrive at the Benson house and John Baron Frank Sinatra explains that he and his two colleagues are FBI agents who need to inspect the property to ensure that it's secure because the President is expected to arrive in the town later and they've received information about a planned assassination attempt.Pop Benson lives at the house with his daughterinlaw Ellen Nancy Gates and her son Pidge Kim Charney. Ellen's husband had been killed in the Korean War and since then she's forbidden 8yearold Pidge to watch war movies or play with toy guns and has also rebuffed Tod's proposals of marriage. When Tod and Dan Carney arrive at the house to see Pop Dan is shot dead by Baron and Tod is also shot in the arm. The family and the sheriff are then taken hostage and Baron threatens to kill Pidge if anyone tries to escape or interfere with his mission to kill the President.Predictably the tension increases as the President's expected time of arrival gets closer and a violent outcome seems inevitable.All the characters in this movie are fiercely patriotic as even John Baron is incredibly proud of the success he had in his military service and the fact that he was awarded a Silver Star. He also doesn't think that the planned assassination will damage his country because another President will automatically be sworn in one second after his victim has been killed.Frank Sinatra in an outstanding performance is very intense as the unstable Baron who gradually loses his composure as time progresses and seems to have been an inadequate person who found some selfesteem as a result of his achievements as a soldier who killed 27 Germans. Sterling Hayden and James Gleason are also good in their supporting roles and Nancy Gates does well as Ellen whose feelings and views are routinely undermined or ignored by everyone who purportedly cares for her.".

Why? Because the dialog is so stilted and obvious. And then because the actor playing the cop whose name thankfully is hard to discern from the credits delivers his lines phonetically. What really stinks is that when you see Sterling Hayden his tone is just as neutral and lifeless as this supporting bit player and then the sinking feeling becomes panic  we're dealing with a director here who doesn't even seem to have the level of dramatic intuition or ability to direct his actors that would make him suited to directing a 3rd grade play.And for Pete's sake what a lame and unbelievable story. Sinatra and a couple mugs are running around with a high powered rifle planning on killing the President. The idea of shooting the President from an upper story window with a carbine rifle probably kept this film off TV all through the 60s a fact which everyone could be very thankful for many reasons. But the Sinatra character is supposed to be doing this just for money. Eventually he gives enough long winded emotional speeches about his childhood  yes in the context of a home invasion and hostage situation where suddenly everybody is talking about their childhood  that we realize he is a section 8. Basically the script is like an amateur conservative version of Saroyan's Time of Your Life but instead of a bunch of people in a bar sharing their miseries over a beer this is a film where we have to buy that they are all sharing their darkest fears and undergoing minipsychoanalysis in this hostage situation. There was a whole slew of movies like this in the 50s and this one just happens to be exceptionally poorly written directed and acted. Every aspect of the production is substandard. Sinatra is playing to the back seats Hayden is as wooden as he ever was in his worst Westerns. Even the action scenes are so poorly blocked out that you can't tell what is happening.To summarize it would be pointless to summarize.".

Whatever one thought of Sinatra he was larger than life to most of us  and I sometimes think that the 20th Century ended in 1998 when he died.Sinatra's film career is odd. Initially it was his singing that got him roles. But the characters he played in ANCHORS AWEIGH ON THE TOWN and some other early films were very naive types. It is not until FROM HERE TO ETERNITY that people were able to see him in serious film parts. But he still played people that one liked or sympathized with. Sinatra could skirt the law or morality but he is not the villain usually. In ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS and OCEAN'S ELEVEN there are worse or more threatening mobsters than Robbo or Danny Ocean. Think of Peter Falk in the former or the gentlemen represented by George Raft in the latter. The most sleazy character he played was PAL JOEY who uses women to reach his dream of a great nightclub. But he is not the sleaze ball that John O'Hara wrote of or that Gene Kelly played in the Rodgers and Hart musical. The role was watered down.The fact is Sinatra had an image problem. Sinatra simply refused to be a villain except once  more in a second. At least however Sinatra could still do dramatic roles while being a hero like Detective Tony Rome or Von Ryan but he stymied a section of his acting development. His fans never cared but it meant that he never could reveal a darker image in his acting unless his characters were twisted by circumstances they barely understood like in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.SUDDENLY is the one exception. Here Sinatra played a psychotic villain  a wouldbe Presidential assassin hold up in a house with his gang setting up a state of the art rifle with a telescopic site to kill the President as he steps off a train in the small town of Suddenly.It was pointed out on this thread in another review that the film seems like a B feature even though Sterling Hayden plays the sheriff and James Gleason plays a retired Secret Service Agent. Actually the subject matter was quite unusual. Films about political assassination in the U.S were rarities. In the 1940s and 1950s one can think of WE WERE STRANGERS THE TALL TARGET PRINCE OF PLAYERS ALL THE KING'S MEN A LION IS IN THE STREETS and THE PHENIX CITY STORY. All these actually dealt with real assassinations WE WERE STRANGERS dealing with events in 1933 Cuba but the others dealing with Lincoln Huey Long and the murder of the Attorney  General of Alabama by corrupt politicians in 1954. But SUDDENLY broke the model a little SUDDENLY suggested that the Presidency was fair game in mid20th Century America.This was a shocking concept. McKinley had been the last President to be killed by an assassin and that was in 1901. Although Teddy Roosevelt was wounded in 1912 while campaigning and FDR shot at and Mayor Cermak of Chicago killed in 1933 those events were long past. FDR's near thing was supposedly connected to the Depression. But in 1950 Harry Truman was targeted by two Puerto Rican nationalists at Blair House in Washington one of the assassins and one of the Secret Service guards had been killed. Still despite the fatalities in 1933 and 1950 the image of a President dying by an assassin seemed unreal in 1954.So the film became quite unsettling to the audience of it's day. Sinatra has the mind set of John Baron the assassin quite down pat. A total egomaniac his attempts at being friendly are only to brag about his being a successful shot in the army. He tells Pidge Benson Kim Charney  Gleason's grandson and one of Baron's hostages that he won a medal for his marksmanship from the army. Pidge dismisses it by saying he Baron must have stolen it. He thinks he is better than Booth and the other assassins because he has his escape planned  although Gleason warns him he'll never get away with it. He also dismisses the men who hired him because immediately as the President dies he'll be replaced by the Vice President. It never bothers him that the men who hired him may want that Vice President as President.He does try to overawe Ellen Benson Nancy Gates in the kitchen. But he knows Ellen and the Sheriff are a couple so it's a way at striking at Hayden too. But his attempts at seduction are not effective Ellen finds him repulsive. It is possibly the oddest sexual failure in any of Sinatra's movies.In the end the Bensons and their allies thwart Baron and he dies not understanding why the scheme failed. The film therefore ends reassuring the viewers that it can't happen here anymore. Within nine years after he made his best film THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE also dealing with political assassination Sinatra saw his former friend President John Kennedy murdered. It may have struck him as odd that the murder weapon was a rifle with a telescopic site aimed from a height the window of a warehouse rather than a private home and that the killer was a wiry thin long faced loner with a military record. It may explain the fact that Sinatra made sure to take both THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and SUDDENLY out of circulation for decades  he may have felt profoundly guilty about what happened.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie kicked up something of a fuss at the time 1954. After all Ike Eisenhower was not only a popular president but a war hero as well. It's probably no stretch to say that yes indeed everybody liked Ike. So this was a pretty nervy production for the conformist 1950's. Then too it's likely no accident that the movie was produced independently of the Hollywood studios. I doubt any studio big or little would have okay'ed such touchy subject matter as killing a president. But the 70 minutes does amount to an effective little suspenser as assassins and hostages crowd into a living room perch awaiting the president's sittingduck arrival while the tension mounts.The movie came along during a low point of Sinatra's career before his 1954 Oscar reversed the slump. That's probably one reason he would take on such a risky role as the thoroughly dislikable assassin. And visually especially Sinatra's's quite good. As a result when Baron says he would be nothing without his gun Sinatra's scrawny nonHollywood appearance confirms the fact. Just as importantly he gives the wouldbe assassin the right kind of nervous edge.There's a fairly obvious theme working through the screenplay namely that despite pacifist wishes violence does have a moral place in life. As events in the movie turn out the only way to stop Baron's immoral use of violence is with morally sanctioned counterviolence. The screenplay makes the point by showing us that had Pidge gone along with Mom's antigun wishes the assassination plot would have succeeded. So fortunately the movie implies when push comes to shove Pidge follows the men in his life and the plot fails.For Cold War audiences of the day the political lesson is pretty clearonly guns and muscle will stop Soviet plans to destroy The American Way. Of course the film never identifies the authors of the plot but I'm sure audiences came to the obvious political conclusion. It's probably also telling that guns are identified with manly men and only a frightened woman the mother opposes them. Mom's doubts may be understandable given her husband's violent death. However by ignoring Mom's wishes no matter how understandable Pidge comes to represent a future in which gun violence and armed national defense will continue to be morally necessary. Beneath the surface it appears lies some pretty heavy symbolism.Subtexts aside Suddenly remains a gripping film even this many years later. That's pretty darn good for a cheap production using basically one set for most of the action. But I expect it's really the touchy subject matter that continues to excite viewers and separate the film from more routine suspensers of the day.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Cusack's girlfriend has just dumped him for the biggest jerk in school and John deals with the depression anger and frustration in humorous ways. Slowly he finds himself bonding with French exchange student Diane Franklin a beautiful and clever young woman that helps to build up Cusack's selfimage so he can win his girlfriend back.Better Off Dead follows a familiar basic storyline.

I WANT MY TWO DOLLARS!!!!Also has some of the funniest lines in 80's teen comedy such as Franklin's accidental misuse of the word testicles and the comment made by an onlooker when Cusack tumbles into a trash truck. Definitely better than the majority of 1980's teen comedies.".

We have a guy that attempts suicide but he can't even succeed at that.  There is his best friend that declares that a mountain they are on in the dead of winter is pure snow saying  Do you know what the street value of this is?  We have a father that is trying to speak the lingo of his kids and fails miserably and a mom that cooks food that literally slides off it's plate.  We have a math class full of genius' that get upset when they don't have homework to do.  Lane has a younger brother who orders books on how to pick up trashy women and learns how to build rockets.  We have the entire male population  and Barney Rubble  that wants to go out with Lane's exgirlfriend now that they are broken up. There is two Oriental guys that want to constantly race Lane and then broadcast it over the loud speaker on their car.  There is Porky from the Porky's movies basically playing the same role here dancing hamburgers a basketball team that grunts and of course the most relentless paper boy in the history of paper delivery.  Whoooooooo!  I'm out of breath.  So why do I mention all of these things about the movie?  Because all of these little issues combine to somehow make one of the funniest and zaniest movies you will ever see.  Better Off Dead is so full of energy that there is enough material in here for ten movies. But Savage Steve Holland makes it work.  Don't ask me how but he does.  I think I'm going to stop here because if you haven't seen this movie you have to see it now.  This is a completely original film and it also one that no one will ever have the guts to make again.

What has long been a cult classic this film did an excellent job of portraying the awkwardness of those teenage years that all adults thank God every day that we now have behind us. Savage Steve Holland's directorial debut was simply sensational he could not have picked a better vehicle in which to make his mark! Rounding out the cast includes Amanda Wyss as the fickle girlfriend who is more interested in her popularity than anything else David Ogden Stiers Major Winchester from MASH fame as the dad who tries too hard to be in Kim Darby is priceless here as the mother who is completely absolutely and utterly clueless Scooter Stevens as Lane's little brother Badger is one ongoing surprise after another and what is probably going to go down as BY FAR the most coveted film role in the 20th century Demian Slade plays the paperboy from Hell. His portrayal alone makes the film not only worth watching but worth buying! To close matters off in the casting department the chemistry between Cusack and Diane Franklin  who plays the French foreign exchange student Monique Junot is something that simply cannot be denied. Keep in mind however that whatever you do  that like The Cable Guy  DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT take your eyes off that paperboy! Cusack and Holland do a perfect job of capturing that period of time in the 1980's better than any other film of the period. This film is well worth an evening's entertainment. Rent it once and then buy it as you will want to watch it many times over. It took me SEVEN YEARS to find a copy in VHS. The DVD was just bought for 10.00 and change from from WalMart.com. I highly recommend this film to one and all as a MUSTOWN!On a scale of 1 to 10 I give this film a 1210. ".

The film delightfully spoofs those teen angst movies that were so popular at the time. Lane's exgirlfriend giving him an excuse that she dumped him for someone better looking and more popular Lanes failed suicide attempts Lanes cartoons are among some of the most amusing sequences.Holland gives the film a unique treatment. 'Better Off Dead...' has an innovative quality that makes it one of a kind. It includes the adorable claymated romantic Hamburgers cartoons a stalking paperboy a ski competition on one leg a little brother who's a silent genius and an international language. Holland put a lot of heart in the writing and some of the lines had me rolling on the floor laughing.The acting is splendid. The character Lane seems tailormade for John Cusack. I've always thought of Cusack as an underrated actor and 'Better Off Dead...' is one of the few movies that does justice to his talents even though this is perhaps one of his first roles. A vivacious Diane Franklin is supercute and she has the loveliest smile. The chemistry between her and Cusack is undeniable and both have excellent comic timing. David Ogden Stiers and Kim Darby are hilarious as the nutty parents. Curtis Armstrong provides some morbidly funny moments.To say it in one sentence 'Better Off Dead...' is one of the rarest examples of teen movies at its best. It already is a classic and while many of us watch it for nostalgic reasons others may like it simply for the heart and humour.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eighties teen films I love 'em. I never tire of this brand of entertainment that's a true product of it popculture times. There's something about this wonderful era. Everything about the humour had a natural build up and even during the hits or misses it stayed consistently amusing without resorting to grossouts. 'Better off Dead' fits that buck. Here's another cherished coming of age story through the eyes of a troubled teenager dealing with a dumped relationship and the embarrassments that seem to follow through the painful years of high school and everyday life. Wallowing in selfpity eventually it comes to identifying selfconfidence over what isn't the impossible. What am I going to type that someone hasn't already. Nothing. The plot is secondary to the oddball episodic setpieces and comic characters where the flow is unpredictable and original like out of some daydreaming teenager's imagination. John Cusack a pinup boy for these roles has that likable downtoearth awe which fits. Surrounding him is a fantastically hearty support cast in David Ogden Stiers Kim Darby Diane Franklin Demian Slade Amanda Wyss Curtis Armstrong Dan Schneider and Laura Waterbury. Director Savage Steve Holland throws caution to the wind with his animatedly interesting style but manages to make sure everything still comes together without really trying. Well it looks so. Visual gags also have a powerful note like the nighttime chase sequence involving a persistent paperboy after his 2 dollars and the drag racing scenes with a pair of Asians. Even the ski scenes are well shot. An upbeat soundtrack pounds out the catchy nostalgic tunes and cements an provocatively charming sincereness. It's hard to pass up this selfknowing offkilter teenage comedyromance winner.".

Everything about the humour had a natural build up and even during the hits or misses it stayed consistently amusing without resorting to grossouts. 'Better off Dead' fits that buck. Here's another cherished coming of age story through the eyes of a troubled teenager dealing with a dumped relationship and the embarrassments that seem to follow through the painful years of high school and everyday life. Wallowing in selfpity eventually it comes to identifying selfconfidence over what isn't the impossible. What am I going to type that someone hasn't already. Nothing. The plot is secondary to the oddball episodic setpieces and comic characters where the flow is unpredictable and original like out of some daydreaming teenager's imagination. John Cusack a pinup boy for these roles has that likable downtoearth awe which fits. Surrounding him is a fantastically hearty support cast in David Ogden Stiers Kim Darby Diane Franklin Demian Slade Amanda Wyss Curtis Armstrong Dan Schneider and Laura Waterbury. Director Savage Steve Holland throws caution to the wind with his animatedly interesting style but manages to make sure everything still comes together without really trying. Well it looks so. Visual gags also have a powerful note like the nighttime chase sequence involving a persistent paperboy after his 2 dollars and the drag racing scenes with a pair of Asians. Even the ski scenes are well shot. An upbeat soundtrack pounds out the catchy nostalgic tunes and cements an provocatively charming sincereness. It's hard to pass up this selfknowing offkilter teenage comedyromance winner.";

First time director Holland is conspicuously the new kid on the block as he saturates his film with so many ideas a clear giveaway that he is yet to trust himself enough to release the reigns enough to let his movies breath. The results are spectacularly manic but it really works. Amidst the zany comedy and plentiful sight gags the cereal boxes with all the giveaways cut out for example Holland throws in some amusing cel animation a stopmotion fantasy sequence and a cameo from Barney Rubble. Yet despite all the mania the film's comedy has a level of discipline and restraint that ensures all the jokes land and humorous plot points established early on are satisfyingly resolved. One of my favourite characters in the film is superenthusiastic maths teacher Mr Kerber played by lategreat character actor Vincent Schiavelli. Telling maths formula jokes to his spellbound class Schiavelli spins comedy gold using that discomfortingly warm tone that made him such a soughtafter talent. His is one of several casting choices that are pitch perfect John Cusak as the selfinvolved teen who wants to end it all when his vapid girlfriend Amanda Wyss dumps him for someone more popular Laura Waterbury as the odious loudmouthed neighbour and gas guzzling mother of shy bullish nerd Ricky Smith perfectly played by Dan Schneider Kim Derby as the timid clueless stayathome mom who makes slimeridden meals that seem somehow sentient and slide off the plate by themselves her Frawnch dinner party host is unforgettable Curtis Armstrong ostensibly reprising his role from REVENGE OF THE NERDS gets the lion's share of oneliners and he delivers them with so much aplomb Chuck Mitchell reprising his PORKY'S role is perfect as badtempered burger baron Rocko Diane Franklin as the hapless frustrated French exchange student who is both a fairy godmother and the surprise love interest monster child Scooter Stevens who wields newspapers as weapons and to whom two dollars means the world and the super talented David Ogden Stiers as the priggish father attempting to bridge the generation gap with his checkedout son.BETTER OFF DEAD is not for everyone and the film is most likely best enjoyed by those who lived through the 80s and understand its cultural peccadilloes but if you have watched your fair share of 80s comedies like SCREWBALLS 16 CANDLES BACHELOR PARTY PORKY'S NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION REAL GENIUS ZAPPED or POLICE ACADEMY you might wanna give BETTER OF DEAD a chance.

A dark comedy with very little edge and even less laughter this was one of the biggest disappointments I have seen in recent memory. Now I know why it was listed for one cent on Amazon.com.The story concerns high schooler Cusack whose girlfriend played by Amanda Wyss Shakma leaves him for a boorish jock. The film's title come from Cusack believing himself to be better off dead than minus Amanda Wyss. So he tries to commit suicide he really doesn't his foolish attempts only give credence to the fact that he can't score at anything a couple times during the film. Savage Steve Holland tries to coax laughs out of an eccentric family Cusack's best pal that snorts snow and a deranged newspaper boy demanding his money. It's films like this that give teen comedies a bad name.STORY  There was plenty room here for Holland to give his viewers the goods but his writing skills are wanting to say the least. He fails to build any sort darkness out of John Cusack's character making his suicidal sojourns pointless and flat. Holland was dealt a hanging curveball and popped the darn thing up.ACTING  Rather weak here as well. Genre favorites Curtis Armstrong Vincent Schiavelli and Amanda Wyss do their thing and try to give this some substance but fail. Cusack is far better in other films and David Ogden Steirs is wasted as John's father.SEXUALITY  Little of note here. The sexy Tina Littlewood is accidentally stripped in the school cafeteria and blushes in her underwear.".

	schema:reviewBody "I picked up this movie to see my favorite 80s comedy actor Curtis Armstrong who is probably best known for his role as Booger in 'Revenge of the Nerds' or Miles in 'Risky Business.' He's just as good here as the 6year high school senior and Lane Meyer's friend Charels.Better Off Dead sister movie of One Crazy Summer is one hell of an oddball film for the 80s teen category. It is a mix of strange humor animated sequences drawn by writerdirector Savage Steve Holland and a loveable star to pull off quite an entertaining and hopefully not too obscure 80s teen comedy.John Cusak is his typical outrageous teenager character in his role as Lane Meyer the same type of character we saw in One Crazy Summer Hot Pursuit and others the one where he is always a regular nice guy who somehow gets caught up in unforseen crazy situations. But Better Off Dead offers the most offthewall atmosphere for such a seemingly levelheaded kid.Lane Meyer is a young guy who's long time girlfriend Beth Amanda Wyss breaks up with him. Lane is crushed and isn't quite sure whether he can deal with the problem even contemplating suicide until he realizes he has not yet even visited New York. Beth has taken up with Lane's blonde macho nemesis Roy Aaron Dozier who's character is quite similar to Cusak's nemesis character in One Crazy Summer. As guys typically do in these movies to compete for a girl's heart Lane is going to race Roy in the dangerous K12 run there is a joke in the measurement of the slope because 9 is actually the highest and hardest slope rating. But Lane is in over his head and seems nowhere near ready for such a dangerous slope. But since things have gone pretty lousy for Lane since breaking up with Beth what's he got to lose? The tag line 'Sometimes...you're Better Off Dead' is quite right for Lane. It seems like for a while everything is disastorous for Lane such as always losing the race to the two Japanese brothers who mimic Howard Cossell the date with the girl who just suggests that Lane give her the money that a date would've cost and spare them both the agony of pretending to enjoy each other's company or when everybody in the school including Lane's geometry teacher keeps asking Lane if it's alright if they ask Beth for her number.But things get better when a French exchange student Monique moves in next door with a fat mama's boy Dan Schneider as Ricky and his obnoxious mom who make her stay in America literally a living hell. So she and Lane Meyer soon enough become friends and maybe life without Beth just isn't so bad for Lane Meyer after all. The movie is great Valley Girl's E.G. Daily plays at the school dance! and a completely different kind of 80s teen movies one that should be in a category by itself because the things that go on around Lane are so weird. For example Lane's little brother Badger Scooter Stevens who has no speaking lines in this movie spends the entire film cutting off those little sweepstakes mailers from various household food boxes and mailing them in to get stuff particularly supplies needed to build himself a rocket really. In another example you'll notice that the filming locations used for the slope sequences in which the entire city appears to be covered in a blanket of snow is much different from the sunny dry climate of the locations where Lane is at school or at home or anywhere but the slope. The Nine Lives song Paperboy makes the reference to the running gag of the paperboy in the movie who keeps hassling Lane for his two dollars. Where's my two dollars? repeats the kid with a paperboy posse. It subtle and unsubtle humor.If you like this movie try Holland's One Crazy Summer which came out a few years later starring Cusak again and Demi Moore and Bobcat Goldwaith among others. It is just as bizarre and funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 80's was full of rather bland teen comedies such as Pretty in Pink and the dreadful Revenge of the Nerds series. Here we get one of the nerds Curtis Armstrong but i suspect that he was merely in this movie to give it some clout as the lead John Cusack wasn't really a household name yet. When you look at the movie Curtis Armstrong's screen time doesn't even amount to 5 minutes.The rest of the movie is sort of interesting because of the style of the first half which is kind of offbeat considering that Cusack's character Lane is ten times more realistic than the rest of the characters. His mother who cooks rather disgusting meals belongs in some kind of 50's sitcom and almost all her lines are written like she is talking to herself and not interacting with anybody else. And who could forget that pesky little paperboy who keeps showing up and demanding 2 dollars. That scene has almost been parodied to death on various spoofs through the 90's and 00's.The director Savage Steve Holland did not have a prolific career but you certainly can't deny that he made some movies out of the ordinary and I am glad that I can remember this as being one of the more satisfying experiences at the movies because usually 80's movies were extremely formulated. John Cusack may not have been a official member of what was known as the Brat Pack and this film certainly is a notch below the Breakfast Club. However since he succeeded where they failed I doubt that he lost much sleep over it.".

Unfortunately when I taped this off tv some time ago I missed the beginning.

I first watched Weird Science then BOD then I watched Weird Science another two times because Kelly LeBrock was totally hot and I really didn't think BOD was all that great.It's now 16 years later and I can honestly say that I have not seen Weird Science since then but I've watched BOD so many times I can't keep track. FYI Kelly LeBrock is still hot.Sure I admit I'm a Cusack fan so that definitely makes me enjoy the movie.  Plus Curtis Booger Armstrong makes me chuckle. Side note Curtis Armstrong could win the Nobel Prize and he'd still be Booger. But BOD has so much little things that just make you understand why you watch movies.

However this movie wasn't the typical 80's comedy at all. I'll explain myself. This comedy has a very particular absurd humor. Unlike a lot of comedies that were made in the late 80's and early 90's it's not a ripoff or a bad version of something that was made in the early 80's. However it's not a type of humor that anyone can enjoy. But if you do enjoy it you'll love this movie and it can easily become one of your favorite. The strange family of the main character and the main character himself played by John Cusack are extremely amusing and funny. It's seen as a teen movie by a lot of people but I personally don't think it is. It's an unique genre but it's also easy to wonder if it's a parody of the typical 80's teen movies. If it is a parody it's a lot easier to understand the typical cheesy ski film aspect of the movie and the romance with the exchange student. But if it's not then the movie would be separated into a horrible cheesy teen movie and a hilarious comedy. This is what is so strange about it. The typical 80's love story really doesn't work in this movie because of how goofy it is. I prefer believing it's a parody and it probably is. Basically I think this is a very enjoyable fun movie that no one can possibly hate. Specially if you're a fan of absurd humor and the 80's.".

As far as that goes the song and dance sequences are satisfying although not elating.Like many that came before it including Truffaut's Day for night Perhaps Love is structured as a movie about making a movie. It manipulates the situation to its fullest by having the story in the movie that is being made replicate almost exactly the story of the people making it  the director male and female leads in an alltoofamiliar perpetual triangle. Crisp cutting traversing the three dimensions  the making of the movie the present flashbacks the past and the story within the movie being made the allegory  creates a fascinating kaleidoscope of lavish beauty from which emotions flare.Kaneshiro Takeshi and Zhou Xun playing two top stars that shared a past that one tries to forget with icy resolution while the other clings on to with fiery desperation work together splendidly to bring life to an oftentold tale. Jacky Cheung cuts quite a powerful Phantom figure playing the director who brought the actress to fame and fortune. Ji Jinhee is comfortable in a role of the muse in Tales of Hoffman but appearing in many guises.The use of the trapeze in the grand finale is a clever move bringing to mind quite a few classic movies with the circus as background. The mellowed ending lifts this movie one notch above conventional romance melodramas sending the audience away with reflections on the protagonists' as well as their own fleeting passage through life.".

Just because Perhaps Love is not as musical as other musical movies does not mean it is worse than those movies. I personally loved the movie. the characters performed beautifully the songs were original and empathetic. The plot seemed simple yet complex and deep. The idea of 'film making' in a film is clever and well fitted. The costumes were designed exceptional as we see clear contrast between the past in BeiJing and the present new Sun Na. The introduction was philosophical. Life is a movie. you could be the protagonist on someone's movie or just a glimpse of the face. The love between the 3 people seemed simple yet extremely complex. and the twist at the end of sad yet realistic. In conclusion Perhaps Love is a masterpiece. it needs more explorations to be completely understand but i think it's worthwhile. Good Job!".

Yes it's opening made it look like a boring musical but actually the singing and dancing are just eye candies for the audience. The love story presented is simple. I don't even think it as a romance movie. I think of it more as a drama about love more. I guess the reason I felt this way is because I watched the Chinese version better communication compared to English sub. and I was in a situation that questioning my own love life. This movie gave me another perspective looking at love relationship.Don't you feel related to any one of them or part of? How many of us really have something true? Why do you think Sun Na and Lin Jian Dong still break up at the end of movie? Answers can be diverse and it all depends on your own experience. Yes Sun Na was once Jian Dong's true love. She messed it up. He loved her ten years ago and still presently but more complicated with hatred revenge. There is no way they will be together any more.It looks like the movie is talking about a love triangle but I think it's talking about love in general. I relate it to real life. People can be running away not just from poverty they can be running away from a bad love relationship bad family relationship to start a new love relationship. How many of us had relationship like Sun Na and Nie Wen's? Gain from each other's strength not necessary in a bad intention. I bet there are a lot.Anyway the movie is beautiful. Zhou Xun has always been great. Takeshi did a good job in this film surprisly. Director Chan I'm waiting for your next great work! No pressure  When I got time I will write more.See you.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Perhaps Love";
	schema:reviewBody "I fell in love with the introductory analogy. Life is like the movies in which you are the director producer and the star. In your life there are other costars and of course that significant other. But what if you happen not to be sharing the limelight in your other's life? Editing is always a pain and in the final product you will then learn if you are sharing the same billing get relegated to a cameo or in the worst case get cut out entirely and lie on the floor of the editing room.Similarly to my 2004 movie of the year Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind this film too takes a look at the trying to forget someone in your life entirely. Except in this one there is no fauxpas scientific methods but done by sheer human will and pretense.This is a musical within a musical and a beautifully choreographed one at that. First thoughts will be hey it looks like Moulin Rouge with big colourful sets dancers singers stunts and songs with meaningful lyrics. Yes and given similar themes like Love and Hate but Perhaps Love tells its own story. The soundtrack befits the musical and I won't be surprised if anyone adapts this for the stage too.Japanese heartthrob Takeshi Kaneshiro plays Lin Jian Dong a struggling film student when he met his love in Beijing. When the film begins he's already an accomplished actor and chances upon that same love in his latest movie collaboration. He's not the least surprised at being given the cold shoulder and goes all out to try and win her back. But exactly what his motivations are  love revenge closure that one pleasure filled fling remained to be seen.Much is said about his ability to sing or lack thereof but I felt that he sang convincingly in this movie and fleshed out his role as the pained lover realistically. When his final intentions are revealed you can't help but to emphatise  yes that perhaps what he did was justified.Contrasting Kaneshiro's character is Jackie Cheung's Nie Wen the auteur director with his mood swings. His current lover and muse is Jian Dong's love in Beijing and he comes to discover this fact after filming begins. He feels cheated upon hurt and channels his raw emotions onto the film. There should be no doubt as to Cheung's singing prowess  powerful is the one word summed up though I thought it's always the same song? Between the two male leads his is surprisingly magnanimous and shows true courage as compared to Jian Dong.Chinese actress Zhao Xun plays Sun Na the woman caught between the two men. One is her lover in a past she wants to forget while the other is her lover who brought her stardom in the present world. It's a highly complicatedinemotions role one which explores and for those in love might have felt in one way or at some points in time. When you feel your love is holding you back would you give it all up to pursue your dreams? Sun Na is one such woman who will stop at absolutely no cost and jump on every available opportunity presented to seek fame and fortune. And it is she who walked out of Jian Dong's life at least twice to be with an American director and later with Jian Dong's assistant director friend before we currently see her in the present.Ignoring Jian Dong when they meet in their new film she can't help but feel her icy walls being broken down by his persistence though Jian Dong had assistance from Korean Jin Jihee's role as Montage a spirit who interacts with all characters and weaves in and out of the plot bringing about a feel that there's always that higher being involved in events that unfold in life.And the way the characters interact is probably fused so seamlessly into the musical within the musical. Unable to express themselves freely they do so through the musical's story premise and lines. It doesn't feel contrived but the entire narrative seemed flawless. Even the flashbacks doesn't mar the pacing of the film but brings about a natural progression and revelation of character development and events.Perhaps Love is a truly wonderful experience especially for those who have been in the same ship before. Its ending isn't typical but one which perhaps is the most realistic an ending can be for the characters involved. Peter Chan has crafted a beautiful masterpiece of a musical for the Hong Kong film industry. Catch this on the big screen before its run is over!".

It's much and I really mean MUCH better than most of the stuff Hollywood chunks out and I bought it on DVD the day I got back! For everyone who has ever felt the feeling of losing a love or having an unreachable love this movie will be very recognizable. It greatly depicts the pain and suffering that can come from true love and although the movie isn't always as easy to follow it will captivate you and keep you hooked right up to the end.Apart from the wonderful story the great backgrounds and superb acting made me an instant fan of Asian cinema. I'd seen a couple of more well known Asian films like Il Mare for example but this one opened my eyes entirely. I hope to see more movies like this soon and I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a good love story!".

The chemistry between the actors felt real and I loved the soundtrack! Probably the weak points were the choreography and the effects especially the ending sequence.Btw the director Peter Chan has stressed in interviews that Perhaps Love is NOT a musical but a love story so viewers shouldn't be going in and expecting a fare like Moulin Rouge.I liked the way reality and illusions past and present were hard to separate in the movie eg no different usage of colors because it reflected the inner struggle of the characters Sun Na who refuses to believe that her past affects her present Nie Wen who thinks that illusions can solve reality's problems Jian Dong who cannot separate the past from the present.The saddest part was when Sun Na after receiving her memoir from Monty recalled the film that Nie Wen had always wanted to make  a simple love story  and she said If that film was ever made I've always wanted to be in that film... which reflected her inner yearning for a simple love story of her own but it never came true. But why did she disagree so strongly with the location of that film that Nie Wen said it would be filmed at? Qingdao? and Qinghai? sorry can't remember the exact names Perhaps it's because even though Nie Wen and Sun Na longed for the same thing in a whole they also longed for different things that they could not agree upon.There are so many things to discuss about the movie but I think most of it is subjective if you know how much love can confuse hurt give hope and stumble you'd probably like Perhaps Love too. Words won't do it justice! All in all Peter Chan did a great job in capturing the emotions of the characters. Worth a second and third watch!".

Sun Na left Jiandong to pursue her dream to be a movie star leaving Jiandong devastated. Ten years later both of them become big movie stars and their paths cross again when they costar in a musical. However the musical's director Nie Wen Jacky Cheung also loves Sun Na. Will the old love prevail or will it simply break more hearts? At the beginning when the music and dancing started I thought this film is another Hollywood style cheesy musical. I am not a big musical fan so I got a little worried. That concern quickly disappeared because the heart wrenching story and the marvelous performance settled inside me deeply. The music and the songs actually move me profoundly. The film brilliantly blends together the musical which two lead characters are filming and the movie itself. The characters are enacting their love affairs through the musical they are playing.I am glad that Takeshi Kaneshiro speaks perfect Chinese in the film not like how Zhang Ziyi speaks English in Memoirs of a Geisha. Heck even Ji Jinhee speaks darn good Chinese perhaps dubbed.I shed so many tears together with those characters during the screening of this film. I wonder why. Perhaps love?".

They are all making a musical film which in movie tradition parallels the triangle that exists in real life.. Its an often jaw dropping eye popping emotional film. To be sure it doesn't always make complete sense partly because the frame work confuses things a bit too much and partly because I don't think all of the elements are there but at the same time the music the images and the emotion just carry you along. Many people here on IMDb compare it to Moulin Rouge but I don't think thats fair since this film really only compares to that film in that they are musicals. This is a movie musical that knows what it is and knows how to use the conventions of movies and musicals to great effect.Honestly I'll have to watch it again to determine how much I like it and yet at the same time I want to go out and show it to people. I want to show it to people and explain you want to know why I love movies here watch this or If you want to know what a movie is suppose to be watch this.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps Love is an unusual film from the East in that it is a musical. Jacky Cheung plays an acclaimed movie director Nie Wen who gave the major break to his girlfriend Sun Na Zhou Xun years ago. Once again he's cast her in a musical film which tells of a love triangle between the leading lady to be played by Sun Na her former boyfriend played by Lin JianDong Takeshi Kaneshiro and a circus director played by Nie Wen. Little does Nie Wen know that there are too many similarities between his script and real life as Sun Na and Lin JianDong have a past from 10 years before.Our film unravels showing the parallels between Nie Wen's film and flashbacks of the story between Sun Na and Lin JianDong. Despite the potential for it being clichd and full of the boring old scenes from other romantic stories it does turn out to be innovative and full of a few twists to keep the interest going. Plus Nie Wen's musical film gives some beautiful songs and choreography that occasionally bridge fictional and real life so good in fact that they would fit in well in some good West EndBroadway musicals.Jacky Cheung fresh from his almost endless tour round Asia in the stage musical production Snow.Wolf.Lake demonstrates in the movie why he is the king of the musical stage in Asia. His unique powerful singing voice shines like a heavenly king's should. Takeshi Kaneshiro was a pop star in his youth and sings well and just in case you wondered not at all like the drunken scene in House Of Flying Daggers when Zhang Ziyi dances. But the acting honours go to Zhou Xun who didn't actually have many singing parts but her acting shone through as exceptional. She effectively plays three characters in this movie Sun Na in her youth and as the diva and the character in Nie Wen's film and she makes the transition between those characters so effortlessly. She is for me a real talent in the making a Zhang Ziyi but with real acting ability aside from looking innocent. It is no wonder then that she won the HK Film Critics Award in 2006 for best actress beating a whole host of stars and is up for the same category the coveted Hong Kong Film Awards in April 2006.Peter Chan's visionary directing is as strong as ever. The film has some amazing sets costumes and choreography that brings it to life. The cinematography is almost Christopher Doyleesquire. Given Chan's other recent success as producer being Dumplings in the Three... Extremes films I'm now looking forward to what Chan has to offer next.The film is bound to create some more interest in Chinese musicals in the future and I'm hoping that we'll see a film version of Jacky Cheung's Snow.Wolf.Lake. And there is an appetite for it internationally too as Perhaps Love was widely praised when it closed the 62nd Venice Film Festival. In Hong Kong it received good reviews is nominated for 11 HK Film Awards and was Hong Kong's official entry into the Oscars although it hasn't been nominated This is a gorgeous film and definitely worth watching. One for an emotional tug on the musical heartstrings.".

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews Perhaps Love";
	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps Love is one of those movies that gets better with age. 6 years ago I first popped in the huge DVD box set and honestly not only did I not get it but it was a snoozefest. That's coming from someone who enjoys and embraces Wong Kar Wai movies since the tender age of 17 years old. Something about musical and whatever this film just didn't click. Now fast forward the time machine and countless experiences it is 2011. Perhaps Love is not just any other good film but it is a wonderful emotional and simply amazing movie experience. It is a film that constantly makes you think reflect and the inner turmoil of Jacky Cheung Zhou Xun and Takeshi Kaneshiro are all heart wrenchingly felt. The musical aspect adds to the atmosphere and the story telling in fact Jacky Cheung's role as the present lover who can do nothing about his partner being unfaithful is most likely his most difficult and complicated role to date.

	onyx:emotionText "Perhaps Love is one of those movies that gets better with age. 6 years ago I first popped in the huge DVD box set and honestly not only did I not get it but it was a snoozefest. That's coming from someone who enjoys and embraces Wong Kar Wai movies since the tender age of 17 years old. Something about musical and whatever this film just didn't click. Now fast forward the time machine and countless experiences it is 2011. Perhaps Love is not just any other good film but it is a wonderful emotional and simply amazing movie experience. It is a film that constantly makes you think reflect and the inner turmoil of Jacky Cheung Zhou Xun and Takeshi Kaneshiro are all heart wrenchingly felt. The musical aspect adds to the atmosphere and the story telling in fact Jacky Cheung's role as the present lover who can do nothing about his partner being unfaithful is most likely his most difficult and complicated role to date. Zhou Xun is amazing as always but it is Kaneshiro that really surprises me. His eyes hides years of sadness frustration and unrequited love is simply breathtaking to endure.

	schema:reviewBody "Saw the movie last night at the Malaysian premiere with Peter and Takeshi present at the beforebuffet and screening.Personally I did not enjoy the movie. Don't get me wrong I love musicals and I thoroughly enjoyed Moulin Rouge. There were a lot of things in Perhaps Love that tried to be like Moulin Rouge but just didn't quite get there. For example the opening sequence with fast choppy editing and fastpaced choreography. The only problem here is that at least Moulin Rouge gave a clear premise of what the movie was going to be about as oppose to in Perhaps Love which throws you into a song with no clue at all.The one thing that fell flat was that even though the storyline about the love triangle was simple the way it was revealed was confusing and there were a lot of scenes that just seemed like a waste of time and wasn't moving the movie along.Perhaps it needs to be explained to me but generally movies don't need to be explained and should reveal itself. The formula of a good musical is that it is pretty straightforward and what makes a musical work are strong songs that explain the storyline. The music in Perhaps Love was weak in the sense that it all sounded like Mandopop ballads and didn't move the story along at all. At some points in the movie I was thinking whether it can even be justified as a movie musical due to the fact that the only musical numbers were songs from the movie being made within the movie. From memory there were only about 5 songs through the 2 hours! I usually enjoy choreographed pieces and musical numbers but when it came to the musical scenes in Perhaps Love I started feeling uncomfortable due to the fact that the extras looked a tad unprofessional and the whole thing was cheesy as oppose to it being a serious dramatical love story.Visually though the shots were well done and setscostumes and even the acting was strong so I'll give it a few stars there but other than that it just got tedious and I pretty much was waiting for the ending to arrive.".

I wouldn't find it difficult to imagine the same melodies with French or English lyrics. In Mandarin they just sound strange.The musical items were also cut together badly far too quickly to be enjoyable and the shots of the actors looking anguished lasted far too long.The special effects are the next disappointment.

	schema:reviewBody "I love musicals.. somehow I have doubts for this one.I expected to see a musical albeit one without any plots. Musicals are born that way actors sing to what they suddenly feel like. If you look for a plot in a musical you're going into the wrong movie.However this film is.. I can't describe really what it is. It's a musical yes and there's a story. I didn't like the way the music is performed in the movie though. They depended too much on the playwithinplay idea to present the music. All the musical performances happened within the 'film' that the three characters were involved in. You can see that whenever the characters are singing they are doing it in the 'film' and not in the real life situation. I was expecting a performance to come out from the feeling of that character  like Chicago when Roxie feels like it she would suddenly sing to the tune 'Roxie Hart'  of course then the song All That Jazz is still done in a 'performance' within the movie. In fact Tsai MingLiang's The Wayward Cloud sex and other things aside would make a better musical  the leads would suddenly change clothings and sing whenever they feel like it.Am i making sense here? Instead of that sort of thing I wish that the characters would just sing when they're happy like that scene in Singing in the Rain or when they feel sad and not doing it because the characters are 'in a movie set'. It just takes the notion of Musical away. Yes there is a plot probably better than other musicals but then the plot is not strong enough on its own. The music is great at times touching. Jacky Cheung is an amazing singer and I didn't know Takeshi could sing that well either plus good looking and can speak canto oh my.. The slow love songs are the most beautiful. The cinematography are obviously beautiful and carefully arranged. There are many dancing scenes that are nicely choreographed except that I wished the singers would dance with the background dancers too instead of them singing in the middle doing nothing. I wished also that there would be more singing done by more characters instead of just Jacky or Takeshi and the other Korean guy whats his name..? Nevertheless its a really good try by an Asian director trying to go global. I just wished it would be less Broadway and more unique ChineseAsian the setting are all 20s Harlem sort of feel.And I also really wished there were more people singing. I like the Korean guy's character because he's exactly what musical is all about  who that person is doesn't matter what matters is that he sings whenever he wants to! So I think it's a good watch just to see how Asia can make a musical too. Plus the musiccostumessetcinematography are just too nice to miss.".

This I find a bit lacking in the film and the music itself doesn't really make an impression. I agree with other comments in here that the main characters should be more involved when in the musical mode. The film successfully created a sense of deep sadness thoroughly from beginning to end oozing out from EVERY character. But really the story is extremely simple. It brought on the heartache from the very beginning and it was just there until the last minute of the film. If you enjoy such tearjerking moments you will like it but for me I soon started to long for something....some sort of happenings to fill up the gaps between the numbers. That brings us back to the music because if the numbers are good enough the audience would soon forget the plot. In terms of singing performance Jacky C obviously steals the light from everybody else. In fact it is just a onehorse race. The rest of the cast have easier scores probably due to their vocal limitations. But this film does give a different flavour from the recent Hollywood mainstream musicals. It is more feminine more subtle and perhaps that would work better for the markets over here.".
