In an effort to save him his father Prescott Roe seeks to purchase the dead wife's sister Velada from the same traveling carnival he acquired Awbonnie. The girls' father carnival master Eamon McCree is willing to do business but her stepbrother Reeves protests putting an end to the negotiation. Desperate Prescott kidnaps Velada and promises her the means to be rid of her father in return for comforting Talbot out of his obsession. In Talbot's madness he guards his wife's corpse preventing her from passing to the beyond. As a result Awbonnie's ghost begins haunting and cursing everyone involved in the transaction of selling her as a wife. Meanwhile Reeves and Eamon search the prairie for Velada. Drunken Eamon several times wants to turn back and leave his daughter to her own devices but Reeves refuses. At the site of a hunting party of Indians Eamon panics and loses...";

The plot is interesting and I really like the cast but the movie is a little slow. We always expect something explosive to happen but nothing really does. The symbolism is nice.

	schema:reviewBody "River Phoenix was a part of our 2003 All Soul's remembrances and I'm shocked to find that a decade after his death he is practically forgotten. Video clerks stared blankly at the mention of his name. National video store clerks!! Two different chains! I only located a few of his ensemble films at the major video rental outlets. Silent Tongue was among the meager offerings at a grocery store. Others I can't find at all.If The Thing Called Love is your only experience of the adult River Phoenix you might not recognize him in Silent Tongue. He hardly looks the same. This is the film which finally gave us River Phoenix the man and in it he plays Richard Harris' addle pated son. Sadly his screen time was all too brief. Perhaps he knew his soul was about to be called home for he finally broke through all the artifice and became the consummate actor we so often heard he was supposed to be but seldom saw.The film is compelling most often when River is on the screen. Gone is the boyish actions which hardly fit his farseeing eyes. Gone is the dual selfimportance and shyness which often felt false. Here we see a man truly possessed and lost damned by his own makings. Burdened with something we can't quite understand. It rings of truth. Ugly and brutal but truth nonetheless as we were to learn that Halloween morning in 1993.Richard Harris is also excellent as Prescott Roe. His love for his addled son is evident and the character is both touching and pathetic in trying to protect him. Harris always managed to elevate his fellow actors by a rung or two but there is nothing he could do to elevate those parts he did not appear in. I find it interesting that he twice played a father to a Phoenix boy son. Father to two wounded men if only in the land of makebelieve. There is a certain symmetry to it. I wonder how the real man thought about it.The Mulroney part is unconvincing for the most part but it is not the actor's fault. Sheila Tousey is interesting as the ghost and Jeri Arredondo is lovely to look at. I wish both ladies appeared in more films. The scene with Tantoo Cardinal is a waste of her talent and makes little sense to the whole. Since when did a rapist rear their own products to adulthood?Watch the film to see River Phoenix as a man and to finally see his promise fulfilled. It would have been nice if the vehicle were a better one. Although it is flawed it is worth the watch if only to get a glimpse of what he would have brought to Interview with a Vampire and other roles. With the successes enjoyed by Keanu and Depp so much in evidence it is hard not to be a little bit bitter and bemoan the whys. Forgiveness is harder to come by though the anger has started to dim. This film can go a long way to explain it all to those who are too young to remember who River Phoenix was.".

Great performances by Richard Harris the father Alan Bates the medicine show owner and of course River Phoenix. The film has a unique and eerie look and feel that's unlike any others I've seen. River's role as the grieving young widower is interesting to watch. Especially since he plays a disoriented hallucinating character which seems to mirror his real life at the time battling drug addiction and other demons.

Great performances by Richard Harris the father Alan Bates the medicine show owner and of course River Phoenix. The film has a unique and eerie look and feel that's unlike any others I've seen. River's role as the grieving young widower is interesting to watch. Especially since he plays a disoriented hallucinating character which seems to mirror his real life at the time battling drug addiction and other demons. He even looks high during some scenes Of course he was a great actor. Granted this movie is not for everyone. The friends  family I've shown it to liked it.

If you let yourself be immersed in that context you'll enjoy this movie. It goes beyond that just a Western' don't be mislead but such a qualification. Many of the weird images that the movie shows will stick with you and that for me it's a plus for a movie. Please don't ever see it if you're only in the mood to see clearstraight message movies. Any kind of mood you're in though you can only appreciate the good job done by all the actors specially by River Phoenix.like a reminder that he was posed for better things than some of the movies that he made. If you're a River Phoenix fan or simply a good actor's fan you won't help by being moved by such a convincing performance and think of what could have been. I give the movie a 7 and that in my book means a good movie that worths a try. You must be the judge which means you must see it.".

It does not hurt that the screenplay's characters sometimes speak with the cadence and tone of formal 17th Century English mixed with a touch of cowboy colloquy. It helps even more that there are murderous ghosts and allusions to suicide. After about 30 minutes of trying to get a peg to hang my movie genre hat on I was left with a question. WTF is going on here? That is why eventually I gave up and accepted it for what it wasa Shakespearian western. Aside from that its a slow stroll with lots of dramatic flourishes and an unexpected touch of Grand Guignol. Dermott Mulroney and River Phoenix are evident in support. Native American actress Sheila Tousey is absolutely terrific. Watch it but in the right mood.".

But you can't blame his son for being so loyal to his wife that even after death he still remained by her side. That's when the ghost came into the picture and also into the reality of the others' minds! The Plains Indian tradition was to place a deceased body up above the ground on a scaffold rather than burying it underground. At least they got that correct. But Ms. Tousey's ghost wanted her own body to be burned so that her spirit can be free and in peace. Of course in real life that would not have happened but I also understand why she wanted herself to be cleansed in flames. Fortunately Mr. Roe himself cleared his son's insanity in the end by throwing the remnants of his son's deceased wife. This may seem weird to some but I think Ms. Tousey's ghost character was truly dominant in the sense that she womanhandled and terrorized the white men who ruined her sister's life buying her in exchange for the 4 horses and gold!! Unfortunately the ghost even gave her own sister hell for allowing herself to be bought by the foolish white man Harris who only cared about saving his son without considering the consequences!

	schema:reviewBody "There was something about this movie that was haunting. It could be that both Richard Harris and River Phoenix were gone and they were two of my favorite actors it could be that they were both so good in it and made the best of a film that really didn't have much climax to some characters. Having said that what I did was just ignore the other storyline and paid attention to the Talbot's and it became real a real haunting story and it made sense. She needed to be burned and her body to be let go in order for her to be free. She would haunt and torment them until it was done. She wasn't angry at any of them and I believe she even loved him since both sisters hated the father but her spirit was angry for not letting her move on. The actress who played Awbonnie was also fantastic. I enjoyed most of this movie and some of it was riveting however some of it fell flat. I agree on Dermott's part and acting what a travesty that was. I'm surprised he was such a bad actor back then. Reading some of the other reviews I have to say the first one threw me for a loop. People never heard of River Phoenix? Shame on them. I know a lot of people tend to forget about him due to his mother not wanting to do films about him talk about him or letting them release a lot of footage and stuff unless she gets paid but that's downright heartbreaking that someone wouldn't know who River Phoenix is. He was the premier actor of my time. He was the one you watched for not Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise but River Phoenix. You waited to see when his next movie was coming out who he was working with what his next project was what interview you could scour up. He was our James Dean. RIP River Phoenix I would never forget you.".

It could be that both Richard Harris and River Phoenix were gone and they were two of my favorite actors it could be that they were both so good in it and made the best of a film that really didn't have much climax to some characters. Having said that what I did was just ignore the other storyline and paid attention to the Talbot's and it became real a real haunting story and it made sense. She needed to be burned and her body to be let go in order for her to be free. She would haunt and torment them until it was done. She wasn't angry at any of them and I believe she even loved him since both sisters hated the father but her spirit was angry for not letting her move on. The actress who played Awbonnie was also fantastic. I enjoyed most of this movie and some of it was riveting however some of it fell flat.

The most interesting character is Richard Harris's whose interpretation  is one more proof of his genius watch MAN IN THE WILDERNESS if you are not convinced. Many interesting elements everywhere and again superb images but well boring. The plot takes too many directions and the symbols  are rather cryptic to me.

There is just the right amount of concert footage to keep System of a Down fans happy and just enough political characteristics to keep the moviegoers interested with some added entertaining shots of fans that allows the illnatured topics to be given a rest every once in a while.The beauty of the film lies in the fact that it provides feedback for the reasoning behind why Armenians still fight for recognition after 90 years. Discussing several modern genocides of the 20th and 21th Century including the ongoing tragedy in Darfur Screamers is able to relate the Armenian Genocide and its denial to contemporary accounts of why some may still think that they can get away with such atrocities.Some critiques of the film may come from politically motivated viewers having not seen the film as the currently ridiculous rating of 2.110 suggests. I am reviewing the film in a partial manner regardless of my Armenian heritage and my views on the subject. As a film Screamers is well worth your time regardless of your political views. Whether you are Turkish Armenian or any ethnicity for that matter please watch the film before you judge it or review it.Combining music politics humor and drama this documentary will keep you entertained provoke your thoughts on contemporary tragedies and possibly influence you to become a Screamer rather than live in your own little world silently watching a tragedy unfold.".

The voted ratings appeared to be slanted all the way to the negative while the comments are on the other extreme and seem to be mostly written by the converted who the film was preaching to. Regardless I thought I would watch it despite not knowing what it was really going to be about.I found a film that was strong in some areas and weak in others. The strengthen is in its educational value as it discusses the secret genocide of the Armenian people by Turkey in the early twentieth century and how it also dovetails it into other genocides. Knowing almost nothing about this genocide I found these parts of the film to be quite fascinating and revealing as various experts contribution to the discussion of the past as well as the ongoing denials. The former is naturally shocking because of the diaries stories and photographs paint a typically gutting view of how evil humans can be. However the latter sections are just as fascinating because it is very clear and critical about the powers that be that deny genocides this one and modern ones we know this of course but it is never less that shocking to see it.System of a Down deserve credit for using their fame to try and bring the subject to a wider audience by making this film but the problem is that they do actually achieve the opposite effect. At the start of the film there is far too much of a focus on the band and their music and while this is fine for fans I personally found it quite offputting mainly because I didn't really care for their music. This meant that I found myself struggling to get into the film in the first 15 minutes. After this though the film steps back from them a bit and gets better at balancing the mix between documentary on the genocide and less of a rockumentary. The approach does rather mean though that marketing the film is difficult and it is most likely to be watched by those politically aware the converted and the band's fan base which is certainly a smaller audience than the subject matter deserves.An interesting and informative documentary then thanks to the contributions of experts and the sense of history.

Unfortunately my country the US hasn't declare that yet motivated by political reasons it's more convenient to have a big country like Turkey as a political partner as a small Armenia which does not have a political power. Nevertheless my state California has recognized the fact of genocide...";

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Screamers is a documentaryrockumentary that focuses on the Armenian Genocide of 1915 but also points out the atrocities that have occurred in other genocides through the present. Director Carla Garapedian follows System of a Down an American rock band with Armenian ancestry on their tour through the U.S. and Europe. On their tour System of a Down educates their audience of the horrors of the past. The Armenian Genocide today is still not recognized by the Turkish government its perpetrators. On April 24th the anniversary of the Armenian Genocide System of a Down's front man Serj Tankian made his message clear. On stage before the screaming fans he shouts Tonight is not just the 90th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide it's also time to break down all the walls of hypocrisy around the world with all genocides known and unknown accepted or not accepted. It's time to make the Turkish government... to pay for their fing crime! SOAD then proceeded to play their song P.L.U.C.K. which stands for Politically Lying Unholy Cowardly Killers referring of course to the Turkish government. Half of the film is concert footage from SOAD's tour and the other half is some very graphic footage of genocide and interviews from researchers survivors etc. Most notable of these is Serj Tankian's grandfather one of the few living survivors of the Armenian Genocide. In addition to the fact that the Armenian Genocide is still denied by the Turks today another reason that this film is so important is that right now there is genocide occurring in Darfur. Some of the images in Screamers are very graphic and hard to watch however it is necessary that people be exposed to the truth. This is an incredibly powerful and important film. A lot of people haven't heard of this film because of it's limited release and exposure. It's a real shame because it really is an amazing film. It also helps a lot if you're a System of a Down fan.httpwww.screamersmovie.com".

Acceptable Chorizo Western though contains some flaws and in which a drunk become sheriff resolves a conflict among officials  corrupt Land Baron  Mayor  Judge that want to blackmail villagers and the good guys who attempt their freedom . All in all this film is predominantly a Spanish film rather than an Italian one. It's a two country coproduction but is clearly dominated by the Spanish contingent and the traditional leanings of the Spanish producers of the time have their stamp on the entire proceedings. The Spanish westerns of this era were far more likely to try and emulate their American source material than cultivate a distinctive style of their own the way the Italians were doing but their product if you like traditional westerns remains watchable . It's a thrilling western with breathtaking gunfight between the protagonist Alex Nicol against the heartless Robert Hundar and his nasty hoodlums and a stirring ending fight . It's an entertaining story with a touch of peculiarity  some great characters and an agreeable soundtrack . The basic plot is typical spaghetti western fare  but what makes this movie stand out is its style . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax  such as in the ending gundown . The movie gets the usual Western issues  as avengers antiheroes  strong facing off  exaggerated baddies and spectacular duels  among them . The sense of pacing is such interesting that his film can be counted on to move quickly and smoothly . Sympathetic acting by Alex Nicol who takes on a band of crooks  unethical Mayor  his gang and he then decides that he wants to get justice for the friendly townsfolk . Alex Nicol starred during the sixties and seventies several American Western as well as Chorizo or Paella Western such as Relevo para Pistolero Gunfighters of Casa Grande  and The Savage Guns or Tierra Brutal the latter considered to be the first Spaghetti .

Plus  the starring boy turns out to be Mark Johnson  now a prestigious producer who has financed successes such as Rain Man  The Notebook  The Chronicles of Narnia  and Breaking Bad  . Good production design creating an excellent scenario with luminous outdoors  rocky landscapes under a glimmer sun and fine sets by expert set designers Cubero and Galicia who designed several Westerns as Spanish as international ones .

Borau began as a Critic of cinema and to publish articles about cinema in newspapers . He enters the Spanish Official Cinema School where he later become a teacher and after that  he directed documentaries and films . He was President of the Spanish Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  in addition  member of the jury at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1991 .

	schema:reviewBody "Corrupt officials enlist the services of a bandit Moody to kill a farmer in order to seize his property. The town drunk Brandy is enlisted as the new sheriff after Moody kills the former. He is expected to be too incompetent to see justice be done but with the help of the townsfolk defeats Moody his gang and the corrupt officials. Reasonable spaghetti western which starts slowly but improves in the second half by borrowing or ripping off depending on one's view Rio Bravo 1959 and High Noon 1952. The villain is clad entirely in black he even wears black gloves. The film is unintentionally hilarious in a scene where the sheriff Brandy and a few others break into song so hopelessly dubbed it's ridiculous. Why would they suddenly sing in English? Not violent a la later spaghetti westerns.".

The Spanish title Brandy is the nickname given to the flawed protagonist who will be given the responsibility of ridding Tombstone of its greedy and evil oligarchs led by George Rigaud frequent villain in Spanish films of the 50s. It was Jose Luis Borau's first feature graduate and young teacher at the newly established National Film School. It was commissioned by Antonio Manzanos from a story by Jose Mallorqui who were both involved in the 50s popular western adventures of El Coyote although it underlines one of Borau's repeated motifs in his subsequent filmography the importance of solidarity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think this movie won't surprise anyone who has already seen another movie by this great filmmaker it is the same place Blakans and style as we are used to. If you liked his other movies you will surely like this one too.The story develops around a small bosnian village where the lives of his inhabitants are changed by the war that shattered Bosnia 12 years ago. So far nothing extraordinary but what makes his movies different are the atmosphere and life that springs out of every image. There are two levels at which you can perceive this movie the first is the rational level the story the gags as in all his movies humor has a central part and so on. The second might be called irrational because it has to do with identification and feelings you are taken out of your seat and are part of what happens on the screen. Drama is placed very closely to comedy and sometimes the change is so sudden your laughs freeze on your face. This I guess is the landmark of this movie dramatic scenes build upon and increase their strength from funny scenes. After all nothing can be taken seriously in the Balkans I won't say too much about the story partly because I don't want to spoil your fun partly because I feel it's unimportant. Suffice to say that the war is presented only by its reflection in peoples lives  this is what matters most in Kusturica's view. There are no battle scenes.I think the only thing I can reproach is that once or twice I felt the gags were exaggerated a bit unnatural. But all Kusturica's movies have a dose of fantastic so this is not a real problem.I cannot end without pointing out the great performance of the lead actor Slavko Stimac Luka. All in all I would strongly recommend this movie.".

'Life is a miracle' will be seen in time I believe as the ultimate film about the Bosnian war.The main character Luka played by Slavko Stimac is a train engineer building a railroad in a remote corner of Yugoslavia near the Bosnian border. It's the end of the communist rule and lingering ethnic conflicts start showing up and replace the patriarchal life. When war breaks Luka's son will be drafted into the Serbian army and fall prisoner while his wife runs out with a Hungarian singer. The conflict around that he tried to ignore by work partying and booze invades his life. And still salvation is out there the day a beautiful Bosnian prisoner yet a neighbor of yesterday shows up Luka will build a plan to make an exchange of prisoners between her and her son but soon will fall in love.Kusturica succeeds to paint in naive painters colors a world that slowly slides from normality into madness where neighbors become enemies and violence the rule. He is funny and exuberant but his humor is the humor of the fool of the village and his exuberance is the exuberance of desperation. As in many great movies it is love that redeems and brings back human feelings to where they should be. Kusturica builds a world of characters who are tragic and funny colorful and overall avid to live a life despite of the vicissitudes of history.Wonderful.".

It's is very nice to watch that being always himself the director was able to improve his style and understand the most powerful elements of each of his previous films so this time he mixed the lightness and joy of Crna macka beli macor black cat white cat with the seriousness and dramatic feelings of underground.. plus a romance which is truly explored for the first time in a Kusturica's film and with high sensitivity i must say.So in this one the scenery is a typical Black cat a almost wild village near the serbia  bosnia border where a railroad is being built in the middle of a feeling of pre war. Here we find the main character this humble man with a devily insane wife and a son. Things move forward and he looses both when she escapes with some Hungarian and he goes to war where becomes a prisoner. Than we have the last important character showing up Sabaha performed by a dazzling Natasa Solak truly beautiful. Around this context Kusturica builds a very intense psychological diary of the man who has constantly to decide whether to save his son or stay with his love you'll understand how when you get to watch the film as well as to deal with his returning wife vs his new lover. Better to observe that in the film than to talk about it. Apart from that you get a lot of Kusturica elements and typical way of making laugh such as through a mule who is constantly trying to commit suicide in the railroads or the fantastic scene in the football game. In opposition to this you have this scene where Luka main character desperately grabs his son foot ball and cries over it. Powerful. Mixing the beautiful Balcan's landscapes and the ambiguous but typical and enjoyable no smoking soundtrack and never loosing the posture of portraying ex yugoslavia social environment like in the references to Tito ex dictator of the balcans kusturica creates this romantic but also dramatic comedy which is the most difficult thing to put in films as far as i observe. You have in this one that strange laughingcrying effect you find in for instance La Vita e bella or in most of Chaplin's movies. You spend the movie laughing but suddenly you feel very sad and disturbed and understand you saw something sensitive and great...From time to time pace gets to slow and if the film was 15 min shorter it wouldn't be worst. Apart from that it's a powerful European creation. It's Kusturica for sure. 810".

Whether at peaceful life or at war sharing joy of being with friends or bitter taste of parting the characters in the film are given a fascinating ability to see beauty in every moment of their life. They are bright personalities they are full of dignity they are honest and direct in their feelings and they experience life to the full. Lively motion of camera  beautiful sceneries bring the final touch. A remarkably colourful film. Highly recommend to everybody who is into really good cinema.".

Whether at peaceful life or at war sharing joy of being with friends or bitter taste of parting the characters in the film are given a fascinating ability to see beauty in every moment of their life. They are bright personalities they are full of dignity they are honest and direct in their feelings and they experience life to the full. Lively motion of camera  beautiful sceneries bring the final touch. A remarkably colourful film. Highly recommend to everybody who is into really good cinema.";

Still this is not necessarily a negative sign for an author who has been able to create Underground or Black cat white cat. This movie is an authentic hymn of joy to life love and humanity sure also that grotesque humanity that in the Balkan countries may look wild sometimes thus we can be happy that Kusturica has achieved once again this objective. In addition Kusturica stress here in an unusual way for him the real power of sentiment between two persons which can overcome war and ethnic division.However the instruments that Kusturica uses are this time too familiar for us and we cannot avoid the impression of the repetition of the same gags and expressions that we have seen in his previous films. This dj vu becomes impressed in our minds since the beginning just after the magnificent aperture of the movie. A dj vu which allows us to anticipate the gestures of the each character. In addition the carnaval does not allow to catch the important political assumption of this movie which is that that war was a war instigated by all illegal dealers on both sides to preserve and increase their traffics and that first of all the fights happened within each camp to eliminate those who were promoting a fair and decent life see the murder of the Serbian mayor by his Serbian deputy. This political assumption is one of the strongest elements of the movie but is Kusturica's carnaval reinforcing or diluting this powerful message?I believe that Kusturica is now come to a real crossroad either he continues to follow his colorful and sometimes grotesque representation of the Balkan soul and in this way simply repeating himself or is he addressing new territories with different instruments. This movie represents some old and some new for him this is its strength and its weakness. I hope to see Kusturica taking the challenge and using his immense creativity to enter into a new dimension.".

After a soccer game Milos expects to be invited to play in the Partisan' team but is calledup to the army. Luka can not believe that a war is beginning in his country and forces his son to join the army. Meanwhile after Milos' farewell party Jadranka leaves Luka traveling away with a musician. When the war reaches the area where Luka lives Milos is captured alive by the enemy. Later the Muslin nurse Sabaha Natasa Solak is abducted by the Bosnian soldiers and the lieutenant asks the lonely Luka to host her as prisoner because they would try to exchange Milos for Sabaha who belonged to a wealthy family. As the days go by Luka and Sabaha fall in love for each other until the day that Jadranka returns and the trade of Milos per Sabaha is accepted.The beginning of Zivot je Cudo is surrealistic and funny and annoying at the same time. The character Jadranka Djuric is one of the most bothersome I have ever seen and the weird situations made me believe that this movie would be a boring comedy. However after the departure of Milos and Jadranka the story becomes very attractive and when Sabaha appears the astral of the story changes to a magnificent and dramatic romance. The gorgeous actress Natasa Solak is unknown in Brazil at least for me but I loved her performance and her beautiful character. Further I was cheering for a happy and commercial ending and I also appreciated the conclusion with Luka and Sabaha leaving together the blackness of the tunnel metaphorically representing the life of Luka after Sabaha's departure to her country. Another plus in this romance is that it does not focus the cruelties of this bloody war. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Vida  um Milagre The Life is a Miracle".

The love interest Natasa Solak really is gorgeous and it is a tad improbable that she'd fall so much in love with Slavko Stimac but this is a minor beef because it's equally improbable that Stimac and Solak would survive the scene at the Drina or that love really WOULD find a way against the odds in the final scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "But a good one anyway. Director Kusturica has already accustomed us with his caricatural way of telling stories occurring in several parts of former Yugoslavia presenting their characters as burlesque. He doesn't ridicule them however. In fact he shows love and even some tenderness for them. He simply doesn't take life seriously and plays in a first class way with war ethnic conflict love and so on. But sentiment and emotion are not altogether absent of this movie. Behind the humorous scenes we can feel the depth of love that arises between the Serbian railway engineer and his supposed prisoner Muslim girl that he intends to exchange for his son who was captured by the Bosnian army during the Bosnian war of 1992. Some of the love scenes are full of humour but also of poetry and even fantasy like when their bed flies over the fields of Bosnia in some kind of dream. The first part of the movie is a quick succession of funny incidents and accidents. When the love story begins in the second part its pace is a bit more calm without losing completely its rapid rhythm. It's a movie that puts you on a happy frame of mind and don't forget the important role of the shedonkey which will make you laugh at several scenes. In the end the animal performs even an important part in the issue of the story that without its intervention would probably have a sad outcome.".

	schema:reviewBody "With pain sorrow and joy we shall remember our country as we tell our children stories that start like fairytales. Once upon a time there was a country...'These lines closed the curtain on Underground Kusturica's most achieved movie about an 'unachieved' history. Indeed close isn't even an appropriate verb to use since the story had no end whatsoever. But it was a bittersweet way to insist on Yugoslavia not being dead because it stopped belonging to current maps. The country as a memory rather than a flag would live as long as there would be great stories and that doesn't go without great storytellers.So I open this review with the following statement Emir Kusturica is certainly the most important Balkans' figure after Tito and it's only because of the former's historical aura. I don't think any other politician athlete artist celebrity no matter how preeminent and successful they were would leave as an indelible mark in the legacy of this fascinating and tragedystricken land as Kusturica did counterbalancing all the negativity brought by the news and the images conveyed by NATO or UN representatives.Many of us have grown indeed with the images of the Balkans as a doomed placed with soldiers refugees barricades burnings houses. I came to age in the early 90's and along with Israel and Palestine Bosnia Serbia and Croatia were 'routine' news as far back as I can remember. But as if Kusturica was aware of that reducing clich he gratifies us with a small but significant scene that sums up the way the proud Oriental feels about the Occidental vision. Luka the film's protagonist played by Slavco Stimac an engineer working in a railway station in the Serbian mountains is tired of hearing the same CNNlike news every day about the conflict so he throws the TV on the railway the news go on so he must resort to shooting the screen. Maybe engrossed by blind patriotism Luka was oblivious to the inevitability of war his mind focused on his son Milos a wannabe football player dreaming to join the Belgrade team and to a lesser degree his mentally unstable wife Jadranka graced with the kind of voice that shouldn't get too close to someone who wears glasses. Not totally optimistic Luka didn't overestimate people he overestimated the country. Stimac had played the nave brother with a stammer in Underground and who discovered with shock as an old man that Yugoslavia ceased to exist. So the film works like a chronological continuation to Underground but with a Kusturica who took some time to digest the war's aftermath and the illreception of his Golden Palm winner. It took Kusturica almost ten years to get back to the war. Meanwhile he concocted a zany comedy Black Cat White Cat like an elixir to expire all the demons that could have poisoned his inspiration. And while I expected more drama in Life is a Miracle I was glad to find myself in familiar territories again with colorful characters enjoying life and ignoring war even when it strikes them in the face. And I mean that literally. In fact all the people in the film have one thing in common they don't care about war a man is worried for his son's future his operasinging wife flirts with his coach for the same reason the son isn't too eager to play with guns and seeing how the soldiers handle bazookas you wouldn't blame him. Even war profiteers only care for coke and human traffic. Life is a miracle is set in a sort of twilight zone of surreal fantasy or a tragic circus  la Kusturica.. And like Barnum Kusturica knows how to use animals as fully developed characters in his movies it's the death of a turkey that seals the hero's comingofage start in Time of the Gypsies it's animal panic in the zoo that announce the German bombings and the scene with the bears in Miracle echoes the incongruous elephant wandering on the street in Underground or the use of the black and the white cat as wedding witnesses. Animals are integral to the story and it's by seeing a chicken laying eggs that Luka's jovial friend says life is a miracle his encounter with the bears will play like a darker omen. In another scene Jadranka is chatting on a phone a cat and a dog fight for a pigeon they have their priorities straight as if they were one step ahead of humans. And this is where the mule plays as a magnificent Chekov's gun the animal blocks the railway standing there with tears seemingly dropping from the eyes. According to his master the mule's sad because the sweetheart won't come back. There's something fascinating in the way the animal foreshadows the coming romance and even its conclusion... because beyond everything the film like all other Kusturica's films it's a romance. Not any romance but one  la Romeo and Juliet between Luka the Serbian and Sabaha Natasa Tapuskovic the Bosnian hostage kept in his house to be exchanged with his son taken as a war prisoner. Sabana becomes a light of hope for Luka and naturally they get closer and closer. There comes a point where life finds a way. Life is a miracle indeed. And the film is another occasion for dazzling and poetic imagery with the two couple literally flying over the land belonging to no country anymore simply to each other as if the bond of hearts can transcend any frontier. We knew that already after venturing in the realms of Emir's imagination a world where marriages were the occasion for crazy celebrations where glasses are broken and truths spoken movies where even death couldn't conceal that lust for life and made the party end whatever happened.Whether it reflects a truth of the exYugoslavian people or a fantasy in Emir's mind the show had to go on... the Barnum way the Shakespeare way... or the Fellini way.".

And to make it powerful in the end there's the whole dramatic separated lovers story.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie on 14 May in France. I was really excited before the movie. I was just waiting for a fantastic Kustrica Movie! Unfortunantly it was not a good movie. And also I hate the movie!!! Why? Because it wasn't a fantastic movie trial and also a political propaganda! I watched this movie with my French friends. When we left the cinema they started to talk about Serbian Public. They thought that the Bosnian people made lots of bad thing to Serbians. Because in the movie it is clearly shown that the war between Serbian and Bosnians was started by the Bosnian Public!!! This is not true! Actually Kustrica couldn't mention the war... or if he really wants to mention so he could be realistic! He must think that why the Serbian President is in the court now??? Why there are no Bosnian people in the court?? The answer is so easy but anyway with the movie he wanted to change the idea in the people's mind. So by the way people who have no idea about that war could think that Bosnian people are the ones who started and behaved in a bad way. Or he showed the Muslim public Bosnian different than the real! As a conclusion this movie is not about Love not about people have fantastic life it is just about the Propaganda of the Serbian Public..So poor Kustrica..

And also I hate the movie!!! Why? Because it wasn't a fantastic movie trial and also a political propaganda! I watched this movie with my French friends. When we left the cinema they started to talk about Serbian Public. They thought that the Bosnian people made lots of bad thing to Serbians. Because in the movie it is clearly shown that the war between Serbian and Bosnians was started by the Bosnian Public!!! This is not true! Actually Kustrica couldn't mention the war... or if he really wants to mention so he could be realistic! He must think that why the Serbian President is in the court now???

The credits began and Jaya Bachchan could be heard individually pronouncing each name the cast the team behind the movie and slowly by the time she reached Writer and Director you wished her to stop. And then in a magical tone she says Paa! laughing along and a soothing tone fills your ear and heart... and you know yes this is going to be a good show.Paa has its moments that touch you that move you that make you laugh that make you feel warm that make you happy... etc etc. There are moments that are supposed to make you cry... but they don't. I guess that's where Paa fails. Amitabh Bachchan in the lead role delivers a sweet performance and Abhishek is seen trying very hard to fit in. Vidya sort of stumbles out of her Vidya character. The music of the movie is simple. The end credits song sung by Amitabh Bachchan was one amazing track. Even Hitchki was nice. The direction and flow was simple though the cuts between Auro's waiting and Amol's political moves were rather jerky. The cinematography was simple and fulfilling though the editing required spicing up.In the end definitely go watch Paa. I was disappointed to find only 15 had come for the first day first show... me being one. It's films like these that should be more prevalent. In contrast if Kambakkht Ishq was a HIT then in that case this should be a BLOCKBUSTER. Sadly I know that will not be the case.710.".

We do not know this kid although it is possible that he impresses us all after we see him perform. But does this essentially guarantee a bumper opening for the movie? Can we safely assume that the audience will come into the theatres? Now take this. The entire cast and crew remains the same. And although it is indeed possible to find an immensely talented child artist and create the desired character using prosthetic makeup and voice modulation the director decides to cast Amitabh Bachchan as the child. And he calls the film Paa. The result is for us to see in the form of one of the most smartly promoted films of our time. This is what we call star power. This is what I admire about the phenomenon of a superstar. And this is what this film uses in the best possible way.The film also uses the personality and not the acting of Abhishek Bachchan to create a gennext politician and we connect. It uses Vidya Balan to portray a strong independent modern Indian woman and most importantly  a mother and we connect. And it utilizes the human curiosity for the weird our tendency to look at 'freaks' with wide eyes and held breaths and converts that 'freak' into a warm lovable and memorable character called Auro and takes us into his world. It uses songs melodrama and the Bollywood clich to tell a story. It relies on the timetested formula of emotional manipulation and succeeds in making the audience cry. It has decent production values is marketed smartly and sold at cheap rates. The result is not a great timeless flawless piece of art. The result is a film that knows how to use the illusion of the medium. The result is a movie that moves.The best thing about Paa is that it knows what it is doing. It does not claim to be 'socially relevant' and does not ask us to leave our brains home before coming to the theatres. Instead it asks us to bring our brains our hearts our entire selves not excluding the 'curiosity for the weird' that we all have but fail to accept. It treats itself as a film for everyone and successfully creates an entertaining cinema experience. In its attempt it often gets inconsistent but it never seems uncertain. It is an innovation and yes that it is which is sure of itself including how to sell itself. It is an innovation that does not go wasted and that is indeed an achievement in the Hindi film scenario of today.It has been a few decades now and Hindi cinema is desperately in the need for revival. For that to happen if it ever happens we need socially relevant cinema we need cinema as works of art we even need cinema with an international appeal and with the guts to experiment . But what we need most is innovative ideas true to Hindi cinema sensibility and tradition not necessarily great in the absolute cinemasense but films which make people come watch and connect. We need more films like Paa. I have no idea about how it is going to fare at the boxoffice. If it is a commercial success my point would be proved beyond doubt. If it fails well I will try my best not to lose hope.".

	schema:reviewBody "R Balki directs 'Paa' a film I was very interested to watch. At first the promos did not impress me and I expected to see a pretentious film at best but the positive reviews and several recommendations made me finally catch this one. The film was a pleasant surprise nice and simple but somehow I still expected something else. R Balki did a very good job in terms of both writing and direction. The film's story is wellwritten and told the execution is steady and the dialogues are witty and light. But at some point I did feel that something was missing there. Don't know what. Maybe something in the portrayal of Auro's relationship with his mother could have been better done though I liked how Balki portrayed his friendship with school kids particularly a boy named Vishnu.Bachchan's casting in the role of Auro which created a lot of buzz and curiosity prerelease was brave and bold but frankly speaking it would have been more interesting to see a child actor playing Auro. I say that while considering the many young talents in the industry who could have easily been suitable for the part. Bachchan is somewhat overly tall for the role and since all of us know Auro is played by the great Amitabh Bachchan it reduces the level of credibility in the film's authenticity and many may feel it was made to showcase his greatness and to evoke such reactions as wow! He plays his son's son!But Bachchan does not disappoint. He manages to make Auro a likable character with his undertoned line delivery expressive eyes and simplicity. A lesser actor of his age could have played the role in an overly childish manner with exaggerated mannerisms and noticeable attempts to overdo and emphasise the character's young age and disease symptoms. But not Bachchan. Hardly recognisable under this heavy mask of makeup he naturally transforms into a little intelligent kid of our times and is thoroughly convincing.Abhishek Bachchan playing his reallife father's father is strictly okay in a role that is not very deep or demanding but still contributes to the film significantly. Vidya Balan is excellent as Vidya the caring and loving mother who is also an assertive and independent career woman. Balan acts with grace and restraint and she is natural and compelling throughout. And she is absolutely stunning in her traditional Indian looks. Arudhati Nag is fine and effective as Vidya's supportive mother. The child who plays Auro's best friend Vishnu is simply adorable. I particularly liked a scene in which Auro and Vishnu have a phone conversation and Vishnu sharply criticises his father. That was hilarious!Coming to the music Ilayaraja composes a lovely classical and joyful soundtrack for the film which gives it a very light and feelgood mood. The editing and the cinematography are welldone. Towards the end 'Paa' is a bit emotional. It neither made me shiver nor tear but it still was efficient and moving. I recommend you to watch 'Paa' with family or friends. Do not plan to either hate or love it. If you watch the film trying to ignore this wow factor you will definitely enjoy it and will probably be able to appreciate Balki's efforts to make a lightly dramatic episode about one young boy and his relationships rather than a socially educative film on progeria. Just enjoy this witty interesting and refreshing piece.".

	schema:headline " You got to see this cinematic excellence.";
	schema:reviewBody "Paa evidently proves that Bollywood has still not lost it all and we still have filmmakers who can deliver movies at par with the other parts of the world. Yes the storyidea may have been borrowed from Francis Ford Coppola's Jack and the makeup may remind you of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. But at the same time it's also true that Paa has nothing else related to these two names. Paa certainly belongs to its director R. Balki and the phenomenon called Amitabh Bachchan. Just when everybody thought that this man has done it all he comes up with an extraordinary and out of the world character named Auro. What's even more astonishing in his portrayal is that you never find the real Amitabh Bachchan anywhere on the screen in those two hours. In the entire past comprising all his mammoth blockbusters Amitabh has always been there as a Bollywood persona hidden in his on screen characters. But here is a movie where you know that there is Amitabh featuring in it but you still can never feel him on the celluloid. He simply adopts a completely different soul minus his world famous style and baritone voice structure. And that's the magical spell cast by the magician actor. Truly speaking Amitabh literally sends every reviewer in search of new words to praise his impeccable and incomparable act of 'Auro' in Paa.Right from the first scene introducing Auro in his school function the veteran actor makes you believe what you are seeing. He humbly forces every viewer in the theater to admit that he is watching the most accomplished actor of all times who has just walked beyond any number games and Bollywood Titles. Especially in the scenes where he is interacting with his kid friends in their own school lingo and in the emotional climax sequence inside the hospital Auro goes on to set new benchmarks for the entire Indian Film Industry. Though the script has some unnecessary references of political activities and slums which could have been easily avoided but the spotless performances of the entire cast don't let you ponder over these needless insertions and the movie goes on impressing you continuously.Unexpectedly Amitabh is not the only one to watch out in the movie. He is superbly supported by three highly talented people in the cast lead by Vidya Balan as a tough mother who raises Auro on her own with the help of her mother. For Vidya's effortless performance I would only like to say that in all these years of movie watching she is the only female actress who reminded me of Jaya Bhaduri Bachchan and her flawless natural acting.To feel what I am trying to say just carefully watch the scene where Vidya gives Auro her approval to visit Delhi. She exactly acts like Jaya in that particular scene.Abhishek Bachchan as the truthful politician and father of 'Auro' delivers another polished act on the lines of his Guru and Yuva. He comes up with a very controlled emotional performance and never tries to outshine any other person in the scene. Both Vidya and Abhishek share a very cozy chemistry on screen which actually helps a lot in enhancing the overall impact of 'Auro' on the viewers.The third worth mentioning act comes from Arundhati Naag who plays Vidya's mother and Auro's naani whom he fondly calls as Bums. Her praise worthy act emerges as a strong pillar in addition to the other stalwarts present in the movie. Paresh Rawal again remembers his immense talent after few irresponsible acts in some brainless movies. Last but not the least come all the child artists in the movie who are intelligent enough to understand the pain and suffering of their friend Auro and try to help him out wherever they can. It was really nice to see that 'Auro' was not being teased in his school as suggested by the promos. In fact it was very thoughtful to show all the kids having the empathy to feel the abnormality 'Auro' was born with.Musically the film has the maestro Illayaraja to give exactly what was needed as per the subject. His theme music is pleasant and his songs don't act as a hindrance in the narration. R. Balki very skillfully uses the songs in their short versions and in the background wherever needed. Dialogues are intelligent witty and well written. Cinematography by P.C. Sreeram is remarkable. He brilliantly uses innovative camera angles to portray the character of Auro and his abnormal body structure. But what makes Paa so believable is the unimaginable makeup done by Christien Tinsley and Domini Till. Kudos to the duo to achieve this herculean task and hats off to Amitabh Bachchan for undergoing such a painful process in this age.Honestly the main highlight of the movie is that even when the story revolves around a diseased character with an abnormal behavior the director is simply not interested in taking you onto an emotional journey at all. So Paa is not just another tear jerker as expected by many. On the contrary it's a very enjoyable movie having many light entertaining moments with 'Auro' for everyone in the family. And for that the director R. Balki rightly deserves all the praises.In short the movie is an amazing must watch experience for everyone still enjoying the gift of life at any age. It makes you realize the importance of all your days left in the count. And on the top it has a performance which can easily be kept along with any world class act by any actor in the entire globe. In other words only one statement can match the unbelievably expressive and impressive act of Amitabh Bachchan in the movie.He once again proves that at present he is the only Big Paa for the entire Indian film Industry.".

Though the script has some unnecessary references of political activities and slums which could have been easily avoided but the spotless performances of the entire cast don't let you ponder over these needless insertions and the movie goes on impressing you continuously.Unexpectedly Amitabh is not the only one to watch out in the movie. He is superbly supported by three highly talented people in the cast lead by Vidya Balan as a tough mother who raises Auro on her own with the help of her mother. For Vidya's effortless performance I would only like to say that in all these years of movie watching she is the only female actress who reminded me of Jaya Bhaduri Bachchan and her flawless natural acting.To feel what I am trying to say just carefully watch the scene where Vidya gives Auro her approval to visit Delhi. She exactly acts like Jaya in that particular scene.Abhishek Bachchan as the truthful politician and father of 'Auro' delivers another polished act on the lines of his Guru and Yuva. He comes up with a very controlled emotional performance and never tries to outshine any other person in the scene. Both Vidya and Abhishek share a very cozy chemistry on screen which actually helps a lot in enhancing the overall impact of 'Auro' on the viewers.The third worth mentioning act comes from Arundhati Naag who plays Vidya's mother and Auro's naani whom he fondly calls as Bums. Her praise worthy act emerges as a strong pillar in addition to the other stalwarts present in the movie. Paresh Rawal again remembers his immense talent after few irresponsible acts in some brainless movies. Last but not the least come all the child artists in the movie who are intelligent enough to understand the pain and suffering of their friend Auro and try to help him out wherever they can. It was really nice to see that 'Auro' was not being teased in his school as suggested by the promos. In fact it was very thoughtful to show all the kids having the empathy to feel the abnormality 'Auro' was born with.Musically the film has the maestro Illayaraja to give exactly what was needed as per the subject. His theme music is pleasant and his songs don't act as a hindrance in the narration. R. Balki very skillfully uses the songs in their short versions and in the background wherever needed. Dialogues are intelligent witty and well written. Cinematography by P.C. Sreeram is remarkable. He brilliantly uses innovative camera angles to portray the character of Auro and his abnormal body structure. But what makes Paa so believable is the unimaginable makeup done by Christien Tinsley and Domini Till. Kudos to the duo to achieve this herculean task and hats off to Amitabh Bachchan for undergoing such a painful process in this age.Honestly the main highlight of the movie is that even when the story revolves around a diseased character with an abnormal behavior the director is simply not interested in taking you onto an emotional journey at all. So Paa is not just another tear jerker as expected by many. On the contrary it's a very enjoyable movie having many light entertaining moments with 'Auro' for everyone in the family. And for that the director R. Balki rightly deserves all the praises.In short the movie is an amazing must watch experience for everyone still enjoying the gift of life at any age. It makes you realize the importance of all your days left in the count. And on the top it has a performance which can easily be kept along with any world class act by any actor in the entire globe. In other words only one statement can match the unbelievably expressive and impressive act of Amitabh Bachchan in the movie.He once again proves that at present he is the only Big Paa for the entire Indian film Industry.";

	schema:reviewBody "Amithabh Bachchan is flawless acting in Paa. But why make him look like extra terrestrial. There was a point in the movie where there were explaining the disease that his character is suffering  Progeria. In the movie itself when the doctor is explaining none of the images depicted them as abnormal heads. The children just looked old why does fiction take undue advantage of medical science.Sr. Bachchan who plays the character called Auro I would not be surprised if we have dolls being sold in Shoppers Stop Big Bazaar very soon. But one thing for sure whenever Auro is in front of the screen he just lightens up the moment.This movie it seems like Bachchan Sr. is passing the baton to Bachchan Jr. It is high time he does that. There is no competition amongst each other but then there are a only a very few movies of AB Baby that are actually good. Naach Guru Sarkar Sarkar Raaj and now this. Abhishek Bachchan is good political MP no this is not an oxymoron it is the character. To that extent that you can actually see his voter's mark on his middle finger in the movie.Simple Story. The 121314 year old child suffers from Progeria and the disease brings the parent together. Three different occasions when the age of Auro has been mentioned differently by different characters. One sincere request stop comparing the movie to Benjamin Button it is not! It was actually Robin Williams who was suffering the same disease in the movie Jack. It is not actually the original concept. The execution there are just too many cuts that too very fast ones. The cuts becomes irritating towards the end. Reference to Jack on IMDb Songs are well intertwined and the lyrics bring an amazing soothing effect to the whole scene last time this feeling seeped into the heart mind body and soul during Taare Zameen Par. Hichki Hichki and Mere Paa is simple and nice and my favourites.The movie has its moments but it just doesn't make you cry. The performance reminds you of Amitabh Bachchan in Black but then that it was different that was acting. In Black when he was smiling you were laughing when he was upset everyone in the theatre had tears in their eyes. Here he just falls a little short of the getting the audience moved.The other characters that needs mention is bum grandmother to Auro played by Arundhati Nag theatre personality wife of Anant Nag. She was simply level headed strong character. She was when faced with moral questions she would be you take a stand and you will have my support  that was brilliant. At the same time the relationship between Paresh Rawal Dad to Amol Atre and Abhishek Bachchan does not come out that impactful. But individually there were sound.Google being subtly being endorsed by Auro. Tweet Public Relations angle to the story creative people need to stop treating like media as you can buy them. It isn't like this always please do not underestimate the media as your pawn. The movie does bring out the current affairs element in the movie through redevelopment issues and media being used to create a hype on this.In short it is a complete worth it paisa wasool movie for Amithabh Bachchan. I would like to highlight even though Auro is cute it is not for the kid viewing at the same time.".

Period.The tale of a lovestruck couple's careless encounter a man's ambitious plan for his life against a woman's sacrifice while raising her child with a supportive mother leads us to a prodigal son 'Auro' . While Auro's rare and incurable disability of 'Progeria' seems like a tragic foundation for a story whose characters are enacted by Abhishek Bachchan Vidya Balan and Amitabh Bachchan R. Balki's writing and direction walks the sword's edge of realism to give us a funny entertaining witty  heartwarming and endearing film. PAA is enriched with subtlety reality simplicity and stuff that comes straight from the heart. The last quality is especially depicted on screen through the sincere performances by Vidya Balan Abhishek Bachchan Paresh Rawal and Arundhati Nag. However there is no superlative adjective in the dictionary for what Amitabh Bachchan has done and achieved in this film. It would suffice to say that even after reading such praise about his performance you would still be unnervingly surprised after you watch him. To enact a child is one thing but to enact him when he has a genetic disorder that makes him 4 times older than he actually is.... now that's 'performace'. Without the use of ultramodern technology R. Balki with the aid of some outstanding talent in makeup sound recording cinematography music Illayaraja screenplay and that of his own writing and directing skills has generated a marvel that without a doubt sets his work at par with Hrishikesh Mukherjee's 'Anand' . Amol Atre is now an MP who is out to change the image of politics while working more 'for the people'. His political ideology is what we would really hope to see in real politicians. Although one may accuse Balki of overindulgence in the entire slumrehabilitation campaign of Amol's to digress from more fun moments of Auro's life it still remains under control because it does not lead to boredom. Although it may have been a better fit for the 'Sarkar' movies. Vidya's journey through being an ambitious young student to a mature and composed unwed mother is depicted with surprising ease. Her portrayal of the loving and understanding mother who has accepted the reality of progeria's tragic curse is wonderful. Here is one actress who has proved yet again that she can play characters far better than those who play 'roles'. Although Paresh Rawal and Arundhati Nag have a limited role they portray their characters immaculately. Watch them closely when their characters have to play awkward parts. Grandmom playing a video game and Paresh Rawal convincing Auro that his time isn't up yet for him. Among the more brilliant bits of the film are in school. The presence of a child suffering from Progeria who displays all traits of a normal child his age is so naturally convincing that it looks too smooth. Auro's friends are understanding yet playful and comfortable in the presence of this witty lad. Watch out for Auro's telephone conversation with his buddy Vishnu the most hilarious scene of the year! Also the explanation on the necessity of Algebra in Mathematics..... It is only after you reach home from the theater that you realize that the funniest scenes of the year which were rendered by a kid were actually by Amitabh Bachchan. Moments shared by Amol and Auro are funny witty and nonconfrontational while the beauty of the film lies in the moments shared between Auro and Vidya. It's only when all three are together in the hospital that the film turns into a quintessential bollywood melodrama but far from the drag of 'Kal Ho Na Ho'. Balki uses music only in the background without disrupting the story's progress and Illayaraja delivers a fine theme for the movie that is lively. With witty humour and a subtle message just like in 'Anand' PAA reminds us to live your life to the fullest no matter what you have at your disposal. It is an enriching experience that is heartwarming and with an endearing rendition of Big B's little 'Auro'.9.05 on a scale of 110.".

	schema:reviewBody "For anyone who has seen the movie  loved it stop reading the review now. I'm glad u liked this film  I wish u many such cinematic marvels in the future.My review is for those who are considering venturing out to the theatre like I didwith their parents no less coz haven't we all heard such good things about this film? I meanit has Big B  most of his family awesome? makeup  a story that'll make u laughcry  bring your families close.Hah!Come one come alltoday's lesson is called 'Magic Of Marketing' or 'Howtosellcrap to unsuspecting fools'To start It seems no popular film reviewer wanted to be in the bad books of Bachan family so an avg rating of 2.54 out of 5 has been doled out but let me stick my neck out  say it with absolute candor Paa is pathetic.Gasp How could I say such a thing?Well for starters this movie completely failed to 'entertain' me. It was one big yawn from start to finish which was made worse by a sorry script poor direction and a lead actor who does nothing but wear heavy makeup  tries to act like a 12yr. old while mouthing dialogues that make u want to slap him across the face.

I'm glad u liked this film  I wish u many such cinematic marvels in the future.My review is for those who are considering venturing out to the theatre like I didwith their parents no less coz haven't we all heard such good things about this film? I meanit has Big B  most of his family awesome? makeup  a story that'll make u laughcry  bring your families close.Hah!Come one come alltoday's lesson is called 'Magic Of Marketing' or 'Howtosellcrap to unsuspecting fools'To start It seems no popular film reviewer wanted to be in the bad books of Bachan family so an avg rating of 2.54 out of 5 has been doled out but let me stick my neck out  say it with absolute candor Paa is pathetic.Gasp How could I say such a thing?Well for starters this movie completely failed to 'entertain' me. It was one big yawn from start to finish which was made worse by a sorry script poor direction and a lead actor who does nothing but wear heavy makeup  tries to act like a 12yr. old while mouthing dialogues that make u want to slap him across the face.

	schema:reviewBody "1. Poor Poor Script. I couldn't find the theme the concept behind the story. I felt as if a story is made fit to showcase the greatness of the actors.2. Unnecessary subplots. The story drifts from the actual subject so much that I got confused what the director wanted to show. In a movie dealing with progeria and fatherson relationship why spend 30 minutes or more showing the mediapolitician imbroglio. What makes 'Taare Zameen Par' a better movie of that genre is that not a single moment in the movie drifts away from the main subject.3. Missing the meaning of tagline's worth. There was no fatherson relationship that was highlighted. Hence 'fatherson sonfather' thingy was just a marketing gimmick.4. Songs. Not the music or melody of them but where they are placed. Especially the 'Hichiki' song was put at a point where I least expected it.5. The very reason why the movie was made. In an interview R Balki the director of the movie had boasted that when he was in the office of Amitabh Bachchan one day he saw the banter between Abhishek and his father as the role reversal. And hence he wanted to cast the real fatherson duo as reel sonfather. When he heard about the disease Progeria he shouted 'Eureka'. In my opinion it is a very poor way to conceive a movie. May be that is the reason for the poor script.You might argue this as one of the best performances of Amitabh. Of course he acts well that's why he is so great and I am one of his biggest fans. But one thing we must not forget that it is not that great actors make great movies. It is the great movies that make the actors great.Originally posted at weirdoonmovies.blogspot.com".

Abishek plays the father and Amitabh plays the son. At first sight everything seems to be very interesting. In Bollywood it's a hype to make a movie about topics that are generally avoided.So what can go wrong about this movie? Everything! The movie is so boring. Amitabh Bachchan gives his most boring performance ever. His voice and the way he talks are very annoying. His stupid monkey dance was totally unnecessary.The story was worked out very bad. Was this a kids movie with Amitabh doing the stupid monkey dance or was this a mature movie with all the political ideas that kids would not understand? I think this movie is more for teenagers who are with one foot in their youth and one foot in their adulthood.Then there was this line a lady sang during the movie. Something with Ittefaq or whatsoever. What was this annoying! The same line was repeated again and again and again... and again... And if that was not the worst suddenly a man came up singing the same line! At the beginning of the movie you know Auro is going to die and that it will be a Bollywood tear jerker. So the end is not a surprise. A little girl comes at Auro's bed and talks to him. After the talking there is a beautiful moment between Auro and his mother watching Auro's father. This was excellent done! But that moment got disturbed by the little girl whose clumsiness wakes you out of your dream.Was the movie in overall bad? Yes. But there were some good stuff about this movie too. Vidya Balan is a very beautiful woman who shows that women can be independent. The bodyguard in the train who tried to do the stupid monkey dance acted very naturally.What I did not understand is that the movie starts not with Auro but his parents meeting each other. The movie sure ends with Auro. Why? What happens with Amol and Vidya? What happens with Amol's career?".

Mr. B I respectfully submit its time for you to retire your acting was the pits and overshadowed the decent attempts made by Vidya Balan who at least came across as realistic and authentic. Will Indian directors stop being pedantic to the narcissism and nepotism that rules bollywood.

If this movie was any effort to mimic the extremely tasteful and artistic and profoundly rendered work of Taarey Zameen Par thank you Aamir Khan for bringing back taste to bollywood cinema then this venture failed miserably. The story line was stretched over unnecessary scenes and got lost in the antics of the poorly depicted supposed 13year old with pregoria. The monkey theme and suit and subsequent gestures were repeated so many times I wanted to scream. Amitabh Bachan was neither convincing nor real in the kid's role and I wish insight and discrimination had taken over in a feeble attempt at trying to be a character in this movie. The movie was predictable from the second scene. As soon as I saw Ms. Bachan Jaya Bhaduripainfully recounting through the credits I wanted her to STOP so badly by the second one I could see who was pulling power and purse strings all the way around. It was clear that amateurs were pulled in to produce and direct and shoot this movie. The camera work was choppy and all over the place. The feeble angle and distance shots trying to render Amitabh as a 13 year old among his student peers or mother was pathetic. Vidya and her mother Bum were solid performances and realistic. The themes of pregnancy outside of marriage singlemother raising a disabledprodigiouslimited life child was the only thing applaudable. All other efforts failed miserably. The tragic scenes were just overstretched and unnecessary. The movie goes on unceremoniously forever. Abhishek Bachan playing the newstyle politician pulls so many oneoff bravado cowboy like moves in his artful campaign as a trueto the wire corrupt but the end justifies the means politician to raise awareness among the masses it started to border on the ridiculous. He got so much TV Time without advertisements to pander to the massesreally? The only redeeming quality was the prosthetic work and makeup even though the rest of the body didn't quite match the head work for the supposed kid role played by the 70 year old Amitabh Bachan. Where was the director's vision in this movie. The simple story line could have succeeded with a goal and much needed brevity. The last line from the inevitable hospital scene was coming and I could scream again for the boring predictability of it all. Overall D for effort and B for makeup and B t Vidya Balan and her mother's character. The overall work was pathetic and not recommended. What a waste of money. And Anil Ambani of Reliance industries contributed to this venture. I'm surprised that his business skills couldn't see this sleeper coming a mileoff. Please support the noncommercial ventures there are multiple talents writers creative directors and others in India and they don't all pander to the Bachan family to succeed in the movie industry.".

His character seems to be inspired by new breed of politicians including Rahul Gandhi.  Vidya Balan would not need a divine realisation that she should stop experimenting with her costumes and roles.

Paresh Rawal for some reason get a raw deal with R Balki. There was absolutely no valueaddition of his character in the movie. I wouldn't be surprised if his fanbase cry foul. The good thing in Paa is that smart copywriter lines predominant in Cheeni Kum have been pushed under the carpet. Traces like Bum can be safely ignored it was Sexy in CK!Integrating the political track to the main storyline was as diverse as chalk and cheese. Not just hiccoughs but they were more like speed bumps. R Balki's usual P C Sreeram is back to take charge of DOP department and needless to say he doesn't falter a bit Cambridge looks mesmerising. As usual there are no words to describe Ilayaraja composition. Swanand Kirkire demonstrates his authority of playing with words in Udi Udi song has a tinge of Harivanshrai Bachchan and Amit Khanna in it.

If Baby Pinky stole the hearts of millions in the 80's with Ek Hi Bhool it was Makrand Deshpande who did the same in 90's with his heartwarming performance in Mahesh Bhatt's Kaash.

Editing is precise except for a couple of sequences both are related to politics where it seemed that the director is enforcing his idea of 'cool' politician.Now the acting is one thing that has to be surely appreciated by almost all who have acted except one that's Abhishek Bachchan I request him to learn acting or do it or just get off the screen and give screen space to better actors. The acting of Vidya Balan is top notch but the real stealer is Amitabh agreed that the makeup voice teeth eyes were deliberate attempts to make him look like a progeria affected child but the performance delivered is one that is surely world class. Full marks to Amitabh for bringing the actor from within and becoming a child at 68 years of his life and giving a wonderful treat of performance.The characterization was simple but some incidents were surely stretched out. Father is a politician who denies becoming a father as he seeks his personal aspirations over becoming a father its fine. Mom is gynecologist is also fine. Son is a progeria affected child. Now these are characters existing in reality But the point is how father meets the child and learns the truth and how he is united with his lost love. Simple but the meeting was a deliberate and amateurish attempt to begin such a story nevertheless it had to start at some point and so it did and once the protagonist was introduced the entire thing was an engaging watch full of humor it's not cynical or sarcastic but plain and dry that's the stand out selling point. One dialogue in which the kid is asked 'What does your mom and do? to which he replies Bas bachhe paida karte hai is worth the money.Despite the evident flaws in the movie it is worth a watch just for it's simplicity and no nonsense method. Director Balki I wish sticks to such stuff and keeps churning these kind of movies more and kudos for trying this in an earnest way. Highly recommended  45.".

	schema:headline " Perhaps the best noir ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "I hate formal film evaluation lists that ostentatiously rate the relative value of certain films such as Citizen Kane for example.  I do think Citizen Kane is a great film.  But I also think that about fifteen or twenty other films I could quickly name are every bit as good as Kane in their own way. Almost any Richard Gere movie for example.  Just kidding.This brings me to D.O.A. directed by Rudolf Mat.  D.O.A. in my book is the Citizen Kane of the noirs. It's so good that I often wonder about how it got made in the first place.  Since many of the people who were involved in its production are now no longer with us I may never learn anything about its origins.  That's a frustration of course but the more important thing is that I can recognize a great noir when I see it.Why you ask is D.O.A. a great noir?  The most obvious reason is its plot. A guy goes out for a night on the town and someone a total stranger slips him a mickey in a bara lethal mickey.  But it doesn't kill him instantly. It kills him slowly so slowly that he's given the chance to find out who did this terrible thing to him and why.Second the film is exceptionally well made in every other respect.  Okay the Pamela Britton character is one dimensional and embarrassing we all agree on that but who really cares when everything else in the film is so good?  Edmond O'Brien had one of the best roles of his career in D.O.A. and he took full advantage though few critics give his performance much credit for the film's success.O'Brien a classically trained actor plays a smalltime Southern California businessman living his ordinary little life minding his own business regularly boffing his secretary this was implied rather than made explicit after all this was 1949 and avoiding her whiney entreaties that they tie the knot as he's been promising her he would do for ever so long.You can't help liking O'Brien in part precisely because of his human flaws. He's basically decent but harassed overworked and stretched to the limit by the pressure put on him by Britton.  What adult male couldn't identify with this man or at least sympathize?  His very insignificance as one more human ant on the planet Earth and the terrible thing that's about to happen to him are the essence of great film noir. Detour although by no means a favorite noir of mine is nevertheless another perfect example of an ordinary man a smalltimer minding his own business and unexpectedly colliding with Fate and all that it has in store for him.  We resonate to D.O.A. because fate and contingency have been the fundamental conditions of life on the planet earth since before the beginning of history.  Our time on Earth is brief and our lives but little scraps of paper blown about by the wind toward endings we know not.  We live noir lives.The film's particulars are wonderful.  From the sunny hick town of Banning the movie switches quickly to San Francisco.  If ever there were a noir town it's Frisco.  Hitchcock picked up on that real quick watch Vertigo again to see how he saw the eerie side to that town with its creepy deserted streets little ghostlike fogblown urban hills and other abandoned places suggestive of loneliness and soullessness.From here one great noir scene follows another in astonishing succession the smoky crowded jazz bar where the sweaty black musicians are blowing up a storm to an allwhite 1949 audience of course while a murder is silently committed with a switched drink.   The doctor holding the eerily glowing glass tube of luminescent poison and informing O'Brien You've been murdered.  O'Brien running through the crowded downtown streets like a madman as if velocity could help him escape his fate.  O'Brien after being shot at a gun now in his own hand looking for his killer in the abandoned processing plant.  His encounter with Luther Adler's insane sadistic henchman played by Neville Brand.  Brand speaking softly glints of spittle in the corners of his mouth nutty little eyes lighting up with anticipated pleasure I'm gonna give it to you in the belly.  You're soft in the belly aren't'cha?   Then the fantastic night scene in the crowded Los Angeles drugstore with Brand stalking him among oblivious customerstill shots ring out then screams followed by death.  Finally again at night O'Brien's confrontation with his killer which inevitably occurs in the Bradbury Building that great architectural shrine to noir scene of so many other noir films.Let's stop for a moment and go back to an earlier part of the film. Fatally poisoned still not quite believing what has happened to him exhausted and uncertain of anything O'Brien has run for block after block but now his energy has finally petered out and he finds himself alone near the docks. Utterly depleted all hope lost he wearily leans against the side of an old wooden newsstand in an otherwise bleak abandoned area.  Eyes glazing over he's terrified trying to catch his breath.  During a medium closeup we briefly study him then notice something to his left a single long vertical row of magazines all identical covers arranged down the side of the kiosk just half a hand away from him.  He isn't looking at them isn't really aware of them but we are.  For just a few seconds we see Life Life Life Life Life Life Life. Then the film quickly moves on and goes about its business as if we had been shown nothing of importance.You tell me this isn't a great film noir.".

When you DO find out the who and why it doesn't really make that much sense but I don't think it matters all that much in the end the journey is the thing and only a very picky Noir fan could be disappointed with this. On top of that Neville Brand who later in the 1950s played Al Capone in 'The Untouchables' TV series and later still starred in Tobe Hooper's gonzo cult classic 'Death Trap' a.k.a. 'Eaten Alive' plays one of the most memorable screen villains of all time the dim witted Chester a real nasty piece of work! 'D.O.A.' comes with my highest recommendation.

Frank Bigelow I was. It must be the dream of all directors to open a film with a scene or line which carries great impact and remains in the memory. The opening line in D.O.A  must rank among the most dramatically effective and intriguing lines that has ever opened a movie. This is the quintessential film noir. Edmond O'Brien as the tough hard drinking businessman who has grown tired of the normalcy of his life and the clinging Paula. His holiday in San Francisco is an opportunity to break the shackels. The premise that the hero has been given a slow poison for which there is no cure and only a day or so to solve his own murder before he dies is exceptional. We also have an array of sultry bad girls a seedy villain and a manic hitman. Rudoph Mate directs brilliantly not missing a moment to twist and turn the action at a fast pace with no dull moments.  Scenes of O'Brien running through city streets after he has learned his fate are superb with incredibly realistic wide shots. The fact that his direction is so effective makes one wonder how he could have allowed the lapses of ridiculous canned wolf whistles whenever the hero passed a good looking girl in the early scenes. Although these wolf whistles are really out of place and very annoying the film is so effective that we can forgive the indiscretion. This is a classic example of a brilliant plot superbly told in a way that is still gripping 50 years after it was made. D.O.A. defines Film Noir.".

The action from there on is hectic and as convoluted as all the best noirs are as O'Brien infected by a deadly poison races against the clock to track down his own killer and the reason behind it.The film makes fine use of actual San Francisco and Los Angeles locations as well as authentically depicting the hot and steamy atmosphere at a Frisco jazz club. O'Brien is great as the doomed Bigelow racing often literally against the clock stopping only to palm off his adoring secretary girlfriend Pamela Britten who of course doesn't find out what's wrong with him until too late.The pacing is almost nonstop once it gathers momentum unfortunately when it does some of the scenewriting gets overripe and correspondingly overacted as O'Brien and his girl pour out their hearts somewhat unnecessarily. The film ends bravely though with a downbeat conclusion delivering what the title says it must and at least tying up all the loose ends by that time.".

The action starts with the man going into a police station to report his own murder. This set up is so bizarre and memorable that any replication of it in another movie would immediately be recognised as a D.O.A homage or rip off.The man in question is Frank Bigelow Edmond O'Brien. The police are not surprised by his information and invite him to tell them his story.Frank runs a small business in the little town of Banning he'd gone on a short holiday to San Francisco during Market Week and got caught up in the partying going on in his hotel. When a group of people went on from the party to The Fisherman club he went with them. At the club a man at the bar swapped Frank's unattended drink with another one. Frank consumed some of the drink but didn't finish it because it had an unpleasant taste.Next day back at the hotel. he felt unwell and went to the Medical Building where one of his tests confirmed the presence of luminous toxin poisoning. He was told that this was fatal there was no antidote and he had only a very short time to live. He went on to a hospital emergency unit where further tests confirmed the previous diagnosis and he was told that he only had a maximum of a week to live. The doctor deduced that he had been murdered and notified the Homicide Department. Frank panicked and raced out of the building and along a series of streets until he got to The Fisherman which was closed. Back at the hotel he found that the people he'd partied with had left. The only possible lead he had to help him find out who had killed him was that a man called Philips had been trying desperately to talk to him. Frank had not responded to his request because he didn't want to interrupt his holiday. A telephone conversation with Paula his secretary  fiance confirmed that Philips had died. Frank then decided to go on to Los Angeles where Philips' office was located to see if he could find out what he'd wanted to discuss so urgently.Through his investigations Frank found that Philips had purchased some iridium from a man called George Reynolds and sold it to someone called Majak. The iridium which was very rare and costly had been stolen. Philips was on bail and was facing a possible jail sentence unless he could show that his part in the deal was legitimate. He could've cleared himself if he could've produced the bill of sale which had been notarised by Frank. Further investigations revealed that Philips had not committed suicide but was murdered and his murderer had then poisoned Frank to prevent him from producing the document. Frank eventually confronted his killer before getting his revenge.D.O.A. provided Edmond O'Brien with the role for which he is best remembered and his depiction of Frank's descent into increasingly aggressive brusque and desperate behaviour as his efforts to find his killer are met with a series of dead ends and complications is suitably frantic and convincing.".

I came across it on the Internet Archive and was quite surprised at how good the movie is. The story itself is quite remarkable. Frank Bigelow played by Edmund O'Brien plays a small time accountant  lawyer who travels to San Francisco for time away from his somewhat nagging girlfriend.While Frank is in San Francisco his drink is spiked with a lethal poison by a mystery person. Frank does not know who the mystery person was why his drink was spiked and why someone wants to kill him. Frank does not do what probably most of us would do in a similar situation  sulk cry get drunk etc. Rather he sets out to find out who did this to him and why.Apart from a fantastic plot the movie is very memorable for the collection of shady characters who Frank has to deal with in trying to find out who poisoned him particularly the psychopathic Chester. One thing to note is that the plot is quite complicated. I found myself having to go back and watch scenes a second time to work out what was going on. So make sure you concentrate when you watch this movie.This is an excellent movie. Highly recommended.".

The pacing is good acting toprate and very noirish and it manages to pull so much out of a very simple plot with minimal sets. In other words it gives a fantastic bang for the buck and modern filmmakers would really benefit from learning a lesson or two from DOA.I just checked the IMDb Top 50 Film Noir films and for some odd reason this film is not listed.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is the kind that doesn't kid itself at all it knows what it is and is pretty happy to have it that way. It's filled with the classic toughguy 'realtolife' dialog of the thriller while staying a foot ahead of the audience. This is because the director Rudolph Matte the great cinematographer behind many a filmnoir and Carl Dreyer's masterpieces has such a clever hand of the material. One wrong step and it could slip into being too hokey. In fact there is a camp factor in a couple of scenes the subject matter almost slips into Naked Gun parody before stepping back up for air. But for the fans of mysteries of today would want to check this out as it provides a twist on the usual logic of the subgenre if a genre at all. While not as 'dark' as other filmnoir pictures it still ranks very high in it storytelling having a potent enough story to tell and a slew of actors just pushing the limits of the Bmovie style.Edmond O'Brien is at his absolute best as the worried Frank Bigelow worried because he's in a rotten predicament poisoned by a random drop of 'luminous poison' at a jazz club with no chances of survival. The one thing to do then is to investigate it 'his' way through searching the histories of men like Phillips and Rakubian. One has to pay attention to his story a few times but after a while everything does come together adding to the suspense. O'Brien doesn't play him very naturalistically it's actually quite great at being a simply cinematic performance with the occasional swagger roughness but determination of the best of the doomed heroes of these stories. There's soul in his work even as he says lines fast or with such vigor to maybe go overboard. But it works especially because of the other cast around him being so solid. Several are good and a few are standout Luther Adler as Majack gives some worth in his scenes and especially a small but very memorable part for a nasty character Chester done to a T by Neville Brand the little dialog scenes between them are as shamelessly pulp as any other film like this but compelling and very entertaining.Aside from the merits of most of the cast and Matte's visual approach much of the outside running scenes and chase bits are shot right on location like in a preguerrilla style of filmmaking there's the aspect of the script. Stories like this are hard to come by now even ones being almost this simple. At the same time the screenwriters implement a kind of twisty logic that happens in the course of the film. The sort of MacGuffin lies in the bill of sale as maybe I missed something as it's the last thing to worry about. What one looks for in something like D.O.A. is how the written matter can go through the director's visual mindwarp. Under the radar in a sense the film does some techniques that wouldn't of made it had it been a bigger Alist film. Two examples of this were striking to me making D.O.A. of some note this is besides the adept onlocation work. One was the mix of shots shown in the jazz club scene the musicians. This is a great great little scene adding a sense of atmosphere that another filmmaker would've passed over. Another was during a short scene when Bigelow arrives at the hostel women pass by and with each one a little sound effect comes through. This is whimsy maybe or maybe just some unexplainable little joke put into the film but either way its terrific. When a filmmaker can add a little flavor to the film like that it elevates the material.D.O.A. is on a short list of numerous writers regarding the histories of 40's50's 'filmnoir' pictures in America as one of the premiere examples and it's not far from the truth. It's compact enough to not make Bigelow's strange mix of abrasiveness confusion and drops of tenderness to his secretarylove interest Paula while allowing enough of a story to be told to make it feel complete. And that scene near the end in the hallway...".

When a filmmaker can add a little flavor to the film like that it elevates the material.D.O.A. is on a short list of numerous writers regarding the histories of 40's50's 'filmnoir' pictures in America as one of the premiere examples and it's not far from the truth. It's compact enough to not make Bigelow's strange mix of abrasiveness confusion and drops of tenderness to his secretarylove interest Paula while allowing enough of a story to be told to make it feel complete. And that scene near the end in the hallway...";

	schema:headline " A Better Print Helps This Unique Noir Story";
	schema:reviewBody "When I started watching all the film noirs I could find I was a bit disappointed in this. However after three viewings I now find it decent. It's nothing super but certainly better than what I though at first. A big help is having a better print of the film. This is one of those movies that always had a poor VHS quality transfer and many times the same on DVD. Finding a good print is hard although I finally got a decent one with this Killer Classic DVD set that includes this movie.The story like the print is not always easy to follow either even though the premise is very simple. A man discovers he has been poisoned and there is no hope for recovery. Before he dies he retraces his steps to find out who murdered him even though he's still alive when saying that and why. The story gets a bit complicated. Like a Sherlock Holmes or Charlie Chan mystery there are a number of suspects that keep popping up. Many of them are hard to figure.This is an odd film noir for several quirky things in this movie. The lead character Frank Bigelow Edmund O'Brien is strange and kind of stupid in the beginning. There are a half dozen of these dumb whistlelike wolf call soundeffects that come out every time he sees a pretty woman. It just doesn't fit in a tough film noir. Then there is his possessive girlfriendsecretary Paula Pamela Britton who is constantly calling him and paranoid about his whereabouts. She acts more like an insecure nagging wife but she obviously cares a great deal about him. But man give the poor guy some space! The dialog in this film ranges from incredibly stupid to very clever and solid film noir material.We also see one of the most sadistic people I have ever seen on film Chester played by the sadisticlooking Neville Brand. Wow is this guy sick or what? He reminded me of Vera Ann Savage in Detour. Those two would have made an interesting couple! Brand's character is only interested in one thing in life inflicting pain and the slower and more brutal the better.Anyway if you find a good print tolerate some of the goofy things in the film this is an interesting film noir that gets better with each viewing as you understand the story better.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm generally partial to film noir and D.O.A. is about as close to pure noir at least in spirit as a movie can be. But I don't like it and never did. Both the director and cinematographer have done brilliant work elsewhere and the film is no no means incompetently made but it's poorly written has way too convoluted a plot and is for the most part very badly acted. There are no likable characters in the film and no engaging performances. I grant that much of the outdoor photography is excellent and that the views of postwar California offer a sociologically fascinating and at times aesthetically striking picture of real life at a certain time and in a certain place. But such ancillary pleasures do not a good movie make.One of my chief problems with the film is its leading actor Edmond O'Brien. When well cast O'Brien could be excellent. He had a fine background in the legitimate theater and could play Shakespeare quite proficiently as his Casca in Julius Caesar attests. But he is a dull hero. In D.O.A. his mere presence makes his hounded character absurd almost from the start. With Bogart Ladd or even Dick Powell in the role the movie would have worked better as these actors whatever their limitations were bona fide stars and would have audience empathy just by showing up. O'Brien while not a loathsome presence isn't the sort of actor people care for. He is workmanlike as the unfortunate hero but there's no spark there no reason from a likability standpoint to identify with him. My greatest concern for O'Brien was for the actor himself. As he was a heavyset beefy fellow his running up and down stairs all the time made me worry that he might have a heart attack. The best thing about O'Brien and one of the reasons he was never out of work is that he was in the parlance of Old Hollywood a great dialog man. He always spoke clearly never muffed his lines and no matter how stupid the things he had to say might sound he delivery was impeccable. In a lesser role Luther Adler makes a tedious predictable villain. It's the sort of performance Claude Rains Conrad Veidt or George Macready could have delivered in his sleep. Adler tries hard but is defeated by the script and he is badly photographed and directed. There's no menace to him. As his henchman Neville Brand is so obviously trying to give the kind of dangerous performance that put Richard Widmark over in Kiss Of Death a few years earlier that he's impossible to take seriously. As the years went by he became a capable screen performer but here his grinning and eyepopping while fun to watch just make him look silly. Pamela Britton is a dull love interest and like O'Brien seems to be in the wrong film.How this film ever became a cult classic baffles me. I like dark cinema as much as the next guy but I don't cherish films just because they're dark or because they have doomed heroes or are photographed at night or offer brilliant dandyish European villains. Such things had become clichs by the time D.O.A. was made anyway and the formula was wearing thin. Noirs would continue to be made fitfully through the next decade but in a different mode more realistically than before with greater subtlety. D.O.A. is caught between two modes. As it came out in 1950 it still has some of the ChandlerWoolrich feeling of the previous decade dark cities eccentric secondary characters evil women indifferent or corrupt cops and an air of fatalism. Yet it also reflects the semidocumentaries of the postwar period in its location shooting and in the absence of much studio artifice which ought at least in theory give it an air of hope of modernity which alas its ironclad plot doesn't possess. It would take the talents of among others men like Phil Karlson Don Siegel and Robert Aldrich to move noirs in a contemporary direction more appropriate to the times. Indeed Aldrich seemed to have learned a thing or two from this film which his later Kiss Me Deadly though vastly superior seems stylistically to be at times an homage to.".

	schema:headline " A classical and poetic memoir of existential subtlety";
	schema:reviewBody "Who among the Indians failed to get moved by the advertised displays and cutouts of the Indian actress Rekha in context of Umrao Jaan. Those who saw the film carefully recall it in the silence of sadness and as a class of its own. Umrao a true character of a highly sensitive female artist of nineteenth century India could write the wonderful lyrics of her songs tune the classical melody herself achieved a magical voice and presented the class of a dancestyle called Kathak. Though finally she came up on top of her fame and popularity in a wide region of India she remained deserted by her relatives. Her love relations failed to acquire any meaningful social end. Only the audiovisual experience of the film can take one near the heart of the poetic portrayal brilliantly done by Muzaffar Ali. Ali comes of such a lineage of aristocracy which had much bearing on the time and cultural milieu of Umrao Jaan in Lucknow. A sensitive Indian viewer might also intuit such a  living philosophical background of the spectacular details and technically rare presentation of an excellent narrative.Abducted from her home village along with another friend Ramrey in her childhood Umrao alone was purchased by a pander. She lost the last link to her past even the whereabouts of her birthplace. Umrao Jaan grew up as a professional dancer and singer in certain artloving space of Lucknow where the performereven the sexually virgin one entertained the elite with performance but could have no legitimate social relation with  them. Umrao had to leave her first love a connoisseur of her performance and a goodhearted handsome prince whom after many years she finds as married to Ramrey. It was also a matter of chance that one family adopted Ramrey and paid satisfactorily to the same kidnaper. The mature Umrao as a paid entertaineron the family occasion of the happy and her beloved couplecould readily responds in songs to her amazing feelings of relentless drift of life.All along the narrative of the film the genius of Umrao is shown to expand as an artist and as an author from inside her existential experience. Her songs and danceswonderfully matching the shifting contexts of her biographymove gradually from deep passion for life to profound existential quarries. A period of historical unrest in the region keeps Umrao floating and troubled to procure her livelihood and to maintain her prestige. After all the unthoughtof turns of life and an effective exposure to the outworld she unknowingly reappears in her lost paradise the forgotten shelter of her birthplace and patriarchal family of origin. On deepest agony and not incredibly the Indian spectators see Umrao herself to accept her social death and ruthless rejection from her family belonging to orthodox Indian patriarchy. Crying her heart out she had to leave her mother the evermissing reconciliation perhaps for all. Finally the major associates of her troop also got detached from Umrao.  She had to return to the deserted house of Lucknow and starts cleaning the dust spread over the old things. The pale sight of disheveled Umrao reflected in an old mirror concludes the film. The still of a drifting individual on the edge of her career and tormented life suspends an air of subtle nostalgia.Except editing all the aspects of the film making is overwhelming.

	onyx:emotionText "Who among the Indians failed to get moved by the advertised displays and cutouts of the Indian actress Rekha in context of Umrao Jaan. Those who saw the film carefully recall it in the silence of sadness and as a class of its own. Umrao a true character of a highly sensitive female artist of nineteenth century India could write the wonderful lyrics of her songs tune the classical melody herself achieved a magical voice and presented the class of a dancestyle called Kathak. Though finally she came up on top of her fame and popularity in a wide region of India she remained deserted by her relatives. Her love relations failed to acquire any meaningful social end. Only the audiovisual experience of the film can take one near the heart of the poetic portrayal brilliantly done by Muzaffar Ali. Ali comes of such a lineage of aristocracy which had much bearing on the time and cultural milieu of Umrao Jaan in Lucknow. A sensitive Indian viewer might also intuit such a  living philosophical background of the spectacular details and technically rare presentation of an excellent narrative.Abducted from her home village along with another friend Ramrey in her childhood Umrao alone was purchased by a pander. She lost the last link to her past even the whereabouts of her birthplace. Umrao Jaan grew up as a professional dancer and singer in certain artloving space of Lucknow where the performereven the sexually virgin one entertained the elite with performance but could have no legitimate social relation with  them. Umrao had to leave her first love a connoisseur of her performance and a goodhearted handsome prince whom after many years she finds as married to Ramrey. It was also a matter of chance that one family adopted Ramrey and paid satisfactorily to the same kidnaper. The mature Umrao as a paid entertaineron the family occasion of the happy and her beloved couplecould readily responds in songs to her amazing feelings of relentless drift of life.All along the narrative of the film the genius of Umrao is shown to expand as an artist and as an author from inside her existential experience. Her songs and danceswonderfully matching the shifting contexts of her biographymove gradually from deep passion for life to profound existential quarries. A period of historical unrest in the region keeps Umrao floating and troubled to procure her livelihood and to maintain her prestige. After all the unthoughtof turns of life and an effective exposure to the outworld she unknowingly reappears in her lost paradise the forgotten shelter of her birthplace and patriarchal family of origin. On deepest agony and not incredibly the Indian spectators see Umrao herself to accept her social death and ruthless rejection from her family belonging to orthodox Indian patriarchy. Crying her heart out she had to leave her mother the evermissing reconciliation perhaps for all. Finally the major associates of her troop also got detached from Umrao.  She had to return to the deserted house of Lucknow and starts cleaning the dust spread over the old things. The pale sight of disheveled Umrao reflected in an old mirror concludes the film. The still of a drifting individual on the edge of her career and tormented life suspends an air of subtle nostalgia.Except editing all the aspects of the film making is overwhelming. Such an extraordinarily articulate film needs to be reviewed over again especially in the intercontextual  backdrop of  a memoir  of a loner a genius a beggar a performing artist an author and above all a female that is successfully reproduced by a director as a stream of  nostalgic images.";

Ali does not exaggerate with lavish set designs and his adaptation is of a rather lower budget. He gracefully shows us Umrao mastering the art of poetry and dance. The songs are beautiful and poetry is itself a character in Umrao's life like a traveling companion. In some of the songs we are shown flashes of old elegant paintings old fashioned settings and what Lucknow may have looked like. takes us back in time to what the late 1800s may have resembled.The performances are subtle except of Khanum Jaan's character. Muzaffar really Farooq Sheikh is brilliant as the young nave prince and Nasseeruddin Shah is superb as Gohar Mirza. Shaukat Kaifi and Dina Pathak are adequate. Prema Narayan is decent.However Umrao Jaan clearly belongs to Rekha. With subtlety and grace she underplays her part. There is no melodrama or unnecessary loudness and this allows us to really feel for Umrao. We see that Ramdei who was kidnapped like her but sold to slavery has now become a happy wife of a Nawab. We see her friend and fellow dancer Bismillah finding happiness in her life. Finally we see Umrao moving along the path of life trying to forget the past trying to find happiness and love or trying to escape from it all. She manages to independently make a living reciting poetry ghazals and dancing but though people yearn to hear her sing and watch her dance they refuse to give her the respect of a 'decent' woman. As we see Umrao travelling through life trying to find her own place in the end she returns to that very place now abandoned picking up from where she left as she has no place else to go. She looks in the mirror that reflects her destiny".

The problem is that it is so good that Muzaffar Ali the producer from Lucknow where most of the movie unfolds perhaps cannot make a better movie all his life.The film is very restrained and therefore a believable story of a Lucknow tawaif courtesan geisha. There are no brave heroes all flee 1857 Sepoy Mutiny against the English the robber Faiz Ali dies in an unheroic escape. Owner of house of tawaifs Madam Khanum is selfish and exploitative. Nawab Sultan one of the first clients of Umrao sees Umarao what she is  a tawaif and abandons her with no compunctions to marry into the wealthy family of her cousin others hurl insults at Umrao. There is a thin line if any between a tawaif and a prostitutehooker  Umrao sleeps with Nawab Sultan as a matter of routine and then with the robber Faiz Ali. Urdu poetry ghazal is shown to be pervasive in the lives of tawaifs and all around her. The dialogs are in lyrical delicate and local Urdu difficult to be appreciated in translation. Acting is superb by all. Songs and Indian Kathak dances minus one by Nawab Sultan are mostly in context.Good movies like good books can enrich and teach. Most Indian movies are trash fantastic escape from reality but not old Umrao Jaan. You could see Lucknow of a bygone era. Sample thesepigeon flight contests or kabootar baazi a flock breaking pigeons mid flight from a rival flock  Indian hop scotch ikkal dukkal  the earthen stove or choolha  the custom of eating with hands in the kitchen on the floor near choolha  the custom of offering for a saint's shrine nazar at durgaah  the custom of arranged marriage between Muslim cousins  the custom of purdah  the custom of eating betel leaf or paans and hookah smoking  the tradition of sellers of bangles and shawls coming home  the incompetent and indolent nawabs who would sell part of the estate for a courtesanSee it if you have not yet see it again if you have once. Technically the photography is not as high quality as now  but then in 25 years movie cameras have improved a lot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Umrao Jaan1981 is based on the novel  'Umrao Jaan Ada' of Mirza Mohammad Haadi Ruswa. I happened to watch the movie first and read the novel later. And undoubtedly director Muzaffar Ali's cinematic version of the story originally written in the nineteenth century and said to be the true story of a true character is better than the written work.The story belongs to the Tawaayafcourtesan Umrao Jaan who was born at Faizabaad as Ameeran. After getting kidnapped and sold to a Kothabrothel in Lucknow she grows up and becomes famous among the rich and the elite because of her ShaayariUrdu poetry sung in her melodious voice and coupled with her enchanting dances. However she finds almost everybody around him as greedy for her earnings and she continue to move through her journey of life with a sense of complete loneliness within her. Certain males enter her life and raise false hopes in her heart for being able to live a normal married life containing a loving husband social acceptance and motherhood but finally she finds that loneliness only is her destiny.Taking the story from the said novel producerdirector Muzaffar Ali himself has written the screenplay and dialogs of this movie in association with Shama Zaidi and Jaaved Siddiqui. This script has been written quite crisply without giving undue footage to anything and not allowing the focus to divert from the principal character and her woes. The narrative with the gloom and loneliness of the principal character prevalent in every moment of it moves at a reasonable pace without allowing any laxity or boredom to creep in. The audience is not only kept engaged in the narrative and glued to the screen for more than two hours but also made to feel the pain the feelings and the stuffiness of the pivotal character. It is a very impressive movie no doubt.The ending scene is just superb in which Umrao Jaan wipes the mirror to see her face in that. It's an example of sheer brilliance on the part of the filmmaker who conveys the permanent sense of loneliness in the courtesan to the audience leaving the theatre without any spoonfeeding. Anybody who has watched this movie on the big screen must have left the theatre with a throbbing in his  her heart.Umrao Jaan can be termed as painfilled poetry written on celluloid. It stirs moves pinches and brings tears to eyes. It's a journey made by the spectator alongwith the courtesan known as Umrao Jaan. Within a few minutes the narrative envelops the viewer and makes him a part of the unusual story of the protagonist being told to him.The art director has brought the period of the 19th century alive on the screen. The complete milieu including the architecture the dialect the clothes the style of living etc. are authentic. The cinematographer has also left no stone unturned from his side in this regard and thus a realistic account of that era is presented to the audience who also happen to witness the turbulence due to the Gadar or the mutiny of 1857 by a section of the Indians against the British rule.Rekha quite deservingly won the national award for the best actress for the title role played by her in this moviethough Jennifer Kendal Kapoor was a stronger contender for that award for that year for her performance in 36 Chowringhee Lane. Rekha does not seem to be acting she appears to be actually living the life of Umrao Jaan. Originally a Tamilian this talented actress has portrayed the Urdu speaking Shaayara cum Tawaayaf in an amazing manner.Farooque Sheikh as Umrao Jaan's lover and all the other characters have also done exceedingly well. Even the small characters of Maulvi SahebGajaanan Jaagirdaar and BismillahPrema Naarayan are able to leave their imprint in the movie. The romance between Farooque and Rekha is so delicate that the audience can't help falling in love with them and their relationship.Khayyam has composed immortal music with the great Shaayari of Shaharyaar for this movie. All the ghazals and nazms are so touching that any lover of music and Shaayari can keep on listening to them again and again. Dil Cheez Kya Hai Aap Meri Jaan Leejiye In Aankhon Ki Masti Ke Mastaane Hazaaron Hain Zindagi Jab Bhi Teri Bazm Mein Laati Hai Hamen Justujoo Jiski Thi Usko To Na Paaya Humne etc. are heartconquerors. Most of these are gems in the voice of Asha Bhosle whereas Zindagi Jab Bhi Teri Bazm Mein Laati Hai Hamen is a memorable ghazal of Talat Aziz. The album contains a couple of folk songs also and a classic written by Amir Khusro. However the painsoaked ghazal which is placed at the end of the movie which always brings a flood of tears in my eyes is  Ye Kya Jagah Hai Doston Ye Kaun Sa Dayaar Hai HaddeNigaah Tak Jahaan Gubaar Hi Gubaar Hai.Umrao Jaan is a true classic. A masterpiece. It was remade by J.P. Dutta in 2006 by taking Aishwarya Rai in the title role. Though I found J.P. Dutta's movie as closer to the novel of Mirza Haadi Ruswa it lacked the soul of the story. If anybody wants to meet the real Umrao Jaan that used to exist some 150 years ago then this movie only is the perfect choice for him  her.".

The first western movie filmed in the Soviet Union The Russia House is better defined as a love story than as a spy thriller. Do not be concerned however spy fans. There is plenty of intrigue to be had in this beautiful movie. The interplay between Sean Connery Roy Scheider and J.T. Walsh in a scene from Vancouver British Columbia alone is worth the price of admission. However the true star of this understated romance is James Fox who plays the British contact for Connery's Scott Blair and the foil for the CIA's Scheider character in such gentlemanly fashion as to make the audience believe the true Bondstyle gentlemanspy really does exist in this world.

And I realized that it's fascination still holds....this is one of my top 10 definitely.The reasons I would rate this a 9 while somebody else would give it a 5.9 are largely personal....i think it always comes down to the personal. Talk all we want when we watch a movie  as when we eat a meal or kiss someone  the pleasure center in the brain either lights up or doesn't. For me it's all about the love of a place...for Scott Barley Blair it's early Glastnost Russia for me it's 90's Germany  Hamburg Berlin...the strangeness the trueness of people who surround you in such a place and your love for them because of this. The fact that a film can light up specific sense memories like these means that it is true  at least in that respect. This is a remarkably honest film  terrifically unsensational for a spy film and one of the rare love stories that delivers the satisfactions expected of a love story without getting mawkish. Everything rings true here except for the ending a fabricated happy ending which is the only thing that kept me from rating this a 10.To ask for Manchurian Candidate type excitement from this low key film is wrong. The suspense which is remarkably sustained those rich long tracking shots of people walking through public places to uncertain destinations to meet with or maybe not meet with shadow characters who may be allies or enemies is the truer suspense of the uncertainty of living in a gray gray world...where nothing much happens but peril is part of the fabric of mundane life.Those sequences are gorgeous....the colors of autumn in a Leningrad park the closeups of the stone gargoyles....the moody circular stepping pace of the soundtrack....Branford Marsalis' saxophone. Someone has said here that it is talky. Yes it is talky...but the talk is brilliant...it is the perfect reflection of a world where everyone  book publishers and bureaucrats and spies alike speaks in mannered ritualized streams of code. This is not disinformation  it is perfectly understood by all a language that has supplanted the language of an earlier age in which sincerity was an option.Besides that ending the piece is perfectly faithful to LeCarre's novel. LeCarre's books have had good luck when being translated into movies. Of the eight or so that have been adapted four have made great films The Spy Who Came into the Cold The Russia House and the two George Smiley BBC miniseries. LeCarre is a great writer and more specifically great at plotting and dialogue and these films all succeed pretty much by filming what is written unadorned and pouring on the atmosphere. And they are blessed with lead performances by three great actors at the top of the form  Richard Burton Sean Connery and Alec Guiness Guiness especially...to watch him for six hours in Smiley's People is one of the great pleasures.A beautifully efficient and elegant translation by Tom Stoppard of a great novel wonderfully dignified and touching performances by Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer never seen her better a beautiful soundtrack by a second tier composer graced by the presence of a real jazz master a terrific evocation of a place and time....a very moving film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Admittedly The Russia House may not be for all tastes but I saw this when I was 15 when it came out in the theaters and I loved it then and I love it now. If you go in expecting this to be a James BondSimon TemplarNorth By Northwest type movie you'll be GRAVELY disappointed. Needless to say the movie is dialogue driven and the performances are great. Sean Connery my alltime favorite gives a nice performance in a role that isn't typical Connery. Michelle Pfeiffer my favorite actress is equally excellent. I kept looking for her to flub her Russian accent but she's on target from start to finish. The supporting players Roy Scheider who I also love is awesome. There's a lot of witty dialogue in this film but Scheider has some of the film's most memorable ones. Ken Russell the controversial director has an equally memorable witty role as Walter. I own this movie but between the time I saw it in the theaters and the time I bought it a year and half ago Russell was one of the things about the movie that really stood out in my memory of the film. And of course James Fox who's always great.Not really a supporting player but it might as well be is the LOCATIONS. Wow really breathtaking stuff. Fred Schepsi did a wondrous job with the locations and the CAMERA. The cinematography and locations were firstrate. And if that wasn't enough I was equally enthralled with the jazzy musical score. If it isn't already apparent I love this movie and I absolutely recommend it. It has a nice blend of dialogue plot romance and humor. I reiterate Not for all tastes given that many may find it slow but definitely worth a look. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.".

Connery is very good as the boozy worldweary publisher who considers personal relationships more important than Cold War oneupmanship. Michelle Pfeiffer apart from being very pleasing to the eye as usual was also pretty believable as the Russian trying to do the right thing. What's more Klaus Maria Brandauer deserves an honourable mention as well. OK the plot is complicated  sometimes hard to follow as are most of Le Carre's works  also doubtless the real world of espionage but it is worth the effort.

Additionally a couple of factors have been unkind to it over time.Connery and Pfeiffer are excellant the large cast are almost uniformly outstanding except perhaps Roy Scheider who I usually like but who seems a bit over the top in his role here the Moscow scenery and end of the Cold War feel are great and the main characters are easy to like if difficult to outright love.  On the down side the writing assumes too much in expecting the audience to stay on top of the espionage jargon and intrigue added to the nonlinear plot. Let your attention wander and you'll lose your way. If it had been a little easier to follow it would have left more room for dramatic tension which was adequate but seldom riveting.When I said that time has been unkind to The Russia House I meant two things firstly that the unfortunate timing of the movie's release a year before the collapse of the Soviet Union ensured that it would be dated almost immediately. More significantly a growing portion of the film's potential audience didn't live through the late Soviet Era and the nuances of concepts like Glasnost and why Perestroika makes it hard  for Pfeiffer to do her shoeshopping aren't going to mean a thing to anyone much under 30.But that's not the movie's fault. Russia House is still a  quality enjoyable drama with a great cast even if it's somewhat ponderous and slowmoving and complex. And oh yes  it has James Fox. A film like this without James Fox would have been like a table with three legs.7 out of 10".

It contains some of the first images filmed by American cinema industry in former Soviet Union. The rhythm is a little slow but it's compensated by the excellent story scenario and performances. The characters are very well defined. Michelle Pfeiffer plays one of her greatest performances and Sean Connery and Kalus Maria Brandauer have also very remarkable roles. I've personally visited Russia and the film reflects very well the general atmosphere ... the essence of the country. To my opinion it's the best film ever filmed in Russia.".

It contains some of the first images filmed by American cinema industry in former Soviet Union. The rhythm is a little slow but it's compensated by the excellent story scenario and performances. The characters are very well defined. Michelle Pfeiffer plays one of her greatest performances and Sean Connery and Kalus Maria Brandauer have also very remarkable roles. I've personally visited Russia and the film reflects very well the general atmosphere ... the essence of the country. To my opinion it's the best film ever filmed in Russia.";

James Fox' character Ned was well developed as he grew increasingly more aware of the goingson on both sides and even more aware of old Barley's persona and why he was doing what he was doing.Michelle Pfeiffer impressed me with the interpretation of her role and with her facility with the Russian dialectaccent. This is my favorite of all her roles. As for Sean Connery's interpretation I don't think I enjoyed him in any role quite as much as this one. The instances of dry cutting humor juxtaposed with the strains of the deepseated moral ambiguities to which he is exposed makes this role a challenge to any thespian and he carries it off perfectly. No one else could do Barley quite like him! The supporting cast was excellent but one of the really strongest points in the movie is the contribution of Branford Marsalis superior Soprano Sax work over jazzyclassicalethnic themes. The fact that the character Barley was himself a practicing sax player lends even more authenticity to Branford's work here.This movie is a do not miss one of the best I have ever seen!".

	schema:reviewBody "Russia House is British playwright Tom Stoppard's effort to bring John LeCarre's book to the screen. Sean Connery owed Stoppard a favor and agreed to act in the lead role of an outatelbows publisher whose plays jazz clarinet and is equally talented on the whisky bottle. LeCarre likes to confront mildly despondent middleaged men of middling talent with a challenge that might allow them to be small heroes. LeCarre's minisupermen were interesting in his first dozen novels but American readers have grown heartily sick of the theme and many left Russia house collecting dust in the annual pile of unwanted Christmas gifts. Imagine the surprise of discovering that a movie based on an unreadable book turns out to be a masterpiece.Director Fred Schepisi filmed Russia House in Moscow and Leningrad in the midst of Glasnot. The movie begins at a Russian book fair where a Moscow book agent Katia played by Michelle Pfeiffer comes to deliver a secret manuscript to Boozy Barley Blair Sean Connery. His book stand is empty he is absent. The manuscript makes its way into the hands of British Intelligence and turns out to be a technical treatise showing that the Soviet Union cannot make solid rocket fuel worth st its rockets suck instead of blow and they could not hit Nevada on a clear day. Through a series a virtuoso flashbacks fastforwards and voice overs we learn that Blair loves Russia and Russians and that during one of his drunken rants at a retreat for Soviet writers he has inspired Russia's top rocket scientist to betray his country because as Blair has expounded in his cups if we are to survive we must all betray our countries. The plot of Russia House is too complex to describe in a few lines but the theme is simple. A country's system can be bad but its people good. America and the Soviet Union are in the grips of weapons makers and generals who amplify their power by blowing up the threat each country poses the other. To tear down the lie that the cold war is the only peace possible between Soviets and Americans Blair and his rocket scientist must disobey their superiors and turn coat much as soldiers of the First World War did when they crossed noman's land to shake hands. Stoppard somehow manages to get the message of Russia House across without stunning us with platitudes about geopolitics and even manages to squeeze in a love story that comes across as mature and moving.This movie is to Sean Connery what Glenn Gary Glenn Ross was to Alec Baldwin. The script of Glenn Gary put an epic speech into Baldwin's mouth as the hectoring slave driver of pathetic real estate agents and showed the world that Baldwin could act. Connery has never been better than in Russia House nor has he worked with such an expert cast. Roy Scheider Ken Russel Michelle Pfeiffer James Fox Klaus Maria Brandauer as well as the regular batch of talented British nonames give this movie the sort of punch that has not been seen since 12 Angry Men and Inherit the Wind.Russia House is not for everyone. You will see no shootouts no exposed breasts no chases down busy streets. If you want a glimpse of the Soviet Union before its fall brought to life by a crack troupe of actors at the top of their game then you need to see this movie. Again and again.".

This film I have watched at least twenty times but by the time you read this it will be many more since I watch it at least every 6 weeks or so. I sit down with a bottle of genuine Russian vodka a small tin of red caviar and some hard white bread I turn up the dolby 5.1 and soak up the experience. Why is this film so good? Well for a start it is from a book by John LeCarre who must be our best living author. Who else researches a book so thoroughly? Every location has been checked every character totally believable with an intelligent plot.Secondly the screenplay by Tom Stoppard is faultless. Having read the book first I could not believe how faithfully Stoppard made his screenplay chunks of LeCarre dialogue are faithfully copied. Then there is the acting. There are memorable performances from Sean Connery Barley and Michel PfeifferKatya the beautiful Russian heroine. Klaus Maria Brandauer wins my best supporting actor award as the totally believable Russian scientist. There are so many memorable lines of dialogue in this film. Brandauers line If I will be a hero will you act like a merely decent human being always brings a lump to my throat. Barley's tongue in cheek replies to his CIA interrogators are wonderful. What gives this film such a feeling of authenticity are the locations which are all genuine Moscow and St Petersburg. Already Moscow has changed a lot since this film was made. The lovely old National hotel shown in the film has been demolished and replaced with a modern nonentity so this film is rapidly becoming a piece of history. The buildings are changing but the same faceless KGB operators are still there. How can one flawed man fight the power of the spymasters. Barley shows how to do it. What a hero! Does it have any faults?If only Ken Russell had stuck to directing and left acting to actors.".

	schema:headline " Le Carre blithers but Connery and Pfeiffer light up Moscow";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite certain divergences in character and plot this movie version of The Russia House does do justice to John Le Carre's twisted tale. Perhaps this is because so much of Hollywood shares Le Carre's own moral obtuseness  wishing bureaucratic tyranny upon the rest of the world while insulating itself with money.Le Carre cannot tell the difference between West and East between the bumbling mediocrity of western bureaucracies and the unremitting evil of the Soviet bureaus which owned everything in the evil empire right down to peoples' souls. The Russia House was the first of his many post Cold War novels to make it clear that he could not or would not.Yet the man does write brilliantly. Le Carre is one of the great masters of English prose. Therefore one can almost forgive his blockheadedness while one enjoys his rich descriptions his twisted characters and his sharp storytelling.

By contrast James Woods does an excellent job as his opposite number in British Intelligence with support from a young Michael Kitchen now the graying star of Foyle's War.

Moscow looks nearly deserted a graphic reminder that the official Soviet population figure 5 million was overstated by at least a factor of seven according to Robert Heinlein.There are interludes of wistful jazz woven seamlessly into the story but much of the rest of the musical score is loud and distracting especially toward the end. I suppose it was intended to induce anxiety in viewers who could not follow what was happening in the complicated plot. The director should have stuck with the jazz. By far the best screen adaptation of a Le Carre novel is The Little Drummer Girl directed by George Roy Hill.

	onyx:emotionText "Despite certain divergences in character and plot this movie version of The Russia House does do justice to John Le Carre's twisted tale. Perhaps this is because so much of Hollywood shares Le Carre's own moral obtuseness  wishing bureaucratic tyranny upon the rest of the world while insulating itself with money.Le Carre cannot tell the difference between West and East between the bumbling mediocrity of western bureaucracies and the unremitting evil of the Soviet bureaus which owned everything in the evil empire right down to peoples' souls. The Russia House was the first of his many post Cold War novels to make it clear that he could not or would not.Yet the man does write brilliantly. Le Carre is one of the great masters of English prose. Therefore one can almost forgive his blockheadedness while one enjoys his rich descriptions his twisted characters and his sharp storytelling.

	schema:reviewBody "Since I enrolled in International Cinema at my university I've had the opportunity to see classic foreign films in the theatre and it's really opened me up to the genre. I'd have to say that this movie Shoeshine in English struck me as one of the most powerful I've seen yet a sad bleak commentary on children's lives in postwar Italy. Shoeshine dealswith a pair of children living on the street best friends who shine shoes for a living and whose greatest dream is to buy a horse something they could actually take care of and call their own. Pasquale the older boy and Giuseppe the younger are drawn into a situation they don't quite understand the weight of. Not knowing that the Italian society is chaotic after the war when children under ten years old are put into prison for crimes like vagrancy Pasquale and Giuseppe are coerced into doing a favor for Giuseppe's brother Attilio Filipucci  they are to bring and sell smuggled American blankets to a lady fortuneteller for the Filipucci family's profit.Without warning police appear at the fortuneteller's house and question her. The boys are paid not to say anything and are paid just enough to pool their money and buy the horse. Unfortunately the fortuneteller has the boys taken from the street and into police custody where though claiming not to know anything are fingerprinted and thrown into a juvenile prison. The prison and events that occur in it force the best friends apart and the previously lighthearted story turns ugly. The boys' environment corrupts them and innocence is quickly lost.Directed by the famous Vittorio De Sica and with Cesare Zavattini doing his trademark poetic screenplay Shoeshine definitely deserves its place as one of the first foreign films to with the Oscar of the same name. The Neorealist De Sica does include some comic relief in the movie and it's not all serious and depressing... The line from Giuseppe to Pasquale as they're walking up a flight of stairs Elevators sure are great and Pasquale's answer of Yes I slept in one for quite a while is one example.To say any more would give away the story and you simply must experience this classic for yourselves. My rating 910.".

The horse symbolic of freedom selfworth beauty upward mobility hope etc epitomises the shredded shared aspirations of Italy's underclass. The film then begins to resemble the works of Charles Dickens with their street urchins likable ragamuffins and soot smeared daydreamers. Here the horse  which Giuseppe and Pasquale buy using blackmail money  is shown to be unattainable precisely UNLESS the boys resort to crime. It's the cruelest poverty trap the duo arrested the moment they realise their dreams which echoes earlier scenes in which De Sica has the kids visit a clairvoyant a sequence which points to a kind of hard social determinism. The boys aren't just fated to a life of suffering society wills them into crime.The film becomes most interesting when the boys enter prison and various reformation facilities. Loyalties are tested the kid's are beaten hearts harden betrayals are frequent and we're introduced to hordes of other confined children who seem to be perpetually whimpering in the dark let out occasionally if they're lucky only to meet deeply embarrassed parents. At its best the film shows how prisons purport to offer reform and redemption but serve only to warp incarcerated individuals hardening them coarsening them making them worse. The film would be deeply influential on Luis Bunuel's Los Olvidados Bunuel cites early De Sica as a big influence which was released in 1950. De Sica's Shoeshine was released in 1946 with Rossellini's similar film Germany Year Zero released two years later in 1948. Rossellini's masterpiece is arguably better but wouldn't exist without the groundwork De Sica lays here.In handling the camera I feel that I have no peer Orson Welles once said. But what De Sica can do I can't do. I ran his 'Shoeshine' recently and the camera disappeared the screen disappeared it was just life. At the time many felt this way toward the neorealist movement. It's authenticity was new gritty these films offered a neverbeforeseen heightened reality. But time is rarely kind to films which overtly attempt to recreate real life. Once the novelty wears off you're often left with something contrived calculated documentarian touches revealing themselves to be paradoxically both sensationalistic and not sensationalistic enough next to whatever is the newest incarnation of heightened reality. As a mainstream example it's why Scorsese son of neorealists keeps getting more and more ridiculously manic a kind of pornographic escalation into further and further layers of hyperrealism. Meanwhile groundzero reality gets increasingly banal.So Shoeshine like most neorealist works is odd in that it's now both not gritty enough whilst revealing itself to have never been realistic. It's a weirdness specific to neorealism a movement which continually with much futility tries to capture a reality that always seems to exists beyond it. And of course like most neorealist works there is little metaphysical depth here little of interest beside what we directly see which is why Italian metaphysicians like Antonioni and Pssolini often feel more modern more affecting then the Viscontis Rossellinis and De Sicas. On the plus side all these flaws are tempered by De Sica's own particular brand of pathos which is directly influenced by the poetic realism of the French specifically Renoir whom De Sica rightfully admired. And like Renoir De Sica zeroes in on poverty hardship intergenerational estrangement and the sense of general moral decay and vacuity cast by Fascist regimes. In typical Renoir fashion De Sica also codes class relationships cleanly but subtly much of the film preoccupied with contrasts in high and low with characters towering over others or with strategically placed stairs top floors bottom floors ascents and descents. This updown dynamic extends to the film's title and the chief occupation of the shoeshine boys who must kneel submissively at the feet of American soldiers in a national image of defeat and shame.8.510  Worth one viewing.

	schema:reviewBody "Sciuscia  one word carrying the poignant context of a devastating story as the Italianization of the word 'Shoeshine' the name given to the little 'ragazzi' who shined GI's boots for a living. We're in 1945 when Italy was still recovering from the ashes of WWII. In one title the tone is set in an impoverished Italy the main protagonists are all children carrying in their hands and hearts the hope of a slow rebirth. This light of hope is even conveyed in the opening scene when two kids two friends Pasquale and Giuseppe ride horses in the middle of a forest under a bright sunshine. Their fetishhorse is a white one the fastest one named Bersagliere and both dream of owning him. Like in Bicycle Thieves or Umberto D. the simplest things make the most inspirational statements about humanity a bicycle is synonym of hope a little dog is the only companionship an old man can dream of in Sciuscia the horse is the dream the exhilarating feeling of freedom inhabiting Pasquale and Giuseppe's hearts and the cement of a seemingly unbreakable friendship.Friendship if anything Sciuscia is the heartwarming story of a friendship before it would turn into the heartbreaking chronicle of its destruction all the more tragic because both couldn't foresee their lives without each other and De Sica doesn't need to make it said it's obvious. Pasquale is an orphan who lives in Giuseppe's home and while Giuseppe younger and more immature complains about having to give part of his 'shoeshine' money to his family Pasquale wished he had a family to give money to. These boys have hopes dreams principles and even an innocence that haven't been undermined yet by a tragic turn of events. Unfortunately Giuseppe has an older brother Attilio who works for a fence named Panza Attilio incarnates the eventual danger that Giuseppe might end like him and it's not coincidental that we meet him when Giuseppe talks to his child love a pretty little girl who becomes at that moment the last link to childhood before the irreparable would be committed.As I said Sciuscia carries the whole story in its title it was in 1945 the GI were still here and while the political authority was in reconstruction many Italians made money through Black Market. Giuseppe and Pasquale were given a mission to sell some US blankets to an oldlady unknowing that Attilio and Panza would come up later passing as cops to steal the poor woman. Given enough money to buy the horse they'll live the happiest parenthesis of their lives riding Bersagliere an exciting state of grace interrupted when they're questioned by the cops regarding the stealing of the old lady's money. Refusing to break the Omerta and having no proof against them both kids agree not to talk and patiently spend their time in the juvenile detention center.Sciuscia turns into a powerful social commentary about juvenile delinquency as the only desperate answer to difficult economical conditions when kids were put in the same trunk with prostitutes when some were forced to steal to nourish their family. As the trunk leaves the street both Giuseppe and Pasquale are precociously leaving childhood incarnated by the little girl who follows the trunk. And the center is filmed with a documentarylike style that finds the right tone between pathos and cold realism De Sica trusts our intelligence enough not to portray the kids as little angels some of them lie frighten the newcomers provoke fights but some others are indeed victim of cruelly sad circumstances and a slow bureaucracy like the kid named Rafaelle who can't be put in a sanatorium despite a severe lungcondition. Even the administrators are not all onedimensional they're men who went through Fascism a war and only use violence because disorder would be much worse.Fatally Pasquale and Giuseppe have their friendships affected by their detention starting at the moment they're sent in different cells their cries and shouts the way they keep their hands hooked to each other is an extraordinary display of desperate need to be together. Their separation only exposes them to the worst to the influence of their respective groups that would slowly and progressively drive them apart. And it starts at the pivotal moment of the film when one of the guards pretends to hit Giuseppe to force Pasquale to talk it's out of his love that Pasquale breaks his premise and starts the turn of events that will destroy their friendship. Giuseppe will think of Pasquale as a snitch who sold his brother and as revenge sets him up in return putting a deathblow on their friendship.It's impossible to describe with words the tragic path the movie takes and its extreme realism only makes it worse. If Bicycle Thieves is regarded as one of the saddest films ever there still is an imperceptible light of hope at the end. In Sciuscia the film doesn't have a sad score the main theme is the joyful riddlelike music of the white horse that reminds of childhood's insouciance but God it cruelly contrasts with the slow transformation that involves the two protagonists even physical the loss of innocence is one thing but what can be sadder than a destroyed friendship. Killing the myth of the friendship built behind the bars the film demonstrates how authority bureaucracy order can annihilate the most beautiful aspects of humanity and finally how fragile are the most beautiful virtues. But I wonder if it's not sadder than the film itself that one of the greatest masterpieces of Italian neorealism a movie I knew about through Scorsese's documentary about his Italian influence and Pauline Kael's review has only 14 reviews counting mine while The Avengers already has 1207. One thing for sure no last minute of a film haunted me as much as in Sciuscia while I desperately looked for something to keep my faith on humanity.".

Now let me tell you why 'The shoeshine' is phenomenal. After having seen the movies Umberto D Bicycle thief and The Shoeshinethe third movie of De Sica which I watched it became evident to me that the narrative is spun around the characters emphasising on the dimensions of the characterwhere there is a transformation of the character from being vibrant to becoming docile or viceversa and the like.

	schema:headline " Like so many of De Sica's films of the era not necessarily enjoyable but brilliantly made.";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a huge admirer of the films directed by Vittorio De Sica during the 1940s. Using what is referred to as the 'neorealist' style he was able to craft many brilliant classics using ordinary folks in ordinary situations. So without stagebound sets and professional actors he was able to make films superior to Hollywoodand among the best films ever. Try watching The Children Are Watching Us Umberto Dor Miracle in Milan and you'll see what I am talking aboutbrilliant and compelling fro start to finish. The only negative about the films is that sometimes they can be incredibly depressingand that is certainly the case with Umberto D and Shoeshine. Depressing but also amazing.Like the other neorealist films this one stars very ordinary folkslots of kidsnot professionals. Considering how hard it is to get realistic portrayals from kids he really has to be commended for this. And like this style of film it was shot throughout Rome in various locationsnot sets. And in the process De Sica really hit a home runchronicling a very sad period in Italian history.The film is set in Allied occupied Italy circa 1944. Folks are poor and hungry and jobs are hard to come by. Amidst this poverty two kids Pasquale and Guiseppe are inexplicably saving all the money they can to buy a horse! And so they take odd jobs shine shoes and scramble to make a buck. When they are nearing their goal they are tricked into doing a 'simple' job for Giuseppe's brotherand get arrested for stealing blankets from the Allied forces. Surprisingly despite their age and how nonserious their crime appeared to be the two are dealt with VERY harshly and are sent to a godawful juvenile prisonwhere starvation and neglect are the norm. Most of the film is set in this awful place and it's a fascinating historical portrait of this period of time in recent history. I could say a lot more about what happens there but I don't want to spoil the surprise. Suffice to say it's all very tragicand you might want to have some Kleenex nearby just in case.The biggest strength of the film is the realistic acting by all the kids. You don't get the impression they are acting but that really are kids sent to prison. Also although this might put some off the story's insistence that it NOT have a nice happy ending is also a plus. Although I don't want a steady supply of depressing movies I love that the film was not afraid to be sad in order to tell the story effectively. Well worth seeing and if you enjoy this film I suggest you then try The Children Are Watching Us nextit is in my opinion De Sica at his directorial finest.".

	schema:headline " Italy after WWII a small history lesson";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie follows a couple of young teenage friends Pasquale and Giuseppe who are trying to survive by shining shoes in the difficult conditions in Italy after WWII. Pasquale is homeless and has been sleeping in elevators while Giuseppe is a bit better off having a mother and brother living. However it is Giuseppe's brother who involves the two friends in selling army blankets on the black market. From their rather innocent involvement in this scheme the boys are ultimately arrested and sent to a prison for juveniles. The bulk of the movie takes place in the prison and it is there that things start going very wrong for the two friends leading to an ultimate tragedy. For me the power of the movie lies in its depiction of how a society on its ass creates a toxic environment that grinds people up in a downward spiral that they are powerless to control. I did not get the sense of any overarching evil on anybody's partpeople on all levels were just tying to get by. The movie portrays how the social structure was overwhelmed in its attempt to climb out of the hole left by the war.There were some things that seemed inconsistent with the stark realism. The two friends are seen saving up to buy a horse that is being rented out to upper class people. I appreciate the value of the horse as a symbol of freedom and how people who are down can still have dreams but was it realistic to think that the kids could buy the horse on income from shining shoes? The musical score often intruded with a sentimentality that seemed out of place. For kids who were supposedly on the verge of starvation the kids in the prison seemed remarkably healthy even the small kid with tuberculosis.I found the commentary track on the DVD to be of interest since it made some points that I would otherwise not have noticed like how the filming of the two friends mimics their relationshipclose together on the screen at first and later separated.This is an example of how a quality movie can inform you about a small slice of history in a more effective manner than reading history books.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie follows a couple of young teenage friends Pasquale and Giuseppe who are trying to survive by shining shoes in the difficult conditions in Italy after WWII. Pasquale is homeless and has been sleeping in elevators while Giuseppe is a bit better off having a mother and brother living. However it is Giuseppe's brother who involves the two friends in selling army blankets on the black market. From their rather innocent involvement in this scheme the boys are ultimately arrested and sent to a prison for juveniles. The bulk of the movie takes place in the prison and it is there that things start going very wrong for the two friends leading to an ultimate tragedy. For me the power of the movie lies in its depiction of how a society on its ass creates a toxic environment that grinds people up in a downward spiral that they are powerless to control. I did not get the sense of any overarching evil on anybody's partpeople on all levels were just tying to get by. The movie portrays how the social structure was overwhelmed in its attempt to climb out of the hole left by the war.There were some things that seemed inconsistent with the stark realism. The two friends are seen saving up to buy a horse that is being rented out to upper class people. I appreciate the value of the horse as a symbol of freedom and how people who are down can still have dreams but was it realistic to think that the kids could buy the horse on income from shining shoes? The musical score often intruded with a sentimentality that seemed out of place. For kids who were supposedly on the verge of starvation the kids in the prison seemed remarkably healthy even the small kid with tuberculosis.I found the commentary track on the DVD to be of interest since it made some points that I would otherwise not have noticed like how the filming of the two friends mimics their relationshipclose together on the screen at first and later separated.This is an example of how a quality movie can inform you about a small slice of history in a more effective manner than reading history books.";

He almost has a free pass to make my top directors list I just got to fill his next 3 spots. In retrospect Shoeshine has brilliant plotting and characterisation. It takes emotionally motivated turns and has well constructed cruel ironies. Unfortunately it struggles with its execution. It's not as tightly edited or shot as his two later films often making scenes confusing and key plot points are missed. The score and performances of which I recognise are from amateurs can be too melodramatic. Its atmosphere ends up feeling inauthentic. Umberto and Bicycle were great for their subdued portrayals of inner pain I wish Shoeshine was the same. I would love to rank this film among those two as its screenplay is really great but both the crew in front and behind camera let it down. Still has a punch though and gets more engaging as it goes along. Great decision to have most of the film take place in that great set of a juvenile prison.710".

The movie starts on a perky note  two boys close friends exuberant at having bought a horse they both love. One is almost lulled into thinking that this will be a buoyant movie about friendship and a horse. It turns out to be several shades darker. It is De Sica's genius that he can pull you in so quickly and make you feel such strong empathy for the two boys as they are brutalized by life within a short span of a few days their friendship souring and spiraling down towards an ominous end. Be warned this is a depressing movie. But it is a gem nonetheless and I know that several scenes will remained etched in my mind forever. In particular De Sica captures in a starkly beautiful manner the quicksilver bonding and the territorial rivalries of the boys trapped in a bleak Dickens' style detention center. A must watch for any fan of that strain of Italian cinema from the 1940s and 50s.".

There are moments where the plot actually imposes itself on the viewing of the film where the action takes on a genre quality that isn't entirely successful for me.MINOR SPOILERThe escape from the children's prison for example feels like it could have been taken from any narrative film and seems out of place in a film whose essential story is about the depths of friendship and the longing for simple pleasures if you call a horse a simple pleasure in postwar Italy. The bumbling court and police sequences also seem far too scripted.I suppose my principle problem is the performance by Rinaldo Smordoni as Giuseppe one of the two shoeshineboy heroes of the film. He seems much too selfconscious as if mugging to the camera. Compare this with other child performances in DeSica's films including Franco Interlenghi's Pasquale in this film and I think it's clear that there's a decent sized hole in the center of Shoeshine.That being said the major flaw hardly keeps Shoeshine from being heartbreaking in that Oh God since this is Neorealism something horrible's bound to be lurking around the corner way.  DeSica was a master at that. He understands that in a wartorn country sometimes caring too much like Pasquale or the kind hearted supervisor of the prison can be the greatest mistake.The print that I saw projected and 35 mm was missing complete subtitles. I think all of the important stuff was translated but tiny conversations were mostly ignored. I don't suppose this had anything to do with my take on the film but it's still worth mentioning.Probably still a 7.510".

Taking place in war ravaged Italy the film features the stories of two young shoeshine boys who are tasked with delivering black market goods and get caught in a web of intrigue. Once they are caught by the police their friendship is challenged when they're sent to an overcrowded boy's penitentiary.The majority of the film takes place in the penitentiary where the two boys Franco Interlenghi and Rinaldo Smordoni are separated from each other almost instantly. Forced into separate cells each holding five boys they become the center of their own maelstroms when one mistakenly betrays the other. I won't ruin the whole picture other than mentioning that the main source of motivation early on is a horse they bought together.The period sets the tone for the film. Despite a bouncy score that highlights every small victory experienced by the characters the lack of sustenance and poor conditions of life in and out of the penitentiary keeps things gloomy. The boys eat gruel which the warden calls passable medical help is slow and ineffective and beds are riddled with lice. Even one of the more kindhearted superiors finds objection to the state of things. Yet at one point one of the boys calls his new home paradise because of its only slightly better living standard than sleeping in an elevator.The film is considered one of the first Italian neorealist works which would leave an indelible mark on Italian cinema and movies worldwide. The form contends with economic hardship and moral denigration as a canvas. Many times they would shoot in and around the streets of Italian cities and even hire nonprofessional actors to intensify the realism. Often this was for practical reasons. The aftermath of World War Two left the film industry previously under the close watch of Mussolini unable to maintain their studios.The Bicycle Thieves stands as the pinnacle of Italian neorealism but for my money Shoeshine is the better movie. Both stories are quite compelling but from an outsider's perspective the multiple Italian customs and the research required to understand them are much morea plenty in Bicycle Thieves. Additionally the main characters of Shoeshine are children no older than twelve. While in many cases this would be a slight when comparing one movie to another the actors in Shoeshine act much more authentically to their predicament. There is one scene where the boys trot a horse down the street as the other shoeshine boys either cheer in zeal or jeer in jealousy. They preen and strut like they're the talk of the town the belle of the ball or to put another way two poor kids with a horse. How can you not smile at that image?There is a famous review of Shoeshine by the famous Pauline Kael where she mentions a  petulant voice of a college girl complaining to her boyfriend 'well I don't see what was so special about that movie.' She then claimed alienation from those who could not experience the radiance of Shoeshine. In many ways I feel the same about it.

The time line is fairly stable and simple to followexcept parts of the endwhich makes for an enjoyable experience. Without worrying about when things are happening you are free to instead concentrate on WHY they are happening.I really liked the video game plotit was entertaining enough just to watch the gamers get so into it! Everything is interconnected so it kept me interested enough to look past the jumpy parts to the underlying meanings and symbolism.The characters were fairly dynamic and complex and the acting was much better than I expected. I actually FELT for them an element often missing from horror films. The procession of events may have been slightly predictable at times but the characters remained real and believable throughout. I was happy to see that everything wasn't discarded simply in the name of gore.The lighting was surprisingly good for this genreevery scene was welllit and easy to make out what was happening. The colors were perfect to set the mood and the cinematography was on the better side of average no complaints here.Overall although the ending was a bit of a letdown I believe this is worth seeing if you like horror movies that also make you THINKit's not all about scares. I'm also a novice gamer so I might have appreciated it more than a nongamerI don't know.In conclusionit's worth a shot.".

Directed By William Brent Bell Starring Jon Foster Frankie Muniz Samaire Armstrong and Sophia Bush Runtime 85 minutesTO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT7 out of 10. Not very scary but it is enjoyable.THE LONG VERSIONOK. I was not expecting much from this flik from the getgo. Script although more original than most of the crap movies to come out lately was still nothing ground breaking. And having a relatively unknown director on the project wasn't giving this film any better buzz. Then the trailer was released which made this movie look even worse. So today I see a matine for this film with a friend of mine and I'm surprised to find myself watching a genuinely interesting film.Is it scary? Not really. There's a few boo scares thrown around but none of them really work. I like during some of the creepy scenes how silent it was but it never really paid off properly. Is it at least suspenseful? Yes. It is in fact very suspenseful. There are some really cool chase scenes and some pretty decent what was that!? moments. Is it gory? No. The pictures were as most suspected quick shots in the film and you barely saw any of it. This was of course to keep this flik pg13. That's annoying but whatever I could get over it rather quickly.Editing Directing etc. was all pretty solid nothing shocking but nothing horrible either. And now to the part most people are probably interested in How was the video game sequences? Awesome. This is by far the best part of the movie. When it goes into the video game it gets really cool. The beginning shines best in this particular style the movie goes for. With some creepy Samara like ghosts crawling around and plenty of stabbing the video game sequences are the scariest and goriest parts of the flik. These are the scenes that truly shine.So what else can I say? It's an enjoyable flik that floats in mediocrity until the video game sequences. Thats when it shines. Which makes this a 7 rather than a 6 out of 10.All in all Not very scary but suspenseful. A pretty solid film that can entertain you but there will definitely be haters. I say lean back and enjoy a decent rental when it's released on DVD that is It will be worth the 68 bucks you pay for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A group of teenagers discover a bootleg video game but once they start playing it they each start dying just like they do in the video game. As they become addicted to the game they need to find a way to beat the game's central villain The Blood Countess before she kills them all.The premise does sound a little stupid and familiar but this film could have still been mildly entertaining. However this horror movie is not scary at all. It's actually more of a comedy than anything else. The film takes itself way too seriously and the movie is not a lot of fun to watch. Sure there is the occasional laugh but for the most part the film is very dull. PG13 horror films can still be good like The Ring or Cry Wolf. The Ring and Stay Alive aren't really the same type of horror film though. Stay Alive is more of a slasher movie and since its rated PG13 the death scenes are very tame. It should have been the movie's main sell and since it had an interesting concept the deaths could have been really good. Unfortunately the studio wanted a bigger audience and the film had to be altered.The acting is a complete joke and most of the cast give awful performances. Jon Foster is not a very good leading man. He lacks charisma to really engage the audience or for the audience to care about him. His character isn't unlikable just very bland. Samaire Armstrong actually gives an okay performance though a little too bland to truly stick out. Frankie Muniz probably gives the best performance in Stay Alive. That's an honor on the level of being the best player on the Houston Texans. Sophia Bush is absolutely terrible as October. Her performance feels so rushed and so fake. The most annoying character in the movie is Phineas played by Jimmi Simpson. His character is so unlikable you will be rooting for him to die.In fact most of the characters are pretty unlikable so that makes it even harder to become interested in the film. It's just hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying kids and it's a lot more fun to watch if you want the characters to actually survive. The only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. It's a little old but it still kind of works. The film is also really short so it's not too much of a pain to sit through. I wouldn't really blame the cast though because they were working with an inexperience director and writer. The direction is not very good and the screenplay isn't much better. Stay Alive is actually not the worst horror film of 2006. That honor would go to When a Stranger Calls. Stay Alive is still a missed opportunity though. In the end this cheesy and lame horror film is better left on the shelf. Rating 410.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK I actually just saw the movie today and I gotta say it's not too bad. Yeah it's not that scary and while the script in and of itself is mildly very mildly original the dialogue and the reactions of the gamers remains hopelessly clich. That is the world of horror unfortunately. So why do I like this movie? Because I didn't go to get scared obviously the movie is PG13 I didn't go to critique it though I guess that's what I'm doing now. I went to get a good hour and a half of entertainment. And boy was I entertained.Let's start with the premise of the movie. A group of attractive 20something gamers find this new underground video game called Stay Alive where the objective is the title. Despite the fact that the main character's friend died shortly after playing it the gamers decide to give it a go. They find the effects creepy and fulfilling but the fun ends there when one of their group the main character's boss dies in exactly the same way as his avatar in the game. It just escalates from there. Now I'm a big fan of games with an interesting plot so if this were a game I would totally play it.A lot of people were complaining about the CG effects. I liked them. It was supposed to look like a video game. I realize the normal route was to have these characters look real when they step off the computer screen but I thought it looked so much cooler when it seemed like the game itself was killing you. Some of it seemed far too reminiscent of Japanese horror but considering that's the trend these days I let it go. Overall I loved the fact that the demon children and the crazy Countess looked exactly like the game until the very end.The characters themselves were fun. You had the goth chick but what I liked about her was that she wasn't the stereotypical I'm creepy and dark and depressed chick that always seems to grace these movies. Then there was her brother whom I was alternating between laughing at and wanting to hit. The main character Hutch I believe was cute enough that I didn't really care whether or not he was cool. Swink played by Frankie Muniz was utterly adorable. The only one that I didn't get was the blonde Abigail. Why the hell was she there? To create suspense to be another love interest for Hutch? I really wanted her to be evil. That would have made so much sense in the long run. I mean she shows up at Loomis' funeral and suddenly becomes buddies with Hutch and then later his new girlfriend after the goth chick dies. That entire relationship I could have done without. I would have absolutely LOVED it if she turned out to be some psycho obsessed with the game or something. But whatever. She was decent too.The only part of the movie that I didn't like which always drives me nuts is the fact that they never mention why and how the game was created. The company apparently was the plantation itself but who made it? The Countess? That doesn't make sense to me. I get the idea of mixing an old ghost story with today's technology. I find that fascinating. But how does a Civil Warera ghost come up with the idea of making a video game to further her evil purpose and then manage to go through with it? Also how did she manage to distribute it after she was supposedly destroyed? If there is one thing that can tie a movie together for me it's a good backstory.Other than that I found the movie enjoyable and I would definitely watch it again when it comes on TV. If you're looking for hardcore horror look elsewhere. But if you want some fun with a great ghost story then definitely watch this. If anything you can have fun with rooting for who dies next.".

Sure I liked the Silent Hill and other 1st person survivalhorror references but c'mon. The acting was so horrible it sounded like they were TRYING to sound like the voice acting from the first Resident Evil game. I was waiting for a master of lockpicking quote to be said. Not only was the acting bad the special effects were horrible and lame as well. The way Countess Bathory looks in the gamemovie I would be surprised if she frightened the toddler we had behind us with his family. In fact I recall the kid giggling during one scene. And correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't Countess Bathory in Europe? In fact I believe she was in Transylvania. How is it possible for them to get to her plantation when they are in New Orleans? Or did I just miss something there? Luckily I know a guy who works there and he got us all in for free because I would have kicked myself for paying to see this movie.

It just makes the audience feel cheated and resentful to the characters. Its a shame that horror flick cannot be more intelligent. 'The Ring' was great and it looks like a great beginning for the new age of scary intelligent movies but this movie push the genre back a few notches.Basically there should be 2 types of scary movie 1 intelligent ones and 2 stupid but with lot of TA. This movie is stupid without the TA replaced by really nicely rendered video game scenes. guess that is not enough to please the audience.".

'The Ring' was great and it looks like a great beginning for the new age of scary intelligent movies but this movie push the genre back a few notches.Basically there should be 2 types of scary movie 1 intelligent ones and 2 stupid but with lot of TA. This movie is stupid without the TA replaced by really nicely rendered video game scenes. guess that is not enough to please the audience.";

Some of it was terrible but I blame the script more than the actors some of those lines were impossible to deliver realistically. The plot was ehh well you already know the plot. It was not the strong point of the movie to say the least. The thing that really bothered me was the fact that the movie cut away right before everyone got killed. I guess that's what happens when you make a PG13 horror movie. I get the feeling this movie would have been a LOT better if they had just let it get an R rating and include all of the violence. Violence doesn't necessarily make a good movie but in this case what else would you watch this movie for? It doesn't build tension very well and is generally not very scary. The makeup for the countess looks pretty good she is a creepy looking woman.All together the movie wasn't terrible. It was at least entertaining to some extent. Don't expect to be scared unless you are a 14 year old girl. 410 stars.".

I wanted to see it mainly because of Sophia Bush. Shes my idol..but it turned out to be pretty freaky. Its about a video game that once you die in the game you get killed by a mysterious force the same way you did in the game. Actually...a countess comes and kills you when you die in the game. After Hutch's friend dies Milo Ventimiglia mysteriously he wants to find out what happened. At his funeral he meets his new friend AbigailSamaire Armstrong Milo's sister gives him the game and he and his friends get trapped in playing it. I agree the idea is kind of cheesy but it does effect the friends bad. Sophia Bush plays October who is one of Hutch's friends. She works at a coffee shop and she has a pretty important role. If you like Sophia bush or are a fan of One Tree Hillwhich I'm not or liked her in John Tucker Must die or Supercrossnot a good movie then go for it. But if you like scary movies...go for it as well. She did a good job even though the countess gets to her. I will spoil the ending by telling you three friends live and don't die and they manage to beat the countess. I really enjoyed this movie and I know you will too. I'm glad it was PG13.".

	onyx:emotionText "My friend was telling me to take him to the movies and I didn't know what movie I could take him to...so I decided to take him to see Stay Alive. I wanted to see it mainly because of Sophia Bush. Shes my idol..but it turned out to be pretty freaky. Its about a video game that once you die in the game you get killed by a mysterious force the same way you did in the game. Actually...a countess comes and kills you when you die in the game. After Hutch's friend dies Milo Ventimiglia mysteriously he wants to find out what happened. At his funeral he meets his new friend AbigailSamaire Armstrong Milo's sister gives him the game and he and his friends get trapped in playing it. I agree the idea is kind of cheesy but it does effect the friends bad. Sophia Bush plays October who is one of Hutch's friends. She works at a coffee shop and she has a pretty important role. If you like Sophia bush or are a fan of One Tree Hillwhich I'm not or liked her in John Tucker Must die or Supercrossnot a good movie then go for it. But if you like scary movies...go for it as well. She did a good job even though the countess gets to her. I will spoil the ending by telling you three friends live and don't die and they manage to beat the countess. I really enjoyed this movie and I know you will too. I'm glad it was PG13.";

I see what they mean ... and to me this sort of suggests the two things about this flick that I really liked the most.One is it's a good solid horror flick built on a good solid horror story. Nothing superoriginal or exceptional ... just good sound basic scary movie type features from one end to the other. Works for me! The other thing I really liked is that it's steeped in what I take to be contemporary electronic game culture. This is a culture I really just plain don't know at all except for snippets I get here and there. I'm 52 years old and a step son introduced me years ago to a then current version of the game Doom. I sort of went nuts about it for several weeks then deleted it off my computer so I couldn't get addicted to it again. And that's my sum total personal experience with electronic gaming. But enough that watching this brought back some of the old sensations ... not in a bad way either. And the general young adult culture of the Game that this movie depicts sure looks authentic tho others will have to comment more reliably on that. But it's a walk through a culture that I really enjoyed.That combo ... Ringlike video Story on one hand HereandNow Reality on the other ... and the way the two intersect ... horribly this being a horror movie ... that's a sort of interlayering that I just really really enjoy.The acting and characterizations were all solid Munoz deserving special mention in his especially convincing geeky characterization. Cinematography was good scripting very solid plot very fine all the elements worked together to make a really cool fun horror flick set in the young folks' gaming subculture. Check it out good movie!".

The cutting away from the violence didn't get on my nerves the way I thought it would the directing isn't all that bad.The characters one in particular kept slinging catchphrases which got on my nerves but not to the point that I totally disliked them. This film doesn't make the mistake that most PG13 films do Pulseremake of showing too much. The ending doesn't really have a twist so much as an open ending so for that I'm grateful. They didn't try to explain too much perhaps in this case too little instead. The movie wasn't necessarily scary but unlike every other PG13 film in this genre I can understand why it might scare some people.All in all it was better than I expected. Not ultra violent but then I don't see why a supernatural film would need to be. Muniz got on my nerves but then take his character from Malcolm in the Middle out of the context of that show and into something a little more serious and thats bound to happen. That's what they did here.Not great not terrible. But good. I'd say a 8 out of 10.".

Goku meeting Bulma Oolong and Yamcha arriving at Muscle Tower fighting Major Metalletron which was way too short here and meeting Android 8 Eighter finding the sea turtle and meeting master Roshi the giving the Flying Nimbus to Goku Bulma flashing her....ok that doesn't tie in the story but meeting Roshi would just b incomplete without that. lol and finally Assistant Black killing Commander Red and fighting Goku in a giant robot which is about 3 times as big here than in the show and a LOT more powerful. the one plothole in the movie is where Bulma neglects to tell Goku that he'll lose his grandfather's dragon ball once the wish is made. the wish made at the end of the film is for Android 8 to come back to life as he was destroyed while fighting Black's giant robot. the film ends abruptly the moment Goku makes his wish. we don't even see Eighter revived or even Goku's reaction to losing his ball or even any idea of what becomes of our heroes afterwards. this abrupt ending is my only complaint about this masterpiece of a Dragon Ball film. if you're a dbzgt fan go check this out!".

Benda Bilili  in English See Beyond is the name of this Kinshasa band which has acquired a global following. Chances of success were slim at first for these homeless handicapped artists who struggled to survive on the streets of their dilapidated capital. Benda Bilili is not a music film it's the story of a dream that became reality. And a plunge into the streets of Kinshasa without a safety net.";

There are ups and downs as life isn't always easy in one of the poorest countries on earth especially when you have just a sheet of cardboard on which to sleep.The two filmmakers started to befriend the leader of the band Ricky and after becoming enchanted by Benda Bilili's terrific music they decided to help the small group make a recording. At the time they had no idea that their commitment would take five years. The other striking character is young Roger a street child with a gift for music at the beginning of the documentary a man and an accomplished musician at the end of the film. It's moving to watch him grow escaping from gang life and God knows what and making his dreams come true. It's too bad though that we don't learn much about the members of the band but given the budgetary restraints under which the film was made I think that it was merely impossible for the filmmakers to delve into this subject.Look out for Benda Bilili! if you can especially of you dig in African music orand cinma vrit.".

	schema:reviewBody "Benda Bilili! Is a 2010 documentary about a group of disabled musicians from Kinshasa Congo who use rudimentary and hand made instruments to produce wonderful rumba and reggae music. The band are followed from 2004 to 2010 by French film makers Renaud Barret and Florent de La Tullaye as they progress from living on the streets and practicing at the city's zoo to recording an album and touring Europe. The film focuses on the struggles of the various members and those around them and upon their influence in the city and especially on the young street kids who follow and assist them.The band use strange hand peddled tricycles to get about as most of the members suffer from Polio and are unable to walk. Their songs are about their lives on the streets from being laughed at for being handicapped to songs about sleeping on cardboard. Bad things keep coming at the various members but they never let it get them down and remain focused on making a better life for themselves and their families. In one scene the leader of the band Staff Benda Bilili a street papa called Ricky Lickabu receives a call to say that the shack that he has been staying at has been burned down. He simply turns to the camera and says these things happen in life. He is later seen sleeping on the street with his wife and four children.Along with Ricky another one of the stars of the film is Roger Landu who was introduced to the band by the French film makers. Landu fashioned his own instrument using an empty tin can a twig and string and is able to make incredible music from just one high pitched twang. After joining the group as a shy but dedicated young boy by the end of the film he is on stage in France performing solos lying on his back on stage ala Jimi Hendrix to the delight of the paying crowds. It's a fantastic story.All the way through the members of the band are sure to try to educate those around them about the likes of hard work and vaccinations and even share out what little money they make between their various hangers on. The street children who surround the band who have had no formal education speak with more wisdom and knowledge than I've ever heard come from a Western child. They are aware of their surroundings what has caused them and the various legal and illegal ways out and debate amongst themselves the various possibilities of their future. It's heartbreaking.One theme throughout the film is everyone's desire to get to Europe. Europe is almost treated as a mystical place where anything is possible. Some people have misconceptions such as one child who tells his young friend that Europe is a country that God put here so we can compare it to our own. Everyone knows that their best chance of survival is to make it to Europe and the streets of Europe's cities are testament to the fact that many get here.Benda Bilili! is a thoroughly uplifting film though you have to get through some pretty rough viewing to get there. The story and people are life affirming and the music is excellent.www.attheback.blogspot.com".

The filmmakers make no pretense at staying removed and objective. They are just as won over and in time actively become a part of trying to raise enough money to help these men live their dream to record and to travel with their music.

	schema:reviewBody "A seemingly heartless conman Sergio Castellito goes around postWorld War II Sicily filming most everyone for a price and leads villagers to believe that he is a talent scout for a film studio. Naturally many flock to the apparently kind stranger and do what they can to escape lives of poverty and unhappiness. Castellito meets up with many vivid characters but none more so than the beautiful Tiziana Lodato in her first screen role. Soon the young lady is begging Castellito to take her to the land of moviemaking and in the process he falls in love with her and acquires a conscience. Apparently he may change his ways and then again maybe not but it becomes very clear that the local authorities may catch up to Castellito before the film runs its course. The Star Maker was a Best Foreign Language Film nominee at the Academy Awards in 1995. Cowritten and directed by horribly underrated Italian filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore who struck Foreign Language Oscar gold in 1989 with Cinema Paradiso one of my alltime favorite pictures The Star Maker is a flawed work because of a strange tone that makes it an uneven experience at times. Humorous situations early point the way to a freewheeling comedy but soon drama sneaks in and by the end the drama has literally chased the early comedic routines away. The performers come and go but Lodato's appearance about halfway through was enough to put the movie over the top. She just shines in a film of illuminated darkness and ultimately steals the show from Castellito by the heartbreaking finale. Tornatore was able to grab everyone with Cinema Paradiso. Regardless of whether you liked that film or not you should have cared for the primary characters. The Star Maker is a little more difficult in that regard. It holds its audience at arm's length most of the time and almost never hugs as tight as it should have. The final haunting scenes are reminiscent of the emotionallycharged montage to the magic of motion pictures in Cinema Paradiso and thankfully by that point most everything was presented well enough to make The Star Maker an important and worthy addition to the Italian world of films. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

This time at the end of the forties a bad guy goes on the road of a very poor Italia pretending to be a scout for movie studios of Rome. But in fact his camera was stolen and had no tape in it.  He steals money from these poor people full of dreams to become movie stars.  Sometimes they talk with their hearts with very deep emotions but the man don't care.  One day a teenager takes very seriously her faith to be a movie star and goes with the bad man.  Her love tortures the man. This is a strong statement about celebrity dreams and poverty. Sergio Castellito one of the best actors of Italy gives a very strong performance so is the charming young Lodato Gee! Isn't she beautiful?  This movie is one of the best of the risky genre of movies about movies.  For me it's the third best of the kind after Woody Allen Purple Rose of Cairo and of course Cinema Paradiso.

	schema:reviewBody "Joe Morelli Sergio Castellitto is a flimflam man who is driving around the rural villages of Sicily shortly after World War II selling potential stardom for fifteen hundred lira. He has a motion picture camera and loudspeaker on his truck. As he drives through the villages he broadcasts to the people that he is from the film industry of Roma and he is giving screen tests in order to discover natural talent.He sets up his truck and tent typically in the town square. His technique is to tell everyone that they have a wonderful face hidden talent that they are naturals and diamonds in the rough. He hands out fliers with some dialogue from Gone with the Wind on them that they should practice reading before appearing before his camera. He has discovered that people will fall for his flattery and pay him for the fake screen tests.As we watch the film we discover that people will put their hearts and souls into the experience of appearing before his camera. They don't just read the lines from Gone with the Wind. They tell their life stories in miniature. They bare their hearts and souls to the flimflam man in the hope that someone will hear and see their anguish their pain their experience. To Morelli who has been to Hollywood and failed this is just a way to make a lira. He has a gift for the hustle and is blind to the real emotion that he evokes.A woman believes his teenaged daughter has the talent to make it in the movies. She begs Morelli to take her to Roma. She even has sex with him and promises to allow him to be her daughter's first lover. But Morelli moves on to the next town. He is stopped by the local police chief but Morelli manages to flatter him into appearing before his camera and then applauds the chief's performance. Three highwaymen stop to rob Morelli. He is able to convince them that Roma longs for their raw talent. And so on as he travels over the cobblestones and over the winding roads.Finally he meets beautiful Beata Tiziana Lodato who is 15 or 18. She isn't sure. She works in the convent bathing the sick and scrubbing the floors. She exposes herself to the local tax man to raise the 1500 lira needed for Morelli's screen test. She is strikingly beautiful from head to toe and the tax man exclaims You are a statue! when he sees her body. Morelli is reluctant to get involved with someone so young even though she throws herself at him. What happens after this I will not say since it would spoil the film for those who have not seen it. But watch for the con man to get conned among other things. Despite his villainy there is a sense that Morelli is a man that we can identify with and understand. I think it is this quality that director Giuseppe Tornatore has developed in his character that carries the film and Sergio Castellitto whom I saw recently in Non ti muovere Don't Move 2004 really becomes the part.Tornatore who made a splash with the critically acclaimed Cinema Paradiso 1988 wrote the original material here and worked on the script in addition to directing. While I thought Cinema Paradiso was an excellent film I liked this one even more. Both are original works of art but I found L'uomo delle stelle more engaging. Particularly striking are the beautiful village scenes the faces of the people and the photography of the Sicilian countryside and ruins.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

But the most powerful contrast is seen in the faces of the Sicilians during their screen tests.  Giuseppe Tornatore magically captures the hopes and the desperations of his wouldbe stars as they appear before the Dottore's' camera. They have two minutes to sell themselves and to escape their destiny of poverty and capture their life's ambitions.  Then there is the hero's moral dilemma.  This is an everyman' story il Dottore' is another poor guy who does what he can just to get by.

All universally saying the same thing that the sex is either superfluous or if relevant demeaning to women. Of course its demeaning to women it was intended to be. The guy is a rat bastard thats what the film is all about. This film takes place a long time ago in a place that still would be considered backwards. I don't understand what people expect to see but i assume its because they are fed a steady diet of Hollywood nonsense and have been for so long that anything that isn't the false matriarchal utopia Hollywood longs for as a reality in life upsets them greatly. Get over it already please. This film isn't any sort of great achievement but it is sucessful in portraying rather accuratly conditions in post war Italy. Womens attitudes in Europe differ greatly than that of their American counterparts and probably always will. They are as equally mystified by the total desexualization of our modern American society as we are by their willingness to openly confront issues we deem taboo.".

All universally saying the same thing that the sex is either superfluous or if relevant demeaning to women. Of course its demeaning to women it was intended to be. The guy is a rat bastard thats what the film is all about. This film takes place a long time ago in a place that still would be considered backwards. I don't understand what people expect to see but i assume its because they are fed a steady diet of Hollywood nonsense and have been for so long that anything that isn't the false matriarchal utopia Hollywood longs for as a reality in life upsets them greatly. Get over it already please. This film isn't any sort of great achievement but it is sucessful in portraying rather accuratly conditions in post war Italy. Womens attitudes in Europe differ greatly than that of their American counterparts and probably always will. They are as equally mystified by the total desexualization of our modern American society as we are by their willingness to openly confront issues we deem taboo.";

	schema:headline " Journey into sicily 1950's";
	schema:reviewBody "After the sicilianthemed Cinema Paradiso and Stanno Tutti Bene Giuseppe Tornatore returns with another motion picture heaviliy imbued into sicilian themes and modern history.  The vehicle he uses expose the audience of what Sicily is is by showing the daily travails of an intinerant quack who claims to be a movie talent scout that collects fees from the gullible audience for the expenses of the film trials and proofs.  This ploy reminds Fellini's Il Bidone in which a populace of northern Italy of the 1950's is shown through the experiences of a group of four swindlers. In front of the camera the individuals recite stories that are spontaneous to them.  It may be a family story.  It may be something they memorized. And sometimes it is something that in normal circumstances they would never reveal but here in front of a camera and a chance to be seen by the Rossellinis and the De Sicas of Rome in just two minutes of trial length they literally confess their lifetime secrets and beings to the screening record.  All sorts of characters are displayed  Male and Female Young and Old Straight and Gay Talkers and Mutes Carabiniere and Brigand Humble and Cocky. The Man from Rome after listening to days and days from his clients he concludes that the sicilian populace is an ignorant one something that is echoed by the doctor to whom he gives a lift with his truck to a rural site where a farmer was dying.  The scene of the doctor arriving in a hopeless medical situation is reminiscent of Cristo Si e' Fermato a Eboli. Interestingly enough in that film  the main character is a doctor who is advised by the Priest not to waste time with these ignorant people. Interesting parallels between these two  films. Moving from town to town with his beatup truck transporting his wares setting up a makeshift tent in public squares announcing his arrival through loudspeakers and collecting money from the audience we see Sicily. And just like Zampano' in La Strada by Fellini he teams up with a woman that ends up in a mental institution. We see all the sicilian characters  the Carabiniere may be like one in Giorno della Civetta  the Brigand may be like one in Salvatore Giuliano the Dongiovanni may be like one in I Basilischi and the indoor cafe crowds may be like the ones seen in L'Avventura.  Sicily is a state of mind.  So many motion pictures have tried to portray it.While the stories in Salvatore Giuliano I Basilischi and L'Avventura were current to when these motion pictures were made early sixties more recently made motion pictures about Sicily retroactively show a how it once was attitute by showing a nostalgic remembrance of the populace and their lifestyles.  Kaos 1984 by the Taviani brothers shows an antiquated Sicily contrasted with their more current Uomo da Bruciare 1962. Cinema Paradiso is also a retrospective of sincegone lifestyles and relationships.  And this nostalgic attitude on the past as if the old days were better is a trademark of Giuseppe Tornatore exemplified in Stanno Tutti Bene in which a father is deceived by his children on their professional career status.  Even in Cinema Paradiso we get the impression that moviegoing was better in the old days.  The modern age and machine age brought us a detachment from each other.  In rural societies people are used to talk to each other.  So are craftmen working in small apprentice shops.  But in this modern age telephone operators working in cubicles are not allowed to socialize Stanno Tutti Bene.  And out of loneliness one can even die Stanno Tutti Bene.  So the old days of the rural south were better because people socialized.  And our itinerant equivalent of Zampano' is here to show us the audience who his audience is this populace of 1950s Sicily is. This motion picture shows great outdoor scenery of stone towns in Sicily. Great street scapes.  Great town squares.  Great ambience of small crowds in piazzas and indoor inside bars and cafes.  There are also some beautiful detailed scenes shot in architecturalyinteresting spaces indoors and outdoors.  The camera is moved around to show the dynamism of people moving about in a hill town.  Historically accurate there are outdoor scenes showing political party flags and posters of the Democrazia Cristiana of the 1950's and the Comunist Party congregations in the countryside attempting to regain farmland seen intensively in Uomo da Bruciare. But that is all I would reccomend seeing the movie for.  Otherwise I found the story weak and the portrail of the characters silly simplistic and stupid.  While in I Basilischi the characters are funny but intelligent here we encounter people that we must assume are idiotic.  The brigand for example is no Salvatore Giuliano.  Even the kid that is asked to simulate orgasm is portrayed in a silly manner.  With a large budget on filming a story about Sicily I think here there was a wasted opportunity to make a potentially good movie but lost its chance in silly portrail of its characters.".

Interestingly enough in that film  the main character is a doctor who is advised by the Priest not to waste time with these ignorant people. Interesting parallels between these two  films. Moving from town to town with his beatup truck transporting his wares setting up a makeshift tent in public squares announcing his arrival through loudspeakers and collecting money from the audience we see Sicily. And just like Zampano' in La Strada by Fellini he teams up with a woman that ends up in a mental institution. We see all the sicilian characters  the Carabiniere may be like one in Giorno della Civetta  the Brigand may be like one in Salvatore Giuliano the Dongiovanni may be like one in I Basilischi and the indoor cafe crowds may be like the ones seen in L'Avventura.  Sicily is a state of mind.  So many motion pictures have tried to portray it.While the stories in Salvatore Giuliano I Basilischi and L'Avventura were current to when these motion pictures were made early sixties more recently made motion pictures about Sicily retroactively show a how it once was attitute by showing a nostalgic remembrance of the populace and their lifestyles.  Kaos 1984 by the Taviani brothers shows an antiquated Sicily contrasted with their more current Uomo da Bruciare 1962. Cinema Paradiso is also a retrospective of sincegone lifestyles and relationships.  And this nostalgic attitude on the past as if the old days were better is a trademark of Giuseppe Tornatore exemplified in Stanno Tutti Bene in which a father is deceived by his children on their professional career status.  Even in Cinema Paradiso we get the impression that moviegoing was better in the old days.  The modern age and machine age brought us a detachment from each other.  In rural societies people are used to talk to each other.  So are craftmen working in small apprentice shops.  But in this modern age telephone operators working in cubicles are not allowed to socialize Stanno Tutti Bene.  And out of loneliness one can even die Stanno Tutti Bene.  So the old days of the rural south were better because people socialized.  And our itinerant equivalent of Zampano' is here to show us the audience who his audience is this populace of 1950s Sicily is. This motion picture shows great outdoor scenery of stone towns in Sicily. Great street scapes.  Great town squares.  Great ambience of small crowds in piazzas and indoor inside bars and cafes.  There are also some beautiful detailed scenes shot in architecturalyinteresting spaces indoors and outdoors.  The camera is moved around to show the dynamism of people moving about in a hill town.  Historically accurate there are outdoor scenes showing political party flags and posters of the Democrazia Cristiana of the 1950's and the Comunist Party congregations in the countryside attempting to regain farmland seen intensively in Uomo da Bruciare. But that is all I would reccomend seeing the movie for.  Otherwise I found the story weak and the portrail of the characters silly simplistic and stupid.  While in I Basilischi the characters are funny but intelligent here we encounter people that we must assume are idiotic.  The brigand for example is no Salvatore Giuliano.  Even the kid that is asked to simulate orgasm is portrayed in a silly manner.  With a large budget on filming a story about Sicily I think here there was a wasted opportunity to make a potentially good movie but lost its chance in silly portrail of its characters.";

	schema:reviewBody "A crazy homicidal man named Judd owns a shabby hotel in the Louisiana bayou and when he receives guests he goes out of his way to murder them and feed them to his pet crocodile. Some of these unexpected guests who face this horror that awaits them ranged from a reform hooker an unfortunate family and the hooker's father and sister who are looking for the missing girl.Tobe Hooper director and Kim Henkel cowriter the two who brought us one of the most powerful and groundbreaking horror films of all time The Texas Chainsaw Massacre team up again for their next independent Bgrade project the crzay exploitation piece Eaten Alive. The film's title has been renamed plenty of times by the distributors and also it's been labelled as Hooper's lost movie. It may lack the power raw intensity and realism that made TCM so nerve wrecking but this gruesome horror film doesn't hold back on the shocks and sleaze of the typical lowgrade horror that filled the late seventies. There's a sheer amount of gore and flashes of nudity evident compared to his previous film. Though it does come across as more of a comic book horror because of eccentric characters and outlandish setups. The absurd plot doesn't stand out as it's basically taken right off Psycho and doesn't make too much sense but the look of the film is terrific and it's high on atmosphere. The cheap sets and swampy terrain with its blankets of fog and wildlife sounds capture such a horrifying and morbid awe and there are some rather uncomfortable scenes that are sick and twisted. It's filled with adrenaline packed scenes of graphic if comical violence of crocodile munching and graceful blood splattering involving Judd's scythe. These thrilling sequences involve a chase through the swamp girl under the house and a sudden burst to the climax that ends with a whirlwind of sheer chaos. Another element that stands out is the rusty colour scheme which is rather murky and dull in tone because of the lighting. These under lit sets add to the disorientating and gritty feel. An eerie and high pitch music score is rather effective as it really nags away and makes it quite unsettling. Frantic edgy and encroaching camerawork is achieved to great effect. We get the usual sloppy and atrocious special effects that we see in cheap bfilms and the massive rubber crocodile looks real shoddy is no exception.The cast gives mostly amateur performances. Though there are some fine performances by Robert England Freddy Kruger fame in one of his first big screen roles as a horny local stud called Buck and when on screen he shines. Neville Brand as the mumbling and wandering Judd delivers it brilliantly. He totally captures the mentality of this crazed character. There are a lot of scenes where we just listen to the creepy Judd ramble on in a husky tone and meandering around the shadows that fill rundown hotel listening to country music and most of these sequences feel like they're dragging the pace. Marilyn Burns who also starred in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre plays Faye the mother of the annoying family who checks in and spends most of her time being gagged and then finishes off by screaming her lungs off. Good support by Mel Ferrer and Crystin Sinclaire as the prostitute's father and sister and Stuart Whitman as Sheriff Martin. Roberta Collins and Janus Blythe also appear. The dialogue is rather bad and inane at times but there's some added tongueincheek humour.It's definitely not in the same league of Hooper's previous effort The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Rather silly stuff but amusing lowbudget nastiness with good art direction and some sudden jolts of excitement.".

One reason for its seemingly firm place in the ranks of oblivion is its numerous title changes. Notwithstanding all this I found the film and watched it. The film is interesting bizarre unbelievable and disturbing. The setting is just a trifle too unimaginative to be taken for real as is the central character of Judd for the most part deftly played by Neville Brand. The plot too seems to be making its viewers accept too much for granted without really giving any knowledge of why Judd is the way he is etc... Despite these shortcomings the film has some of the truly most horrific scenes filmed. The scene in which Judd tries in vain to goad a young girl from under his hotel out is sheer terror. Other scenes in which he dispatches some of the hotel guests are equally effective. The film has a lot more going for it than its oblivious nature would suggest. It has fine performances an eerier setting and score and the taught tuned terror Tobe Hooper realized in his first great film.".

The setting is just a trifle too unimaginative to be taken for real as is the central character of Judd for the most part deftly played by Neville Brand. The plot too seems to be making its viewers accept too much for granted without really giving any knowledge of why Judd is the way he is etc... Despite these shortcomings the film has some of the truly most horrific scenes filmed. The scene in which Judd tries in vain to goad a young girl from under his hotel out is sheer terror. Other scenes in which he dispatches some of the hotel guests are equally effective. The film has a lot more going for it than its oblivious nature would suggest. It has fine performances an eerier setting and score and the taught tuned terror Tobe Hooper realized in his first great film.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' of course and Death Trap' less obvious already are the only two films Tobe Hooper should be really remembered for as a horror director. They both are raw and chilling explorations of the angry rural America. The location of this film looks like a giant swampy area homed by underdeveloped perverted rednecks and other freaks of society. Neville Brand terrifically portrays Judd the isolated owner of the Starlight Hotel. Judd suffers a bit from the incapability to communicate with people and the guests at his hotel are doomed to die as soon as they enter his facility. He also has a pet crocodile swimming underneath the porch of his hotel which is a pretty convenient method to get rid of human leftovers A poor rejected prostitute is the first to undergo Judd's murderous rituals. Her relatives soon come to search for her and are doomed as well. In the meantime the croc feeds on some more unfortunate by passers. Although I regard this as Hooper's second best film it doesn't come close to the power of TCMWhich kind of gives you an idea of how great I think TCM was! The settings and photography of Horror Hotel one of the film's a.k.a's look nasty and utterly cheap. Just as it did in TCM this actually increases the macabre atmosphere and you constantly feel something wicked is about to happen. The characters  although pretty imaginative  aren't as convincing as the Sawyer family but they too seem to come running straight out of a freakshow as well! There's Judd of course but also a very memorable Robert Englund who plays a retarded yokel with an obsession for anal sex. The screamqueen prototype Marilyn Burns returns as well before disappearing into actressoblivion forever. The crocodile as well as most other horror scenery looks really cheap but to me this only increases the trashfun value of this film. Highly recommended viewing as far as I'm concerned.".

The fiercely acrid and incisive script by Kim The Last Night at the Alamo Henkel Alvin F.

This pervasively seedy sense of moral erosion is best epitomized by sleazy and lascivious good ol' boy Buck a marvelously mean portrayal by Robert Englund in his firstever horror film role a swaggering and antagonistic redneck lout with an unsavory penchant for sodomy which suggests that underneath his macho hick veneer Buck is really a latent homosexual who's in complete denial about his true gay nature.

Robert Caramico's luridly stylized cinematography an odd atonal score by Hooper and Wayne Bell the firstrate soundtrack of melancholy country and western songs the blatant artificiality of the ratty sets and a terrific cast which includes Carolyn Jones Morticia on The Adams Family as a saucy whorehouse madam The Texas Chainsaw Massacre heroine Marilyn Burns as Finley's fedup longsuffering wife Crystin Ruby Sinclaire as Ferror's loyal loving other daughter Halloween 's Kyle Richards as a muchterrorized little girl Janus The Hills Have Eyes Blythe as a small town tramp and the everlovely Roberta Caged Heat Collins as a forlorn prostitute further enhance the ripely scroungy and brooding gloomdoom atmosphere of this shamefully underappreciated psycho horror exploitation winner.";

	schema:headline " Bizarre horror flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Eaten Alive is one of the weirdest most bizarre horror movies I've ever seen. Directed by Tobe Hooper following up on the success of his first film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Eaten Alive is about a junky old hotel run by an old guy more demented than Norman Bates ever was. So demented that he has a crocodile living in a pond right in front of the hotel. Anyway the plot of Eaten Alive goes pretty much like this people check in but they don't check out. However there's a twist. The insane hotel owner maimes the guests then tosses them to the croc. When you watch this movie ask yourself one question would you check into this hotel? It's grimy and ugly looking. At least the Bates Motel in the Psycho movies looked nice and clean. Obviously Eaten Alive was made on a low budget. Make that a very low budget. Director Hooper didn't jump into bigger budget projects until 1982's Poltergeist. Nevertheless even though Eaten Alive is preposterous it's kind of fun in a goofy sense. Neville Brand gives one of the craziest performances of alltime as that nut of a hotel owner who spends half the time mumbling to himself. Carolyn Jones the original Morticia Adams of TV's The Addams Family has a bit part as the owner of a nearby whorehouse a prostitute who gets fired unwisely goes to the yucky hotel right at the beginning of the film. Marilyn Burns reteamed with Hooper after Texas Chainsaw Massacre and stars here as a woman with a husband and daughter who regretably checks into the dump. And Robert Englund preFreddy Kruger appears as the local bad boy. Eaten Alive is a truly unusual film. In one way it's gruesome and gory but in another way it's witty and funny.12 out of four".

It is possessed of a special evil power most films don't have  an evil power to ruin a perfectly good day suck all the joy out of your heart and make you forget you'd actually been enjoying yourself or maybe even forget the whole IDEA of joy.I'd been having a good day when myself and a couple of friends sat down to watch one of the 2 shiny new movies I'd bought. The choice was Lucio Fulci's surreal zombie meltdown the Beyond or Death Trap Tobe Hoopers follow up to Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Being huge TCM fans we went for Death Trap after all Tobe Hoopers second film has to be worth watching right?Wrong wrong wrong wrong WRONG!So very very wrong.Death Trap is basically a cut price hillbilly Psycho rip off. At the start we meet a female character who fleeing from trouble stays at a grotty hotel where the nutcase owner shockingly kills her. Except where Norman Bates was fixated on his mother Judd has a pet crocodile. and you'll never see the end coming not in a MILLION YEARS!!!!....oh OK the croc eats JuddThen some more people show up including the worlds most annoying family and a mildly amusing Robert Englund as a horny redneck. Most of them die but not in any remotely interesting ways. Oh and a pet dog gets eaten by the crocodile possibly the highpoint of the film unless you really want to watch the future Freddy doing the nasty in which case my advice is  seek professional help!The main problem here is the pacing and the script and a lot of the acting and the unoriginality but hey lets stick to the pacing. The film is desperately slow and I can't believe it only runs the 87 minutes listed on the box. If so Death Trap must be possessed of another evil power  that same power doctors waiting rooms and tube station platforms have to make minutes seem like hours.Pretty much everything Hooper did right with TCM he messes up here. The film is ugly lacking in real atmosphere and just so damned slow! The fact that it's mostly filmed on one set and in overlong takes often makes it feel more like a film of a really bad play than an actual movie complete with horribly overwrought acting like the cast are playing to the folks at the back of the stalls.Worse there's no real tension  the only scene with any suspense has a child crawling under the hotel to escape the crocodile and using a child in jeopardy to provoke a response from the audience is a pretty cheap shot.Death Trap suffers the same problems as the 2004 Dawn of the Dead  it's not scary or really horrible or funny. It's just painfully boring it killed the vibe of a perfectly good day and made at least one of my friends fall asleep.There are all sorts of conspiracy's to try and explain exactly how come this film is so bad haven't these people seen Lifeforce??? like Hooper walked offwas sackedthe film was reedited by the producerthe distributorbigfootGeorge W. but the plain truth is that this is an illconceived poorly executed failure. You can see how Hooper was aiming for a similar effect to TCM the psycho killer in the clammy southern setting the sudden deaths and OTT performances but this time it just doesn't work. Perhaps it's the stagebound production but then perhaps it's just the crummy screenplay...Afterwards the only way to try to make the wasted 87 minutes seem worthwhile was to then lend the film to some TCM loving friends and inflict it on them too. They didn't rush to thank me.".

Retaining the mental redneck theme from his earlier success Eaten Alive is another trash horror highlight. While not nearly as good as Hooper's smash hit predecessor it gain's notability for it's malignant undertone and uncompromising violence not to mention the low budget styling and the aforementioned reptilian. The story this time follows a hotel owner that for one reason or another enjoys battering his guests and feeding them to the crocodile while they're still alive which isn't a bad premise for a movie at all in my opinion! The film is easily categorised under the subgenre of trash horror and on an objective level there is no doubt that this feature is a bad movie. However as it's uncompromising and has immense cult value horror fans will no doubt find lots to like about it. The location of the film is in a swamp and this makes for a great horror location as it's atmospheric and gives the film that foreboding feel that has made other films in the genre so good. The presence of Robert Freddy Kruger Englund adds to the cult value of the movie and this is a decent early performance from him. The acting on the whole is largely bottom drawer and over the top but when it comes to this sort of film what does it matter? I cant give this movie high recommendations but I can safely say that trash horror fanatics will like it and anyone that enjoys The Texas Chainsaw Massacre should seek this out too.".

I have taunted and teased quite a few times at school before just like the sexcrazed hillbilly Buck does to Judd. In one scene Buck and one of his girlfriends come to Judd's Starlight Motel searching for a room to do the nasty in. Judd denies Buck entrance into his motel but the sex addict redneck and his lady friend go in anyway.

Too much of red color n fake studio settings but nonetheless the cinematography editing n most importantly the acting of the psycho was good enuff. Given this was Hooper's follow up to one of the greatest horror films Texas chainsaw massacre ever made it brought with it some high expectations. Some may find shades of Psycho. Its about a hotel run by a psycho an older version of Anton Chigurh lookalike n his pet crocodile. The highlight of the movie ain't bah the croc but Neville Brand's portrayal of the psycho who kills the visitors with a scythe n sometimes jus pushes them in the pond to his gator. Ignore the viewers who complains bout the mechanical gator although some shots r effective in small doses. Jus enjoy the gruesomeness and the humor. It isn't all that scary but the sense of hilarity throughout n the kills especially the scythe piercing thru the cheeks was over the top. One great scene has Judd repeatedly slashing a victim with the scythe when suddenly the crocodile bursts through the rails on the porch and snatches the victim by the head and pulls him into the murky pond. The scene wher the psycho comes running with his scythe is comical n tension filled at the same time. Also the chase scene with the kid is full of tension. So there is enuff tension mayhem n enuff nudity. Its atmosphere madness surrealism gruesome sights and sleazy nature is immensely effective. Lots of veteran actors. Check out a very young Robert Englund n his dialogue my name is buck n m raring to ck. Tarantino included this line in Kill bill.".

	schema:headline " YEARNING  Incisive drama of postwar Japan from Mikio Naruse";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw YEARNING MIDARERU 1964 at a screening at New York's Asia Society on Dec. 3 2010. It's only the second film by Mikio Naruse that I've seen but I'm eager to see more. The first was WHEN A WOMAN ASCENDS THE STAIRS 1960 seen on Criterion DVD earlier this year. YEARNING is a quiet but emotionally honest drama about Reiko a war widow who has given her best years to her late husband's family managing their grocery shop while Koji her younger handsome brotherinlaw gambles drinks and loafs. The family plots to tear down the shop and build a supermarket in its place pushing Reiko out of the top position. Koji protests. When he decides to take a stand on more than one front it changes his relationship to Reiko and forces her to make a lifechanging decision.Naruse shoots in a spare classical style with syncsound recording both on location and in the studio and gets strong performances out of the entire cast. Yuzo Kayama whom I know primarily from period movies like SANJURO CHUSHINGURA and SWORD OF DOOM plays Koji as a spoiled son and brother who begins to mature before our eyes. Hideko Takamine plays the stillbeautiful 30something widow whose selfeffacing front hides her own submerged desires. She never acts on her own behalf but just dutifully runs the shop and waits for Koji to grow up. No matter what is happening in her heart she simply won't ask for anything or accept it when it's offered. Even when she makes her big move midway through the film it's only because she thinks it will help Koji. Reiko resembles an Ozu heroine while Keiko the lead character in WHEN A WOMAN also played by Takamine was more like a Mizoguchi heroine. The film was shot in widescreen blackandwhite and the action is set mostly in a small rural town far from Tokyo where a new supermarket loudly promotes itself and its cheaper prices causing hardship for the small shopkeepers like Reiko. This is why Koji's family wants to expand the storeto compete. Later the film stays with Reiko on a train ride for a long stretch wrapping up in a small picturesque resort town.YEARNING is not as complex or as layered as WHEN A WOMAN and Takamine's character was more outspoken and less selfeffacing in that film. But it's still a beautiful moving Japanese drama with an insistent subtext about the lingering effects of the war on Japanese families some 20 years later.Mie Hama the petite beauty who played Kissy Suzuki the Japanese agent who marries James Bond in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE 1967 appears in two memorable scenes as Koji's cute and fickle young bedmate who chews gum and spits it out on the floor of the shop and boasts a beauty shop hairdo like American teenage girls were wearing at the time. She's quite keyed into her own desires in a way that Reiko can only envy. When she was on screen I kind of wished the movie would stay with her for a while.The abrupt ending may leave some viewers unsatisfied. I would have preferred some kind of epilogue like the final scene of WHEN A WOMAN. However I've learned to accept that with certain filmmakers like Naruse one should take the ending on faith even if you don't get the reason for it right away.".

	schema:reviewBody "YEARNING MIDARERU. Viewed on Streaming. Restorationpreservation  seven 7 stars cinematography  seven 7 stars subtitles  five 5 stars music  two 2 stars. Director Mikio Naruse credited with writing the story delivers a photoplay packed with passionirony bitterness suffering perseverance and unrequited love to name a few humor red herrings the ending is pretty much a total surprise! and strong women Japanese business women are depicted to be as ruthless as their male counterparts all the while demonstrating mastery of the thennew widescreen format. It's quite a show! Typically Naruse's stories take place during times of societal change. In this case it examines how war widows deal with their fates and the challenges faced by traditional small family business from emerging largescale chain stores in this case food supermarkets. Stunning lead actress Hideko Takamine a bit on the chubby side? headlines a strong cast but easily steals or is allowed to steal every scene she is in she was one of Naruse's favorites. The explicit courtship of Takamine's character by the younger brother of her long deceased killed in the Pacific War husband they have lived in the same household and been secretly in love for quite some time is cleverly depicted by the Director during a long train ride towards the film's end. Another classic trainthemed movie sequence! Cinematography 2.351 black and white and lighting are understated but excellent. Subtitles need some grammatical adult supervision since they often fail to summarize the dialog and instead resort to speedoflight flash rates!. Textsignage is usually translated. Music is endtoend terrible. It consists of an impoverished riff on contemporary Italian film scores with a very short theme maybe 34 bars? repeated ad nausea. And it never fails to distract from every scene in which it is heard! Restorationpreservation is very good except for a few seconds of noise artifacts as the movie begins. Takamine's character finally lets her hair down or at least a few strands in the closing shots. Here her body language and facial expressions seem to summarize the film's plot line in a few seconds. Sagoi Desune! Amazing! Highly recommended. WILLIAM FLANIGAN PhD.".

Director Mikio Naruse credited with writing the story delivers a photoplay packed with passionirony bitterness suffering perseverance and unrequited love to name a few humor red herrings the ending is pretty much a total surprise! and strong women Japanese business women are depicted to be as ruthless as their male counterparts all the while demonstrating mastery of the thennew widescreen format. It's quite a show! Typically Naruse's stories take place during times of societal change. In this case it examines how war widows deal with their fates and the challenges faced by traditional small family business from emerging largescale chain stores in this case food supermarkets. Stunning lead actress Hideko Takamine a bit on the chubby side? headlines a strong cast but easily steals or is allowed to steal every scene she is in she was one of Naruse's favorites. The explicit courtship of Takamine's character by the younger brother of her long deceased killed in the Pacific War husband they have lived in the same household and been secretly in love for quite some time is cleverly depicted by the Director during a long train ride towards the film's end.

	schema:reviewBody "Mikio Naruse's film Yearning reflects the significant social change occurring in Japan in 1964 when supermarkets began to offer cheaper prices in order to drive out the small shops which had dominated the market. This changing structure particularly affects Reiko Hideko Takamine a widow since the last war after only being married for six months. She has remained with her husband's family to run the family grocery store along with her motherinlaw Shizu Aiko Mamasu while brotherinlaw Koji Yz Kayama and sisterinlaws Hisako Mitsuko Kusabue and Takako Yumi Shirakawa live their own private lives. Takamine's remarkable performance as the repressed widow conveys a longing for a freedom that has been elusive.The film opens as a van parades the streets advertising the supermarket driving past Reiko's store in the process. Shot in Naruse's quiet style the film is a study in contrasts. Reiko is a woman with traditional values who has repressed her own desire for companionship to serve her husband's family while Koji is a layabout who drinks and gambles and takes no responsibility for the family business. When a group of drunken businessman pressure bar girls to see how many eggs they can stuff into their mouths Koji intervenes and starts a fight leaving Reiko to bail him out of jail. Koji and his sisters make plans to build their own supermarket but conspicuously leave Reiko out of their plans urging her to remarry.Reiko is hurt by the family's seeming lack of appreciation for her service. She is accepting of her role but emotionally unprepared when Koji surprisingly confesses to her that he loves her. Though Reiko initially rejects his advances she tells him later when you said you loved me I felt glad and I've been a different woman since that day. She is unable however to accept Koji's telling her that she has wasted her life for his family. Though she hears the words she is too bound to the past to be able to acknowledge their truth. She tells Koji I didn't waste my life. I lived it but she is not convincing. The entire mood of the film changes with Koji's declaration and the way their relationship unfolds constitutes the emotional core of the film and provides its most dramatic moments and its shattering conclusion.".

It features one of Alain Delon's very best performances and an equally good supporting one from Giancarlo Giannini.  Delon plays a harddrinking and gambling professor of poetry who is fascinated by the sullenness of a beautiful studentSonia Petrovna and gradually falls in love with her. He finds out through his gambling buddies that she is involved in a pornographyprostitution operation of some kind. Zurlini's great film uses a slightly overthetop melodramatic style to delve deep into the existentialist despair of Delon's character as he hangs around the discos of a very liberal and swinging early '70s postsexualrevolution Italy depressed by all the empty people around him desperately trying to distract themselves any way they can. The underlying Antonionilike theme of people trying to distract themselves and merge into a crowd rather than individuate and painfully grow is very similar to that of Desert of the Tartars a film that couldn't be more different than The Professor on the surface. Dario Di Palma's deepfocus color cinematography in this film is one of the most breathtakingly gorgeous displays of virtuosity this side of Carlo Di Palma's softfocus work in Antonioni's Red Desert.".

Naturally all is straightened out in time for a happy ending although I can't say I detected any real chemistry between Bolger and Dayeven in a musical where logic doesn't really matter.The dances staged by LeRoy Prinz are not the best but there are some cheerful well staged moments when Bolger gets to do his tap routines and limber legged dancing. All in all it passes the time pleasantly if you have a weakness for musicals the way they were in the '50s. And Doris proves that singing wasn't her only asset. Her dancing is also very professional and not surprisingly she intended to become a dancer before an accident ruined her plans and she switched to singing.".

The letter was supposed to go to Ethel Barrymore instead. Doris had written the State Department about a work permit visa to work at a nightclub in Montreal. It's a faux pas of the highest order that State Department bureaucrat Ray Bolger has committed and he tries to rectify the situation. But when the press gets a hold of it the thing becomes a popular move. So Bolger's boss Paul Harvey puts him in charge of getting Doris's diplomatic etiquette up to speed. For better or worse Bolger and Day are going to spend April In Paris together. The popular Vernon DukeE.Y. Harburg standard serves as the title for this film and Warner Brothers got Vernon Duke to write the balance of the score with Sammy Cahn's lyrics. Nothing really outstanding here but the score fits well with styles of the two leads.Doris is great as always the problem here is Bolger and the part he plays. Ray Bolger was a great personality on stage who but for two roles never quite was able to translate the same popularity to the big screen. One role was of course the Scarecrow in The Wizard Of Oz and the other was the lead in Charley's Aunt. And both of those were comic parts.As a traditional screen lead Ray never quite made it. In fact in watching April In Paris I couldn't quite see what Doris saw in him. Of course with her attraction it was obvious as Bolger so succinctly put it 'What a Built'. Ray plays a traditional WASP stuffed shirt diplomat who is engaged to the demanding daughter of Harvey Eve Miller. Getting involved with Day was not an upward career move.Of course Doris sparks the attention of Claude Dauphin who's working his way back to France on the same ship that Bolger and Day and company are traveling. She has a nice number with Dauphin in a Parisian nightclub.Bolger's big moment on the screen is a very nicely staged fantasy number where portraits of Lincoln and Washington come alive and dance with him as Bolger dreams about his future. It was as creative as something Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire might have done.Still Ray is not quite leading man material and the film can't overcome that. Fans of Doris and Ray will like it though but I fear it's not one of Doris Day's best films.".

Bolger's dancing is phenomenal but the chemistry between them is not really there it's hard to believe they really like each other very much. The costumes are outrageous in a campy way  almost Busby Berkley level synchronized dance scenes. A fashionshow scene shows overdone eccentric outfits in various colors with French poodles dyed to match. In the last musical scene Doris starts out with a floorlength gold cape with minipleats radiating from her shoulders and then takes it off to show a bare midriff any current teenager would be proud of. The movie opens with some vintage scenes current to the time of the film of Washington DC complete with streetcars. But the most anachronistic element is the main theme of the plot which revolves around Bolger and Day coming close to sleeping together thinking they are legally married when in fact horrors!! they're not. In summary it's a great combination of lightweight plot eye candy good music and a few laughoutloud lines wrapped in the relative innocence of the fifties.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is fascinating to consider the two leads of this film in terms of their movie and stage success. Doris Day became one of the biggest popular singers of her day and then got a nice contract from Warner Brothers. Her image as the perpetually beautiful virgin who is your next door neighbor got pushed into our faces with films like ON MOONLIGHT BAY and TEA FOR TWO. But they were good films. The public never quite realized her good straight acting in films like LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME or THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. Bolger was in films from the 1930s but performances even good ones in films like ROSALIE were forgotten. Instead he lucked out early at MGM with the Scarecrow in THE WIZARD OF OZ a role nobody who saw it ever forgot. He did well enough in the 1940s but his best film again with Judy Garland  THE HARVEY GIRLS while showing him to advantage is just not as memorable. Bolger went back to Broadway did WHERE'S CHARLIE  a tremendous popular hit and then was lucky enough to get his performance on celluloid in the film version. He should have taken off. Instead he makes this film  again a nice one  and does very little other films afterward most notably the Disney version of BABES IN TOYLAND. A great dancer and entertainer but with two first rate performances on film he never got real film stardom.APRIL IN Paris was a decent musical for 1952 but as a followup to WHERE'S CHARLIE it lacks a degree of snap. WHERE'S CHARLIE was based on a classic English farce CHARLIE'S AUNT so it was really tried material that usually works The script for APRIL IN Paris was based on the Vernon Duke number that is a standard. But the rest of the score was not up to that standard although a song and dance number that Day and Bolger do together in the galley of the French ocean liner I'm Going'to Ring the Bell Tonight! is tuneful and bouncy. A later song between Claude Dauphin and Doris Day was also quite pleasant regarding Day's reaction to being in Paris. But neither of the latter two songs have ended up in the American songbook.The script is actually fairly typical for the period. Bolger is a rising figure in the State Department who is engaged to Eve Miller the daughter of Paul Harvey Bolger's boss. Bolger has set up an international cultural festival in Paris wherein America would have Ethel Barrymore representing us. But by one of those ridiculous errors that are used to stimulate the plots of comedies usually they can be explained away by simply owning up to them the invitation is sent to chorus girl Dynamite Jackson Day. Bolger tries to get it back but he is slowly attracted to Day. Still he has a difficult time convincing Harvey to replace Barrymore with Day to impress the French about our love of fun.I was thinking about how within a couple of years Day appeared in YOUNG AT HEART with Barrymore  it might have been interesting to have the famous actress appear for a scene or two reacting to this silly error.Bolger is trying to balance between his career in the diplomatic service which may lead to a political career and his growing affections for Day who is against the straight jacket approach of American Diplomacy forced down her throat by Harvey. Complicating matters is the side antics of Claude Dauphin who has to sneak back to France because of a diplomatic problem that Bolger would not help him with  Dauphin is working as a steward on the ocean liner and is unwilling to keep quiet with the crew or with the passengers including Doris. Eventually Bolger and Day decide to be married by the Captain of the ship and Dauphin is their witness. But the Captain is a fraud and so is the marriage. So Dauphin has to sabotage the wedding night as the nice Day and prickly Bolger are not legally entitled to sleep together. It is quite silly but it has some amusing moments when Harvey shows up and threatens Bolger to face up to his career responsibilities or face the end of his career. Harvey reading the diplomat's rule book to Bolger under an umbrella in a flooding cabin don't ask is a sight to see!It ends satisfactorily. But it is not as good as WHERE'S CHARLIE was and as a result it was not a good follow up to that film. Maybe if Bolger's follow up had been his Barnaby in BABES IN TOYLAND the film career problem would have been settled more satisfactorily.I have known only one person in my life who went far in the State Department. He was the smartest fellow in my high school graduating class and he would rise to the post of Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs. He still is a rather big wheel in his current job. I dedicate this review to him.".

All of their musicals  except the wonderful 'Yankee Doodle Dandy' and some later adaptations of Broadway musicals  are marred by extremely low budgets and obvious economy measures. 'April in Paris' is one of several Warners musicals featuring an established popular ditty with a stiff pricetag for performance rights as the movie's title song buttressed by some very forgettable songs by resident Warners tunesmiths. Except for one highspirited and highkicking number called 'Ring the Bell Tonight' only the E.Y. HarburgVernon Duke title song is memorable here.Doris Day amazes me not only for her unearthly beauty and her quiet sex appeal and for her underrated acting ability but also for her musical talents. I've read that Day originally trained as a dancer but switched to a career as a vocalist after she was injured in a car accident. Her singing voice is so clear and beautiful I've difficulty believing that singing was her second choice of career. And as she proves here she has no physical handicap as a dancer ... unless you count the dull choreography of LeRoy Prinz.Ray Bolger is an interesting choice of romantic leads for Day but the two of them don't really team very well. Here he plays a character very similar to the one played by Donald O'Connor in 'Are You with It?' a repressed wonk who turns out to be a superb dancer. Bolger an underrated actor is quite good in his straight scenes here as a harried bureaucrat a less nelly version of Edward Everett Horton ... but that character just doesn't match up with Bolger's dazzling dance numbers. Bolger's Massachusetts accent is much more obvious here than in any of his other films. Bolger was sometimes required to play epicene men as in the Broadway musical 'By Jupiter'. Here he's impressively virile as he strips off his dinner jacket and lights into some rapidfire nerve taps far more proficient than Ann Miller's.I always enjoy watching Bolger dance. Here regrettably  blame it on LeRoy Prinz  Bolger doesn't do anything he hasn't done better in several better musicals except for a brief trick shot in which he dances between two fulllength portraits of Washington and Lincoln also played by Bolger who dance along with him. I was impressed with a brief pas de deux between Bolger and Day in which she dances conventionally but manages to keep up with Bolger while he does his usual Where's Charley? moves.The contrived plot line requires Bolger and Day to mistakenly believe they're married to each other. Two Frenchmen perform the wedding service without actually being qualified for that job. This being a Hollywood film of the 1950s it's imperative that the fake marriage remain unconsummated so the two Frenchmen then have conscience pangs and sabotage the marital bed so that no sex can take place ... instead of simply admitting their deception. Speaking of 1950s morals this movie's dialogue features several occurrences of the word 'gay' in its innocent sense.Two of my least favourite movie clichs are every building in Washington DC is directly across the street from the Capitol and every location in Paris has a clear view of the Eiffel Tower. We get both of those clichs in this movie. On the positive side we get a brief appearance by character actor Shepard Menken as a Parisian waiter. Actress Eve Miller does her best in an unplayable role as Day's rival. Eve Miller's acting career never quite caught on she suicided shortly after her fiftieth birthday.The movie's weird plot gives us Claude Dauphin as an omniscient Frenchman. A gag sequence requires that Ray Bolger's hat be several sizes too large ... but later the same chapeau fits him perfectly and later still it's too large again when the scriptwriter recycles the gag. This movie is more than competently directed by the underrated David Butler but matters are not helped by a script which requires Day's and Bolger's characters to be unable to make up their minds about deeply important issues such as love and career. Still as enjoyable froth I'll rate 'April in Paris' 7 out of 10.".

The performers are all talented and have done much better elsewhere they are not to blame. The script is basically boring and the title very misleading only the last 15 minutes or so of the movie takes place in Paris. And when it does it's all painted backdrops. We never really get to Paris.What I found interesting was the postWW II notion that Americans are very uptight especially sexually and that a trip to Paris could do wonders to loosen them up. This idea is well presented in the great 1948 Billy Wilder movie A Foreign Affair though there Paris is not the answer it's just getting out of the American mindset and encountering Europeans. One of the bright spots of the movie is Doris Day's danceandsing number on the ship I'm gonna ring the bell tonight when she encounters the joie de vivre of the French crew on the ocean liner and starts to loosen up herself.Later there is a decent number with Day and the Frenchman Philippe Fouquet Claude Dauphin playing the role that Georges Gutary had played so much better the year before in An American in Paris in which the appeal and disappointments of Paris are sketched out.In sum this is a pretty forgettable movie forgettable music certainly forgettable dialog mostly though there are a few nasty lines between Day and her female rival unremarkable story  you never believe there is any real feeling between Ray Bolger and Day  forgettable if energetic dancing. Coming a year after An American in Paris  and no doubt meant to play off the success of that movie  this is pretty much a letdown. Even the scenes of Paris are fake.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before seeing April in Paris I saw a fair few bad things written about it about Ray Bolger being miscast the story being disposable and the songs being weak. As someone who liked Doris Day I went ahead and watched it anyhow. The criticisms are understandable actually but April in Paris is not as bad as it has been made out to be and is hardly a film without redeeming qualities. Ray Bolger is not really the ideal lead role for Day he was a likable comic actor when his skills were used well but he is too old here and is more supporting comic role actor than leading man. He and Day don't have very much chemistry either or one that is completely natural. The story is toiletpaperthin and contrived true that not many musicals of that particular time had particularly great stories but there are not many that are as redundant as the story here and while there are nice snappy moments the wit and satire in the script isn't sharp enough. April in Paris doesn't look too bad though one does wish that real Parisian locations and more Parisian fashions were seen and some of the sets are on the garish side but the photography is still attractive and Day's dresses are lovely. The songs are definitely not weak either I'm Gonna Ring the Bell Tonight April in Paris and That's What Makes Paris Paree are simply beautiful songs and while not quite as great the other songs work. While Bolger is not leading man material and his strengths are not really used his dancing is very lightasafeather and he looks very comfortable doing it. Charles Dauphin is charming too while the choreography and dance routines are at least wellstaged and put you in a good mood. Day is the best thing about the film her singing is just enchantingly beautiful she's completely at ease and she lights up the screen in everything she does from smiling dancing singing and acting. Overall not a great film but while the criticisms are valid it is better than given credit for and Day is fabulous. 610 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "April in Paris was originally a song from a 1932 Broadway musical revue entitled Walk a Little Faster. Although the show was not a great success the song proved highly popular and was recorded by a number of artists. The story goes that a friend of the lyricist E Y Harburg was inspired by its romantic picture of Paris in springtime to visit the French capital during that month but his holiday was ruined by bad weather. Upon his return to America he complained loudly to Harburg who replied I wouldn't know. I've never been to Paris in April. I was there in June but I needed two syllables to fit the music. Some twenty years later the title came to the attention of someone in Hollywood who decided as Hollywood producers sometimes do that it was too good to waste on a mere song and that should also be a film entitled April in Paris and this is the result. Pretty Woman and Sweet Home Alabama are more recent examples of the same phenomenon. Despite the title only the last few scenes actually take place in Paris most of the action takes place in Washington New York or on a transatlantic liner.Samuel Winthrop Putnam is a junior official with the US State Department. His official title is Assistant Secretary to the Assistant to the Undersecretary of State. He has been tasked with organising American participation in an International Festival of the Arts in Paris. He intends to invite Ethel Barrymore to represent American theatre but owing to a mixup the invitation is sent to a Broadway chorus girl named Ethel Jackson. It is never explained how this happens. It might have been more plausible if the heroine had a surname like Barrington or Barrowman rather than Jackson. This being a romantic comedy Ethel and Winthrop have to meet on the way to Paris and fall in love. This being a romantic comedy however there also have to be a couple of obstacles to their love. The first is that Winthrop or Sam as Ethel prefers to call him is engaged to Marcia the pushy snobbish daughter of his boss. The second is that Ethel seems to have a second admirer in the shape of French singer Philippe Fouquet although it is eventually revealed that Philippe is actually a happily married family man. He needs to keep this embarrassing secret hidden from the French public who like to believe that all French public figures especially entertainers are successful skirtchasing lotharios. Doris Day can be something of an acquired taste and. I must admit one I have never really been able to acquire particularly in romantic comedy where she could come across as being just too sugary sweet to be true as she does here. Ethel may be nicknamed Dynamite but she gives little hint of anything explosive hidden beneath her placid exterior. Ray Bolger seemed miscast as Winthrop he would have been 48 in 1952 old enough to be Doris Day's father. This may not always have mattered in the fifties when older manyounger woman love stories were the rule rather than the exception in the cinema but in this particular film the age difference seems inappropriate. Winthrop who has been with the State Department for ten years and still has hopes of promotion followed by a political career is probably supposed to be in his early thirties not his late forties. Bolger moreover did not have a particularly good singing voice although on the evidence of this film he was clearly a talented dancer. Quite apart from the casting the main problem with this film which is after all supposed to be a musical lies with the music. About the only songs which remain in the memory are the title song written twenty years earlier and Auprs de ma Blonde a traditional French folksong. The original songs written for the film itself are all very bland and forgettable. The film is also supposed to be a comedy but much of the humour seems tame and contrived. When the action finally moves to Paris there is a running gag about the April weather not living up to Ethel's expectations the scriptwriter must have heard that same anecdote about Harburg and his friend. April in Paris seems to have been popular when it first appeared in 1952 but it is one of those films which has lost much of its appeal over the years. 510".

The story goes that a friend of the lyricist E Y Harburg was inspired by its romantic picture of Paris in springtime to visit the French capital during that month but his holiday was ruined by bad weather. Upon his return to America he complained loudly to Harburg who replied I wouldn't know. I've never been to Paris in April. I was there in June but I needed two syllables to fit the music. Some twenty years later the title came to the attention of someone in Hollywood who decided as Hollywood producers sometimes do that it was too good to waste on a mere song and that should also be a film entitled April in Paris and this is the result. Pretty Woman and Sweet Home Alabama are more recent examples of the same phenomenon. Despite the title only the last few scenes actually take place in Paris most of the action takes place in Washington New York or on a transatlantic liner.Samuel Winthrop Putnam is a junior official with the US State Department. His official title is Assistant Secretary to the Assistant to the Undersecretary of State. He has been tasked with organising American participation in an International Festival of the Arts in Paris. He intends to invite Ethel Barrymore to represent American theatre but owing to a mixup the invitation is sent to a Broadway chorus girl named Ethel Jackson. It is never explained how this happens. It might have been more plausible if the heroine had a surname like Barrington or Barrowman rather than Jackson. This being a romantic comedy Ethel and Winthrop have to meet on the way to Paris and fall in love. This being a romantic comedy however there also have to be a couple of obstacles to their love. The first is that Winthrop or Sam as Ethel prefers to call him is engaged to Marcia the pushy snobbish daughter of his boss. The second is that Ethel seems to have a second admirer in the shape of French singer Philippe Fouquet although it is eventually revealed that Philippe is actually a happily married family man. He needs to keep this embarrassing secret hidden from the French public who like to believe that all French public figures especially entertainers are successful skirtchasing lotharios. Doris Day can be something of an acquired taste and. I must admit one I have never really been able to acquire particularly in romantic comedy where she could come across as being just too sugary sweet to be true as she does here. Ethel may be nicknamed Dynamite but she gives little hint of anything explosive hidden beneath her placid exterior. Ray Bolger seemed miscast as Winthrop he would have been 48 in 1952 old enough to be Doris Day's father. This may not always have mattered in the fifties when older manyounger woman love stories were the rule rather than the exception in the cinema but in this particular film the age difference seems inappropriate. Winthrop who has been with the State Department for ten years and still has hopes of promotion followed by a political career is probably supposed to be in his early thirties not his late forties. Bolger moreover did not have a particularly good singing voice although on the evidence of this film he was clearly a talented dancer. Quite apart from the casting the main problem with this film which is after all supposed to be a musical lies with the music. About the only songs which remain in the memory are the title song written twenty years earlier and Auprs de ma Blonde a traditional French folksong. The original songs written for the film itself are all very bland and forgettable. The film is also supposed to be a comedy but much of the humour seems tame and contrived. When the action finally moves to Paris there is a running gag about the April weather not living up to Ethel's expectations the scriptwriter must have heard that same anecdote about Harburg and his friend. April in Paris seems to have been popular when it first appeared in 1952 but it is one of those films which has lost much of its appeal over the years. 510";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is about Manu a young gay man who moves to Paris. There he meets Adrien an older man also gay. Adrien is in love with Manu who isn't interested in more than friendship. Adrien is also a good friend of a young woman Sarah who's just had a baby and her husband Mehdi. Sarah and Mehdi have an open relationship and are allowed to have affairs with others. Mehdi starts an affair with Manu. Like many other French movies this one is told by a character in voiceover Sarah who is writing Manu's life story. The story is about love in different ways about being happy with who you are and about the destroying struggle against AIDS.It is set in the 80's when the world first heard about the disease. Nobody knew what it was. It's beautifully shown how these characters deal with it when AIDS hits them and the people they love. The movie's never really sad because the director doesn't have the typical long sad scenes with slow music and lots of tears just like life the movie keeps going.What also moved me in particular is the character of Julie Manu's sister played by Julie Depardieu. She doesn't have anyone in the world no friends no lover just nobody bu she manages life and isn't depressed about it she's doing what she wants and loves and that's enough for her. This movie tries to go against common belief in more than one way you have the woman who doesn't have friends but is still very happy you have the woman who doesn't love her baby... All these things aren't accepted by the public but I think it's good to show that it can be different.Les Tmoins isn't widely marketed but is certainly worth watching if you want to see how a nothollywoodfilm and a slow human film can be great. Andr Techin also may not ring any bells but anyone who is interested in French filmmaking has to see something by him. I certainly recommend it.".

The various reactions  bewilderment fear panic hatred selfloathing guilt determination courage loss grief and of course love  are all charted in the five central characters.There can be little argument I'd have thought concerning the excellence of Michel Blanc's performance nor of the puzzling awfulness of Lorenzo Balducci's  whyever was this Italian actor cast as an American who had been brought up in Australia? Julie Depardieu's character is the least developed of the central quintet but nevertheless the actress manages as ever to make a fullyrounded contribution.Emanuelle Beart's striking features and dynamic screen presence make it difficult to assess her as an actress. In the end she didn't convince me she was any kind of writer but she was entirely convincing as a mother with ambivalence to her baby. The scene where her character talks to her own mother the late Maia Simon in a brief but noteworthy final performance about the difficulties surrounding her own birth is one of the most tender in the film.Johan Libreau is touching as the doomed Manu fleshing out what seems to me to be a somewhat idealised character  unreflective but sensitive foolhardy yet vulnerable.But the film ultimately belongs to Sami Bouajila as the policeman who finds himself in the most unexpected of relationships. It's by far the most complex role and also perhaps for that very reason the most believable. Bouajila embraces the contradictions possibly realising as Heath Ledger proved so memorably in Brokeback Mountain that struggles with sexuality can produce compelling drama.Les Temoins is well edited photographed and on the whole well directed. The influence of Truffaut's Jules Et Jim is allpervading but it's none the worse for that. The film's biggest advantage is that it tackles its subject in an entirely unsentimental way the same script made in Hollywood would undoubtedly turn into something unspeakably gooey  the memory of Philadelphia with which it could all too easily be compared makes me shudder.

	schema:reviewBody "Andr Tchin's new movie about crisscrossing relationships marked by the AIDS crisis begins when Adrien Michel Blanc a respectable gay doctor picks up a young eager and definitely gay country boy from the mountains in a Parisian cruising area. Adrien just wants to protect young Manu Johan Libreau there's no sex but he takes the boy everywhere and falls madly in love with him. Whatever shenanigans Manu is up to he's sweet to Adrien. A narcissist he loves the attention. He doesn't get that from Julie Julie Depardieu the opera singer sister he shares a cheap hotel room with. Adrien's idyll ends when Manu gets a job in a remote camping ground and starts an affair with a bisexual vice cop of Arab extraction named Mehdi Sami Bouajila. It's a small world because not only have Manu and Mehdi met through Mehdi's wellheeled wife Sarah a friend of Adrien's Mehdi also minds the seedy area where Manu lives with Julie and consorts with the local whores. Sarah and Mehdi have an open marriage. They also have a baby she doesn't much care for and she is getting tired of writing children's books and wants to write a regular novel. After saving Manu from drowning gives Mehdi a raging hardon and they begin having daily sex this becomes something far too important to tell Sarah about.All this is moved forward with a Nouvelle Vaguestyle retrospective voiceover spoken by Sarah and this is Part One entitled Summer 1984 Happy Days. The happy days are not to last. The AIDS crisis is about to happen and Manu is going to be one of its early victims. The idea that this is a collective tragedy worthy of opera is underlined by Julie's singing and operatic background themes not to mention the swirling merrygoround of interactive relationships.Many of these ingredients are familiar to Tchin fans. The young gay boy from the mountains who goes wild in Paris has close parallels with the young Pierre played by an actor named Manu Manuel Blanc in the 1991 J'embrasse pas I Don't Kiss who likewise comes from the mountains winds up in a promiscuous gay life as a hustler and initially finds an older gay protector at a Parisian cruising area and this film also has Bart in the cast. I Don't Kiss focuses mainly on Pierre but in it many paths cross. A love triangle and bisexuality are central to the 1994 Wild Reeds Les roseaux sauvages another period film though it's set in the Sixties. Crisscrossing bisexuality and a brothersister combination are found in Les Voleurs Thieves 1996. These are all fine fascinating films. The Witnesses partakes of the same complexity. There is something radical about Tchin's ability to avoid a central action or central character yet keep things interestingeven more interesting because of the unpredictability of the interactions and an openness toward behavior the straight world tends to see as forbidden or transgressive. Les Voleurs is complicated in this way but it's anchored in a powerful sense of family and place and made exciting by the fact that one main character is a representative of the law and several others he's personally involved with are as the title implies criminals. Wild Reeds is a kind of triple coming of age film and has simplicity and focus through a tranquil provincial setting and the relatively simple life of the three youths with the Algerian war a vague but powerful magnetic force in the background. It's more sympathetic toward the gay boy and his sensitive girlfriend than toward the bisexual youth who breaks his heart but the latter's dark appeal is unmistakable. Tchin's mastery of the odd and unexpected relationship is never more evident than in the intense transitory union between a wild mysterious boy called Yvan Gaspard Ulliel and a Parisian mother fleeing WWII bombs in the country Bart again whom he rescues in Strayed Les garsa story of intense freshness marked by Tchin's great sense of landscape and ability to blend sweeping evocative tracking shots and vivid closeups. The look of The Witnesses isn't as beautiful and consistent but there are many nice little visual details. The faces will stay with you Mehdi's hyperactive eyes muscular brow and disturbed jaw Adrien's intelligent bourgeois solidity his pale shaved dome has stylish round glasses Sarah's distracted gaze and scruffy bleached hair Manu's wild eagerness and frequent smiles then his skin ravaged by lesions. Also memorable visually are Manu's little lightfooted leaps over barriers and onto branches which Adrien observes admiringly but does not try to follow.It's disconcerting to discover that Manu isn't central to The Witnesses because when AIDS takes him away life goes on. Adrien has become part of the teams of French doctors frantically seeking to manage the disease. This is Part Two The War against AIDS. Mehdi is terrified that he is infected but when he learns that he isn't his life can resume in new but not altogether different directions. Sarah against his wishes brings Manu's story into her adult novel. The couple makes love again but Mehdi also begins taking Julie up in the little airplanes that were part of his courtship of Manu and she begins to replace Manu in his affections. There's a slight danger that The Witnesses will seem like a Telenovela. Manu's story ends he drops out of the series and a new sequence begins. The coda entitled Summer Returns is both premature and excessive. The film feels a bit as if it's gone on too long and doesn't really know how to end. But the point is still a valid one at least for the cross section of society young and old sophisticated and nave creative and blocked rich and poor integrated into the ingenious and characteristically Tchinesquire story. La vie continue. The witnesses survive.".

	schema:reviewBody "Les Tmoins The Witnesses is another fine artwork by French director Andr Tchin that continues to examine relationships in times of stress and through areas of rough travel. As written by Tchin Laurent Guyot and Viviane Zingg this film is a love story and a social commentary on life in 1984 when AIDS raised its ugly head and disrupted lives hopes and relationships. What could have been a heavyhanded woeful tale is instead a story about ordinary people and how the spectre of the then 'new disease' affected a small group of friends. In the intimacy of the story there is an opportunity to reflect and to see more clearly the atmosphere of that time in history. Sarah Emmanuelle Bart is a writer of children's books married to Mehdi Sami Bouajila a member of the Paris police force vice squad. They have an open marriage and have just given birth to a baby boy  a factor that disrupts their separate lives while conflicting their married life. Sarah has a physician friend Adrien Michel Blanc so memorable in his role in 'Monsieur Hire' who is gay and while he is older he still longs for the company of young men. Adrien meets the young catering student Manu Johan Libreau a lad whose sexual appetite is satisfied by trysts in parks back rooms of bars etc. Manu and his opera singer sister Julie Julie Depardieu live modestly in a sleazy hotel cum brothel that is under surveillance by Mehdi. Adrien and Manu strike up a friendship and are invited to join Sarah and Mehdi to Sarah's mother's cabin by the sea and while there a relationship between Manu and Mehdi begins one that will become an affair in secret. A strange disease comes to public attention and it is Adrien who is in charge of the investigation of the disease now called AIDS. Though Adrien's ties with Manu have become platonic while Manu see Mehdi daily Adrien is the first to notice lesions on Manu lesions that are the hallmark of AIDS. How this discovery affects the lives of each of the characters we have met the 'witnesses' to a very important time in our history serves as the crux of the story  part tragedy and part a torch of resilience the weaves the story to a close in an honest touching but never maudlin manner. The acting is consistently excellent the sort of ensemble acting that keeps the focus on the message of the film rather than on individual attention to characters. The movie is beautifully photographed by Julien Hirsch and the musical score by Philippe Sarde wisely blends excerpts from Vivaldi and Mozart with original music that recalls the 1980s. This is yet another triumph for Andr Tchin  a film that deserves the widest possible audience. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " A good film but a little weak";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. This is the story of Maunu Johan Libreau a young gay man from the country who is past high school but is not attending a university and instead arrives at his sister Julie's Julie Depardieu in Paris who is a struggling but talented opera singer and living in a dilapidated hotel where only hookers live. Cruising the city parks Manhu befriends an older gay doctor Adrien Michel Blanc and develops a platonic relationship with him although Adrien is enamored with Manu. Adrien is best friends with Sarah Emmanuelle Bart who is a struggling writer and a new mother. Sarah's husband is Medhi Sami Bouajila who is a vice cop and the principal parent of their child who Sarah prefers to ignore and doesn't even want to be a mother. Mehi and Manu begin a surprising and unlikely relationship. This is a good movie but seems kind of sliced together in it's storyline. One good character is the streetwalker Sandra Constance Poll who seems like is going to be a central character but then disappears from the film. Manu who has a wealthy benefactor in Adrien impossibly wears the same clothes throughout the film. Medhi and Manu and Medhi and Sarah have absolutely no on screen chemistry. AIDS is treated in 1984 as being so new that no one except the doctor Adrien has ever heard of it before and it's brand new on all the television newscasts yet AIDS was at that new phenomenon point in 1982 not 1984. The relationships between Manu and Adrien Manu and Medhi Manu and Julie are never properly developed because there is too much going on in this film. We never really understand how Adrien and Sarah became lifelong friends and it doesn't seem like they really care for each other anyway. Satah and Manu never have any kind of established friendship. Veteran filmmaker director writer Andr Tchin directs and cowrote the screenplay with Laurent Guyot and Viviane Zingg. Nice cinematography from Julien Hirsh. Michel Blanc is the commanding acting presence in this film. I would give this a 6.5 out of 10.".

It shows such a versatile tenderness from both parties and Sami Bouajila's performance as the character of Mehdi evokes such genuine feelings that I was moved to tears. In addition to this I found Les Temoins an extremely beautiful film to watch visually its very blue and yellow colourscape providing a serene backdrop for the action.

But I didn't like the script very much. All characters seemed a bit bland and there was little connection between any of them even the supposed lovers like Manu and Adrien or Mehdi and Sarah. In fact it seemed to me as if everyone was very much focusing on themselves and I couldn't find any sympathetic character among all of them. Take Manu's sister Julie who even at the day of the funeral of her brother seemed to care more for her cherished role in an opera or Adrien who loses himself in his role of potential savior of the AIDSepidemic or Mehdi who was more involved with fear for his own health and who switches shamelessly between Manu Sarah and in the end even Manu's sister while in the meantime relentlessly executing a witchhunt on brothels and prostitutes even if this means hurting innocent people like Julie. Or Sarah who sees her baby not as a responsibility but as a burden. Sure enough Manu's character is endearing young and careless and on top of everything in the beginning but in his extremely improbable affair with Medhi he doesn't hesitate a minute to sack Adrien in a very harsh way.The whole AIDSrelated section with Adrien who at the start of the movie impressed me as a lowkey local physician suddenly becoming a professor and a national AIDSexpert and all the lecturelike information on the disease struck me as a bit patronizing and undermined the dramatic storyline. Furthermore the movie seems like 20 minutes too long the part after Manu's death doesn't fit in at all. Are we to think in witnessing in the final scene yet another peaceful picnic at the river that everything is as it was before? The new boyfriend for Adrien is as improbable as the coupling of Manu and Medhi even Adrien seems to think that. And why this complicated nationalityissue whatever language he spoke it never did come out as genuine. And as someone already commented on this site did Manu really have only one shirt and one pair of trousers?!? On the other hand I have to praise Sami Bouajila and young Johan Libreau they did an excellent job and carried the whole movie. And for some reason I really liked the photography it has this French quality of balancing between the intimate and the claustrophobic and makes French movies often feel like your stepping into someone's private home. And most important of all Tchin succeeds in avoiding all larmoyancy it's as if the fast pace of the movie tries to keep up with the lively spirit of Manu the story waltzes around the rocks of melodrama and as such it resembles Real Life itself in spite of everything the band has to play on.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Witnesses is a provocative and moving French drama set in the early days of the AIDS epidemic.It's 1983 and a young gay man by the name of Manu Johan Libereau has come to Paris where his sister Julie Depardieu an aspiring opera singer lives. Almost immediately Manu enters into a platonic relationship with Adrien Michel Blanc a middleaged doctor who falls in love with Manu despite the fact that the young man sees Adrien as just a pal. Meanwhile Adrien introduces Manu to a longtime friend Sarah Emmanuelle Beart a writer of children's books and Mehdi Sami Bouajila her husband who works as a vice cop in the city. Eventually Manu taps into Mehdi's latent attraction to men and the two strike up a tentative secret relationship. But before long a mysterious and deadly disease has arrived on the scene changing the lives of these characters  and of countless others in the world  in ways they could never possibly have imagined.Even though The Witnesses deals with a very grim and serious subject its primary focus always rests on the characters and the complex relationships that define them. Written by Andre Techine Laurent Guyot and Viviane Zingg and directed by Techine The Witnesses draws us into the lives of these people precisely because it refuses to make an undue fuss over them and how they choose to live their lives. In fact much of the narrative feels spontaneous and unformed almost as if the writers were making it up as they go along. The result is that the incidents don't feel contrived or forced and we are never tempted to question their credibility. In fact the filmmakers often seem to go out of their way to avoid doing the obvious often building up to scenes a dying man's trip to his sister's opera performance a final meeting between estranged lovers a maudlin drawnout death scene that never end up taking place  just as in real life.The characters moreover are richly drawn with each emerging as a nicely balanced combination of weaknesses and strengths. Manu for example is basically a happygolucky kid who's just beginning to find his way in life and who demonstrates that he has a tremendous capacity for joie de vive and emotional tenderness  even if his youth and inexperience occasionally lead him to hurt others in ways that he doesn't yet fully comprehend. It becomes doubly tragic then when the fates demand such a harsh unforgiving punishment from him. Sarah is a recent mother who admits quite frankly that she appears not to have much of a maternal instinct looking upon her newborn more as a hindrance than as a blessing. Her husband Mehdi is a mass of contradictions as he tries to come to terms with his bisexuality falling further in love with Manu even while raiding dens of iniquity in his onduty hours. Finally Adrien is the lonely older man whose wisdom born of experience ultimately gives strength and guidance to others.The performances are uniformly excellent throughout and Techine's direction can be either downtoearth or lyrical depending on which of those two seemingly contradictory tones a particular scene calls for.The Witnesses is a sad movie but not a depressing one for its canny recognition that humans have an endless capacity for regeneration and hope even in the face of unimaginable suffering carries us beyond the tragic nature of its subject matter.".

Meanwhile Adrien introduces Manu to a longtime friend Sarah Emmanuelle Beart a writer of children's books and Mehdi Sami Bouajila her husband who works as a vice cop in the city. Eventually Manu taps into Mehdi's latent attraction to men and the two strike up a tentative secret relationship. But before long a mysterious and deadly disease has arrived on the scene changing the lives of these characters  and of countless others in the world  in ways they could never possibly have imagined.Even though The Witnesses deals with a very grim and serious subject its primary focus always rests on the characters and the complex relationships that define them. Written by Andre Techine Laurent Guyot and Viviane Zingg and directed by Techine The Witnesses draws us into the lives of these people precisely because it refuses to make an undue fuss over them and how they choose to live their lives. In fact much of the narrative feels spontaneous and unformed almost as if the writers were making it up as they go along. The result is that the incidents don't feel contrived or forced and we are never tempted to question their credibility. In fact the filmmakers often seem to go out of their way to avoid doing the obvious often building up to scenes a dying man's trip to his sister's opera performance a final meeting between estranged lovers a maudlin drawnout death scene that never end up taking place  just as in real life.The characters moreover are richly drawn with each emerging as a nicely balanced combination of weaknesses and strengths. Manu for example is basically a happygolucky kid who's just beginning to find his way in life and who demonstrates that he has a tremendous capacity for joie de vive and emotional tenderness  even if his youth and inexperience occasionally lead him to hurt others in ways that he doesn't yet fully comprehend. It becomes doubly tragic then when the fates demand such a harsh unforgiving punishment from him. Sarah is a recent mother who admits quite frankly that she appears not to have much of a maternal instinct looking upon her newborn more as a hindrance than as a blessing. Her husband Mehdi is a mass of contradictions as he tries to come to terms with his bisexuality falling further in love with Manu even while raiding dens of iniquity in his onduty hours. Finally Adrien is the lonely older man whose wisdom born of experience ultimately gives strength and guidance to others.The performances are uniformly excellent throughout and Techine's direction can be either downtoearth or lyrical depending on which of those two seemingly contradictory tones a particular scene calls for.The Witnesses is a sad movie but not a depressing one for its canny recognition that humans have an endless capacity for regeneration and hope even in the face of unimaginable suffering carries us beyond the tragic nature of its subject matter.";

A policeman of Islamic descent has married a young woman partly for her money. She doesn't care. He's a sexual dynamo. She doesn't even care that he sees other women  or a man for that matter.The other man is an innocentlooking young gay guy who is having an affair with a gay doctor interrupted now by the attentions of the police officer.Everyone goes around shrugging shoulders and gesticulating except the doctor who is fiercely jealous and has lost his young lover. It's all rather comme ci comme ca until finally a brief announcement is seen on TV that a mysterious disease is spreading among the gay community.The young man has it the others don't. The whole business is treated without melodrama and without any overt attempts to engage the viewer emotionally except insofar as we are saddened by the illness of the innocent young man and we share the anxiety of those who have made love with him. Amor vincit omnia and then you roll over and go to sleep.I found the sexual juggling a little boring. I didn't really care much who wound up with whom. And the way AIDS was treated was something of a disappointment. Neither moral nor medical questions were raised. It was as if something had intruded into a couple of love affairs and the consequences though tragic were also a damned nuisance.The photography is crisp and evocative the direction efficient the budget modest. If this doesn't achieve all it seems to have set out for I still wish there were more efforts made along these lines. My God what an improvement it is over another Batman movie!I wish the characters had been made more engaging.

And for a USmade movie it is pretty pure.If you do not know it the primary narrative is essentially no narrative a muscle car speeding across the desert chased by police initially for speeding and ultimately just to exert power. This fellow is Kowalski a name imported from a landmark film. He simply drives. It is his life now. We see flashbacks. Find he was a Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam a star racer and then a cop. There's a backstory about his being a good cop and turning in some rotten apples so by degrees we come to understand the moral landscape.There is only one other character a blind black disk jockey who is listened to by apparently everyone. Guided by his eavesdropping on police radio and some psychic ability.This was after Easy Rider and instead of bold men moving into a life we have life chasing an honest man. Same ethic could even have been the same man. But he knows himself. He knows he is a cinematic creature someone to be observed and dreamed about. He knows he carries his world with him. Always borrowed. You can see Malick here the notion that the character sees us seeing him that he knows he is fictional and knows we think him not. You can trace it to the female version in Thelma and Louise where they have their end only because they know someone will watch. Its not like Cool Hand Luke or Bonnie and Clyde at all where the man decides. That comes from the Hollywood western.Its derived from the Breathless tradition. A good third of this film is spent on the audience the rural townspeople. These parts are filmed in a documentary style with  it seems  real people who have come to watch the filming having heard on the radio from a borrowed soul. They look dumb and bored clearly with nothing better to do than watch just like us.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

I was fascinated by the simple yet powerful expression of the will to reach freedom. All the reactions of Kowalsky the naked rider the blind DJ the store owner etc they were all after freedom. And the possibility of being deprived of freedom is the reason why Kowalsky commits suicide at the end.

The cast is excellent and this is one of Cleavon Little's last main roles as well as the last main role for the early love interest. John Amos is so underplayed he is almost unrecognizable I'd love to see his commentary on the movie. And one guy is so ripping off James Dean though as a racist that it is unintentionally funny.

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers Alert More'n a few reviewers on IMDB have described Vanishing Point as being plotless and directionless.... They left out nihilistic and bleak.But that seems to have been a theme during the late '60s and early '70s. Yes Kowalski dies at the end commits suicide really.  Just like the car going into the train at the end of 'Dirty Mary  Crazy Larry' or whatshisname getting blown off his motorcycle with a shotgun at the end of 'Easy Rider' or the lone survivor from 'Night of the Living Dead' being killed by cops at the end.... It doesn't matter what you've accomplished what you've survived through or how good of a person you are odds are you'll be offed by a complete stranger for no damn reason out of the blue. I will leave the parallels between this type of nihilistic thinking and the emotions surrounding a certain military conflict the United States was involved with at the time up to the individual.Um anyway about the movie.  Hell yes I liked it.  The Mopar musclecars of the era really were top of the line... I've never had a chance to own a Charger but I've gone through various muscle cars from the Detroit Big Three and the 1970 Plymouth I owned was by far the most satisfying for both speed and as a daily driver.  Also like Kowalski I have been driven slowly nuts by way of too little sleep and too much time isolated living behind the wheel of a car rarely having conversations with other human beings longer that 45 seconds... Stop to eat and you realize your back hurts sitting in a 'normal' chair and your feet are out in front of you poised above imaginary pedals.The bet at the beginning of the movie  what constitutes the basis for the 'plot'  is absolute insanity Driving from Denver to San Francisco in fifteen hours. This works out to averaging 100 m.p.h. not including stopping for fuel.  I've taken bets like this on a smaller scale I can get from San Jose to downtown SF in a half hour!  It can be done but only if you're seriously unbalanced.I can also identify with what I imagine Kowalski's motivations are especially his selfdestructive streak The realization that you're well past thirty whatever past attempts at 'real' careers have been blown to hell for whatever reasons and hey... You ain't nothing but a fxxking delivery boy.So yeah I have a soft spot in my heart for Vanishing Point but mostly due to a higher level of personal identification with Kowalski than most. I'm less likely to kill myself though  After years of covering 1600 miles a week without leaving California I caught myself doing the DeathStare on the road too many times and it finally scared me.".

This is more than just a car chase movie it actually has depth and a story to tell.  The scenery of the great American West is also first rate and the soundtrack never fails to set the mood.THIS PARAGRAGH MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS The story of the main character an auto delivery driver named Kowalski unfolds as he takes delivery of a white '70 Dodge Challenger which is as he puts it souped up to 160' and proceeds to drive it from Denver to San Francisco.  His plan however is to do this in 15 hours to win a bet.  As Kowalski makes his journey his life is revealed to us through flashbacks and recollections which are usually triggered by what is currently happening to him in real time.  Through these the viewer learns that despite his apparent lawless behavior Kowalski is a man of good character.  One of the big things that drew me into this movie is that it doesn't hand you the explanations on a silver platter. Instead it allows you to think about it and draw your own conclusions long after you've seen it.  Certain other reviewers here have already done a great job of touching on the philosophies of freedom and individualism prevalent in this movie so I won't waste the time trying to top those.  I'll add that I feel this is a type of an expressionist film.  Kowalski is kind of an Everyman' I think people can relate to him who is on a journey to find his place in the grand scheme of things.  Along his path he encounters various characters that watch over him and help him along but there are also those who wish to shut him down.  Whether you think the conclusion of Kowalski's journey is successful or not is up to you.Another big plus is the realism in the driving scenes where the drivers are actually driving their machines and occasionally things happen like tires going flat or the car needs fuel.  Most modern car chase sequences leave me wanting with all of the computer generated car moves and general lack of realism no you can't shoot a car repeatedly with a .50 calibre machine gun without harming the occupants or engine.  I know they sometimes got it wrong back then too doing things like obviously speeding the film up. In this one though they got it right.  The driving here brings us into that realm of manhandling 4000 lbs. of American Iron in all the glory of bigblock V8 roar screaming smoking tires and hands flying over the steering wheel.Another thing that's cool to me about this type of movie is the appearance of the car.  At the beginning the car is resplendent in gleaming chrome and white paint.  As the story moves along the car gradually gets a more dusty battered countenance.  I won't spoil the end but those who've seen it know.The final things that tie this whole thing together are the soundtrack and scenery.  They seem to go hand in hand from the upbeat rock  roll as Kowalski starts out to the stirring guitar strains during the thoughtful moments.  I also cannot say enough about the scenery which really sucks the viewer in.  It ranges from the mountains of Colorado across Utah and into the searing Nevada desert.In closing I'll say that this is one of my favorite movies.  It won't be understood by everyone but those of us who fantasize about getting in a classic car and blasting down an open twolane highway devoid of SUV's sport sedans and minivans will likely get it.".

It has elements of both and could have been so much more had it focused more on the main character and less on the nonsense. In so many films of this type the lead meets up with the strangest people just to be strange and it adds little to the overall story. I recall the scene in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot where they encounter that crazy guy who shoots rabbits from his trunk and funnels the exhaust into the cars interior why we don't know and never find out. In Vanishing Point we have to two weird gay bandits in one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever watched and a revival meeting in the desert that seems just thrown in and pointless.The Dodge Challenger obviously is just incredible and is a star in it's own right and the shots of it screaming across the desert highways are just fantastic. I'm not sure of the whole delivery premise to begin with he doesn't seem to care if the car is damaged so why is he in a hurry to deliver it and didn't they have Dodge dealerships in CA in 1970???. Is it a death wish from the start? It's hard to see this now and realize that car was brand new and one of the true monsters of the road at the time. The movie is dated like most older films but I don't rate movies based on that you have to take into account the time and not compare it to today.Clevon Little's role is just incredibly stupid with him feeling the drivers moves or whatever and the music they choose does not fit the scenario at all you would of expected a much harder soundtrack. I'm still not sure why there is a soul station in the middle of nowhere and it must have one powerful signal to reach such a long distance. In fact the music here is so bad and forgettable I can't imagine anyone listing it as part of the reason they like this film. A lot of movies from this era used groups they thought were going to be popular or are friends of the producer there is not one hit from the 60's or 70's here except Mississippi Queen which is used for ten seconds and in the wrong place.More weird to be weird is the naked chick but I guess there is a running theme of wispy blonds in his past but how in the hell would she have a collage of his history?The ending is so disconnected from the rest of the movie the crowd awaiting his arrival don't even seem to be in the same scene and it ends so anticlimactically. Why did they suddenly use a Camaro to blow up instead of the Dodge you can even see the letters on the side nameplate. The beginning had a good feel to it and I can't imaging how great this would have been had it been more structured and been a straight action film instead of trying to become some religious message wrapped in a Challenger.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Vanishing Point' a chase movie from the early 1970s can be easily related to other films of the same or similar genres. From its predecessor 'Easy Rider' it takes the bleak beauty of western America a rollicking soundtrack and a structure whereby the continuum of life on the road is punctuated by emblematic but vague encounters. Like Spielberg's 'Duel' it is minimalistic in form. But it's outlaw philosophy has more in common with later sillier films like 'Smokey and the Bandit' and 'The Cannonball Run' in 'Easy Rider' the heroes simply want to mind their own business but in 'Vanishing Point' beating the system is the end in itself. This might make the film seem more political except for the complete vapidness of its central concept that freedom can be defined as the right to burn enormous quantities of oil at lifeendangering speeds indeed it appears that one of the ways in which the mainstream has persecuted our hero is to attempt to prevent him from driving when drunk. One could say that this film proceeds under the false cloak of counter culturalism while selling us the same macho dreams as any mainstream Hollywood product. Yet without the pseudophilosophical justification this is a movie without point or purpose whose central character acts without any rational motivation.For all that the chase itself is gripping though it's strange especially for a European to see what qualified as a sports car in America 30 years ago this one has huge front and rear overhangs and ridiculously soft suspension. But the worst thing about this movie are its bizarre diversions from the main plot which include the cheesiest love scene I can remember a strange homophobiatinged encounter with a couple of gay wouldbe carhijackers a racist attack apropos of nothing and most oddly of all a meeting with a motorcycling naked blonde in the middle of the desert. The surprise ending which follows all this might have had an impact if the film that had preceded it had anything to say. The only real reason for watching this film today is as a period piece a strange mix of reactionary and hippie values that clearly mark it a product of its time. But freedom does not mean irresponsibility nor does irresponsibility in itself bring freedom however oppressive we find may the life we are expected to live. Watch 'Five Easy Pieces' a timeless classic from the same era for a real exploration of these themes.".

The cops are corrupt the racists are ignorant and the true believers in true freedom are overwhelmed in the end... sigh. Some things never change my friends. Read Edward Abbey for further insight to this spectacularly polished and perfect lowbudget movie. The film Lonely are the Brave starring a very young Kirk Douglas and and even younger Walter Matthau is a close parallel in gorgeous black and white. It is based on The Last Cowboy by Abbey but his masterpiece A Fools Progress illustrates almost as completely as Vanishing Point the heartbreaking philosophy that mourns the final death of true freedom in the one Empire that claimed to champion it.".

There were so many gaps in the plot it was hugely open to personal interpretation. Kowalski had no first name he had no reason to rush the delivery journey he had no reason to die! I can remember the elation of seeing the chase scenes for the first time and remember the fact that NO special effects were used the car did exactly what it said on the box ! Excellent film sad and pointless but excellent oh yes  and music to take you right back when. To this day the 197071 Dodge Challenger RT is THE coolest car on the roads sorry Bullitt fans. This film Is dated but thats not a bad thing For all the advances of film technology they couldn't better this when they made the 1997? remake it was TOO user friendly all the gaps where filled in name motiveetcand it became just another chase movie. This original was probably the first real road movie of modern times also SUPERSOUL so hip so camp so funky so 70's.".

Well I'll be the first to admit that I just don't get it.I've read other comments alluding to its allegorical Christian and post60s subtexts.  Fine.  But for a film to work metaphorically it needs to work on a literal level.  What we have here are details that don't make much sense. Does Kowalski really hear Cleavon Little in his mind or the radio?  It's hard to believe that a Denver radio station's output can reach all the way to Nevada.  What's with the racist attack on Little at the station?  The bluntedly obvious irony of the attack juxtaposed with a Love Everyone tune aside the purpose of the scene failed to enlighten me or propel the story. What's with the choir in the desert?  What's with the naked chick???  And all the flashbacks and police reports didn't tell me a whole lot about what makes this guy tick.  What is the point of this movie???  That men desire the open desert road with no societal restrictions???  Don't stop the presses...Anyway like I said I'm probably not tuned in to its message I never cared for Easy Rider either.  Vanishing Point was made three years before I was born and perhaps I needed to have experienced the era to appreciate something like this this may be why I adore Almost Famous Dazed and Confused and Woodstock so much for their nostalgia purposes  jeez how much do I wish my parents conceived me twenty years earlier!  I do however admire the filmmaking techniques of this time especially the downbeat endings I'm a big fan of They Shoot Horses Don't They which is why I saw the crash coming from so far away I had time to trim my nails and read my EW.  Cool car though.So if somebody can clue me in drop me a line.  In the meantime I'll just keep spinning my Zeppelin and Who CDs and remember a past for which I wasn't present. 310".

After years of watching grainy and scratched prints its nice to see it as it was in 1971. Theatrical trailer and two TV spots are included. Commentary by Richard C. Sarifian brings some insights into filming locations the various actors etc. Gilda Texter was severely sunburned during her desert motorcycle ride and she was girl friend of actor Paul Koslo who also appears in film. And a story of a prostitute befriended by the crewwho stole the last remaining challenger. eight were used only one survived. She was caught sometime later. The real treat is actressCharlotte Ramplings missing scene near the end of the film. While it really adds nothing to the storyits nice to finally see the missing footage after thirty years. There are also some striking images of the challenger at daybreak in that previously missing scene. The only thing lacking is commentary from the STAR of the film Barry Newmanwhich would have made this a Great DVD.".

	schema:headline " An epitaph to the Muscle car era.....";
	schema:reviewBody "Much has been written about this movie so the story is well known. The main character is a man known as Kowalski who delivers cars for a living. He has done other things though. He was a Vietnam veteran a former car and bike racing driver and an ex cop but in the film he collects a car on a Friday night in Colorado to drive it back to San Francisco California in 15 hours.  a journey of some 1200 miles .Given the car he is driving a 1970 Dodge Challenger RT 440ci V8 with a 4 speed manual transmission which is also allegedly  hopped up to over 160  it is technically achievable however as he will be driving mainly on the back roads no one seems to think he can do it. To help him he visits a friend at the start and take a supply of speed and then gets on his way. And then the fun begins.So what is the movie really about?....Well if you read all the other comments and I recommend you do you will see the main points of the plot and events etc so I wont be repeating these here but to me none of them get to the real raison d'etre of Kowalski and the movie.You first have to look at the time period in the US in 197071. The Vietnam war was still ongoing and by then the protest against it was very wide spread. In addition there was still a very strong racism element and the US was in effect a Police state only much more so than today.Then there was the Muscle care era which was at its peak in 197071 but by 1973 it was all but dead as emission laws made many of the big block engines illegal. The 70 Dodge Challenger RT 440 ci V8 was one of the fastest in its day and with a 4 speed manual transmission was good for around 375 bhp in stock form however we are told that it is hopped up to do over 160 mph  standard was around 140 mph  although no details of how it is tuned are given other than a couple of cops saying it is allegedly supercharged.Then he have Kowalski himself. On face value it would seem he has been a failure throughout his life  well the bits we get to see in flash back  but is he really?....No. The way he drives the Dodge shows you that he is in a different league to the cops and like all racing drivers instead of slowing down he changes down and accelerates to even faster speeds so he isn't simply a good driver he is a great driver. One of the very best.He doesn't just drive the car he becomes part of it and it becomes part of him. He knows that whenever he changes down a gear or two he has rocket like acceleration that will get him out of trouble and when the roads get closed off he simply takes it out into the desert. As Super soul says Kowalski is one of the last great American hero's and that is what the movie is really about.It is an epitaph to the last of the real hero's Kowalski the last of the real muscle cars and the last blast of a freedom that the police are trying to destroy. Kowalski knows that just like the muscle car his time has come and gone so he pushes himself on an almost impossible journey that he knows will end in his death. After all what is there to live for. Nothing except the speed and the race and so at the end we see him smash into two bulldozers rather than surrender.On face value this seems madness. He could easily stop and although he might be imprisoned for a while  or maybe not as he hadn't really done anything wrong  he would get to drive again but for Kowalski its not so simplistic. He is on a one way journey and this is evident by the flash backs to the past events in his life. We see him as a racing car driver a bike racer when he was a cop and the death of his beloved. He whole life story is laid out along the road so it is obvious that death is the only destination. This is further confirmed when we see the naked chick shows him all the news stories she has collected about him long before this journey. Its like she is an Angel saying this was your life Kowalski.There is also the scene not in the US versions  where he picks up a female hitchhiker  death  who spends the night with him and then mysteriously disappears before he wakes. Kowalski knows its coming but rather than fear it he drives into the next world at maximum speed smiling and with him dies the last of the great muscle cars.Whether you agree with my synopsis or not this is one of the great movies of all time and if you do nothing else in your life you have to see this film and preferably on a big screen with surround sound.".

However Harry becomes involved in illicit business and Karl quickly realizes that it would be best to join his son Ernst in the citizenowned factory.

As with his first feature film Kuhle Wampe from a screenplay by Bertolt Brecht Dudow wanted an art that cultivates the viewer's psyche. His postwar films were intended to make the viewers realize the importance of supporting the new order in East Germany.

With that in mind it was a great success as entertainment and release from stress.The plot is simple and age worn  a teen named Casey Michelle Trachtenberg is torn between fulfilling the dreams of her parent or following her own dreams. Nothing new here. Yet the supporting characters of Gen Harwood Hayden Panettiere and her mother Tina Kim Cattrall also have the same situation. Tina a skating coach wants her daughter to become a skating champion an achievement Tina was unable to fulfill in her own skating career. Thus both Gen and Casey have something in common pleasing mom or pleasing themselves.Yet Gen and Casey were dramatically different. Casey was a brilliant student with her eyes on Harvard while being gifted at skating too. Meanwhile Gen excelled only by becoming a slave to skating and sacrificing her schoolwork.And it is with that difference that I believe Disney missed the potential. The Casey's of the world are few and far between and it is difficult to relate to them Oh gee. Will I go to Harvard because I'm brilliant at school? Or will I become a skating champion because I'm brilliant on the ice? Because she is so distant from the vast majority of people she never truly grabbed my empathy.Gen on the other hand is very very real. She is being pushed into a sport by a parent and her social life and academics are suffering. She faces a real dilemma. Plus she has no hope of excelling at either academics or skating. Her social life is her only escape from this vise. And Gen is endearing because she seems to have a good heart despite the difficulty. And how often we see kids with good hearts trapped by situations.I believe that most of us can relate much better to Gen than to Casey. I would have preferred the character of Gen to be the focus of the story with Casey's character in the supporting role. It would be tougher grittier and more meaningful to the audience.Yeah we all cheered for Casey but I was cheering for Gen even more.".

	schema:reviewBody "ICE PRINCESS is not the kind of movie to which this reviewer is usually attracted  the trappings indicate that we are in for a happywappy sterilized PG Disney candy box. But surprise! here is a film that is better than its package. Writers Meg Cabot and Hadley Davis have combined the sport of ice skating with the drama of teenage angst and come up with a credible tale of a 'science geek' discovering her talent and following her dream of figure skating.Director Tim Fywell knows his way around the ice rink and the halls and lockers of high school kids and his preparation for the film is apparent. Casey Michelle Trachtenberg is a fine student who is encouraged by her physics professor to find a project that incorporates her personality along with physics that will assist her in gaining a scholarship to Harvard. Casey's mother Joan Cusack is a pragmatist a schoolteacher who wants Casey to succeed beyond the mother's status. Casey loves to skate on their home pond but one day happens into a private skating rink class owned by onetime star skater Tina Kim Cattrall a place where Tina relentlessly drives her daughter Gen Hayden Panettiere toward winning prizes. Tina's son Teddy Trevor Blumas  a much underused handsome actor is always around to keep the ice surfaces smooth with his machine.Casey observes the brilliance of fine skating thinks of a way to analyze moves on her computer that will diagnose aerodynamic physics aspects of skating and once that is perfected and she is able to aid the skaters with her scientific knowledge she personalizes her theories. Before long has won a place along with the other aspiring skaters. She encounters resistance from her mother encouragement from Tina and friendship from Gen and her fellow skaters as well as the eye of Teddy! When Casey has her Harvard interview she admits that her real love is for skating not physics and commits to pursuing that love full time. The rest is predictable all's well that end's well.What sets this little film apart is the quality of acting from Trachtenberg Cattrall Cusack and Blumas they create characters about whom we care. The skating is fun to watch and the 'sitting in the bleachers rooting for the good guys' feeling is refreshing. This is not a great film but certainly one of the best of this genre. It is most definitely a 'feel good' popcorn movie! Grady Harp".

Ice Princess attempts to treat the issue of female achievement with both charm and weightiness. One is almost tempted I say almost tempted because it still falls under the very successful Disney Channel formula of a challenged teenage life and happy ending to forgive the every ready show of single motherhood as fanatical stage moms driving their kids to the fulfillment of their dreams rather than encouraging the same to seek happiness and true fulfillment.Both Kim Cattral and Joan Cusak play mothers who pressure their daughters into career they seemed all too disappointed about not having achieved. Their daughters in effect are standins of their own unfulfilled dreams. Casey the true focus of the movie is played by Michelle Trachtenberg as a Harvardbound physics nerd who aspires to challenge all the planning and hard work to become a world class figure skater. Conversely Gen played by Hayden Panettiere is the Cattral prodigy who is forced into the role of apprentice skating champ  chasing her mother's Olympic dreams  the dreams lost when she lost disqualified as the story goes in Sarajevo  and just wants to be normal. True to the HollywoodDisney formula there is the perfunctory supportive and accessible 'hunk' who just happens to be Gen's bother in Trevor Blumas. Directed by Tim Fywell and written by Hadley Davis Ice Princess is a story pegged on the duality of very pushy mothers in Cusak and Cattral whose daughters are being pushed in the direction that runs counter to their dreams.Despite the movie's predictability the Ice Princess had moments of seriousness almost lapses actually in the core subject matter of passionate loyalties amidst the cutthroat competitiveness of the figureskating world. Yes you will be treated to the attractive figure skating but Fywell is not tempted to push it over the top. Cusack and Cattrall bring a mature complexity to their difficult roles as mothers who are trying to control the raging hormones and resultant attitude. Problematic in some areas the movie does bring to presence the very important issues of coming of age parental interference and long term career planning. Unrealistic at best to think that after all that was invested a Harvard bound student not to mention the Olympic bound skater would throw it all away on a oneinamillion chance at 'true happiness' but we can always live vicariously in this imaginary space  which is why we will continue to be attracted to movies like Ice Princess.Miguel Llora".

I thought it was perfect and it was so cute I came out of there wishing I was an ice skater its just one of the movies that make you think to yourself Wow I wish I could do that. A lot of my friends thought this movie was a little weird but me and my friends were siting there crying after this movie. It was adorable in every way and I don't think it possibly could be better the only complaint I actually do have is the ending kiss between her and the boy it wasn't romantic at all if that was a little more romantic I thought that would be perfect.

FIrst of all speaking from experience competitive athletes do not treat their rivals in that manor. Most are very polite and encourage the other athletes. Second no coach would buy their own athlete a brand new pair of skates or grips gloves mitts right before a competition. Like the character Zoe said it takes around ten days to break in. Then Casey goes back to that coach to train! Thats ridiculous! Also an athlete that is a minor must have parent permission to compete in any sport. It is unrealistic that her mother would not have any knowledge of her daughter skating. This movie was more of people yelling crying and treating others like dirt than a heartwarming family film. Why was there such a feud between Joan Cusack and Kim Cattrall's characters? It's like they were just being jerks without a reason what's up with that? The only good thing I can say about this movie was the actors did an excellent job with their skating! If I'm not mistaken young Hayden Panettiere could barely ice skate when she started this project and now she is a very talented young skater. This was not the best movie that it could have been and I am quite disappointed with the writing make no mistake the actors did their best with a worthless script it's the writers and whoever approved the script to blame.".

No matter how much natural talent a person has it is impossible for someone to become that good of a skater in such a short period of time especially someone her age in the movie. Not only that but there are multiple tests that a skater has to pass in order to compete at that level and it's not like you can take the tests whenever you want you have to wait until a test session to take them. Also there's no way she could have competed without her mother knowing because as a minor you have to have your parent's consent in order to compete unless of course she forger her mother's signature. Sure the message of the movie is nice the dialogue is okay and I like the main actors but it's just so incredibly unrealistic. I'm 17 and have been skating since I was 7 and skated competitively from the age of 1813. I spend countless hours training and its incredibly insulting of Disney to make that portrays figure skating as being something any person with a good understanding of physics could be good at. And as a figure skater the most insulting thing you can tell me is that figure skating is easy. And it's because of movies like this that people think that. So sure if you want a heartwarming mediocre movie then by all means go see Ice princess but if you want to see a movie that is far more realistic about figure skating I think you'll have better luck with Blades of Glory.".

	schema:reviewBody "This does have some spoilers therefore don't read it if you actually want to see it. But I wouldn't recommend seeing it in the first place! This movie was completely and utterly corny no that is not strong enough of a word. This movie was extremely clichd banal stale hackneyed and just plain a waste of money time and brain cells.First of all the movie starts off with Casey Carlyle a physics geek trying to get a scholarship to Harvard. This was supposed to show how substandard her social life was before she fell into skating. Nevertheless the entire time you see this you think to yourself wow she is pretty smart and she is not even trying which in any other situation this would lead you to believe that she was better than the girls who are popular and stupid. But no!! Instead she has to become a figure skater to realize her feminine potential. You can tell that this is a man directing this Secondly the entire movie deals with her being a figure skater and being so good that she is able to accomplish what the other girls have worked so hard all their lives in less than a year. This is incredibly unrealistic and it just makes the movie loose credibility. Not only this but in the performances you see the other girls and they are all better than Casey even in the end.Also the fact that science was such a significant part of her life is dropped in the progression of the film. You have to understand that such intensity for physics does not just go away or is not started rambled about or perfected by someone who does not actually like such a subject. The movie leads you to believe that she is no longer a science geek which if she ever was in the first place she would not have lost all interest in it in the long run.Finally the movie was incredibly contradictory. The reason why movies have been using such strong characteristics in people to show their position is because if the characters flip flop from good guy to bad guy not only do have a corny movie but you also have no definite end or life lesson. This movie teaches you to drop one dream in order to peruse an other that you have to loose identity for another for one were you wear more make up and get the hot guys and that in the end you still do not come out on top win the first place medal but you still end up falling.I am very sorry that I complain about this movie but the situations were not believable the characters were jerks who only cared about one thing and could not look beyond that one thing whether it was getting your daughter the gold medal getting your daughter to go to Harvard getting to skate getting not to skate or obtaining popularity. I have to say that this is not exactly a movie that I should take so seriously. I mean it was supposed to be a kid's movie. But I could not find one thing that I like about it with the exception of course of the Zambonie driver which still was not realistic that he would do half of the things he did and it was a disappointment all together. I give it a 2 out of 10 and I am being generous.".

This movie was completely and utterly corny no that is not strong enough of a word. This movie was extremely clichd banal stale hackneyed and just plain a waste of money time and brain cells.First of all the movie starts off with Casey Carlyle a physics geek trying to get a scholarship to Harvard. This was supposed to show how substandard her social life was before she fell into skating. Nevertheless the entire time you see this you think to yourself wow she is pretty smart and she is not even trying which in any other situation this would lead you to believe that she was better than the girls who are popular and stupid. But no!! Instead she has to become a figure skater to realize her feminine potential. You can tell that this is a man directing this Secondly the entire movie deals with her being a figure skater and being so good that she is able to accomplish what the other girls have worked so hard all their lives in less than a year. This is incredibly unrealistic and it just makes the movie loose credibility. Not only this but in the performances you see the other girls and they are all better than Casey even in the end.Also the fact that science was such a significant part of her life is dropped in the progression of the film.

I do not mean that as a criticism but let's be honest. Disney rounds off the edges. Or then again and to be positive this movie is worth a peek if you have any interest in figure skating.This movie has an interesting subtext. The moms are jerks but the daughters are OK. And by the end the moms finally come around to understanding what their daughters truly want. I have a vague suspicion that many girls will say  for a variety of reasons  that the movie is not cool. But they'll get and secretly appreciate this message. As an aside to moms Kim Cattrall and Joan Cusack play the moms to perfection. Picture perfect pros. If you're a dad yes you can take your daughter and her friends to see this.My honest criticism? This movie has an excess of estrogen. All the lead characters are women in fact all the characters are women  save one boy who drives a Zamboni. Given all the movies with an excess of testosterone a balance seems appropriate. But I would prefer a balance within films themselves not between films. In a few months this'll be a sleepover rental for the 12 year old crowd or aspiring Olympic figure skaters.

The promotional poster is great but did not make much of a difference.What went wrong? At its core Ice Princess is a modern remake of 1949's It Happens Every Spring. In that film Ray Milland plays an underpaid college professor and longsuffering St. Louis Cardinals baseball fan. He is in his college lab one day working on developing a wood preserving chemical when a baseball comes through the window and smashes all the lab equipment. The chemicals get mixed into a new compound that repels wood. When rubbed on a baseball it causes the ball to jump away from wooden bats. He realizes the possibilities and takes a leave of absence to pitch St. Louis to the World Series. Most of the entertainment comes from having someone who has spent his life in the academic world trying to fit in with the much cruder world of professional sports.Ice Princess makes the main character a high school science wizard changes the gender and moves the idea to a skating rink. It is here that it hits its first problem. The professor in It Happens Every Spring is only playing baseball to earn enough money to marry his sweetheart he doesn't feel comfortable taking on that responsibility on his low teaching salary. One of the themes is the disparity in salary between the two professions. Throughout the film baseball is always just his temporary occupation until he returns to teaching the film is appealing because he always retains his identity as a professor. Ice Princess derails because Casey becomes a figure skater in order to change her identity and realize her feminine potential although this is masked by an unconvincing claim that she is pursuing her dream. Which is totally bogus as someone has already commented as you watch you think to yourself wow she is pretty smart and she is not even trying which in any other situation leads you to believe that she was better than the girls who are popular and stupid. Many viewers spend the movie hoping that she will keep her more likable identity as the smart outsider girl. Plus the idea is overused so much so that Not Another Teen Movie satirized the metamorphosis of the Ugly Duckling Girl Who's Really a Babe Underneath. The joke being that both Chyler Leigh's and Michelle Trachtenberg's ugly ducklings look at least as good as the babes they transform into.The basic premise of It Happens Every Spring was credible and although it raised some ethical issues it was highly amusing. The Ice Princess premise is not even remotely credible and the disconnect is compounded because the premise is more central to the story. Finally unlike It Happens Every Spring's almost exclusive focus on its main character Ice Princess is at least one story too many as you have several motherdaughter subplots which are contrived stale and boring. Perhaps most amazing about the low box office for Ice Princess is that it is significantly padded by Michelle Trachtenberg's huge male fan base. This means that even more of the movie's target audience is staying away than the attendance figures would indicate. Seeing Trachtenberg is almost reason enough to watch the film she is much better in her physics student identity but her scenes with Hayden Panettiere and Kristen Olson are also good. Although a failure commercially it was a good career move for Michelle and a great showcase for her beauty and growing acting skills. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Another excellent actress is Kim Catrall  I really loved her in this.The storyline is touching and it's yet another great story by Meg Cabot who is an excellent writer.All over I loved this movie. 1010";

Michelle Trachtenberg was really good and showed both her funny and serious self. Although the dialogue was a bit clich it really did keep me entertained for a few hours and afterwards made me think a bit. The tricks were very well done and the skating ability of the girls really was amazing. I think almost anyone would enjoy it if you like movies that are funny cute and have great acting.

I never watched Buffy so I only knew of her from the Discovery Channel's Truth of Scare series in which she sounds like a robot. But I really like her in this movie. With some inflection in her voice she's an effective and appealing actress.I'm not the tween audience this film is targeted for so maybe this is why the movie's lack of realism really bothered me throughout the film. I would like to see a movie about skating that show's the sport's realistic and competitive side more. This film showed it in a Disney comical sense but this film is just as much a fantasy as The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast.Overall the film was enjoyable and I liked the theme to follow your dream and the main character's maturity and toughness.

And you would be totally wrong. Mia HansenLve was only twentyseven when she made this profound film.She took her inspiration from two reallife models Humbert Balsan a brilliant film producer who took his life at the age of 51 when he realized he would go bankrupt and Donna Balsan his wife who for all her grief did her utmost to save Ognon Pictures her husband's company after his death. But mind you this is no straight biopic. For instance the names have been changed Grgoire Canvel the screen equivalent of Balsan has three kids instead of two the way he kills himself is different Bela Tarr the Hungarian director Balsan had trouble with at the time of his death has become Stig Janson a Swedish helmer and so on Even Mia HansenLve herself who is part of the story is represented indirectly by Arthura young film maker that Grgoire wants to produce but finally can't  a reference to Tout est pardonn HansenLve's former film whose production was taken over by Pellas Films after Balsan's suicide. Oddly enough Arthur happens to be interpreted by Igor HansenLve Mia's own brother. Sure Le pre de mes enfants is not the exact telling of the life of one of the most original producers of French cinema but it is very close to reality and perhaps even closer than if it was a mere biopic since what Mia HansenLve tries to do is to capture the essence of a man's soul not only to piece facts together.To achieve this end the writerdirector divides her story into two distinct parts. The first one presents Grgoire in his professional as well as in his family life both tending to intermingle to the despair of Sylvia Grgoire's wife. The long opening sequence during which Grgoire uses his mobile phone whatever the place he is in is explicit in this respect. At his country house on the weekend Grgoire is the loving father of three delightful daughters and Sylvia's faithful companion. At his Paris office he is an industrious man the enthusiastic tireless staunch defender of auteur filmmaking whether French or foreign. But money troubles become more and more insistent preventing him from indulging his passion serenely. The documentary aspect is excellent the account of the way the small production company works day after day is very realistic without being boring. But interesting as this part is it would not be enough to make Le pre de mes enfants something else but a good film. What makes it really outstanding is the second part in which Mia HansenLve explores the consequences of Grgoire's suicide on his nearest and dearest and on his collaborators. And she does it with a truly magic touch. She first very intelligently disposes of the set pieces of the discovery of the corpse and of the funeral. Instead she directly cuts to the deep sorrow experienced by Grgoire's wife and daughters the feeling of unacceptable loss of resentment against the deceased who abandoned them. Then she shows how the characters evolve slowly coming to terms with the situation gradually realizing that Grgoire's life has been so rich has brought them so much that he is now part of them that what he accomplished in the artistic domain before committing suicide has not disappeared. They know now that his spirit will go on living through his films through the persons they have become thanks to himA sad story but which does not make you sad in the end for Mia HansenLve doesn't take morbid delight in the evocation of death and the damages it causes. On the contrary it is life she pays a tribute to when she films wonderful scenes of family life with or without Grgoire often in a sunny atmosphere. In the end we get the comforting feeling that arrogant Death finally admits defeat.The actors although practically unknown are very convincing. LouisDo de Lencqueseing is fascinatingly close to his model and to his natural charm. His own teenage daughter Alice de Lencquesaing who plays Grgoire's oldest daughter is simply wonderful displaying a wealth of unaffected beauty and hypersensitivity. Alice Gautier and Manelle Driss who play her little sisters are full of life and Chiara Caselli in the difficult role of Gregoire's wife rings true throughout.Florent Dudognon who reviewed Tout est pardonn HansenLve's first feature on Evene on 3072007 used the following terms to qualify the film touching sensitive sweet unmarred by pop psychology crap played with restraint. I guess he will not change a word if he comments on Le pre de mes enfants a moving picture you must not miss on any account.".

This movie is not an edge of your seat thrill at every corner emotion jerker and that's what makes it superb. Hansen Lve binds this movie to a sense of realism which i find translates perfectly to its audience and relates to its audience. The movie illustrates Grgoire's progression towards suicide and the life for the family he leaves behind in a non appeasing human way. Grgoire's story may not provide the audience with explanations excuses or a nice dramatic lead up to his death. Scene by scene the audience is given mixed messages from Grgoire leading us to feel unprepared for his sudden death. But that is suicide in its realest form. And Hansen Lve has successfully translated this feeling from the Canvel family to the audience. In justification of the so called pointless scenes a scene sampling the relationship between the elder daughter and the writer boy who met with Grgoire or another sampling the elder daughters pursuance of her half brother is completely adequate. The daughter is rebuilding her life after Grgoire's death which cannot be shown to us in a detailed flowing coherent way because that is not the way she is living it. The broken inconsistent scenes of the elder daughter's the younger daughters' and the wife's lives are shown to the audience in the same way they are lived by the characters.The scenes prior to Grgoire's death however construct a solid image of the emotional bond and unity of the 5 members of the Canvel family scenes such as a giggling Valentine being discovered by Grgoire hiding in his bed or Billie floating alone in the pool of water being watched over by her mother. I think in order to profit from this movie the audience's expectations should be shifted from a rollercoaster ride of emotions kind of movie complete with drama coherence and a relevant easy to follow plot to that of a sincere expression of life as it is and how it continues captured on film. In this respect it is superb.".

Young WriterDirector Mia HansenLve has created a story loosely based on a real situation that manages to examine the central aspect of family love 'the defeat of death the victory of life'. Grgoire Canvel LouisDo de Lencquesaing is a producer in the film industry an auteur who is devoted to quality films. As a producer he has several films in varying stages of production including one in Sweden directed by a difficult genius who has little respect for cost containment and the financial aspects of his Moon Films is in rocky terrain despite being surrounded by a staff devoted to his vision and going without pay because of their commitment. At the same time Grgoire is a devoted husband to his wise wife Sylvia Chiara Caselli and to his three daughters  the oldest being the sensitive Clmence a stunning portrayal by young Alice de Lencquesaing Valentine Alice Gautier and Billie Manelle Driss  taking country walks with them and being wholly involved with their family activities despite the fact that he is constantly on the cellphone managing the tragedies that abound at work. It is apparent that everyone who comes into contact with Grgoire feels the special gifts he has  except for the lawyer and creditors he tries to avoid. The financial sinkhole opens and Grgoire in despair commits suicide. The story actually begins here as the point of the film is how each of the people who came under Grgoire's influence  coworkers wife and children and friends  responds to the loss of this man. There is not the usual breastbeating grieving but rather a quiet study of how each of these people is affected by and reacts to the passing of a solitary genius by suicide. The film is definitely one that is life affirming rather than an extended eulogy! The entire cast is excellent with special kudos to the children as well as to Eric Elmosnino who plays a rock bound friend to the family and the director's brother Igor HansenLve whose small part as a hopeful writer is richly detailed. This may be too early a time to judge the talent of Mia HansenLve but if she is able to maintain the quality she achieves in THE FATHER OF MY CHILDREN she has an exciting future in cinema. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " Well done but I was left wanting more";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers This meditation on a suicide left me somewhat unsatisfied. It is the story of Grgoire Canvel a successful French movie producer and his family. The first part of the movie introduces us to the Canvel family Grgoire his wife and three attractive young daughters. There are scenes that illustrate the great affection that exists among all members of this family like Grgoire playfully searching for his youngest daughter who is hiding under the covers in her bed.We are led to believe that Grgoire is a typical harried businessman who spends most of his life on his cell phone. However as the movie progresses it is seen that Grgoire's company is in some serious financial trouble and his business is on the verge of bankruptcy. Hints are dropped that Grgoire himself may be in some deep emotional waters. All of this is well and good and I waited to find out the resolution to this unfortunate situation but I was not prepared for Grgoire's abrupt suicide about half way through the movie. Indeed his suicide is mystifying since Grgoire's family life is so positive. I wanted more details on the motivation for the suicidecould it have simply been the financial problems as implied? That seems too simple an explanation. Grgoire is seen burning some documents before ending his life what were those? Why was the audience denied knowing this since that could have helped in understanding the suicide. Grgoire mentioned that as a last resort he could tap into his wife's monies. He never acted on that. Why was that? Was it even a possibility?The second half of the movie details the family's reaction to Grgoire's fatal act. This part of the movie plays out in a believably realistic way. Grgoire's wife Sylvia tries to finish up the projects that her husband had underway at the time of his death. If she had substantial financial reserves she did not use those to accomplish her goals. Each of the three girls copes in her own waylife goes on.In the end I felt like a voyeur dropping on in this family's tragedy and I had to question the value of the movie. It was not a warning to pay closer attention to the emotional state of others since I think that there was no way that Sylvia could have guessed the gravity of Grgoire's mental state. Maybe an admonition that people should be more forthcoming in communicating what they are thinking? On average in France there are three male suicides for every female suicide. Does this movie help in understanding that statistic?The movie is well filmed and the actors are in good form. As a bonus there is a small travelogue of Parisian scenes as Grgoire drives around Paris. But I was left wanting more.".

The rest of the livings are trying to cope and pick the pieces but in vain at least for the pieces as the movie gets you to believe that despite everything life goes on... you could say this actually is a contradiction in term! I was a little annoyed about the music score in the beginning rather loud and not flattering perhaps I missed something and I also must have missed something with the ending song that did not work very well for me I found it rather inappropriate but my friends disagreed with me so there you are each person may respond in different way.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has been well reviewed described as a 'rollercoaster' and emotional so I was prepared for something quite heavy. However some 30 minutes in nothing much had happened. The film centers around Gregoire a husband father and workaholic who runs a film production company that is facing massive financial issues. In between continuous phone calls and business meetings Gregoire spends time with his family at their apartment or at the house in the country. The family seem very close and content but away from this Gregoire is in crisis mode.The start of the film plays outs very slowly but there is a sense that something tragic will happen. Of course it does but the effect is less than I would expect. Gregoire's death devastates those around him and his wife is left to pick up the pieces. What should be an emotional er rollercoaster fails to engage on an emotional level because while we see Gregoire is up against life there is no indication that life is so bad that suicide is the answer. There is also no shock element to his death Gregoire burns some papers then walks along and shoots himself and it all seemed unrealistic.The film also struggles as there is an immense array of pointless scenes the elder daughter sitting in a cafe ordering a coffee the family walking around a church in Italy. All of these scenes add nothing except to drag out the story which after the death introduces a secret child and a friendship between the elder daughter and a young man who was to work with her fathers company. Neither of these stories are explored in any detail and so add nothing to the film either.It's a shame that for me the film didn't engage. There are some nice performances especially from the daughters and the scenes of the family are actually quite endearing. What a loss then that a potentially interesting and emotional story set inside the world of film making is nothing but slow and a little boring.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com".

This was a tradition in Russia and Poland as well a narrator or actor would read the intertitles of a silent film adding commentary and at times their own political bent to a feature. This was popular throughout silent cinema's reign and particularly relevant in industrial or agrarian communities with lower literacy rates. Shunsui Matsuda a Benshi who traveled throughout coal mining regions of postwar Japan where shortages made reruns of silent films popular entertainment appears in Hayashi's film. Mr. Matsuda is also to be lauded for his work preserving old films many prints he acquired by searching in thrift shops and restoring them. His excellent book The Benshi Japanese Silent Film Narrators details both his work and the Benshi tradition. In many ways comparable to Mohsen Makhmalbaf's Once Upon a Time Cinema though without the political commentary Hayashi's work creates a complete magical world combining both the past and the present.

He purchased a large old home with the intention of converting it into a kind of bed  breakfast since the road running nearby is supposed to be expanded which would bring tourists. But the road hasn't been expanded yet and the Katakuris subsequently have no guests. When one finally shows up mysteriously he commits suicide during the night. They hide the body to avoid bad publicity. But they seem to be in a patch of bad luck and more things begin to go wrong. Through it all however the family sticks together and sings happy songs.Oh how I wanted to give this film a 10! It has so many elements I love. It's an absurdist mix of horror surrealism a musical claymation a black comedy and one of those progressively going to hell in a handbasket films ala After Hours 1985 Very Bad Things 1998 or My Boss' Daughter 2003. Unfortunately Happiness of the Katakuris suffers a bit from being unfocused. All of the individual elements are superb but director Takashi Miike simply abandons too many interesting threads and the film ends up feeling more like a loose collection of skits. If it were tied together better this would easily be a 10.Happiness of the Katakuris which is a mutated remake Jiwoon Kim's Choyonghan kajok The Quiet Family 1998 begins with a restaurant scene that ends up being unrelated to the rest of the film. While a woman is eating a strange creature appears in her soup. This initiates a long sequence of claymation. The creature is a small skinny albino whiteeyed demon who wakes up from being stabbed in the neck with a fork and proceeds to rip out his wouldbeconsumer's uvula which he turns into a heartshaped balloon. The claymation has a strong Tim Burton feel ala The Nightmare Before Christmas 1993 and provides a wonderfully surreal and somewhat gory version of a circle of life also known as a food chain. At this point I was completely loving the film.Oddly Miike drops this material and we go back to a standard liveaction mode as we learn about the Katakuris initially from narration by toddler Yurie Tamaki Miyazaki. I kept thinking that the claymation demons would return somehow but they're forgotten about even if claymation eventually makes a return later in the film with a style more reminiscent of Bruce Bickford who did the claymation in Frank Zappa's Baby Snakes 1979.Fortunately the Katakuris are intriguing in their own right and for a long time the film settles into more of a quirky arthouse drama style albeit with a darker edge due to the fate of the hotel's guests. During this period a romance subplot enters as we meet Richado Sagawa Kiyoshiro Imawano who is courting Katakuri divorce Shizue Naomi Nishida.There are a few interesting musical numbers and the love song between Richado and Shizue has attractive bright production design. Although some of the songs were a bit bland to meI prefer the music of say Jisatsu saakuru Suicide Club 2002they are all intriguingly staged ranging from spoofs of rock videos to The Sound of Music 1965. Miike keeps a wicked sense of humor going throughout the filmthere is something funny about most of the characters most of the ways the characters relate to each other and most of the scenarios.All of the technical elements in the film are superb. Miike treats us to a lot of interesting cinematography the locationsetting of the Katakuri home is wonderful and the performances are good.Later Miike shoots for more of a madcap Monty Pythonesque style complete with zombies nodding their heads and toetapping to a song ala the Camelot dungeon prisoner in Monty Python and the Holy Grail 1975 or the group of people being crucified in Life of Brian 1979. The latter reference is particularly apt as the message of The Happiness of the Katakuris insofar as there is one ends up being remarkably similar to the message of the song Always Look On the Bright Side of Life from Life of Brian. Namely life is short and often brutal so we should focus on enjoying ourselves and having a good time with others while we're here and once we're gone others should celebrate our life and the time we had on the Earth rather than mourning our passingsomewhat like the funerals in some Caribbean cultures which involve joyous singing and dancing rather than dour moping and tears.Those are messages that I couldn't agree with more. It's just too bad that Miike couldn't have made the film a bit tighter but even as loose as it is you can't afford to miss this one if you have a taste for anything more unusualsurreal.".

Nine times out of ten you'd guess it's a horror movies but nine times out of ten you wouldn't guess a comedy. Even less you'd say a musical. But if you combine all three you get The Happiness of the Katakuris a crazy hybrid directed ironically by the guy who directed the aforementioned Audition of the three. Actually four since I just remembered about the animation. This fourgenre film is far from perfect but it's pretty damn good for the combination of the genres.The Katakuri clan owns a guest house on Mt. Fuji because they hear a road will be built leading up to the house therefore much business. However the road hasn't been built yet the Katakuris haven't had a single guest and Shizue Naomi Nishida is recently divorced. Soon however she finds Richard Sagawa Kiyoshiro Imawano and they fall in love. But is everything what it seems? And once the first guest comes he mysteriously dies Murder? Suicide? the songcomplete with smoke and blue lightsasks. Soon more guests come they all die and the Katakuris have to bond together to figure out a solution to this problem.The movie starts off with a couple minutes of claymation that serves as an odd transition to the actual story. I guess it was a pretty lowbudget movie because for two other actionpacked scenes claymation is also used. It works well in the context of the story but a little unexpected too. It's not jarring or anything and the clay characters look like the real ones as much as possible so that's good. Some of the humor comes from the obvious when the father is swinging on a swing he claims to safe it breaks some from the absurd a man singing in a music video in drag obviously that everyone thinks is a woman and some comes from the quirkiness of the musical numbers like that aforementioned one. There's also a delirious ballad some slow songs and some joyous ones. There's even a singalong. There're some lulls in between songs as expected in all musicals but you'd be surprised how much reading subtitles doesn't distract you from the songs. It's just like reading subtitles throughout a film. It is a bit weird during the singalong though.It's not really a true horror although there's a few gruesome images and the themes are quite dark. They're presented humorously though and that's all that counts. Taken apart each lacks. The comedy's not hilarious the horror's not scary the animation's just random and the musical numbers except for a few aren't really memorable. But I still think you should see it. I'll bet that you've never seen anything like it before and you probably never will until Hollywood remakes it.My rating 710Rated R for violent images and some sexual content.".

If you have ever wet yourself sitting through Monty Python you are going to enjoy this. This isn't Will and Grace. Most of the songs are great the song based around a dead man with scissors in his neck is brilliant. They are cheesy OTT and have some of the best dance moves since Ricky Martin tried dismally to samba his way into the charts. I am still humming along to some of the tunes from the Katakuris not Ricky Martin. Although I wish he'd been a guest at the Katakuri's guest house. My greatest problem with the film comes from its advertising. It is labelled as a Cannibal Musical in some press releases. Ignore this. There is no cannibalism in this film. Not even a suggestion of it. Nobody even says in close up Oh I am hungry and then is juxtaposed with a shot of a dead body. The only feasible description of this film which mentions cannibalism is Is not about cannibalism unless if by cannibalism you mean songs. You are going to have a great time watching this film and if you are familiar with Miike I think it is safe to say that this film is more shocking that even Ichi the Killer. Why? Because at the end of it you feel all warm and fluffy inside and I dare say nobody expects this from Takashi Miike. I certainly didn't.".

I am still humming along to some of the tunes from the Katakuris not Ricky Martin. Although I wish he'd been a guest at the Katakuri's guest house. My greatest problem with the film comes from its advertising. It is labelled as a Cannibal Musical in some press releases. Ignore this. There is no cannibalism in this film. Not even a suggestion of it. Nobody even says in close up Oh I am hungry and then is juxtaposed with a shot of a dead body. The only feasible description of this film which mentions cannibalism is Is not about cannibalism unless if by cannibalism you mean songs. You are going to have a great time watching this film and if you are familiar with Miike I think it is safe to say that this film is more shocking that even Ichi the Killer. Why? Because at the end of it you feel all warm and fluffy inside and I dare say nobody expects this from Takashi Miike. I certainly didn't.";

Miike proves just how versatile his insanity is by directing something insane yet far away from his standard fare. We get dancing zombies in one scene a very strange claymation scene that seems to exist for no real purpose and cheesy musical numbers that are well over the top. This funny and happy Miike is so much cooler than the Miike obsessed with exploding brains and unsettling torture scenes.Ever seen the Monty Python film 'The Life of Brian'? 'Happiness of the Katakuris' ends with the same message always look on the bright side of life. 'Happiness of the Katakuris' is very entertaining and funny and a great film although I doubt it would appeal to everyone. It is my new favourite movie.

However my wife and I have urged our friends to see this film and all agree that it is a real gem. It is important that you watch the movie with an open mind as the first few minutes of the film are believe it or not done in claymation! Then it fades to the presentday Japan and the totally bizarre adventures that occur to a genuinely nice Japanese family. Through no fault of their own this family's bed and breakfast seems to attract patrons fated to die in rather comical ways at that. The family's response? Simplebreak into SONG!!! The songs are meant to be very silly and overly dramatic and turn out to be GREAT FUN!! The best of these has got to be the song and dance number featuring this sweet family and zombies dead hotel guests. I'm sure NONE of this sounds funny or charming but it is without a doubt both of these things as well as believe it or not a family valuesaffirming film.The bottom line is if you are brave and want something that is TOTALLY unpredictable and engaging watch this film ASAP! Also if you like weird and surreal musicals I also recommend the Dutch film YES SISTER NO SISTER.".

While Miike's ability to grab your attention and slowly drag you into the film is still present the musical numbers probably had me and others laughing in the crowd.  The Katakuris are a bunch of characters let me tell ya.  Miike's dark side is there but in a twisted strange more subtle way.  Watch the expressions faces and exaggerated acting in this film which are definitely major highlights.  Some of my faves were the navy guy the guests of the house the grandpa but overall the family are hilarious when all onscreen.It's definitely has its moments of lightheartedness laughs and 'interesting' claymation.  Very entertaining and fun.  A lot of people including myself were cracking up in disbelief and bewilderment. Definitely see it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Miike Takashi's Katakurike no Koufuku' is a wonderfully bizarre black comedy musical highly reminiscent of the music videos and live concert performances staged by the nowdefunct 80s  90's Jpop powerhouse Kome Kome Club.  Miike's choice of Sawada Kenji as Katakuri Masao further accentuates this similarity since he strongly resembles K2C cofront man Carl Smoky' Ishii Tatsuya.  The somewhat unpolished song  dance routines unlike K2C along with episodic fits of overacting and selfdepreciating manonawire work combine to create a totally off the wall mix of dark humour and Miike's trademark visual grossouts.In synopsis Katakuri Masao is a downsized urbanite who stakes his family's livelihood on restoring a rundown country inn.  Masao along with wife Terue Matsuzaka Keiko and father Jinpei Tamba Tetsuro reel in their troubled son Masayuki Takeda Shinji and divorced daughter Shizue Nishida Naomi to create their family dream.  But alas location is everything and without a major road nearby the White Lover's Inn' waits patiently sans customers.  When guests finally do begin to arrive the Katakuris find through no fault of their own that their guests have an annoying habit of dying.  Not to be discouraged however the Katakuris do their best to persevere as a family and find time for a number of offbeat musical numbers in between.The most irritating character was the secondrate con man Richard Sawada played by  actorsinger Iwamano Kiyoshiro who also played a deadbeat suitor in the TBS dorama Boku no Shusshoku. He actually does a fair job at speaking bad gaijinsounding Japanese and he's one of the only actors in the movie to my knowledge with a musical background.  Oh and the shot with him wearing the Oakley OverTheTops' is pretty funny.  One of the strangest elements to me besides the opening claymation sequence was the fact that the prologue  epilogue narratives were voiced in retrospect by the young grand daughter for no apparent reason.  Some reviewers point out the moralistic undertones of family values and such but I suspect that even this was thrown in by Miike as part of a coldcocked slap in the face with regards to anything being morally relevant in the film or making sense for that matter.".

While the idea of a combination slapstick musicalblack comedy filled with incongruent claymation sequences should on the face of it be enough to recommend any film I could not help feeling let down by the genius behind Audition and Ichi the Killer.

But the movie was fairly slowly moving with very little actually happening which in my opinion weighed the movie down.Also the DVD cover has 'the hills are alive with the sound of screaming!' boasted on the front cover. Yeah that was false advertising of a grand scale. And on the back of the cover it boasted 'The Sound of Music meets Dawn of the Dead ... yeah right!The story itself was entertaining especially since all those people tragically died at the family's guesthouse which was kind of strange and coincidental. And the family itself was quite interesting and weird at the same time. The characters in the movie were nicely portrayed and had lots of depths to them which really worked in favor of the movie. And the makeup of the zombies was actually quite good I enjoyed that quite a lot even though it was less than 5 minutes of screen time.If you enjoy Asian musicals then The Happiness of the Katakuris is perhaps a great choice for you personally I enjoyed the Korean musical The Fox Family a lot more than I did this movie.

The cast is pretty good. The father is Kenji Sawada who seems to always have things happen. The mother is Keiko Matsuzaka who seems to take charge in the worst situations. Then you have the brother Shinji Takeda who is an ex con. The sister is Naomi Nishida who only wants to find a husband. Her daughter is played by Tamaki Miyazaki who is a cute little girl who is also the narrator. Then you have the grandpa played by Tetsuro Tanba who is just kind of out of his mind. The whole cast had different personalities and throughout the film you see more interesting characters. Also in the film you will see zombies and death followed by happy musical numbers. Then you will see reality burst into the abnormal with claymation scenes creative and interesting. This film will pretty much make you go through every emotion. Combining the goofy with a normal reality. The story line is really hard to explain. Instead of explaining it it is better to watch it and experience it. This film is truly not in the norm at all and that is what makes it so great to watch. There is always something going on. The only really thing I had against it is that it can get a little too confusing and some of the characters moments can get a little too goofy. But no matter what happens you still want to watch it. I actually caught myself not paying attention to the story at parts and just being interested in the moment going on. Another crazy film by Takashi Miike.".

So the acting's singularly terribly. What? That's supposed to be some sort of IRONIC thing is it? So the characters sporadically burst into spectacularly unlistenable song punctuated by unchoreographed amateurish dance sequences? I suppose that's also supposed to be funny and clever? Oh and there's the standard bugsdecayblahblahBLAH imagery. Yes yes I too have seen Marilyn Manson videos. Very nice. Go away. Look anybody can do something rubbish. Rubbish is easy. Why not try NOT being rubbish? I mean surely as one of the most prolific directors currently working outside Hollywood Takashi must know a thing or two about not being rubbish? Seems that to criticise this sort of thing leaves one wide open to being told yeah well you just Don't Get It. And maybe I don't. Maybe I don't see what's so great about having an opening sequence with some sort of stupid claymation goblin in it but maybe there IS something great about that. Fine. I can dig it. I still think it's rubbish. This movie's closest equivalent might be Gondry's Human Nature which wasn't very well received perhaps because many people found it misguided and clumsy. Which it was.

So the acting's singularly terribly. What? That's supposed to be some sort of IRONIC thing is it? So the characters sporadically burst into spectacularly unlistenable song punctuated by unchoreographed amateurish dance sequences? I suppose that's also supposed to be funny and clever? Oh and there's the standard bugsdecayblahblahBLAH imagery. Yes yes I too have seen Marilyn Manson videos. Very nice. Go away. Look anybody can do something rubbish. Rubbish is easy. Why not try NOT being rubbish? I mean surely as one of the most prolific directors currently working outside Hollywood Takashi must know a thing or two about not being rubbish? Seems that to criticise this sort of thing leaves one wide open to being told yeah well you just Don't Get It. And maybe I don't. Maybe I don't see what's so great about having an opening sequence with some sort of stupid claymation goblin in it but maybe there IS something great about that. Fine. I can dig it. I still think it's rubbish. This movie's closest equivalent might be Gondry's Human Nature which wasn't very well received perhaps because many people found it misguided and clumsy. Which it was. But it sure wasn't as misguided and clumsy as this Katakuri crap.";

It is a very irregular film but it still boasts good style and good manners in atmospherebuilding even if it doesn't really live up to meet the expectations at least for me.The story goes about Marie and Alexia best friends who drive up to Alexia's parents' countryside house hoping to find some peace for studying. Instead they'll have to fight a psychopathic killer in a macabre catandmouse game.The best part in my opinion is the miseenscene and the introduction of the characters and the storyline. Everything in those first sequences tells us that something horrible is going to happen not only because we already know that we're watching a horror film. The dusty road the scorching weather the big corn fields... the real feel of a horror story scene is there. It increases with the night scenes the shots of the house the staircase the corridors. The gloominess and inherent darkness of the place and the quiet surroundings perfectly do their job of preparing us for what's to come.The storytelling loses steam after this part. Not being a big fan of gore I didn't really care for the bloody murder scenes but I'm sure that they'll be appreciated by many they're rather truculent and well filmed. The duel between Marie and the killer didn't really work for me in fact I found it a little boring. On the whole I thought the story was unoriginal and predictable but contrary to what many say I don't think it's deceitful I didn't feel that the director cheats on the audience with the ending. I won't elaborate on this so as not to spoil the film for those who want to see it.I have mixed feelings about High Tension. On the one hand for me it is ineffective as a thriller and flawed as an exercise of storytelling. On the other however the murky atmosphere and the darkness of the story and of its subtleties stuck with me for a while after seeing the film. I wouldn't watch it again but I understand why many like it so much.".

Although I doubt it makes a difference because my complaint has to do broadly with the plot of this film my review is based off the US theatrical release.It starts off as a fairly standard chainsaw massacre type of flick which to be completely honest has never been my favorite genre and ends as something I didn't think existed a slasher flick with a plot so awful that it loses any value it may have had as a simple gore fest. It turns out that the main character has multiple personalities and is also the killer or something to that effect. It's very hard to say exactly what happened in the movie because after that revelation it is obvious that 99 of the movie must be dismissed as nonsensical.If this trite twist is done in a clever way it can make piecing together the plot preceding the revelation an interesting endeavor but this movie didn't bother with being clever. The main character would have to be in two different places at the same time in the film so many times that there is no point in trying to put it all together. There is a car chase with vehicles driven by different aspects of the personality one aspect rides to a remote house with her friend the other drives a souped up murder wagon there. Obvious holes such as one personality getting an injury which persists through the remainder of the film in a car wreck which wouldn't have happened if she were actually in the other unwrecked vehicle the whole time plague this film.This is laziest attempt of a director springing a twist on the audience that I have seen. Picture some dimwit introducing their self to you as Chuck having a conversation with you then proudly revealing their name is actually Aja and that they really outsmarted you. Yeah quite a zinger there Aja. When the rest of a movie becomes completely nonsensical due to the addition of a plot twist perhaps that twist could have been left out.

In fact just about everything that can bleed does bleed in this movie and does so copiously.High Tension aka Switchblade Romance much better title is the best horror movie I've seen come out in theaters in years. After so many times hearing this is the movie horror fans have been waiting for and then being horribly disappointed by Cabin Fever The Ring Malevolence Darkness The Grudge and every single other one I am throwing my full weight behind this one. Switchblade Romance is the movie real horror movie fans have been waiting for. It's a bloody merciless nohumor and noholdsbarred homage to the classic slasher pics of the 70s and yet it surpasses almost every movie it draws its inspiration from. We get an unstoppable but definitely human killer far more interesting than say Jason or what Michael Myers has now become because of his obviously being human and because he makes some undeniably smart decisions and operates in a continuously logical inescapable way. The arsenal on display is impressive as it should be in any decent slasher movie. We get the basic straight razor the butcher knife shotgun axe and in an incredible and deliciously violent nod to Texas Chainsaw Massacre the power buzzsaw.Every aspect of this film is in place. The plot is simple and straightforward the acting even dubbed is interesting and despite complaints of why only parts of it were dubbed if you watch closely and pay attention to who speaks French and who is dubbed it actually makes perfect sense and fits with the movie the cinematography is strangely artistic almost giallilike the bloodletting stylish and gruesome the sound design incredible the tension almost unwavering. The initial horror set piece the arrival of the killer and the slaughter in the house is bound to become a wellremembered and oft referenced classic scene of horror. The sheer brutality and stark reality of it ranks it up there in my mind with the gut wrenching finale of Odishon. A quick word on the performances. There's minimal dialogue but what there is is at least two steps up from most horror films. Its meant to build character whereas most slasher flick dialogue is there just to drive the plot. Here we care about the characters even those who don't get much of a chance to talk because the situation is so much more real than your average flick and so is the acting. Cecile de France's physical performance is stunning the fear on her face the tension in every limb the breath rate the pain everything and the sheer madness that Maiwenn's character endures is perfectly conveyed by the utter despair she is able to convey even with a gag in her mouth most of the time.An of course a quick word on the ending. Quit complaining! The ending of this movie is great not only does it take an extremely well made but somewhat shallow gore pic to a whole new level with some interesting things to say about... well I won't say on account of not spoiling it but yes it actually does make sense if you've watched the movie carefully and have enough intellect to think about it on your own rather than just taking at face value what you've seen. I halfway wonder if the twist wasn't in part a snobby French joke Aja decided to play to see if we lulled summer blockbusterfed Americans could figure it out and realize that everything works without being spoonfed exactly how it works.8  10  which makes it twice as good as the next best horror movie to come out in theatres in a decade. The only thing that keeps it from attaining a perfect 10 is that although the tension is cranked up high for most of it and the scares are a thing that will haunt you more after walking out of the movie than when you're watching the suspense does kind of flag unexpectedly in a few key places. Still given the other 80 of the movie is extremely suspenseful and effectively brutal this is a small flaw. If you like horror movies GO SEE IT.".

The plot is simple and straightforward the acting even dubbed is interesting and despite complaints of why only parts of it were dubbed if you watch closely and pay attention to who speaks French and who is dubbed it actually makes perfect sense and fits with the movie the cinematography is strangely artistic almost giallilike the bloodletting stylish and gruesome the sound design incredible the tension almost unwavering. The initial horror set piece the arrival of the killer and the slaughter in the house is bound to become a wellremembered and oft referenced classic scene of horror. The sheer brutality and stark reality of it ranks it up there in my mind with the gut wrenching finale of Odishon. A quick word on the performances. There's minimal dialogue but what there is is at least two steps up from most horror films. Its meant to build character whereas most slasher flick dialogue is there just to drive the plot. Here we care about the characters even those who don't get much of a chance to talk because the situation is so much more real than your average flick and so is the acting. Cecile de France's physical performance is stunning the fear on her face the tension in every limb the breath rate the pain everything and the sheer madness that Maiwenn's character endures is perfectly conveyed by the utter despair she is able to convey even with a gag in her mouth most of the time.An of course a quick word on the ending. Quit complaining! The ending of this movie is great not only does it take an extremely well made but somewhat shallow gore pic to a whole new level with some interesting things to say about... well I won't say on account of not spoiling it but yes it actually does make sense if you've watched the movie carefully and have enough intellect to think about it on your own rather than just taking at face value what you've seen. I halfway wonder if the twist wasn't in part a snobby French joke Aja decided to play to see if we lulled summer blockbusterfed Americans could figure it out and realize that everything works without being spoonfed exactly how it works.8  10  which makes it twice as good as the next best horror movie to come out in theatres in a decade. The only thing that keeps it from attaining a perfect 10 is that although the tension is cranked up high for most of it and the scares are a thing that will haunt you more after walking out of the movie than when you're watching the suspense does kind of flag unexpectedly in a few key places. Still given the other 80 of the movie is extremely suspenseful and effectively brutal this is a small flaw. If you like horror movies GO SEE IT.";

This certainly had a similar affect on me it scared me and horrified me it even surprised me more than any other movie has of late.If you have any preconception about foreign cinema being weaker to Hollywood then you have hardly spent enough time watching foreign cinema and too much time engrossed in poor romantic flicks with Clooney et al. You really need to get out and grab some of that Japanese Spanish and French cinema action. It's easily had and there's a lot to it far better movies...anyway I find myself digressing again.From the outset this movie pitches itself as a hard horror it isn't going to pull any punches and it's going to show you like it is harrowing and horrific. That said the story then turns to a slower pace and you find that it's mixing the suspenseful thriller in with the moments of full on horror and it's done so well. Too well in fact and watching the psychotic at work is sometimes shocking.It rides a fine line between schlock horror and suspense horror it manages to combine the two without falling into a complete gore flick. It is gory mind you very gory. I was eating a couple of biscuits during the movie and I stopped until it was finished even then I wasn't sure.That's where this movies strength lies it really pushes the boundaries of between those two types of movies but keeps its feet firmly in the suspense and tension area. The film is exceedingly tense and it's raised slowly to begin with but creeps up at every set piece and it's not long before the shocking and surprising final set piece is upon you. That in itself is terrifying and as it unfolded on me I was stunned.Part of me thinks that this movie could have done much better without all the horror but I'm not sure that the film would have carried on the tension and suspense alone it's the very presence of the horror that adds to and heightens the pressure.A very stylish tense film truly a suspensethrillerhorror to be proud of from the French.

	schema:reviewBody "Haute Tension is one of the best horror films I have seen in years.  It is appropriately gruesome and shocking and does not take the wise cracking action movie based horror movie approach that so many recent horror films have taken.  The film is well made and paced and builds up the suspense to a crescendo and does not overstay it's welcome.  One would have found it unusual for French cinema to be the one to revitalize the horror genre which has become hackneyed and trite in Hollywood so many want to refer to it as psychological thriller.  The story follows 2 college coeds visiting the homestead of one of the girl's family on a school break.  A mysterious man in a mechanic jumpsuit and old truck reminiscient of the one in Jeepers Creeperscomes to the house in the night and brutally murders the family kidnaps the girl and overlooks her friend who has to pursue the killer to rescue her friend.  Director Alexander Aja does not make a pedestrian light weight horror film and the deaths in the film are disturbing and brutal.  There is no humor or comic relief and the blood literally soaks the camera lens.  The sense of dread and the unrelenting suspense and pace makes this a refreshing breath of fresh air from all of the PG13 rated Scream wannabes that have been hitting the multiplexes. Wes Craven had reportedly seen Haute Tension at Sundance and has hand picked Alexander Aja to remake The Hills Have Eyes and have free artistic licence since Craven had pegged him as the future of horror. There is even a plot twist which you will either love or hate but it fits in well with the film.   The performances by Cecile de France Maewenn and the actor who portrays the killer are perfect. All in all this is a French film that deserves to be seen in American multiplexes and a must see for horror movie fans the world over who have been having to settle for mediocre horror for many years now.".

	schema:headline " Craven and Hooper would be proud unfortunately so would Shyamalan.";
	schema:reviewBody "The 70's and 80's produced what I consider to be the best horror films ever made. There were more independent films being made 20 and 30 years ago and that led to less studio intervention. I seriously doubt Sam Raimi could have made his classic gore fest THE EVIL DEAD if The Weinsteins were behind the scenes. And I know for a fact that Tobe Hooper would never have gotten away with what he did to make Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE as shock inducing as he did. And finally what I consider is the most disturbing film ever made never would have been made if guys like Michael Ovitz were behind it. Could you imagine if Ovitz was visiting the set of LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT took a look at the dailies and then said okay that intestine part has to go the slapping of the naked girls has to be trimmed down and the fellatio part has to be edited. Last House would not be the classic that it is today and it certainly would not be a paradigm to all horror films that many aspire to make today.Now what we have are a plethora of films that follow in M. Night Shyamalan's footsteps after his monster and genre defining hit SIXTH SENSE. It's a great film that puts the suspense back in horror. And as much as I love Sixth Sense as much as I respect what Shyamalan has done to help redefine horror too many of today's film makers try to emulate him and screw things up.HIGH TENSION for the first 80 minutes of the movie is a true testament to the basic primal animal that we are or can be. It is an uncompromising and relentless attack of our senses our nerves and our being. It shreds the neo horror film ideology that THE RING and Sixth Sense seemed to invent and instead grabs a hold of your intestines and squeezes and then twists. It is about as intense of a film as I have seen in quite some time. While not as sick and depraved as Last House on the Left it treads in the same water. This has the look and feel of a 70's guts on the wall horror film and for that I applaud Alexandre Aja for writing and directing a film that looks like it had very little studio intervention and as such the film is about as shocking a film as you will see from any North American distributed film.High Tension's strength is that it is about as violent and blood soaked as any film from the period that it pays homage to. Gone is the horror film blueprint that teens seem to love today. This is a film made by a director that grew up perhaps admiring some of the greats from three decades ago. You can see homages to films like Friday THE 13TH MADMAN THE STEPFATHER and of course Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There are at least 4 scenes in this film that truly shocked me. The violence is real it is macabre and it is brutal. Blood spills it flows and it sprays. I have never seen someone get their throat slit but I would imagine it would something like it does in this film.The pace of the film is frenetic and at about the twenty minute mark the dialogue pretty much stops and what we have is a cat and mouse game. Aja does his talking with chainsaws barbed wire and a switchblade. There is much attention to detail in this film and I guess that sort of justifies the end which is about as beguiling as any legerdemain present in any of the films since Sixth Sense.The ending has to be mentioned because as I'm sure many of you know by now the ending is unnecessary chicanery. It just didn't need to be there. But to be fair the film does allude to the road it is embarking on it just seems like an extrinsic path. The denouement of the film can be a distraction and take away from the raw emotion the film does a great job of making you feel up until this point. And if you examine the film you'll realize that what you have seen for the last 80 minutes is pretty much impossible. I took all of that into consideration before writing this review. And what it comes down to is this The films is so perfect before the preposterous ending that you can kind of ignore the impossibilities and chicanery. If you can just see the film for all of its brilliance before the last ten minutes you'll love the pure terror that this film presents us with. But just a word of warning. The ending is misleading and dishonest.This film is an amalgamation of Last House and Sixth Sense. The twist which may have been attractive to the talking heads in charge of the studio also takes away from the artistic integrity of the film. I as other reviewers have mentioned would much rather a psycho killer gone mad than a film that has to deceive us with a SLEEPAWAY CAMP type slap in the face. While Sleepaway Camp is a good film but not nearly in the class of High Tension the ending fit there. Here it is just plain wrong.High Tension scores a 910 from me because it is about as good a horror film I have seen in the last ten years. The last 10 minutes drags it down to a 9 instead of a 10 but this film is raw it is primal and it is made with ingenuity and care and it is a true homage to the horror films that I grew up with. This is truly a must see for any horror fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "In order to fully appreciate High Tension it's best to see it in its original language and uncut. There has been a lot of hype about this film amongst gore hounds and horror movie buffs. I'd have to say it lived up to its reputation. Although the story is very simplistic and nothing original High Tension still manages to grab the viewer. It has flawless lighting and camera work great acting and a truly disturbing psychological intensity. The story concerns the tomboyish yet sexy Marie played by Cecile De France. Marie and her friend Alex plan a vacation away from the big city. Marie is to stay with Alex and her family at their farm house. Little do they know of the psychotic serial killer who is on the prowl driving his old van through the country side. The killer played by Philippe Nahon of I Stand Alone is a deeply frightening man. He carries a strait razor and at one point even has the nerve to give himself fellatio with a girls decapitated head. Yuck! The killer invades Alex's home and wrecks havoc on her family. The violence is extremely brutal and unrelenting. The bloody realism may cause some viewers to turn their head. The film becomes more insane from this point on turning into a endless pursuit of cat and mouse. Some critics have complained that the film contains certain plot holes. I felt that by director Alex Aja leaving certain things unexplained it added to the intensity. Very suspenseful and horrifying no wonder why they called it High Tension. It sure gave me tension. The reason I recommend seeing the film in its original french version is because the acting is so believable. Dubbing only takes away from the amazing performances. Also not to mention the MPAA taking their own strait razor to the film slashing it down to an R rating. I highly enjoyed High Tension. It marks a return to the style of old school horror directors such as Dario Argento Tobe Hooper and John Carpenter.".

Aja's High Tension delivers what could be the most terrifying scenario in horror history since The Last House on The Left. Two young women travel to a dreary looking farmhouse to study for important school exams. That same night as soon as the doorbell rings the madness strikes and it strikes hard. The killer in this film holds nothing back and it will feel as if you had been struck in the stomach by a 2x4. The flick will not let you go until the last fearful scene is over. Highly recommended for serious horror filmmakers.".

	schema:reviewBody "This will contain spoilers not just for this movie but Fight Club too.To this film's credit it has some decent atmosphere and once in a while lives up to its title. However everything that is wrong here far outweighs the good.On a simplistic level the language is ridiculous here. Boylike Marie and her horsefaced friend Alex are off in the country and dubbed horribly into English. But only sometimes. Randomly some of the movie is in French which I guess is to give the impression some people really are French and some aren't? Or not. I have no idea but it doesn't matter. By the time you hear Marie yell Alex for the millionth time you'll probably wish the whole thing was dubbed.The people in the film may as well be replaced with robots that have processors working on about 64K of programming for all the diversity they're showing. I guess they have human emotions probably but only insofar as I assume that about everyone human. In this movie everyone picked 2 emotions out of a sack and had to stick with them for the whole movie.I have heard people call this movie brilliant and perhaps they did so with a straight face. I have also heard the director valiantly try to explain every one of the incalculable plot holes in the movie. And his explanation works with one caveat. Foe those not in the know this movie gives us a rehash of a familiar idea a multiple personality disorder. When the twist is revealed anyone with an ounce of sense will start to question how on Earth it's even remotely possible. And honestly it isn't unless you accept the director's explanation  the whole story is being told as the nut job killer would have told it so everything makes sense in the nutball killer's head.Well guess what? That's dirty pool. Ever read a story where at the end it was all a dream? That's just as lame as what the director did here. If the whole story must be filtered through the insane killer's perspective and it must be or it doesn't make any sense and can't make any sense then what's the point of the whole story? There's no ground for it to be structured on why should I even believe that any character in the movie is real? How can I know what the pick and choose to be real? The only sensible answer is that the stuff that makes sense is real and everything that doesn't make sense is from the killer's whacked perspective. That's also a horribly stupid answer and it's bad story telling. The story couldn't work logically so they made it illogical.The director also thought he was being clever giving subtle clues that maybe Marie was a little nutty herself and that's great but it's not clever when the killer is introduced as clearly a totally separate entity. You can't have it both ways. At least in Fight Club you never see anyone speak to both Brad Pitt and Ed Norton at any one time they are never together with extra people and recognized as separate entities and when the flashbacks show they're the same it makes sense. In High Tension's flashbacks they avoid the nonsensical moments like the car chase like Alex getting the knife like the entire scene at the gas station none of which work in the one person scenario unless we accept the director's weak explanation that it's all the killer's perspective.And if it is all the killer's perspective why not have a chorus line of dancing goats? We can't trust anything we're seeing anyway so who cares? In a nutshell that single flaw is why the movie can't work at all. In an all or nothing reality scenario High Tension gives you nothing and that's the only way it can make sense.Possibly worse yet is the fact that this movie may as well be 100 other movies. Cut out the failed attempt at a plot twist and what do you have? Every slasher movie I've ever seen. There's nothing new here and certainly nothing scary with scenes that are obviously inspired by earlier films and nothing but gore to keep it afloat. Well I can mix my own corn syrup and red food coloring at home thanks and I dont have to read subtitles half the time to do it.The movie tried and it failed. If the director needs to constantly try to explain himself he failed. The story should work on its own merits and this movie doesn't. It's only worth watching if you want to see how to totally butcher a twist ending into something that makes no sense at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title of this marvellous French horror thriller translates directly into English as 'High Tension' and as anyone who's seen it will tell you it's an apt title. Simply put Switchblade Romance to give it English release and better title is a pure adrenaline rush throughout. The film forsakes substance in favour of masses of tension and the result is a film that is guaranteed to get your heart racing. The fact that the film features numerous sequences of extreme gore doesn't exactly hinder it either. There has been a surge of good inventive horror coming from overseas and independent studios recently the likes of May Dog Soldiers and Sleepless being among the best of them and Switchblade Romance sits nicely alongside the cream of the recent crop. This film follows two friends Alex and Marie who go to stay with Alex's parents in their country home. However things go awry when a man breaks into the home and brutally murders the family. We then follow Alex and Marie through a roller coaster ride of tension and suspense as they try their best not get sliced and diced! The film is very stylishly shot and this has lead many to label it a 'Giallo'. This is most certainly not true and there isn't much other than the style of the movie to suggest this. Switchblade Romance is more of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre style horror driven slasher than a Giallo the film clearly knows this also with a direct homage to the seventies classic towards it's climax. The amount of gore on display is impressive and several scenes are certainly not for the feinthearted. There's quite an array of weaponry in the film also from the plain and simple switchblade to much more exciting weapons like barbed wire various guns an axe and my personal favourite the chainsaw! In fact I am pleased to report that Switchblade Romance features what is maybe the most brutal chainsaw scene ever! Aside from the weapons and gore this film is also of note for it's music. The original score sets just the right tone for the goings on  it's atmospheric but steady and almost like a lullaby which fits with the film's style nicely. Switchblade Romance also features one of the best uses of original music of recent years with a great scene that incorporates Muse's New Born.Switchblade Romance is pure style and a complete adrenaline rush. Tension isn't in the film it IS the film. In spite of it's lack of substance this movie will have you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. Add that to some lovely music classy acting and enough gore to fill an abattoir  and what you've got is the makings of a cult classic!".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's clarify first.  Haute Tension is not Friday 13 or Scream.  While the first was really an exploitation movie and the second is more focused on comedy than in horror this one as the title suggest is only concern of giving you the creeps and by the end twist your mind in the most Lynchenian way.Young women Alex and her best friend Marie visit her parents. Out of the blue a killer appears killing the whole family and kidnapping Alex and Marie follows the killer trying to rescue her friend.Is that all?  Well not really. There are a lot of unexpected surprises that I can not spoil here.  The movie is built on logic situations not in teens taking bath drinking or using drugs but in everyday people that suddenly get attacked from some monster if you think is unreal just read the news. The killer personality has some kind of development.  We barely see his face but his acts follows a certain logic which makes him more horrifying that any Jason on the market.  HE IS REAL!!!But are the actors the ones good enough to transmit you their fear and despair and create the thrilling environment this movie required and very few others are able to get.Now to the gore. The killings are really far beyond the usual cruelty and blood of this kind of films.  The killing of the kid is the only one that the director decided to soften a little but compensate with the disgusting  funny Texas Chainsaw' homage.By the end the movie takes an unexpected twist somehow related to sexual repression that takes a while to accept and probably many will dislike but overall this is one of the best slayer movie made and a real horror film like the ones made twenty years ago when people HAD THE FREEDOM TO SEE OR CREATE whatever they wanted not like   today's ABSURD POLITICALLY CORRECTNESS aka CENSORSHIP.".

It does not disappoint in the gory violence department but I found it to be too short with an abrupt ending. Still the film is a haunting exploration of the darkest corners of the human psyche a portrait that doubles or maybe masquerades as a slasher.Ccile De France is good in the role of Marie showing grit nerve and dare I say tension when the role calls for it. Mawenn Le Besco is also good as Alex although her role does not demand much from her except for a few scenes of considerable emotional range.Two of the best aspects of the film are its cinematography and music. Cinematographer Maxime Alexandre paints the film in bluish metallic detached hues that contribute to the effects of truly unapologetic onscreen violence. Composer Franois Eudes' score is an audio picture of disturbed peace and chaos brewing in the idyll of normalcy. Had it not been for these two elements the film would not have been half as effective.High Tension is not a mustsee film by any means but it is a must for arthouse and horror film fans.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Every now and then in the horror genre a new film comes along that's supposed to Scare the hell out of you or Get under your skin and stay there for weeks.. Or maybe it's supposed to be Terrifying or Unsettling. These are all comments that have been made about the new French horror flick Haute tension.The film has been creating quite a stir on horror websites and has had US audiences itching in anticipation of it's theatrical release. Haute tension or High tension or Switchblade Romance depending on where in the world you see it is at it's core a gory simple slasher film. Marie and Alex college students take a weekend at Alex's family farm to study. They are warmly greeted by her loving parents and younger brother. Then a trucker shows up and proceeds to brutally butcher the family and kidnap Alex leaving it up to Marie to rescue her friend and stay alive herself natch.The film is well acted for what it's worth in a movie like this. Emotions range from scared to dying or from angry to crazy. Marie De France is basically the only character in the film from around the 20 minute point and she makes for a strong lead apparently having studied at the Jamie Lee CurtisSigourney WeaverLinda Hamilton School for Horror Heroines.Is it scary? I'm not sure. It is certainly intense sure to cause many a boyfriend's arm to be squeezed. It's also chock full of stomachchurning violence although one can assume the US version will be significantly tamer. The gore is offputting but very effective and it serves to heighten the tension rather than distract the audience from it which is a trick many recent US slasher offerings would do well to learn.The film is also stylish and well made never winking constantly taking itself very seriously another lesson US horror could take from it. This is no Scream. Rather Haute tension hearkens back to earlier Craven and Carpenter strongly reminiscent of The Hills Have Eyes  Last House on the Left and Halloween. The film takes no prisoners and grants no asylum. It is very well shot with an eye for the perverse demented beauty in the images of mutilation death and torment it depicts.SPOILERS AHEADFor those of you who fall into the never plan to see this movie category and if you know me personally I'm probably going to try to make you watch it so this is your last chance to turn back! the film ends with a bizarre twist after chasing down the evil kidnapper and beating him in the face with a barbed wire topped club then suffocating him Marie rescues the bound and gagged Alex. Alex immediately turns on Marie and we realize that the killer was MARIE HERSELF ALL ALONG!!! This raises several issues all of which I've been mulling over for a week now. First of all does the movie hold up? Is it The Sixth Sense where we can watch it again and see it in an entirely new light? Or is it The Usual Suspects where the ending negates or makes impossible much of the film preceding the revelation? I think it's a little of both. I figured out the twist early in the film and viewed it as a battle between opposing sides of a character's psyche. Marie is obviously a closeted homosexual and due to whatever social factors has denied herself her impulses. This denial and self hatred has led to the development of an alternate personality the embodiment of stark masculinity. For the most part the actions of both characters can be seen as parts of the internal struggle for dominance within this sick girl's mind. Only once does the film truly cheat we in the audience are shown a security camera's recording of the trucker a character we'll soon discover is a figment of his quarry's imagination. How does the camera pick up an image that doesn't exist? Otherwise the dual personalities don't directly interact with each other until the very end nor do they simultaneously interact with any other character. When they are seen as two entities it is purely in her mind. A second issue I've been considering is exactly what stance is the film taking on human sexuality. Is it suggesting that repressed sexuality in general leads to destructive brutality? Or is it repressed homosexuality that does this? Is it trying to say that inside every lesbian is a fat ugly Carhartt wearing trucker? Or is he inside every woman period?How about the film's thoughts on what brings out the rampaging trucker within does he simply wait for the right moment? Is he brought out by masturbation? if so that's a more chilling threat than a hairy palm or blindness any day. Or is it rejection? Is it possible to want someone so badly that only by massacring everyone else around can one have that person?These questions I don't have answers to. I have thoughts on them but none clear enough or well defined enough to verbalize here. The film's numeric rating is based on the fact that I don't like the answers I think the film leads us toward. I do however give the filmmakers credit for putting these issues out there. It's a shame that the vast majority of the film's audience will see only the surface events and will spend more time thinking about whether it makes sense than trying to answer the important social questions it's asking. But then maybe I'm reading too much into it. Maybe it's just a slasher flick and a damn good one. And maybe it goes too far at the end trying to be clever. In that case same rating.httpwww.thestickyfloor.com".

And it's a surprise to me considering I am not too found of movies that are dubbed. The movie was filmed in French language and then dubbed for the US with English voice overs. If you rent the DVD.

The actors are horrible and the dubbing from English to French and vice versa is extremely annoying. The lag time between when the victim sees the killer and gets hacked up drags on and on. Remember that scene from Austin Powers when the steam roller is coming to run over the security officer and he shouts no for like 5 minutes instead of just getting out of the way yeah same effect ludicrous. Oh and if your entire family is getting hacked up downstairs and they're screaming bloody murder and you don't hear a thing is it because of those magical earplugs that they only sell in France. The twist is not clever at all and I would like to drop kick all the idiotic people who rated it 8 or 9.

Your mind starts running backwards through the movie trying to figure out if you missed something if there were any clues and how it could fit but by the time your done backtracking you realize it's plain stupid and there is absolutely no reason for it other than a cheap trick trying to imitate other movies. hehe how is that for a long sentence.If they just let this movie work on it's simplicity this probably would have been a 610 but with that twist the movie looses all credibility.

For the most part this was watchable in a kind of i don't have anything else to do so might as well watch this kind of way. But when the big twist comes along the first reaction is Huh! What?!. Your mind starts running backwards through the movie trying to figure out if you missed something if there were any clues and how it could fit but by the time your done backtracking you realize it's plain stupid and there is absolutely no reason for it other than a cheap trick trying to imitate other movies. hehe how is that for a long sentence.If they just let this movie work on it's simplicity this probably would have been a 610 but with that twist the movie looses all credibility. Give it 010.";

Some old Nazi acquaintances of her father's has taken up residence in Rio de Janeiro he needs her help to spy on them.

The trip takes on the character of a honeymoon and Alicia and Devlin start falling in love.  Then their orders do arrive and Alicia is assigned to infiltrate the house and the bedroom of the Nazi leader Alexander Sebastian Claude Rains.This movie delivers a very different kind of suspense from Hitchcock's more famous NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  There are no strafing runs by malevolent cropdusters no cliffhanging mountainclimbing scenes no mad footraces. The suspense here relies all on subtleties that get under your skin and chill you much more than the inyourface antics of Hitchcock's later piece. The popping of champagne corks signals time running out for two spies in the wine cellar an impassioned lover seeks to kiss the hand of his lady who has a deadly secret concealed in her palm a victim of poison sees the shadows of the poisoners merge together on the wall.  The final scene is the best of all.  Who but Hitchcock could imbue the innocent sentence I wish to talk to you with such chilling power?This is one of Ingrid Bergman's best performances Alicia is hardly perfect but brave and lovely.  Hitchcock was far ahead of his time in discarding male chauvinist attitudes that elevated a woman's chastity and ladylike attributes over her courage and intelligence.  When a superior disparages Alicia for the lack of character she has shown by following the orders he himself has given her Devlin sarcastically lashes out She may be risking her life but when it comes to being a lady she doesn't hold a candle to your wife sir sitting in Washington playing bridge with three other ladies of great honor and virtue.  Yet Devlin himself is often unsympathetic and harsh in his treatment of Alicia and the unfairness of that treatment is sharply highlighted in a manner very sympathetic to her.Not to be overlooked is Rains' magnificent rendition of Alexander Sebastian a villainous but human and rather weak man who genuinely loves Alicia.  I have never seen Rains better except for his immortal portrayal of Cap. Renault in CASABLANCA.  Also superb is Leopoldine Konstantin as Sebastian's domineering scheming mother.NOTORIOUS is intense and meticulously crafted and benefits from the best acting in any Hitchcock movie.  While NORTH BY NORTHWEST or THE 39 STEPS might be a better introduction to Hitchcock for people used to the slambang action of modern cinema NOTORIOUS is the best I can recommend for those who have already learned to love Hitchcock's work.".

	schema:headline " Hitchcock's perfect movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Notorious may not be Hitchcock's greatest film but it may very well be his most perfect film. Rarely is a viewer treated to so much talent in all areas of film creation Hitch directing Gregg Toland photographing Ben Hecht writing Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains acting. And everyone is firing on all cylinders.What gives Notorious its singularity amongst the pantheon of Hitchcock's masterpieces is the highly symbolic literate and penetrating script by Hecht. Nominally the film is about the OSS the prenatal version of the CIA using a compromised young daughter of a condemned unrepentant Nazi to infiltrate a cell of German expatriates in Rio de Janeiro just after the close of the Second World War. The plot hinges on some nonsense involving uranium ore stuffed in wine bottles in the cellar of Claude Rains' mansion. In actuality the film is nothing less than a dark fugue on alcoholism and secondarily and of most interest to the director invasion of privacy. Thirdly we are treated to some more of the Master's endless fascination with Freudian slop yet again we get the Oedipus Complex in all its ardor with a domineering old bat wielding the motherly whiphand on Rains' cuckolded castrated romantic expat Nazi.But Hecht is interested primarily in alcoholism and Hitchcock obligingly complies utilizing a dizzying myriad of symbols and reference points. In the original script Bergman's Alicia is something of a whore the filmmakers were forced by the censors to tone this aspect down thereby bringing Alicia's dependence on booze to the forefront. Indeed Bergman spends much of her screentime woozyheaded whether from alcohol or poisonous coffee symbolically functioning as the same thing. Very early in the film she declares at a party The important drinking hasn't started yet! Exactly. Throughout the movie Bergman drinks in order to escape her unpleasant circumstances or to wash away bouts of low selfesteem. A bottle of champagne bought by Grant becomes a phallic symbol he forgets it at the offices of the OSS with arid results when he arrives home to Bergman. Wine bottles are literally the key to the plot. Spilled wine in a sink blows her cover. And late in the proceedings the simple physical act of drinking  coffee yes but the point comes across  almost kills her.There's much more going on here  too much for a short review really. Let's finish by asserting that Hitchcock's Forties period was every bit as cinematic as his later grander colorized period in the Fifties and Sixties. The slowly swooping shot from the crane starting from high atop the ceiling of a ballroom and ending up focused on the wine cellar key in Bergman's hand is merely one famous bravura moment. There are many othersGrant approaching a hungover Bergman in bed in which the camera takes her upended POV quite literally Bergman overcome with poison hallucinating the figures of Rains and his mother into monstrous shadows that grow larger and larger eventually merging into one darkness the two great tracking shots of Grant and Bergman kissing in her Rio apartment and later when Grant rescues her from her poison bed. The trailers for Notorious were already calling Hitchcock the Master of Suspense . . . it's easy to see why.As for the performances? Cary Grant proves to be a true soldier spending much of his screentime either expressionless or with his back turned to the camera ! unselfishly giving the film to Bergman even though his part is actually the more interesting one. Bergman meanwhile gives one of the best performances of her illustrious career. No two Bergman roles are quite the same Hitchcock wisely allows her to do some of her own interpretation particularly early on during the characterbuilding scenes before the plot moves all the characters into their appointed places on the chessboard. Perhaps best of all both Grant and Bergman were at the very peak of the physical charms the movie is some serious eyecandy for both genders. 9 stars out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Notorious may not be Hitchcock's greatest film but it may very well be his most perfect film. Rarely is a viewer treated to so much talent in all areas of film creation Hitch directing Gregg Toland photographing Ben Hecht writing Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains acting. And everyone is firing on all cylinders.What gives Notorious its singularity amongst the pantheon of Hitchcock's masterpieces is the highly symbolic literate and penetrating script by Hecht. Nominally the film is about the OSS the prenatal version of the CIA using a compromised young daughter of a condemned unrepentant Nazi to infiltrate a cell of German expatriates in Rio de Janeiro just after the close of the Second World War. The plot hinges on some nonsense involving uranium ore stuffed in wine bottles in the cellar of Claude Rains' mansion. In actuality the film is nothing less than a dark fugue on alcoholism and secondarily and of most interest to the director invasion of privacy. Thirdly we are treated to some more of the Master's endless fascination with Freudian slop yet again we get the Oedipus Complex in all its ardor with a domineering old bat wielding the motherly whiphand on Rains' cuckolded castrated romantic expat Nazi.But Hecht is interested primarily in alcoholism and Hitchcock obligingly complies utilizing a dizzying myriad of symbols and reference points. In the original script Bergman's Alicia is something of a whore the filmmakers were forced by the censors to tone this aspect down thereby bringing Alicia's dependence on booze to the forefront. Indeed Bergman spends much of her screentime woozyheaded whether from alcohol or poisonous coffee symbolically functioning as the same thing. Very early in the film she declares at a party The important drinking hasn't started yet! Exactly. Throughout the movie Bergman drinks in order to escape her unpleasant circumstances or to wash away bouts of low selfesteem. A bottle of champagne bought by Grant becomes a phallic symbol he forgets it at the offices of the OSS with arid results when he arrives home to Bergman. Wine bottles are literally the key to the plot. Spilled wine in a sink blows her cover. And late in the proceedings the simple physical act of drinking  coffee yes but the point comes across  almost kills her.There's much more going on here  too much for a short review really. Let's finish by asserting that Hitchcock's Forties period was every bit as cinematic as his later grander colorized period in the Fifties and Sixties. The slowly swooping shot from the crane starting from high atop the ceiling of a ballroom and ending up focused on the wine cellar key in Bergman's hand is merely one famous bravura moment. There are many othersGrant approaching a hungover Bergman in bed in which the camera takes her upended POV quite literally Bergman overcome with poison hallucinating the figures of Rains and his mother into monstrous shadows that grow larger and larger eventually merging into one darkness the two great tracking shots of Grant and Bergman kissing in her Rio apartment and later when Grant rescues her from her poison bed. The trailers for Notorious were already calling Hitchcock the Master of Suspense . . . it's easy to see why.As for the performances? Cary Grant proves to be a true soldier spending much of his screentime either expressionless or with his back turned to the camera ! unselfishly giving the film to Bergman even though his part is actually the more interesting one. Bergman meanwhile gives one of the best performances of her illustrious career. No two Bergman roles are quite the same Hitchcock wisely allows her to do some of her own interpretation particularly early on during the characterbuilding scenes before the plot moves all the characters into their appointed places on the chessboard. Perhaps best of all both Grant and Bergman were at the very peak of the physical charms the movie is some serious eyecandy for both genders. 9 stars out of 10.";

Like so many of his later features it is saddled with a highly suspect plot that is driven by a set of poor decisions made by a handful of characters of such alarmingly low emotional intelligence it is a miracle they survive the first half of the film at all yet it works. It keeps company with the likes of Strangers On A Train Psycho Rear Window The ThirtyNine Steps North by NorthWest The Lady Vanishes it is a classic. It is tempting to put it all down to Ingrid Bergman's portrayal of Alicia Hubberman  which is  faultless  but Bergman alone could not have made Notorious what it is she also starred in Spellbound and Under Capricorn and was unable to save either of those films from limping into mediocrity. It is also appealing to suggest the obvious that it is the combination of breathtaking cinematography flawless supporting cast and Ben Hecht's cracking script that make it so good.  But I believe that the primary reason Notorious excels is because of the abiding friendship professional respect and unrequited love that existed between Alfred Hitchcock and Ingrid Bergman as they stepped up to make the film. The archetypal  themes that comprised their professional partnership inspired amongst other things Hitchcock'sHecht's Alicia  a woman in a barren marriage desperate for love  and all those tender beautifully lit closeups. It also allowed Bergman  and here a precedent was broken  to contribute and to act upon her insights as to the motivations and behavior of her character.Hitchcock didn't suffer the opinions of his actors lightly yetwhere Notorious was concerned he made an exception. For the duration of the shooting of the film Bergman was Hitchcock's closest collaborator. I have a strong sense that the very thing that could have made Notorious lame  Hitchcock's unrequited love for Bergman  is also the very thing that saved it from obscurity and that we may have much  we will never how much  for which to thank Bergman.There are many moments that make Notorious Bergman's picture but I think the most extraordinary is the kiss outside the wine cellar. In all her films Bergman always brought a vulnerability to her love scenes that imbued them with a real sense of intimacy and Notorious is no exception think of her in the infamous balcony scene or during her final descent down the staircase.  Yet when Dev  ever the mercenary genius of improvisation  makes full use of Rains' approach and pulling Alicia to him as they stand outside the wine cellar orders her to kiss him Bergman actually surpasses her own track record.Suddenly in the arms of the man she really loves she is overcome with emotion and for one second maybe two she separates her mouth from his and in an attempt to give voice to the indescribable and to forge experience and register a moment of pure intimacy she utters one word his name  'Dev!' and all hell breaks loose. Never in the history of cinema has one word carried such an erotic charge. They could not be closer. He doesn't flinch. They barely move but it is all there. And it's not just her voice it is also her eyebrows. Just as she utters his name Bergman furrows them. They tremble. They along with her tremulous whisper betray her true feelings so that within the space of two seconds we witness Bergman experience both the heightened rush of intense sexual desire as well as the instantaneous relief afforded her by the act of surrender to it.All this with one word  'Dev'  and the furrowing of a pair of eyebrows. So much emotion conveyed with so little and in such a brief period of time.It is because of moments like these that Notorious is timeless  the film gets under your skin and into your psyche  and given the history of the film and her beautiful performance at the center of it it is fitting that it should be Bergman".

	schema:reviewBody "Dark cruel beautifully photographed and deeply erotic Notorious in one of Hitchcock's very best. It's remarkably sexual and sophisticated story from a time in Hollywood where the power of the Breen Office was at its apex. Alicia Huberman Ingrid Bergman is the daughter of a convicted Nazi. American agent Devlin Cary Grant contacts her and convinces her to spy against some of her father's Nazi colleagues in Brazil. The chief of these of Alex Sebastian Claude Rains one of the most genial Nazis depicted on the silver screen who has a crush on Alicia. Of course Alicia has fallen madly in love with Devlin and he with her though he could never admit it and instead pushes her to seduce Sebastian to obtain his secrets. He wants her for the mission when she accept he brands her a whore. Only a whore would sleep with a man for his secrets right? Hitchcock gathers some of Hollywood's best and casts them against type. Ingrid Bergman who hitherto had played a fair number of virginal ingnues plays Alicia Huberman a powerfully sensual woman but also a drunken nymphomaniac. You get the sense that she can merely stroke Devlin's cold frozen face and bring him magically to life. The great comicacrobatsophisticate Cary Grant is cast as the emotionally stunted and almost sadistic T.R. Devlin a mysterious secret agent who recruits Alicia to work for the government. Cary Grant utilizes his inherent reticence to create a character who is isolated and closed off who can lash out and act disinterested so easily toward the woman he loves. Claude Rains with his rich English voice and amiable face plays Nazi Alex Sebastian a rather nice fellow who happens be plotting against the United States. He is genuinely in love with Alicia and when he learns of her betrayal his despair and terror is palpable and moving. Madame Constantin imported especially by Hitchcock from Germany for this film is the brilliant and icy cold Madame Sebastian Alex's powerful mother. In one particular scene she smokes a cigarette with a malice unequaled by any actress in Hollywood history. It's like she has it clasped in her talons. Louis Calhern is Devlin's boss breezy narrow minded and casually misogynistic.Notorious is a very stylish production. Ingrid Bergman who usually wore little makeup in her films has a very natural sensuality and wears lovely 40s hats and suits very elegantly. Cary Grant is hitting his stride as the fashion icon he later became in the 50s. The suits are slimmer than they were in earlier roles and help emphasize Grant's lean and powerful but graceful physicality. Hitchcock's camera is characteristically authoritative shaping the audience's impressions. It is very open to Bergman and very closed to Grant. Bergman is often shot in close ups and medium shots and in flattering soft focus and in accessible to the audience. Her heartrending luminosity used so brilliantly in Casablanca is used again here by Hitchcock. Grant on the other hand is several times shot with his back to the camera looking away from from the camera or with his face obscured by shadows. You suspect but you never really KNOW what Devlin is feeling for the majority of the film. Grant is inscrutable and here is really demonstrating his economy and brilliance as a performer. Sometimes he does seem a bit too stiff especially since we know that he's capable of doing Dr. David Huxley and Editorinchief Walter Burns but most actors wouldn't have dared to give such an understated performance as Grant does here.The world of Notorious is very insular. Most of the film with the exception of the love scenes is indoors. Any other scenes that find the characters outdoors find the characters closed off. Barricaded between objects or people. All this gives the film a claustrophobic feel like Devlin and Alicia have no place to hide and no place to breathe. People said that Hitchcock disliked actors. I don't think that's true but Hitchcock seems to have extraordinary control over the technical aspects of filming. In order scenes to work actors must explicitly follow direction they are the tools of filmmaking. All this attention to detail is absolutely necessary considering the complex composition of many of his scenes. The reputed Longest kiss in film history where Devlin and Alicia embrace and talk and kiss for several is a very intricate piece of blocking as the characters move from one room to another Devlin speaks on the phone reach turn etc... If Hitchcock worked like someone like Howard Hawks for instance this sort of scene wouldn't be possible.Since this is a Hitchcock film people may be mislead into thinking that it's a thriller. It's not. It's really a perverse romance. The characters are more intricately drawn than they are in thrillers. Indeed plot and character development seem to be equally important. The story does not move quickly but you don't really notice you're too busy being immersed in Hitchcock's world. Thrilling sexy and moving Notorious is highly recommended".

	onyx:emotionText "Dark cruel beautifully photographed and deeply erotic Notorious in one of Hitchcock's very best. It's remarkably sexual and sophisticated story from a time in Hollywood where the power of the Breen Office was at its apex. Alicia Huberman Ingrid Bergman is the daughter of a convicted Nazi. American agent Devlin Cary Grant contacts her and convinces her to spy against some of her father's Nazi colleagues in Brazil. The chief of these of Alex Sebastian Claude Rains one of the most genial Nazis depicted on the silver screen who has a crush on Alicia. Of course Alicia has fallen madly in love with Devlin and he with her though he could never admit it and instead pushes her to seduce Sebastian to obtain his secrets. He wants her for the mission when she accept he brands her a whore. Only a whore would sleep with a man for his secrets right? Hitchcock gathers some of Hollywood's best and casts them against type. Ingrid Bergman who hitherto had played a fair number of virginal ingnues plays Alicia Huberman a powerfully sensual woman but also a drunken nymphomaniac. You get the sense that she can merely stroke Devlin's cold frozen face and bring him magically to life. The great comicacrobatsophisticate Cary Grant is cast as the emotionally stunted and almost sadistic T.R. Devlin a mysterious secret agent who recruits Alicia to work for the government. Cary Grant utilizes his inherent reticence to create a character who is isolated and closed off who can lash out and act disinterested so easily toward the woman he loves. Claude Rains with his rich English voice and amiable face plays Nazi Alex Sebastian a rather nice fellow who happens be plotting against the United States. He is genuinely in love with Alicia and when he learns of her betrayal his despair and terror is palpable and moving. Madame Constantin imported especially by Hitchcock from Germany for this film is the brilliant and icy cold Madame Sebastian Alex's powerful mother. In one particular scene she smokes a cigarette with a malice unequaled by any actress in Hollywood history. It's like she has it clasped in her talons. Louis Calhern is Devlin's boss breezy narrow minded and casually misogynistic.Notorious is a very stylish production. Ingrid Bergman who usually wore little makeup in her films has a very natural sensuality and wears lovely 40s hats and suits very elegantly.

	schema:headline " A second viewing of this great film";
	schema:reviewBody "A nostalgic revisit for me. Unlike many of our other young posters in our community I didn't grow up with a strong background in the classics. Notorious was the first Hollywood classic from the studio era that I went out and rented. I had seen several others but they were either Disney movies The Wizard of Oz or forced upon me in my first film class e.g. Stagecoach which I despised for years!. Notorious wasn't even my first Hitchcock movie that was The 39 Steps which I also didn't care for. But Notorious was suggested to me by a good friend so I went to the video store went to the classics section for the first time and picked it up. It isn't responsible for the path I took afterwards I would probably give that credit to Citizen Kane but I remember liking it. This was the summer after my Freshman year in college in 1998. It's amazing how much I've learned in the five years since I saw it first. I liked it quite a bit but it certainly wasn't one of my favorites. This was the summer I discovered the American cinema after the studios collapsed movies such as The Godfather and 2001 so Notorious seemed a little dated to my uneducated eyes. I remembered a couple of the more showy scenes like the one where Ingrid Bergman realizes why she's sick. I especially remembered the entire final scene. But I was unprepared for the subtlety.On this second viewing I was shocked at just how intimate Hitchcock's direction is in Notorious  it's easily one of his very best works as a director. He utilizes closeups to an almost uncomfortable degree. At first I thought that Grant's and Bergman's love affair felt kind of forced but that scene where they make out for two minutes straight pretty much sold it for me! Notorious was first suggested to me as an example of screen eroticism and I would have been far too unrefined to feel that power five years ago. I do still have a couple of problems with the film but they're minor. Well they're worth mentioning anyway. I don't really like Cary Grant in the film. He's good but he's not at the level of the rest of the film. I really think he's best suited for comedy he has such a gift for comic timing. He has problems shifting between the passion he has for Bergman and the anger he has for what she's doing. I'd love to see what other actors could have done with that Montgomery Clift comes to mind for some reason although he was still a couple of years away. I also feel that Devlin's anger with Alicia talking strictly about the characters now not the the actors is maybe a little exaggerated. I realize that this is 1946 but I might imagine that spies and secret agents would not be so offended at this sort of thing. This is of course the main conflict of the film so I guess I just have to accept it as the premise.As for the other actors they are uniformly brilliant. Ingrid Bergman gives one of her best performances. Claude Rains is brilliant as the villain. He's one of those Hitchcock antagonists whom I shouldn't care for but for some reason I really feel sorry for him. He's so pathetic. The sequence where he discovers who his new wife is is quite heartbreaking really although I think that the musical score which is generally excellent goes overboard on the sting when he discovers the broken wine bottle. Perhaps another thing I hold against Grant and Devlin is that final cruel moment when he locks the car door on Rains. I know he's a Nazi but it's hard not to feel sorry for him at that point. I also love just love Leopoldine Konstantin's performance as Rains' mother. She is simply frightening. Reinhold Schnzel is also rather intimidating as the scarred Dr. Anderson. I love the suspicious look he gives Rains as Grant leads Bergman down the stairs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock's reputation as the Master of Suspense was built largely upon his ability to create suspense out of thin air. Now that he was completely settled into a stylistic method for making effective thrillers it was time for a bit of showing off building tension from the simplest of situations. Notorious is one of his purest pictures in that regard  a plot you could condense onto the back of a postcard but a tourdeforce of suspenseful technique.The screenplay is by Ben Hecht a writer who fully understood Hitch's aims  the two are very much in synch with the structure pacing and presenting of the material. The first twenty minutes are incredibly fast paced full of jump cuts and thirtysecond scenes. We waste no time in establishing the romantic link between Grant and Bergman. The political background is briefly stated but not dwelled upon and to this end Hitchcock shoots the court scene in a distant pointofview shot from outside the room before sweeping the camera into the Bergman's attentiongrabbing entrance. This is not a film about motives  it's a film about consequences.After this once Bergman is assigned to her spying mission and the game as it were begins there is a shift in pace. From now on Hecht and Hitchcock's aim is to place us inside the experiences of our two leads  with a slightly different angle for each. With Grant the focus is upon his pain and bitterness at having to give up Bergman to Claude Rains. So when Bergman and Rains first meet in the horseriding scene we do not see what dialogue passes between them  instead we are shown Grant's point of view and his distressed reaction.With Bergman however the focus is upon her fear and vulnerability as she carries out her work. As opposed to the snappiness of the opening many of Bergman's scenes unfold in excruciating realtime. Hitchcock's camera technique emphasises the sense of danger making the nazi stooges appear more menacing by having them fill the frame. Another very effective trick used in the party sequence is to cut between closeups of Bergman to pointofview shots that show off the vastness of the rooms which make us feel her disconcertedness.The slow and deliberate pace of the main part of Notorious also allows for the effective staging of several suspense setpieces. The simplest of scenes the simplest of acts are drawn out to breaking point cut up into numerous shots and carefully timed to turn them into heartthumpers. The ultimate example of this is of course the final scene. You can also see when looking at scenes like the business with the key or the wine bottle why Hitchcock disliked lastminute twists  the suspense wouldn't work if the audience weren't aware of the actions and knowledge of all the characters.We have here one of the most stellar casts Hitchcock had ever bagged with both Grant and Bergman at the height of their popularity. Both are in quite demanding parts as characters who have to stifle their emotions and play a role within the role. Unfortunately Hitchcock was no master when it came to motivating his cast and while the leads are good they are not outstanding. Claude Rains too has a complex part as a man who has to come to terms with his own gargantuan mistake and it was his steady deep performance that got the Oscar nomination.In the end though it is Hitchcock's utter devotion to suspense over substance that is the Achilles heel of Notorious. The purely functional screenplay is lacking in humour and sparkling dialogue the romance lacks chemistry and the characters lack motivation. It is undoubtedly one of his most carefully crafted thrillers but it is ultimately a slightly hollow experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this about 4 times and I return to it occasionally hoping to see the merit people find in it. I never do. You can see that this movie would have been useful in establishing Hitchcock but that moment is quite over. He surpassed it technically and artistically quickly after with his own work. It's value is only in context. It's not good Hitchcock by my standard. It has one daring idea for the time that a tramp may show greater nobility and heroism than the offscreen prim and proper 1950's housewife that is mentioned and one interesting performance a German mother more threatening than the harmless effete villain.Unfortunately Hitch is more interested in the technical aspects of Notorious and then only in places making it a weird lopsided production. It's chilly and many scenes are crappy genre clichs. It's technically on but emotionally off. I never feel a thing watching this. It's an academic exercise.If the apparent level of a movie is so disappointing why would a viewer be interested in learning more about its symbolic or semiotic level? Which by the way none of these reviews even touch.TECHNIQUE All the major scenes are showy but hollow.The classic camera shot zooming in from an overhead fullroom shot to Alicia's hand holding a key embodies the problems here. It's pointless. The plot has set up the moment. We've SEEN her steal the key and we know she's handing it off to Devlin at the party. The shot is vapid because it adds nothing but conspicuous technique to the moment. The shot is pivotal but it changes nothing. After it we know exactly what we knew before that's not mature Hitchcock. What does it mean when he makes such a laborious selfconscious shot but the rest of the movie is so hideously fake? The rearscreen projections are fatal here whether it's a park bench a courthouse a caf or all of Rio the movie is about one yard deep. I can't believe people love a movie with such phony methods of getting imagery into a camera.Worst of all is the convention of the actors betraying necessarily clandestine reactions on their faces for the benefit of the audience looks that would give them away over and over again. The acting here is all about making faces. Forget body language or something subtler.Cary Grant plays a petulant vindictive ass. It's a miracle we won the war with unprofessional jackasses like this working for us. After one drunk date he's a snotty lover? I have now seen all the GrantHitchcock movies after seeing Suspicion yesterday and I dislike each one for different reasons.HOLES Over and over again Hitchcock chooses the dumb  cinematic over internal logic or common sense. It's as if he assumes the audience left their brains at home.Why such tension developed over handing off the key to Devlin upstairs at the party when Alicia arranges to be at the wine cellar door WITH HIM when he opens it? This is the films major setpiece and it makes absolutely no sense. Why is neither Devlin or Alicia concerned with devising a way to get the key back on Sebastians ring? Because Hitch needs that tensionbuilding wine cellar sequence more than he cares to fit it convincingly into a romance or a spy plot. Why can't Devlin piece her fate together after say ten seconds of thought where he realizes neither he nor she gave a damn about being detected after the fact? Because he's the worst agent ever scripted in a Hollywood movie. This isn't rocket science.Devlin and Alicia meet 4 or 5 times in public to hand information off. They meet at a racetrack or on a park bench talking out the sides of their mouths so as to avoid discovery. But what would anyone need to 'discover' about their conversation if they were seen together? Just being seen together would betray them. Sebastian knows Devlin is an agent from the start and has figured out that the two are in love. What's the point of sitting an extra foot apart on a bench pretending to have idle chatter? Two people in their situation would never choose to meet in public.When I read fawning reviews of this movie it makes me sorry Hitchcock used such constant motifs across his career because shallow fans can watch engaging nothing but a checklist of elements the directors appearance a technical trick a stairway a camera gimmick a domineering mother a character falling to their death an icy blonde etc. They can't wait to declare it a masterpiece and congratulate themselves. But they couldn't tell you why this is important or discuss it's ideas for ten seconds because they lack any criteria that would tell them when those elements construct a shallow movie. In Hitchcock's great movies that checklist is supported by convincing psychology a bit of humor and satisfying depth that yields layers of meaning. Not so here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Notorious is on my short list of movies that I can watch anytime anyplace no matter how recently I have seen it. It never grows old. Many people have described the plot and cinematography but I'd like to give a more personal view of the film. Why do I find it so endlessly enjoyable? Here are a few good reasons 1 Ingrid Bergman has never looked more beautiful. Perhaps no actress has ever looked as beautiful alluring vulnerable and sad as Bergman in this film. From her bare midriff in the opening scenes to her marvelous riding outfit when she meets Sebastian I cannot take my eyes off her.2Notorious has one of the most adult scripts in the history of the movies. I'm not talking about plot  but just listen to the dialog! Devlin and Alicia don't just spar or joust  they verbally rip at each other with a venom that only wild passion can explain. If you listen to all the dialog it can be quite uncomfortable  there is no lighthearted banter between them. It's open sexual warfare  right below the belt every time as Alicia so accurately observes. The dialog is about sex in language so bald that I can hardly believe it survived the censors. And not a dainty pretty sex but raw intense wounding needful adult sexuality that almost never gets explored in mainstream movies. That Hitchcock did it in 1946 is nothing short of astonishing. Ben Hecht gave Notorious one of the great screenplays in the movies  perhaps only Chinatown can compare to it.3 Cary Grant  Claude Rains. I love their competition for Alicia and the way that Hitchcock and Hecht have inverted their roles. As Devlin Grant is cruel cold and repressed in his dealings with Alicia. He is her lover but he can hardly reconcile his love for Alicia with his fear of losing her or with his own selfloathing. Sebastian as played by Rains is a perfect gentleman. We never doubt that Sebastian the Nazi deeply and truly loves Alicia. He is tender and caring with her in ways that we can't really imagine Devlin ever being. Their love triangle is endlessly fascinating to watch.4Perfect form. Hitchcock was a master stylist and he was at the top of his game in Notorious. The movie is like a elegant formal dance. To complain about realism in a movie like this is totally beside the point. It's all artifice and all art. No scenes wasted no scenes that are designed to shock. Everything locks together in perfect symmetry.I have sat through Notorious with many people who simply don't get it. I feel sorry for them. This is one of great experiences that the movies can offer.".

He includes so many shots such as the long shot medium close up and over the shoulder shots. However he revolutionized some shots such as the tracking shot. For instance the tracking shot in the lobby at the top of the stairs all they way down to show the key in her hand was a remarkable display of ingenuity. He exaggerates things such as a zoom out at the table as it slowly zooms in what seems like forever slowly revealing more people at the table. The use of sound was terrific as the film started out with a lot of nondiegetic music but as the film progresses it becomes less and less and silence starts to fill the emptiness of scenes. The film was very highkey in lighting and dissolve shots were common throughout. My favorite shot was with Alicia as she gets dizzy and passes out the camera switches to a POV shot and we see what she is currently seeing and that is a wavy disturbed image as she loses her vision.

It's hard to picture a betterlooking couple than Grant and Bergman in the mid '40s but they can't overcome this tedious script and they don't quite cut it as believable spies.

The story is somewhat slow and at times is even uncomfortable but it is held together by the director's masterful planning along with some good writing and a highprofile cast.The plot concerns an espionage assignment but the thrust of the movie is really much more about the persons involved and about how they are affected by the job than it is about the spy scenario itself.  The American spies Cary Grant  Ingrid Bergman both have deeply conflicting feelings about their mission and the audience often feels their inner torment.  The plot itself moves rather slowly most of the time so that we can make sure to appreciate the ways that Grant and Bergman are torn between their feelings and their perceived duty.  As their opponent in the spy game Claude Rains may have turned in an even better performance than the two headliners.  His too is a complex character who has some sympathetic qualities in spite of being the bad guy.  Thus when moments of suspense arise they are that much more effective for having been slowly built up and combined with an awareness of the characters and their feelings.The writing in Notorious is very good as is the directing with every scene and practically every line having a purpose.  Despite the deliberate pace of the movie there is really nothing superfluous.The overall effect is not as much fun to watch as North By Northwest or Psycho or Hitchcock's other more fastpaced films.  But Notorious is effective in a different way and most Hitchcock fans should find it a worthwhile experience.".

Thus when moments of suspense arise they are that much more effective for having been slowly built up and combined with an awareness of the characters and their feelings.The writing in Notorious is very good as is the directing with every scene and practically every line having a purpose.  Despite the deliberate pace of the movie there is really nothing superfluous.The overall effect is not as much fun to watch as North By Northwest or Psycho or Hitchcock's other more fastpaced films.  But Notorious is effective in a different way and most Hitchcock fans should find it a worthwhile experience.";

I'd get off work at 10 at night we'd go eat Mexican food and then go to a midnight movie at the Alabama Tower or River Oaks theatres inside the loop. They were sponsored by KLOL 101.1 FM and the admission price was 1.01. As you can tell this was before we had children. In fact my wife was probably pregnant with our first born July of 1974 when we saw this. We'd sit in the front row of the balcony because she was most comfortable with her feet propped up on the rail.I only saw EGGSHELLS that one time but it's stuck with me all these years. The plot is a little fuzzy to me but I remember the title because one of the films themes was that our fellow humans are so fragile that we would handle them as if they were made of eggshells.Although there were supernatural elements to it this was nowhere near a horror movie. It was closer in mood to THE GRADUATE or YOU'RE A BIG BOY NOW in that it was a coming of age story about young adults.It was about undergraduates at the University of Texas in Austin. One character comes from a small town and this is her introduction to life in the big city. Several students share a large old house near the University in a neighborhood I've always enjoyed driving through and they discover that the house is haunted.Beyond that plot details get fuzzy although I do remember that there was a 'hippie wedding' that took place on the lawn of the capitol building.It gets a ten because although it didn't have anybody famous in it for years it wasn't even listed on the IMDb and I wondered if I'd imagined it and I don't know if even Hooper has a print of it any more and wasn't a techno marvel I could tell that it was made with a lot of love. Hooper was thrilled to have a camera at his disposal and use it to tell his story.If this ever comes out on DVD I'll be first in line.".

I can't imagine that fully comprehending the film would make it any less dull. I didn't want to understand the presence in the basement I just wanted it to do something. The film is really only of interest to Tobe Hooper fans and people who like artsy sixties movies.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 Blu Ray. I can see why this film didn't get a good release. Not many people wanted to go see a very weird film where weird things happen for no reason. The film opens with a girl sitting on the back of a pick up as it takes her down the road. Then we cut to her sitting in the park picking at a pimple. And then she's back on the pick up again. She arrives at the town and we see a montage of people protesting and people walking up and down the street. This goes on for 8 minutes and it's like Okay. Can we move on please?We then cut to the main setting which is a house. We see a paper airplane flying outside the house it hits the wall and bursts into flames. Why? It's never explained.Then we have our main characters. The girl in the beginning? Not one of them. We have dialogue scenes where the camera is WAY too close on their faces. Tobe Hooper wanted a documentary feel.We then cut to more surrealism such as a 5 minute montage of people walking up and down the stairs a scene where a boy is sword fighting with himself in the basement the editing is really cool and very clever in that scene we have scenes where the couples are in the baths talking about...... nothing a sex scene which is all blurry and all done in quick edits and the actors have horrid tan lines ugh. a scene where a boy follows this girl he fancies into the forest and there's balloons everywhere. He meets up with the girl and she goes with him despite not knowing who this boy is. And a scene where a man steals his friends' car drives it out to a field gets naked sets a car on fire and it explodes...... all for no reason. Near the end one of the couples gets married and we have a montage of the car's POV which was blown up earlier driving down the street and into the road all sped up. This scene reminds me of The Naked Gun for some reason.The film ends with the characters going into the forest building a weird alien like machine they sit on chairs underneath hairdryers like in a salon. They pull bin bags out of the hairdryers and pull the bags over themselves the machine connected to the hair dryers sucks them all up and we see blood coming out from the kitchen sink tap of the machine. Yeah.If you're one these people who love weird films where things happen for no reason and are never explained why you'll love this film. Much like Ralph Bakshi's earlier films.There are creative scenes like the sword fight and the scene where a couple are painting the wall and we cut to them in the bathroom the man turns on the water and we cut back to the room and the walls fill up with paint combined with the sound of the water. That was really clever. Plus some nice stop motion animation of the stars and rainbow being added on the wall too.Other than that Eggshells just isn't my cup of tea. I enjoyed Tobe Hooper's next feature even better.".

The sheriff poured acid into the pool.In any event he gave a wonderful sermon in about 1969 about performing a wedding next to the Courthouse which must have also housed the jail.

Basically you've got a couples sitting around and talking about various deep topics including war and haunted houses.EGGSHELLS was Tobe Hooper's first feature film and it's easy to see why it has been forgotten. Usually whenever director's make a name for themselves their early works come back into play but that never happened with EGGSHELLS and it pretty much remained a mystery until here recently when it got a rerelease. The film isn't awful. The film certainly isn't great. It's just pretty much in the middle without anything overly interesting in it outside of the film's the director would make after it.This is one of those films where there's no plot but instead hippies are sitting around talking about deep stuff that no one but stoned hippies would find deep. Most of the conversations had here are pretty boring and none of them are interesting enough to really grab your attention and hold it throughout the running time. Just take a look at the discussion of haunted houses and you'll see how silly it actually is and how pointless it is.The film really drags at spots and especially the final tenminutes of the movie. I'm going to guess Hooper was trying to deliver some sort of weird acid trip but that doesn't happen and instead of being entertained the viewer will be looking at his watch. EGGSHELLS is technically wellmade and it features some nice performances but that's not enough to keep you glued into the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film's title is taken from the Bible For now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known. 1 Cor 1312.The film is a major work of cinema and a major work of Bergman. If one looks at the body of Bergman's films he was probably approaching his peak of artistry which he would achieve in his next work Winter light a film that Bergman himself called perfect. The reason most viewers do not grasp the importance of the magnificent ManGod trilogy or the Silence trilogy or the DarkFaith trilogy three films Through a glass darkly Winter light and the Silence is that the trilogy deals with the theological question of God's existence. It is essentially a thinking person's film. If you can reflect on what you see these three films are a treasurea treasure that influenced major directors several decades later specifically Kieslowski who made Three Colors Blue also almost entirely based on 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 Tarkovsky who seems to have borrowed some ideas like the sudden baptismal rain from this film that he employs in Solyaris and Stalker and finally the exciting new talent from Russia Andrei Zvyagintsev director of The Return also taking a leaf from the Bergmanesque sonfather relationship. All these films seem to have been influenced by this seminal work of Bergman.To those viewers who are not spiritually inclined the film could be reduced to the obvious action of Harriet Anderson's character Karin insisting on wearing goggles as she steps out of her home to live the rest of her life in a hospital. It could easily be interpreted as a study of mental illness a film that gives credence to the theory that god does not exist. The film can equally be interpreted as a film on mad people who feel they are in communion with god who at other times are slaves to dark forces voices.On the other hand one can argue the intensity of the light is a metaphor for a sign that God existsthe basic question that troubled Bergman the son of a priest in real life. Even the young Minus kneels down to pray to God as the rain baptismal? falls suddenly. A keen viewer will note that there is no sign of rain on island or of rain drenching men in an open boat soon after the event. Only Karin's hair is wet. All three films seek an answer that God exists from a silent inscrutable to quote a word from this film God to whom millions pray. Through a glass darkly opens with a shot of the almost still dark waters of the sea mirroring the sky. The film ends with several references of light. For the cynical Bergman was disillusioned and felt that God was a spider the intriguing image for the DVD covers of the three films a reference to Karin's outburst towards the end of the film. If Bergman was truly disillusioned would he have added the final epilogue where the father tells his son God exists in love in every sort of love maybe God is love. These last words make the son say my father has talked to me the penultimate words of the filma seemingly spiritual response even Jesus on the cross wanted Father father why hast thou forgotten me? before he died.It would be ridiculous to see this work merely as a film seeking answers to God's existence. Like Three colors Blue this is a film on love. There is the undiluted love of an atheist husband shades of Bergman? for his ailing wife note the film is dedicated to Kabi Bergman's wife at a point when divorce was looming large. There is love of a father for his daughter son and soninlaw triggered by a failed suicide attempt only recalled in the film. There is love between siblings.The film is also about marriage. Visually the film emphasizes the wedding ring in the scenes involving husband the camera captures the wedding ring on the finger several times and wife she puts it on after she washes her face. The son asks with an innocent cockiness of the father who has recently divorced his second wife Marianne never shown on screen if he has lost all stability spiritually? Structurally Bergman doffs his cap to Shakespeare by adding a one act play within the film on the lines of Hamlet to drive home a point to the father and his illusion of love for his perfect work of art at the expense of depriving love for his near and dear.In more ways than one this is a thinking person's film. After viewing the film several times one is in awe of this filmmaker so prolific so perfect and so sensitive. What he has written for cinema can be compared to the output of great writers like Tolstoy and Shakespeare. He was truly a genius. I do agree with Bergman when he avers that the three films in the trilogy are not connected and are stand alone films. The only common link among the three films is Bergman's personal quest for a response from a silent God that his father believed in and in whom Bergman was brought up to believe in. These are not films of an atheist but works from a genius flirting with God to quote from the film itself.Many years after he made the film Bergman was uncomfortable with the final scene. The doubting Thomas in Bergman had resurfaced. Yet he never reworked on the film. The film has much to offer for a student of cinema it is made of fine photography art direction acting scriptwriting editing and sound Bach plus the horn of the lighthouse. Undoubtedly one of Bergman's finest works it anticipates the perfect Winter light the next film that Bergman wrote and directed.".

	schema:headline " God defined.";
	schema:reviewBody "Through a Glass Darkly is the first film in Ingmar Bergman's Silence Trilogy. In recent years Bergman has repudiated the idea that these films were a trilogy at all. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with his recent assertion I disagree with Bergman on this one each of these films can stand on its own and explores themes of love loss death and most importantly God. This film was intended to be God defined in the trilogy Winter Light is God exposed and The Silence is God's silence. This film has to be one of the dreariest films that I've ever seen but at the same time it is so beautiful and poignant that the viewer is drawn in.The story revolves around Karin Harriet Andersson who is taking a vacation on the island of Faro in the Baltic Sea with her husband Martin Max von Sydow Father David Gunnar Bjornstrand and brother Minus Lars Passgard. Karin is recovering after being treated for schizophrenia and seems to be in good spirits but her condition is fragile. Through the entire movie she tries to keep in touch with reality and find love from those around her. As her condition deteriorates she reaches out to each of her companions but cannot cling on to her sanity. Through the entire film the characters interact but still seem isolated from each other the island itself is a metaphor for isolation. In the end Karin sees God before she is taken from the island to return to a mental hospital. God is a giant spider.Bergman paints a very dreary picture but as with all of his films there is a ray of hope at the end. I haven't heard most people who have seen these films comment on this theme in Bergman's trilogy. In each film someone's life is basically left destroyed at the end of the film. However there is always another character in the film who has changed but is moving forward. In this film Minus and David talk after Karin is taken from the island. Minus finds hope in his father's words because the two of them actually reached each other on some spiritual level even though neither could do so with Karin.In some way I think that this was Bergman's real message. The traditional notions of God may have deteriorated but there is still some hope that love and spirituality can be communicated between people and that people will move on.Fantastic Film.".

	schema:reviewBody "A character study set on a secluded island off the coast of Sweden Through A Glass Darkly' is Ingmar Bergman's pensive chronicle of a young woman's descent into the maelstrom of schizophrenia.  The story centers on Karin Harriet Andersson who has reached a pivotal juncture in her life having just been released from a mental hospital she must now face the uncertainties inherent in the nature of her illness.  It is a crucial period in her life she occupies a middle ground between two worlds and the question now is will she ultimately emerge in the light or succumb to the darkness of the voices that beckon her from within.  Through Bergman's eyes we observe the effects of her situation on the three people closest to her her husband Martin Max von Sydow her father David Gunnar Bjornstrand and her brother Minus Lars Passgard.  The movie explores their relationships to Karin and to one another and how differently each one them strives to cope with and understand her elusive affliction. An absorbing evocative and sometimes tense drama the film is impeccably delivered by Bergman and the performances are all exemplary especially Harriet Andersson who brings the tortured soul of Karin to life with nuance and a depth and grasp of the character that is remarkable.  Von Sydow is also perfect as the troubled Martin and aptly conveys the quandary of his situation which he approaches with a reserved committed gentleness. Bjornstrand maintains a stoic presence throughout as the novelistfather attempting to resolve an inner conflict borne of guilt and doubtful motives and Passgard gives a notable performance as well his angst and confusion are deeply felt and well played. The first of Bergman's 'Faith' trilogy followed by Winter Light' and The Silence' Through A Glass Darkly' is one of his finest works an intricate exploration of the fragility of the human psyche and the complexities of life.  An Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film of 1961 it firmly establishes Bergman as one of Cinema's greatest directors.  It is an emotional and engrossing film that should not be missed.  I rate this one 1010.".

Nykvist shot films as varied as Lasse Hallestroms 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' to Woody Allen's 'Crimes and Misdemeanors.' Nykvist's touch is present throughout the film a style that begins to become a part of Bergman's signature miseenscene. Bergman's screenplay is transitional because of it's scarcity of saturation. Using a cast of only four and only one location the family's country home on an island off the coast of Sweden. Karin Harriet Andersson is slowly going mad her family fiance father and brother are trying to understand her and not send her away trying to let her know that things may be alright as she descends into hysteria talking to walls waiting for god to come out of the closet. The film is quite simply a masterpiece. A portrayal of descent into madness and the effect on others that feels more grounded in reality than even the best of films on madness see Shock Corridor  Samuel Fuller One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest  Milos Foreman or The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada  Tommy Lee Jones Nykvist's mostly static camera gives the film a brooding sense of anticipation lingering motionlessly allowing the actors to move freely into deep frames marginalizing themselves as they move about the large empty frame. The camera even goes so far as to linger a little too long at times waiting long after the actors have exited the frame making sure that the audience is aware that the hollowness these spaces they live and think in exist without them these voids the audience is watching never go away. These sentiments are echoed by the well penned script. The father's regret over the madness of his deceased wife the husbands jealousy his inability to act the nearly sexual love the brother feels for Karin his isolation and inability to get over his immaturity. It's a delicately woven exquisitely beautiful film on the landscapes of the mind and the solitude of life and the search for god. A good introduction to the psychological drama of Bergman for anyone unfamiliar with one cinema's masters.".

This film has such a distinct atmosphere which conveys not only isolation and melancholy but also dark austere beauty. Every little piece of this film fits together like a glorious completed puzzle. The Bach playing over the opening credits. The cinematography with long meditative shots in glowing black and white. The performances turned in by Harriet Andersson Gunner Bjornstrand and Bergman regular Max von Sydow. Overall I sense that Bergman's vision is so obviously being displayed on the screen as if his soul is being laid bare. As a singular piece of art it is just staggering to behold.

	schema:reviewBody "Harriet Anderson's performance is beyond brilliance. She has a very difficult role but there seems not the hint of acting on her part. It is a role where the character seems to be acting and is having a very rough time. Her performance is transparent and haunting. I saw this film most recently a few years ago and have seen many movies since then but i still recall vividly three of her scenes. The photography is magical and while not as praised as Wild Strawberries Persona or Winter Light  and a few other Bergman classics its power and its passion reach inside your soul and dares you to resist living the story and the characters of the film. Also Max von Sydow is brilliant as usualhe is certainly the most underrated actor of all timetheater television or cinema. I highly recommend this film and then your viewing t he 1971 Passion of Anna also with Max v.S. and a performance by Liv Ullmann that rivals Harriet's in Thtorug a Glass Darkly. The theme of Darkly is the human predicament in a world of suffering and illness. How does man survive if he actually lives hisher life rather than just sports through life without any experience of art and the spiritual good or bad. This film is part of a loose trilogy that includes the magnificent Winter Light and The Silence though each can be viewed separately with no loss of discovery and enjoyment. When I was in college at UCLA from 196875 under and grad school Bergman was the rage with many people. He seems to be lost in the mists of time.

	onyx:emotionText "Harriet Anderson's performance is beyond brilliance. She has a very difficult role but there seems not the hint of acting on her part. It is a role where the character seems to be acting and is having a very rough time. Her performance is transparent and haunting. I saw this film most recently a few years ago and have seen many movies since then but i still recall vividly three of her scenes. The photography is magical and while not as praised as Wild Strawberries Persona or Winter Light  and a few other Bergman classics its power and its passion reach inside your soul and dares you to resist living the story and the characters of the film. Also Max von Sydow is brilliant as usualhe is certainly the most underrated actor of all timetheater television or cinema. I highly recommend this film and then your viewing t he 1971 Passion of Anna also with Max v.S. and a performance by Liv Ullmann that rivals Harriet's in Thtorug a Glass Darkly. The theme of Darkly is the human predicament in a world of suffering and illness. How does man survive if he actually lives hisher life rather than just sports through life without any experience of art and the spiritual good or bad. This film is part of a loose trilogy that includes the magnificent Winter Light and The Silence though each can be viewed separately with no loss of discovery and enjoyment. When I was in college at UCLA from 196875 under and grad school Bergman was the rage with many people. He seems to be lost in the mists of time. But if go back and watch his films from the late 50's to the 70's you will see cinema at its boldest and its greatest. Buy the films or rent them Netflix has a good collection.. Darkly will shake your world and cause ripples of thought and feelings that move for a long long time inside your mind and if your fortunate your soul.. See this film.";

Bergman is one of the very few filmmakers who had the knack for making this kind of feature coherent and memorable at the same time.The story could hardly be more efficient.

	schema:reviewBody "In this haunting film a mentally ill young woman and three of her family members  younger brother older husband and aging father  vacation on an idyllic island. While at first her schizophrenia seems to be in remission family pressures trigger a rapid decline. To the grief of the rest of the family her future prospects are dim and she as the person they knew may be leaving their lives forever. In the end we are only left with a small glimmer of hope that even though life seems cruel and unfair the ability of people to care about each other provides an intimation that somehow things are not hopeless.Rather than a realistic picture of clinical schizophrenia the film primarily uses her condition to explore how people struggle with the contrast between the magic circle of living an outwardly normal successful life with the realities and forces operating apparently from the outside that threaten to destroy their tranquility. The illness of the sister represents one possibility in a life where existentially people find themselves continually in deep water where their constructs of life are constantly threatened. Each of the family members seems poised between their social construct as a happy nice family member and their interior and exterior threats.The father is an aging isolated man who poses as a serious writer tackling serious questions such as the existence of God but who is suicidally depressed by the knowledge that his writing is pop fluff of no real significance and that his real preoccupation is not universal issues but his personal failure as father and a husband. The son is young and naive still living the regulated life of a student but deeply frustrated in his desires for intimacy with women and recognition from his father. Karin the daughter is dolllike and cheerful on the surface but haunted by the depressing undersurface of life which is expressed by trenchant observations at first but then increasingly by nightmare hallucinations of wolves owls spiders and voices in her head. She is sexually repelled by and emotionally distant from her older husband and prefers the company of her impressionable younger brother.Max von Sydow playing the husband is the most sympathetic and normal member of the quartet as the supportive husband. He is a stolid kind somewhat pompous physician who stays easily on keel with positive and normal thoughts and actions unlike Karin and the rest of her hypersensitive family. However it is implied that this feat is accomplished through lack of imagination and stubborn refusal to notice whatever isn't fit to be noticed. The harder he tries to pull Karin back from her visionary fantasies the more she is repulsed by what she sees as his stupidity.Marring the film are some heavyhanded and overly theatrical moments. For example where the father played by Gunnar Bjornstrand pontificates heavily to the point where suspension of disbelief is stretched or where the Bach soundtrack comes in to underscore somewhat tediously that a moment is profound. Related to this the father plays a selfloathing artist who it is not hard to see as Bergman engaging in selfcritique that is overly egocentric not of general interest.Flaws aside this is a beautiful movie that manages to make the most miserable family vacation ever a fascinating experience.".

With the exception of Passgard all the other three are Bergman regulars having appeared in many of his films.The movie happens in a single day period in an isolated island and it's basically about how Karin goes from being relatively normal at the beginning to absolutely crazy 24 hours later and the reaction of the three people around her. The Bjornstrand character for instance feels guilty about his daughter madness though we now know that upbringing has little influence on mental illness. Also her descent into madness is so rapid during the movie though we are told that she has been in a mental institution before that perhaps is not very believable. Also hard to accept are the solemn lines the characters spout about the silence of God. Of course many people have thoughts about existential issues like this they just don't talk about them in such solemn manner. Of all the major directors Bergman was the one whose background in the theater was more obvious. In some of his movies like this one this stage background makes a little more of noise.So this is a worthwhile film but not in my opinion among Bergman's best At about the same time he did with Bjornstrand Winter Light which is somewhat lesser known perhaps but far better.".

An early sixties Swedish family has gathered in an isolated summer vacation spot on the sea to examine itself and its ties. The two male adults are intellectuals of sorts and the female is both the daughter of one and the wife of the other. She is also the sister of her writerfather's adolescent son. Love is at the center of familial relationships and this film makes no bones about it. Yes love is the tie. It is also the tie between Man and God or so it would seem to have been told especially to those in the West and specifically in Sweden those who have fallen for a Christian message.We see in Through a Glass Darkly a family in strife. A daughter and wife who is just back from an insane asylum a teenage son who is unsure of himself most grievously because of the lack of fatherly love a husband who is part of this family and yet remains apart from the family and a father who has been running away from familial love since the death of his wife the mother of the son and daughter. He has been running away from loving responsibility under cover of his art. What can be made of this strange brew is made well by Bergman a man who questions the authority of God the Family and Patriarcy but who still comes up on the side of love?Bergman was a complicated man who made complicated movies. He shocked a lot of critics and audiences in the early 60s. Essentially his cinematic art was a window through which one could vicariously watch Bergman question his faith and the meaning of life and by extension his audience could participate in this philosophical exercise. Bergman said once My fear of death was to a great degree linked to my religious concepts. Later on I underwent minor surgery. By mistake I was given too much anesthesia. I felt as if I had disappeared out of reality. Where did the hours go? They flashed in a microsecond.Suddenly I realized that is how it is. That one could be transformed from being to notbeing  it was hard to grasp. But for a person with a constant anxiety about death now liberating. Yet at the same time it seems a bit sad. You say to yourself that it would have been fun to encounter new experiences once your soul had had a little rest and grown accustomed to being separated from your body. But I don't think that is what happens to you. First you are then you are not. This I find deeply satisfying. That which had been formerly been so enigmatic and frightening namely what might exist beyond this world does not exist. Everything is of this world. Everything exists and happens inside us and we flow into and out of one another. It's perfectly fine like that.What does love mean to those who are obviously imperfect? How can one pursue love when the way is blocked by either madness or fear or lust or all of these forces to one degree or another?These are questions which Bergman examines in Through a Glass Darkly. See it.".

You say to yourself that it would have been fun to encounter new experiences once your soul had had a little rest and grown accustomed to being separated from your body. But I don't think that is what happens to you. First you are then you are not. This I find deeply satisfying. That which had been formerly been so enigmatic and frightening namely what might exist beyond this world does not exist. Everything is of this world. Everything exists and happens inside us and we flow into and out of one another. It's perfectly fine like that.What does love mean to those who are obviously imperfect? How can one pursue love when the way is blocked by either madness or fear or lust or all of these forces to one degree or another?These are questions which Bergman examines in Through a Glass Darkly. See it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Through a Glass Darkly is a seminal film where Bergman's filmworld undergoes a fundamental change of theme and expression. Drawing an analogy to classical music Bergman explores a chamber music format what he called his chamber plays which possess the intimacy of chamber music. These chamber plays resemble stage plays made up of a succession of distinct scenes. The cast is reduced to a minimum of actors and the screenplay extends over a relatively short period of time. Past events are only indicated in the words of the characters as the drama takes place entirely in the present moment in a welldefined restricted environment and a muted scenery and dcor.Cameraman Sven Nykvist introduced a new cinematographic style that would become Bergman's signature from this point forward. Nykvist's style is spare highly disciplined and marked by minimal camera movements. Most of the time Nykvist's camera follows the persons who speaks seldom the one who listens. The dramatic aspect of the dialogue is reflected in closeups through the characters' facial contrasts.Through a Glass Darkly is the first film shot in the bleak remote island of Faro where Bergman would settle five years later and which would be starting with Persona through the end of the decade the set for his films. Except for the opening shot and two other occasions when short excerpts of J.S. Bach's Suite No.2 in D minor for Cello is heard the film totally lacks composed music. The music is instead made up natural sounds which play a crucial role in the developing drama the rain the wind the water bird calls etc.Bergman's choice of actors couldn't have been more appropriate as the acting of the quartet is first class. Harriet Andersson carries the day in her heartwrenching depiction of a schizophrenic's slow descent into Hell. Gunnar Bjorstrand's interpretation of the guiltridden David is understated and entirely compelling. Lars Passgard's acting matches his character's age a seventeenyearold frightened boy struggling with his puberty and von Sydow as the tormented husband is thoroughly convincing.The first theme of the film is the isolation of the individual in the world. All four characters in the film are alone within themselves insulated from the outside world. David the father has taken refuge and isolated himself through his writing to the exclusion of his nowdeceased wife and then his children. Tragically he is well aware of his isolation and suffers immensely from it. Martin's communication with his wife is mannered and superficial. He is locked up in his role as a good husband. Although he loves Karin he is too busy with his work and his everyday life to be able to understand and therefore help his sick wife. He only goes through the motions of caring for Karin like David's caring for his children when he brings them illchosen gifts.Karin lives equally between her two worlds. The first world the world of her schizophrenia where she hears voices is of course totally incomprehensible to others. This world at odds with her second world the world of realities results in her being also misunderstood. Out of desperation she will eventually choose her schizophrenic world. Karin is the only one of the four characters looking for God. Is it only because she is weak and needs help? If this is so this selfish relationship with God only serves to save and heal her. This theme will be explored in Winter Light Bergman's next film.Minus also lives in his own world tormented by his awakening sexuality which leads to his ambiguous attraction to his sister the only female with whom he has any form of intimacy. He has no male guidance as his father has abandoned him. He cannot handle the difficult transition from puberty to adulthood and has locked himself out to the realities of the outside world. His mixedup feelings aided by his sister's mental problems lead him to commit incest.The second theme is the Christian notion and also a modern idea that only a broken spirit can find a new life. According to this thought each of the characters in the film must first go to their ruin before being reborn. The film shows that in some instances hope is still possible and the barriers can be broken down. We see David undergoing a transformation following his attempted suicide opening up to his children and to Martin with love. Minus confronts his fear of love but he is too ashamed of his sin to comprehend his action's power of redemption until his father explains it to him. This is an implicitly Christian message. By the end of the film as he encourages Minus to face the future he offers his son a real gift his simple belief that God is love and love is God. When Minus finally says Papa spoke to me it's like an absolution from the lost father he has regained along with his belief in God. However nothing is said about Martin and Karin by choosing in spite of herself the spiderGod is obviously not redeemed.I believe it would be a mistake to assume that Through the Glass Darkly is Karin's film. Only Karin's slide into madness is central to the film as it forces her father brother and husband to confront themselves their experiences not her illness shape the film. And of the four characters Minus is the pivotal figure of the film it is his consciousness that organizes the film. His struggle with the coming of adulthood and his desire to create a bond with his father is the major story of the film.Notwithstanding his other masterpieces this film together with its two other companions in the trilogy Winter Light and The Silence represents the best that Ingmar Bergman has ever produced.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bergman's Through a Glass Darkly is a step forward even from the brilliance of the Seventh Seal. In this the first part of the Faith Trilogy he contends with the question of God's existence and man's relationship with his fellow man once more. Here though instead of the cold remote studies of his previous work is a more intimate family saga.Of course the very title of this work is a wellknown quote from one of Paul's epistles that here in this life we cannot yet see God clearly but have only dim reflections and impressions. Likewise cinema can only give impressions of what life is about but Bergman captures the clearest image he can.The film begins with the reunion of an apparently happy family on a Swedish island. This setting symbolises that this is a microcosm of humanity the surrounding waters representing perhaps a masculine world whilst the girl is confined to the land. It is notable that it is only on the water that the father and the girl's husband can confront each other openly and confess their own flaws to each other.The daughter is however suffering from schizophrenia and like many victims of this disease believes she is seeing visions of God. However it is a distorted parody of God who is tormenting her. Like everyone else she is seeing through a glass but hers is even more distorted than most. The notion that God is love is absent from her visions of this spiderlike creature. It is only when she is sane and leans on her family for support is there any semblance of a normal supportive Christian God hiding at the margins of her life.The father a writer seeks grandeur and critical acclaim but has so failed at his interpersonal relationships he has contemplated suicide. He has a fascination with his daughter's illness and is intent on recording it to his own disgust. He has indeed thrown love away for temporal success.The play within a play is a beautiful one though watched somewhat dismissively by the father. It is the only time the daughter creates an illusion of her own free will rather than being tormented by ones that are beyond her control.The fact that she is carried away by helicopter in the end perhaps indicates a transition to some higher realm. Her illness has taken complete hold of her but maybe she has now moved beyond the nightmarish stage having confronted the spiderlike false god.The son her younger brother is then left to reconcile with the father and contemplate God's nature.Throughout the film closeups are filmed beautifully and truly capture the characters' thoughts and inner turmoil.As in all Bergman the landscapes are filmed in a stark austere manner reflecting barren souls unable to clearly see God who is all around in their love for each other.Undoubtedly this is one of the greatest films ever made. A true masterpiece by a great genius who captures his own spiritual searches on celluloid in an honest mature manner.".

All the actors do a great job but the story is burdened a little bit by the atmosphere and the style of direction which makes it feel as a play.

All the actors do a great job but the story is burdened a little bit by the atmosphere and the style of direction which makes it feel as a play. All the acting scenery and shots make it very similar to the experience of watching a play and in some respect remember the viewer that they are watching a work of fiction.";

For once the wolves are portrayed the way they should be. They are neither sugarcoated nor villified but rather are shown to be both a efficient predator and a devoted parent in times of encroaching human settlement. The scenery is excellent as is the storyline which is not too complicated for young ones to follow. I love the theme song catchy and the characters are believable. About the only thing I can say negative about this movie is the extensive use of canned sounds especially for the wolves but this really does not detract from the rest of the film. Legend of Lobo is a beautifully made movie that I would recommend to anyone!".

	schema:reviewBody "TARZAN'S SECRET TREASURE MGM 1941 directed by Richard Thorpe the fifth installment in the popular adventure series based on Edgar Rice Burroughs immortal characters as portrayed by Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan is another good entry. In the last chapter TARZAN FINDS A SON 1939 Tarzan and Jane acquired an orphan from an airplane crash and raise the child they call Boy Johnny Sheffield as their own. Unlike the movies released between 1932 and 1936 this entry plays more for the juvenile crowd having the story revolving more around Boy than on his adoptive parents and concentrating more on fastpace adventure along with recycled animal fighting scenes lifted from previous films but with limitations of violence.The story begins typically as the jungle family is seen swimming under water where Boy discovers gold on the bottom. Learning of its true value from Jane the curious Boy later sneaks away accompanied by Cheetah to venture the outside world of civilization. After a few close calls involving wild animals and crossing a tree stump over a cliff that may break in half Boy meets an African native boy named Tumbo Cordell Hickman who after saving him from being chased by a rhino is taken to his village. Because Tumbo's mother has died of the plague the angry Ubardi tribe believe Boy responsible for her death thus capturing and tying him to wooden poles where he is placed to be sacrificed by being burned alive. Just in the nick of time a group of researchers scare away the tribe by driving their jeep through their village and honking the horn. Grateful for the rescue Tarzan accepts Professor Elliott Reginald Owen Dennis O'Doul Barry Fitzgerald Medford Tom Conway and Vandermeer Philip Dorn as friends and invites them along with native boy Tumbo to his treehouse to show his appreciation. It is only after Boy shows off his piece of gold do Medford and Vandermeer show signs of greed turning against Tarzan for refusing to lead them to the secret treasure and scheming to do away with him as well as holding Jane and Boy hostage until they get what they want.Production values by MGM standards still good and cast quite impressive especially by the major attractions of Weissmuller O'Sullivan and Sheffield as the jungle family along with supporting MGM stock players headed by Reginald Owen. By this time the Tarzan formula was becoming fairly routine ranging from elephant stampedes Tarzan's crocodile wild animal fights the jungle warlord's battle against a native tribe uprising who hold Jane and Boy prisoners among others. One interesting scene involving Jane and Boy as they are seated in separate canoes with their hands tied behind their backs surrounded by natives with Boy falling out of the canoe where he is then seen sitting at the bottom of the river struggling to loosen the ropes that bind him while Tarzan tries desperately to reach him in time before he drowns. Suspense builds as Tarzan meets with delays as he not only dodges spears thrown at him by the tribe but fighting off crocodiles getting in his way. One can imagine the roars and cheers in the movie houses at that time. As usual intruders enter the scene at first in good faith until some of them become untrustworthy when learning of priceless gold on Tarzan's domain. Of the expedition team there is usually one trusting soul in this instance the drunken Irishman named O'Doul wonderfully played by Barry Fitzgerald. TARZAN'S SECRET TREASURE marks a very rare instance in the series by which Boy is befriended with another boy of equal age. Although it appears that Tumbo might remain as part of Tarzan's family as well as becoming Boy's best friend his character would never reappear in future installments. One thing that is certain aside from the frequent Tarzan ape calls is Cheetah the chimp around for assurance in aiding one of the characters as well as providing well intentional humor.Aside from frequent revivals on commercial television prior to 1990 TARZAN'S SECRET TREASURE which runs at 81 minutes was distributed on video cassette through MGMUA in the early 1990s and formerly presented on the American Movie Classics cable channel 19972000 before making its Turner Classic Movies debut April 30 2010.

	onyx:emotionText "TARZAN'S SECRET TREASURE MGM 1941 directed by Richard Thorpe the fifth installment in the popular adventure series based on Edgar Rice Burroughs immortal characters as portrayed by Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan is another good entry. In the last chapter TARZAN FINDS A SON 1939 Tarzan and Jane acquired an orphan from an airplane crash and raise the child they call Boy Johnny Sheffield as their own. Unlike the movies released between 1932 and 1936 this entry plays more for the juvenile crowd having the story revolving more around Boy than on his adoptive parents and concentrating more on fastpace adventure along with recycled animal fighting scenes lifted from previous films but with limitations of violence.The story begins typically as the jungle family is seen swimming under water where Boy discovers gold on the bottom. Learning of its true value from Jane the curious Boy later sneaks away accompanied by Cheetah to venture the outside world of civilization. After a few close calls involving wild animals and crossing a tree stump over a cliff that may break in half Boy meets an African native boy named Tumbo Cordell Hickman who after saving him from being chased by a rhino is taken to his village.

Watching Tarzan's Secret Treasure 1941 today I was amazed to hear for the first time after many viewings Barry Fitzgerald's O'Doul character refer to a little black native boy as a pickaninny.  In the earlier Tarzan movies the blacks are constantly called boy and other derogatory terms and often casually shot by white men for disobeying orders.

I agree thoroughly with the comments by lovethoseclassics and lugonian but wanted to add both my own enthusiastic thumbs up for this movie and wanted to add a bit about my own reaction.First the basics really are all there. I was delighted by the blackandwhite cinematography. It is crisp and wellcomposed throughout this film. The pace is excellent and there is never a dull moment. The script provides a wonderful story with nothing wasted.I particularly liked the sequence in which we are given an opportunity to simply enjoy Tarzan and Jane and Boy and Cheetah in their life on the Escarpment before the movie proceeds to a ripping classic adventureaction arrangement.There were some particular features of this movie that especially tickled me. For example the persons composing the members of the expedition is something of a classic from Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. We have the South African Dutch Vandermeer venal cool knowledgeable experienced dangerous the Englishman Medford wicked sharp greedy ambitious murderous the Irish Dubliner O'Doul funny mordant romantic sentimental alcoholic and Professor Elliott scientifically curious generous gentlemanly respectful nave.The adventure scenes with Tarzan were provided with classic style and verve. Again in the grand tradition of Burroughs and Haggard a typical scene combines the wonderful figure of Tarzan in action within the context of a delightful range of African venues. Consequently we have Tarzan facing savages and wild beasts in the depths of the lush jungle Tarzan battling crocodiles and riverbeasts and savages again in rivers teeming with dangers Tarzan facing the wicked white men amid severe gorges and breathtaking dropoffs in the mountain fastnesses of the Escarpment. The pattern is dangerous microactivity in the foreground with breathtakingly scenic macrolandscapes in the background and is to me wholly satisfying.Similarly scenes like that of Tarzan swimming underwater the river being punctured again and again by shafts of spears being cast at him was to me gripping and scary and again wholly satisfying.And of course when Tarzan's elephants storm to his assistance I felt once again that glorious sense of the Africa of Tarzan coming to the rescue in a mighty execution of justice that is yes wholly satisfying.All in all this movie is such a delightful experience. I'm so grateful it was reissued along with the other 5 Tarzan movies with classic WeismullerO'Sullivan collaboration in a DVD collection which is the source from which I saw it this evening. I would recommend this movie to anyone.".

But Tarzan doesn't take kindly to threat and kidnap to his family and executes against the evildoers an extreme lesson . The movie is dubiously faithful to Edgar Rice Borroughs story . It contains noisy action  sensational adventures  many angry natives  nasty white hunters  hungry lions and wonderful outdoors  though mostly shot in Hollywood studios . Well starred by Johnny Weissmuller  Maureen O'Sullivan Johnny Sheffield  both of them bring wit and style to their classic characters . However  Johnny Weissmuller is better Olympic swimmer than actor . Here stands out Johnny Sheffield whose first role was in Tarzan finds a son 1939 as an orphan whose ambitious relatives hope he stays lost so they can collect an inheritance . And  of course  special mention for the likable Chimpanzee Cheeta that steals the show  giving some humorous moments with his antics  frolics and mayhem . As usual  there are the obvious uses of stock footage due to many budget cutbacks following the death of Irving Thalberg many stock shots regarding wild animal sequences from former movies were used  such as intervention of a well trained Lion and a Chimpanzee exprofessed for the film .

When Jane Maureen O'Sullivan tells him about the things people in the civilized world do with that gold Boy decides to head to the city to buy something with his new treasure. Unfortunately the kid is naive and doesn't realize that men will do just about anything for the rocks. So when he meets up with four men from a scientific expedition he doesn't realize that two of them will get gold fever and threaten to destroy this jungle family. At the same time a real fever plague strikes. Can these evil men be defeated and goodness reign supreme? While this is a very wellwritten episode it also worked well because of the wonderful supporting cast. All four of the white men in the expedition are wellestablished MGM supporting actors Reginald Owen Barry Fitzgerald Tom Conway and Philip Dorn and their experience add a bit of class and quality to the film. The only negatives and I noticed them because I recently watched ALL the MGM Tarzan films is that several of the scenes such as the crocodile fightand the vicious way the natives murder the porters were recycled from earlier films in an effort to save money. Still it was enjoyable and once again proves that people really can be jerks!".

For me this film is a mixed bag with much of the first half repeating variations on things that have happened in the previous films jungle romp torture by natives etc though this time with Boy and Cheetah instead of Tarzan and Jane. The film perks up once the explorers come in and the villainous ones led by the ever wonderful Tom Conway begin to try and do away with everyone. The climatic battle on the river is high light to the film though it weakly trots out the alligator fight that has been in least two other films in the series.

	schema:reviewBody "I just had the opportunity to see Werner Herzog's Stroszek for the first time in its new DVD edition.  It's certainly a bleak scenario but I'm not so sure it was meant to be as critical of the United States as many viewers both here and abroad suppose.  In his commentary for this film it seems to me that Herzog plays down that aspect of it.  He expresses a strong affection for the typical Americans seen in the film  nonactors who just happened to be on the scene and were prevailedupon to moreorless portray themselves.  The unfortunate protagonist of the film played by longtime Herzog protg Bruno S. leaves for America with his friends to escape a brutal and oppressive existence in Berlin.  While misfortune comes to them in a different guise in America it's hardly more barbaric or degrading than their lives in Berlin.  To me it suggests that human nature is the same everywhere and the weak are always preyedupon.  Bruno and his companions are just innocent enough to believe the old legend that in America the streets are paved with gold.The running commentary that Herzog has recorded for the recent DVDs of his films are among the most interesting and engaging I've heard and they're one of the reasons I especially appreciate the DVD medium.  That's not to say that he lets the literalminded viewer off the hook by providing handy explanations for every peculiar image or bit of dialog.  When asked what a certain image or phrase signifies he will sometimes simply say that he cannot explain it.  But I find it fascinating to watch a scene and then scan back and listen to his comments about the location actors technical details and yes even sometimes the intended effect of a puzzling image. Many of the people seen in his films are nonactors people he simply ran into found interesting and intuitively knew would be effective on film. Some of the players in Herzog's films are the very people that most directors would chase from their set with security guards but he sees something interesting in them and finds a way to tap into it.  I can't help liking the man for that.  Some people have suggested that his use of the unfortunate Bruno S. as a film actor amounted to some sort of exploitation. But it seems to me that his befriending of Bruno and his artful and patient use of him as a film actor must have given Bruno some sense of the dignity and worth as a unique human being that was denied him for most of his life. If this means nothing to you and you don't know anything about Bruno S. the commentary tracks on either Stroszek or The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser explain his background nicely.  It's a remarkable story.If you're unfamiliar with Herzog's work he has done some especially exotic films with the volatile actor Klaus Kinski.  Cobra Verde is a particular favorite of mine.  But his films do not have the relentless pace or hyperactive editing typical of mainstream American films.  They are unforgiving of those with short attentionspans so be forewarned.".

He'd probably done that anyway but Herzog's portrait of three eccentric oddballs trying their luck in America is a sombre film the most downbeat Herzog made. The only copy I own is a rather dark VHScopy which shows some of the interior shots in Berlin even darker than they already are to the very limit of watchability so perhaps it's time I update this beautiful film with a proper DVD.The film handles the story of former asylum inmate Bruno S. THE ENIGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER as a Berlin street singer in a role where he basically plays himself who joins with his prostitute girlfriend Eva Eva Mattes and ageing eccentric friend Scheitz Clemens Scheitz to embark on a memorable journey leaving modern Berlin for the golden opportunities of America. The 'promised land' is represented by the dreary austere town of Railroad Flats in rural Wisconsin where they settle in a mobile home bought on credit but it turns out America is not gonna fulfill their dreams that easily. Shot in winter Berlin is shown as a cold forbidden and lacklustre place. Not a ray of sunshine. The dark facades of the battered apartment blocks downlit bars filled with smoke and shabby characters the only goal the folks in Bruno's world seem to have is merely make the best of things. Often read as a critique of how capitalist American society destroys the individual Herzog sees the film as less a critique of the United States than as a eulogy in the wake of the American dream for such shattered hopes could develop in virtually any country see Herzog on Herzog p. 144. He does throw in some of the eccentricities of American life but above all it's a somewhat surreal account of three simple folks shortchanged in life desperately trying to make ends meet. From the start it's clear that these three are made for each other. They simply do not fit in any stratum of society really. They're too fragile for the world of pimps and low lives that formed the background of their lives in Berlin. Although not dumb Bruno is too halfwitted to be taken seriously by most people. Eva's background is not fully explained but she's emotionally fragile and dependent while elderly Scheitz's chances to get ahead in life seems to lay in the past. It's a bleak and uncompromising film this tragicomic account of this odd trio in pursuit of a better life outside the dreary confinements of Berlin's lower casts of society but it's so intensely moving and honest with its subjects that alone is something to admire.Camera Obscura  910".

Though the brilliance of those movies is unimpeachable Stroszek at least for me stands at the apex of Herzog's oeuvre. This intensely moving and satisfying film which begins in Germany and winds up in Wisconsin is solid through and through. There's not a weak moment or weak element to be found. The acting especially by Bruno S. is completely unaffected and without overstylization there is perhaps a reason for this  they aren't acting simply being. The story itself deals with melodramatic elements without steering into soap opera territory and the film's ideology is not black in white. There's subtlety and complexity to the ideas put forth in this film about America Germany human beings life etc. Moreover Stroszek avoids beating the audience's brains with its ideas Herzog presents them in the context of the story smoothly integrated. And then there's the beautiful photography particularly of the American Midwest Herzog and his cameramen capture perfectly the cold stark desolate magnificence of the upperPlains. To draw a weird comparison the photography here is the equivalent of Husker Du's New Day Rising  crisp harsh and gorgeous simultaneously. Stroszek also has a justifiably wellknown ending both surreal and completely sensible. Though any other director would be unable to top an ending such as that in Aguirre the slumped conqueror floating on a monkeycovered raft Herzog does just that here. Truly if you have not seen any Herzog this is a great place to start then go see Aguirre Fitzcarraldo Nosferatu Woyczek and Invincible. The man is brilliant and I await with bated breath Grizzly Man his new project.".

RammsteinMany of the films which comprise New German Cinema a period in German cinema which lasted from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s explored and attempted to come to terms with the cultural colonisation foisted upon Western Germany by America in the aftermath of WW2.Wim Wenders Margarethe Trotta Rainer Fassbiner and Werner Herzog were the big names in this movement with films like The American Friend Kings of the Road Storszek and Fear Eats the Soul. But while Herzog's Storszek may have been thematically typical of the movement it's a bit of an anomaly in Herzog's own filmography whose films at least at the time tended to be set in the past and were often structured as allegories or medieval fables.Storszek opens with a mentally unstable musician Bruno Stroszek being released from prison. This character is modelled on the life of Bruno Schleinstein the actor who actually plays Stroszek in the film. Typical of Herzog's work Storszek thus effortlessly blends fiction and documentary Bruno who always seems uncomfortable in front of Herzog's camera acting as himself in a fictional story based loosely on his own life.Like most of Herzog's films the tale is told via several symbolic episodes. First act a wet and oppressive Germany populated by violent pimps and prostitutes. Symbols like a shrinking boat and a bird which is confiscated are then dished out after which Bruno rescues a prostitute and travels to America in the hope of making a better life for himself.Vast and seemingly unrestrictive America is initially portrayed as a place of possibility and freedom. Gradually though Herzog begins to populate this world with his usual assortment of freaks and grotesque characters. More symbols and symbolic subplots are then revealed the story of a local murderer and body snatcher the fact that Bruno's new hometown was the hometown of Ed Gein warring farmers who fight over a thin strip of land obsessions with metal detectors a crazy old man's insistence that people are magnetic and that the dead emit magnetic fields dangerous walks on frozen ponds salty pretzels mobile homes a ski lift etc etc.End result by the film's final act Storszek's fauxdocumentarian edge completely gives way to a kind of overt surrealism. And so Herzog has Bruno lose his home lose his girlfriend who returns to prostitution and leaves him for an obese trucker and mount an incompetent robbery all for 32 dollars and a Thanksgiving turkey. Chased by the police Bruno then flees to a depressingly tacky town whose chief income is a large amusement park operated by Native Indians and awash with machines neon signs glitzy diversions kitschy plastic facades and an assortment of funhouse fakery.Seeking escape Bruno hops on board a ski lift. He thinks it'll take him up into the mountains to some heavenly getaway but of course the ski lift is stuck in a loop and can take him nowhere except right back where he started from. Realizing that the American dream is the German reality Bruno shoots himself committing suicide off screen.The film's final shot is of a solitary chicken trapped in a funhouse dancing automatically seemingly without thought in a cage and making a fool of itself for birdseed. This of course is Bruno's own trap the Myth of Sisyphus in poultry form life reduced to a circus act too grotesque to contemplate. Joy Division lead singer Ian Curtis would hang himself in his kitchen moments after witnessing this very sequence.Herzog's cinema is a cinema of madmen Timothy Treadwell in Grizzly Man Klaus Kinski's numerous starring roles the various mystics and deranged prophets peppered throughout Herzog's filmography etc. What's great is that you're never quite sure how nuts these guys are and how sympathetic Herzog wants you to be toward them. But while it's easy to dismiss Bruno as an endearingly simple manchild with a couple screws loose in the head he is Herzog's ultimate point is three fold. Yes the amusement park may violently spit madmen out of its machinery mad men like Bruno who either reject the illusion or are too damaged to cope. But those chickens whom the machinery doesn't reject are far more insane. Normalcy is irrational and in Herzog's filmography it is often the mad who see this clearest. Or as Harlan Smith once said Fantastic insight into the true nature of Reality is isomorphic to insanity.8.510  Fittingly this film was made the same year as Lynch's Eraserhead. Lynch would use a similar filmic language or metastory decades later with The Straight Story. The film is too ambivalent to be taken as a jab at America and late capitalism. Herzog is primarily an existentialist and whatever fingers he points at the US he points at Germany as well.Worth two viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Admittedly I was hooked from start go by Werner Herzog's Stroszek. This film's weird and unpredictable rhythm intoxicated me. From its arresting images reflections from a hanging glass bottle to the hypnotic sounds Chet Atkins' guitar strumming languidly along a highway these cinematic hallmarks of the great Werner Herzog flooded Stroszek mysteriously unobtrusively and most of all very lovingly. Strange enough the kitschy surreality of this film's music a good example will be that iced lake radar search sequence reminds me strongly of those 70's Classic Taiwanese Beach Dramas. You know the kind where a pair of armsoutstretched love birds would run in slomo towards each other via opposite ends of a sandy seashore? I know the cultural reference may be lost to nonChinese readers and I apologise. But yes this flick stirs and stimulates my free associative imagination with wild and insane glee. I kid you not people. I kid you not. However major credits need be given to the lucidity and forceful presence of one Bruno S. Sample below quote.The Bruno to Eva And now comes the question. All my friends waited for me but this is my best friend....my Black Frienda piano. What's going to happen to my friend when Bruno goes dead someday? Where are these things and these instruments going to end up? What's going to happen to them. Someone must answer this for me. And then they just stared at each other throughout and after.....Above affecting sequence punctuated the bittersweet vulnerability of one Bruno S. As a simple slightly challenged manchild Bruno had very limited human relationships all his life. As such he guilelessly transfers his genuine feelings onto placebo objects. But despite of his checkered past years of physical abuse and institutional upbringing this socially inadequate man ably exudes generosity kindness and unguarded honesty. Given half a chance he will just as likely shower his unconditional love onto those whom he cares for namely Eva. As was shown in one scene set to the haunting tinkles of Moonlight Sonata. All in Bruno is thus an exceptionally good man. But will there yet be more to this Bruno than meet the eyes? I dunno.... Throughout this film I am captivated by Bruno's earnest glow so refreshingly tender and devoid of artifice. In reaction to his search for meaning in life love and other myriad mysteries like birds confiscators or speedtalking men  don't ask. Bruno's expressive face never lies. I felt immensely privileged to share in his bliss or despair at any given points in time. This fascinating creature tugged at my strings more often in this movie than the combined twitches of so many affected actors out there. I friggin' love this charming dude and hence I cannot help but root for the guy. You go Bruno! Like the best of Herzog's works Stroszek boasts of many scratch headworthy moments. Especially considering my having seen the Enigma of Heart of Glass. But these pecularities only serve to propel my viewing experience into mystical realms. For buried within its seemingly artful surfaces lies aching balms of cinematic capsules. They will randomly burst and engulf the inclined and willing. They will seep into one's consciousness and never let you go. I hence don't think I can ever erase the wonderous memories of those stolen moments already from Peddling Sabine to Infant Gymnastics from Not 4 but 5 to 32. Most infamously how can I not mention that Dancing Chicken? Brilliant! At this point I will like to urge all to venture forth into Herzog's film universe. For if you're willing or foolhardy enough to take that plunge you may yet discover a film like Stroszek to be ceaselessly beautiful and effortlessly moving.".

Even Spielberg and Lucas have lost their mojo...OK Lucas moresomuch much moresothan Spielberg. But what about Coppola? What's Scorsese done recently? Did P.T. Anderson fall off the face of the Earth? It's a bit frightening to think that no one is at the helm of the ship and nothing good andor original is being made. Enter Herzog. The guy IS a genius and besides that he is not only prolific but he still has it. Grizzly Man is just as good as anything Herzog made thirty years ago. Coincidentally Stroszek was made thirty years ago. It is brilliant. Herzog knows how to use music in films and here is a prime example. Herzog always has one or two bits of indelible imagery in his films in Stroszek we have the premature babies and the dancing chicken. Another Herzog staple is unforgettable characterization. Who else wanted to punch the banker in the face? The guy's performance as a gladhanding vulture with a big shteating grin was spoton. Now I can see some viewers giving up after fifteen minutes and saying This is pretentious Euroarty bullsht. Fair enough...not all movies appeal to everyone. But I hate pretentious Euroarty bullsht too e.g. The Perfect Human and this ain't that. Stick with it or wait a few years and try it again just like reading Ulysses. This film will make demands on you...don't expect Hollywood pap. Last thing the accusation of antiAmerican has been leveled at this film. I'm a white male Republican i.e. evil incarnate and I do notNOTfind this to be the case. This film is not about bashing America it is about the other side of life's coin and how no man truly decides his own fate.".

For instance the gangsterpimps that terrorize and brutalize Bruno and Eva in Berlin are very much reflections of the Gestapo mentality and the feeling of being trapped and helpless in your own homeland. They are more fortunate than Nazi victims in the ease of their escape to America but unlike most of those refugees in the 30's and 40's Bruno is unable to assimilate and contribute. He expects instant riches and does a little work for the horny hillbillies that give him a job but is still full of anger and paranoia. This is due primarily to his obvious faults alcoholism and maybe paranoid schizophrenia and not to the American system. All 3 of the German transplants are shown to be highly intelligent and cultured beyond the hellish railroad town they are plopped down into and the obvious solution would have been for Bruno to seek employment as a musician as he is very talented in that regard but the dramatic arc of the story demands that he lose everything including Eva and blame America and the insipid characters he is forced to deal with and do something drastic which he does. Eva knew that America is the same as every place if you want a good life you've got to work hard for it using whatever tools  gifts you possess. But Bruno is too damaged to apply this principle and this is the tragedy of Stroszek and of Bruno S.The scene with the premature baby and the doctor is one of the greatest I've ever seen. It is just amazing the character of that tiny infant and shows Stroszek the fundamental power that he lacks the tenacious nature of humanity to hold onto not only fellow human beings but also to life itself.The coinoperated live animals in the end represent not only cruelty and lack of compassion but the obsessiveness of the American pursuit of entertainment. I personally felt more compassion for these creatures as victims of a system than I did for Bruno who was pretty much doomed before he came to America.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the climax of this somewhat tragic tale Bruno a German immigrant whose quest for happiness in America has failed goes on an amateur whatthehell crime spree turns on all the exhibits in a barren midwinter Indian tourist trap and climbs aboard a cable car for a final trip to the mountain top carrying a shotgun and a frozen turkey. One of the exhibits he activates is a pianoplaying chicken who hammers out an impeccable version of Schubert's Scherzo in B Minor. Another is a dancing chicken. The chicken walks out into a glass case plucks a piece of string and begins scratching atop a slowly revolving round table the size of an old record player. The Tribal Police arrive and examine the scene of the crime which includes a burning truck and a recently robbed grocery store. One of the cops is on the squad car's radio. We got a single passenger on the lift and an electrician's on his way out. Somebody turned on the electricity and we can't stop the dancing chicken. The director Werner Herzog lingers on that chicken scratching away over and over on a revolving platter his head completely empty of thought. What are we to make of all this? Except that we are all dancing chickens manipulated by some deranged outer force.If it isn't that then I'm lost.A good case could be made that this movie is utterly pointless. Bruno a shabby caricature of a man is released from an institution and returns to his apartment in Berlin where he has two friends. One is an elderly eccentric and the other an abused whore. The pixylike old man carries on about how easy it is to get rich and live happily in America. The whore saves up her money and the three of them travel to a truck stop in Wisconsin. They buy a mobile home and a television set and things look bright for a while until they fall behind in their mortgage payments.Sick of it all and desperate the hooker takes off in one of the trucks for Canada. The old man goes bonkers and believes it's all a conspiracy so he and the nottoobright Bruno hold up a barber shop run across the street and begin buying groceries. The old man is arrested for armed robbery Bruno steals a truck takes off on his own and finally runs out of money and gas at the Indian tourist trap.My old German grandpappy had a saying Ein Mann hat das Bodel und ein Mann hat das Gelt. Some people have money and others wind up with the bag. Bruno and his friends  and even his enemies  are losers from beginning to end. It's a long slow story of social suicide. All three end up worse than they began as bad as that was.And when I say long I mean long. Herzog  here as elsewhere  has a tendency to hold on stylized shots for a long long long time. The camera is placed behind and above Bruno as a huge truck pulls his forfeited mobile home away. The camera remains static as the mobile home sluggishly departs to the right. The camera stays in the same place and so does Bruno who is now staring at the empty space that his mobile home had occupied. He continues to stare as the seconds tick by and a scratchy old record plays a tune called Silver Bells. If you're patient and if you're sensitive to mood and character and composition you'll get much more out of this movie than if you're expecting some plotdriven dynamo.I'd like to compare this to Robert Altman's exercises in improvisation but I can't. One senses an intentionality behind Herzog's stuff that's absent from Altman's movies. What I mean is Herzog seems to have something in mind behind the apparent non sequiturs and stylized shots. Herzog has a goal whereas many of Altman's movies seemed designed for nothing more than seeing what happened next. In a sense Altman stays with the dancing chicken because that's all there is while Herzog believes that there is somebody turning the machine on and off.".

	schema:reviewBody "The richness of Stroszek strengthens with multiple viewings. Haunting cinematography by Thomas Mauch has a bittersweet humor faithful to midcentury American experience. Underscored by sentimental American popular tunes many from Chet Akins presage Aguirre der Zorn Gottes enhanced by pensive editing by Beate MainkaJellinghaus. The late Bruno Schleinstein plays a protagonist. If you do not know his storywatch the film and then read about him. In the film he also plays his piano accordion glockenspiel and hand bells. This is music by Bruno S. himself. Even though the movies tells a story set in America it is a film about Bruno S. and in an important way a film for him.Eva Mattes famous for her work in four masterworks by Rainer Maria Fassbinder brings a dry sardonic sense to what might have been a maudlin role. Many who play in the film are amateurs the crew met on location. The second cameraman Edward Lachman often improvised English language dialogue in the moment. Literally Mr. Herzog used the people he and the crew met at the moment. Sometimes especially in the sections shot in Germany those playing the role were known ahead of the shooting. The scenes early in the movie with a brutal pimp are played by a brutal pimp. The premature baby is with an actual doctor who works with premature babies.Editor Beate MainkaJellinghaus took part in the shooting. Improvisation plays a major part in the tonality of Stroszek. With Bruno S. and others improvisation plays a vital and central role though Bruno knows what he is to do.This is a terrific film that I relate to Michael Ritchie's Smile another masterwork that explores similar themes. Yet Herzog's view of American life is not bitter like that of Mr. Ritchie. It is brutalbut not meanly so. I think that the meanness has more to do with the story than with Mr. Herzog's opinion of the United States. He admits to having deep affection for the heartland of American and to the people who live there. For one who loves the immense formal beauty of European Modern French Swedish and Italian films watching German movies is sometimes hard in some ways. Many films from the wave of German movies of which Herzog's work is part and example have a hard look. Some of them are hard to watch. The humour is hard even if it softens bitterness. This is not an optimistic film but that is not the mood that Herzog finds about America. It is simply the mood of the story. Do not listen to the commentary on the DVD until you first watch this film without it. Then do listen to the commentary. From the commentary you learn precisely how the movie blurs lines between documentary and fictional film narrative. In the end we realize the Brave New World image of conditioned life in Americain the trained rabbit and poultry a duck and especially a chicken at CherokeeNorth Carolina. Sonny Terry blowing his fierce blues harmonica beats the frantic and pointless pace at which we live. Funny and tragic but not mean these images infect your memory.".

Even though the movies tells a story set in America it is a film about Bruno S. and in an important way a film for him.Eva Mattes famous for her work in four masterworks by Rainer Maria Fassbinder brings a dry sardonic sense to what might have been a maudlin role. Many who play in the film are amateurs the crew met on location. The second cameraman Edward Lachman often improvised English language dialogue in the moment. Literally Mr. Herzog used the people he and the crew met at the moment. Sometimes especially in the sections shot in Germany those playing the role were known ahead of the shooting. The scenes early in the movie with a brutal pimp are played by a brutal pimp. The premature baby is with an actual doctor who works with premature babies.Editor Beate MainkaJellinghaus took part in the shooting. Improvisation plays a major part in the tonality of Stroszek. With Bruno S. and others improvisation plays a vital and central role though Bruno knows what he is to do.This is a terrific film that I relate to Michael Ritchie's Smile another masterwork that explores similar themes. Yet Herzog's view of American life is not bitter like that of Mr. Ritchie. It is brutalbut not meanly so. I think that the meanness has more to do with the story than with Mr. Herzog's opinion of the United States. He admits to having deep affection for the heartland of American and to the people who live there. For one who loves the immense formal beauty of European Modern French Swedish and Italian films watching German movies is sometimes hard in some ways. Many films from the wave of German movies of which Herzog's work is part and example have a hard look. Some of them are hard to watch. The humour is hard even if it softens bitterness. This is not an optimistic film but that is not the mood that Herzog finds about America. It is simply the mood of the story. Do not listen to the commentary on the DVD until you first watch this film without it. Then do listen to the commentary. From the commentary you learn precisely how the movie blurs lines between documentary and fictional film narrative. In the end we realize the Brave New World image of conditioned life in Americain the trained rabbit and poultry a duck and especially a chicken at CherokeeNorth Carolina. Sonny Terry blowing his fierce blues harmonica beats the frantic and pointless pace at which we live. Funny and tragic but not mean these images infect your memory.";

	schema:reviewBody "What an unclassifiable hybridwhatever movie Stroszek is. I'd wager it's the kind of picture that Gonzo the Great yes the Muppet would probably make if he were from Germany and looking to make a tragiccomic look on one man's journey in the rural side of America after all the last sequence would make perfect sense wouldn't it. In truth it's Werner Herzog at his most focused and unhinged a work of wild original art where the tone ranges from harsh reality documentary realism or so we might think to drama stripped of its 'melo' and a brand of satire that goes beyond the usual realm and is satirical only in the sense that you know something is being made fun of. In fact I'd say the last twentyfive thirty minutes of this picture are the funniest and even in these minutes there's a sense of sorrow to what has happened with Bruno Stroszek Bruno S. sort of as himself I suppose the line between fiction and fact is so blurry that it's the only way Herzog can get things done and how his girlfriend Eva Mattes leaves him and his best friend and neighbor gets arrested after armed robbery of a uh store in a basement next to a bank I guess.But whatever weirdness and sort of everyday mundane qualities that go hand in hand with the film Stroszek are given a greater context. I actually had a little more interest in what was going on after having just seen Chaplin's Modern Times and seeing how there could be a comparison made to the two. Of course Herzog could never be one to induce the silly physical comedy that makes up the bulk of Chaplin's films but there is a similarity that struck me and helped make me really care about what was going on with these characters Herzog for all his showing the ultimate follies loves Stroszek or at least does not try and show him off as being a complete waste of life. And if it does almost come off that way Stroszek is after all a perpetual drunk who got released only recently from the mental hospital and can never get steady work aside from being a mechanic once in the US it's offset by how much he even cares about the much more flawed Eva too. He sees them in a context of society and civilization as well as just standalone outcasts outcasts being another Chaplin comparison not to mention the other side characters both wretchedly cruel and mean like the Germans who bully Stroszek and beat up on Eva or the wacky coworkers and very formal mortgageloan people. So in a way Herzog takes on the other side of what we might usually find in a Chaplin effort which includes cynicism at least skepticism despair and replacing morality with a truly twisted sense of humor. Not that the form of documentary more than anything peeks its head into the work.There isn't much story to report aside from the bulk of what I've already mentioned Stroszek Eva and their elderly neighbor escape from the harsh and cruel state of being they're at in Berlin a brief but interesting commentary on Germany too only to find in the smalltown Wisconsin life not much more in line of prosperity. Soon Stroszek is on his own when he loses his trailerhome Eva leaves him after a drunken ramble he goes on and of course the aforementioned botched robbery. He heads off randomly to another small town tells his story to a random guy and then as his truck goes up in flames he gets caught on a skilift after passing by a dancing chicken. All the while Bruno S. plays this guy with no punches pulled and is as intuitive a nonprofessional actor as any given others in the old neorealist days. Eva too wasn't that much of an actress yet when she took on this role. And a lot of the time David Lynch mentioned this in an interview as he started watching the film in the middle it's like watching a documentary of these people showing in all the ordinary workingclass ways how they get stuck and any chance of the American dream gets squashed. One's never really sure who's an actor or not but it makes no difference really. A lot of it is some of the most harrowing cinema that I've seen in a while the tone is of a bitterness at the system any system and of a sorrow that is everlooming that is perhaps until the ending.Remarkable then is really how much I laughed during the film. Even in the earlier scenes when it was dreary the sort of behavior in parts and especially notes of the dialog rang of the complete randomness that is all abound in Herzog's work. But one only needs to look at Stroszek to see the Herzog sense of humor working fulltilt amid the social commentary and despair. The two funniest sequences not withstanding the armed robbery are the auction scene that guy wow just wow is all I could say after that and the dancing chicken. A big chunk of the dancing chicken scene's bizarre appeal is the music with a true absurdity to the harmonica playing and wailing vocals. Many over the years have wondered the significance of the dancing chicken most particularly as the ending to the picture. While Herzog himself claims it to be a metaphor for something he can't place a friend mentioned that it could be capitalism or the chicken as a representation of Bruno Stroszek or of an American in general. I wouldn't want to jump to any conclusions just yet and I'm glad that way all I know is that it's one of the funniest three minutes of film to ever come out of Europe. It's Herzog's ultimate tragiccomic tale about a man in the lower depths of himself and his society. A".

	schema:reviewBody "Stroszekanalysis by Philip BrubakerWerner Herzog's Stroszek 1977 is a film both in German and English. The three main characters flee Germany for the promise of opportunity in America. In Berlin they find themselves victims of vicious brutes who prostitute Ewa Stroszek's friend. Stroszek himself is just released from a mental institution. The two outcasts hook up with an eccentric old man and decided to move to Wisconsin where the old man's nephew lives. Stroszek has been called Herzog's most accessible film a distinction due to it's timeworn fishoutofwater premise. But the archetypal humor of the situation turns black as Ewa begins to revert to her promiscuous ways and the group's double wide gets impounded and auctioned off by the bank. Stroszek's life is falling apart so what does he do? He attempts to rob a bank.The failure of the American Dream is the story of every criminal in the United States. By turning to crime the criminal hopes to regain the hope of being rich by any means necessary. The American Dream failed Stroszek and this idea is represented by many striking images. The most overt symbol in the film are the two farmers who mow their grass toting shotguns. The tractorriding farmers are both watching over a strip of land in between their properties making sure neither one is attempting to mow it and therefore claim it as their own. The scene is played for laughs but it is a pointed reference to Stroszek's hometown of Berlin with it's harsh division by the Berlin Wall. The Native American character is the ultimate symbol of America. He is both a foreigner and a native. A stranger to the white man's culture a culture of European immigrants. When Stroszek makes his farewell ride to the Indian Reservation town of Cherokee he drives right into the heart of the American dilemma. Here he is surrounded by the last vestiges of American Indian culture now warped and perverted into a tourist attraction an example of American grotesquerie at it's lowest low. An oldtimey holler is heard on the soundtrack and our hero ditches his car and climbs onto a chair lift ride with his shotgun. As the camera tilts up to his slow ascent up a tall mountain a shot rings out. Did Stroszek take his own life? Appropriately Herzog leaves this ambiguous. His rise upward on the chair lift is symbolic of the ascent to Heaven ShangriLa Eldorado and every dreamed mythical place that foreigners imagine America to be. He is going home.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a huge fan of Joy Division I found out that this was the last film watched by Ian Curtis before he killed himself. I then found out that Werner Herzog was his favourite director and knew I simply had to see it. I didn't quite know what to expect upon popping it into my DVD player as I had never seen a Herzog film before. I begins with Bruno S. apparently playing himself being released from prison with his accordion and bugle. He is warned to stay away from alcohol as beer is the reason he ended up in prison. The first thing he does is go into a pub called Beer Heaven. There he meets Eva and offers her a place to live however Eva's pimp and his mate beat Eva and intimidate Bruno. Eva sells herself to men to raise money so herself and Bruno can go and join Bruno's elderly neighbour in America. Like many people in films before they believe America will be the place of their dreams where Bruno can rise to fame with his musical talent and they can earn money. Things seem good at first with Bruno and Eva settling in. However the bank comes looking for repayments to their loan and Eva begins selling herself to men yet again finally leaving Bruno. In a hilarious scene Bruno and Mr. Scheitz go to rob a bank only to find it is closed so they rob the tiny shop next door only stealing 32. They then go across the road to spend the money and Mr. Scheitz is arrested. Finally Bruno drives off and kills himself upon a skilift. It is a tragic film that really captures the hopelessness of dreams and shows the characters trapped in a world that doesn't measure up to their dreams much like the dancing and instrument playing animals at the end. Herzog has an eye for simply constructed shots and images that convey raw emotion. One point sees Bruno visiting a premature baby ward. The babies are so helpless and fragile yet still beautiful. The doctors demonstration of the strength of their reflex grip echoes that of Bruno and his dreams. Herzog is also highly skilled at holding a shot forcing the viewer to experience the emotion. At the end we see Bruno in a diner and the camera simply stays on his face Bruno barely flinches but it is though we can feel what he feels. The film is also interesting in its pace as it never rushes but feels though each moment just flies by but also the overall film seems longer than it actually is. The film is very rare as it feels complete. BEing told from Bruno's perspective once a major character leaves him they feature no more. Some films have me thinking What happened to... not here though as I was completely wrapped up in Bruno's journey. The unprofessional cast are more convincing in their subtlety and inexperience than the majority of A list ensemble casts and they really add a human touch to the film. A brilliant film that really makes you feel and connect with it. And since the film is about a musician it only makes sense that the music is well used and very very good.".

It is a tragic film that really captures the hopelessness of dreams and shows the characters trapped in a world that doesn't measure up to their dreams much like the dancing and instrument playing animals at the end. Herzog has an eye for simply constructed shots and images that convey raw emotion. One point sees Bruno visiting a premature baby ward. The babies are so helpless and fragile yet still beautiful. The doctors demonstration of the strength of their reflex grip echoes that of Bruno and his dreams. Herzog is also highly skilled at holding a shot forcing the viewer to experience the emotion. At the end we see Bruno in a diner and the camera simply stays on his face Bruno barely flinches but it is though we can feel what he feels. The film is also interesting in its pace as it never rushes but feels though each moment just flies by but also the overall film seems longer than it actually is. The film is very rare as it feels complete. BEing told from Bruno's perspective once a major character leaves him they feature no more. Some films have me thinking What happened to... not here though as I was completely wrapped up in Bruno's journey. The unprofessional cast are more convincing in their subtlety and inexperience than the majority of A list ensemble casts and they really add a human touch to the film. A brilliant film that really makes you feel and connect with it. And since the film is about a musician it only makes sense that the music is well used and very very good.";

	schema:reviewBody "Kurt Vonnegut once said the problem with the hippie generation is that they expect love and happiness but I would settle for a little common human decency.This movie is Herzog being decent. He promised Bruno his challenged actor another movie but when Bruno couldn't learn the part of Woyzeck he realized his old friend Klaus Kinski had to take the role  and did so brilliantly. But he had made a promise so he kept his word and wrote this movie on the spot and even got the great Eva Mathes who won the Golden Lion in Venice for her role as Marie Woyzeck's tragic love to pitch in and play an abused hooker. All the rest of the cast were amateur characters.It has the basic Herzog themes of struggle against all odds and regardless of outcome even in the most hopeless cases. And just that spirit of struggle is worth applauding. This one just doesn't go into the usual richly layered labyrinths of dreamscapes that Herzog being the romanticist he is tends to use as story within the story as allegories for the whole story  the romantics' arabesque. Strozeck is more blunt straight forward and hits the viewers over the head with a lot of grotesque black humor.This movie has great hilarious black humor scenes and a great punchline when the hero compares the bank repossession agent's pen with the beatings by the Nazi's in the Concentration Camp  unfavorably.It's great fun to watch and wallow in if you're in a dark or twisted mood but I wouldn't base drastic decisions about the rest of my life especially its remaining duration on what is arguably Herzog's most crude slapstick and that includes the one with the rebellious Spanish dwarfs.But it really isn't fair to compare this or any other Herzog film to his big dramatic successes like Aguirre Kasper Hauser Fitzcaraldo Nosferatu or Woyzeck. While they share some common themes see above every one of his movies and documentaries are their own work and can range from remakes of 19th century realist play 1920s silent movie 18th century romanticism or the joys of mountain climbing or ski jumping.As its own work Stroszek is fun to watch and a good laugh watching one of the 20th century's legendary independent filmmakers present a very different mood.".

Herzog of course is not that kind of guy and he spends a lot of his time in the United States. This isn't even really a satire like I thought it would be. Unfortunately I don't think it's much of anything. Bruno S. is such a messedup person both in real life and in the characters he played for Herzog that the fact that he can't adjust to life in America is neither surprising nor at all damning. It seems like life is going to be hard for the guy no matter where he goes. Because of that it's kind of hard to get too invested in this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Werner Herzog's Stroszek intrigued me because of the film's journey from Berlin to Wisconsin. I am always fascinated when directors take on other cultures to present their point of view. Wim Wenders' Alice in the Cities came to my mind when I rented this film. Knowing Herzog's other ambitious and strange films Aguirre the Wrath of God and  Even Dwarfs Started Out Small it was no surprise to me just how bizarre this film was going to be. Bruno a man who some might assume is mildly retarded is released from prison. His first destination is a bar and meets a prostitute who is being mistreated by her pimp. He offers her a place to stay which is looked after by an elderly man Mr. Scheitz. All of these characters by the way have an amazing look about them. They are not your typical looking actors they have a rough and odd look that can be found in a Fellini film. We know they are not professional actors but they fit and play the roles perfectly. Mr. Scheitz announces that his nephew in Railroad Flats Wisconsin has invited him to move there. Bruno then takes the leap in deciding that they must all start new lives there. We already feel baffled at the idea of these people getting off the boat to live in such a rural and remote part of the US. Nothing goes well for these characters. The prostitute runs away because of financial and domestic problems while the other two decide to become robbers and fail miserably. This mind you is only a general plot summary but it is the details and occurrences that are fascinating. I particularly loved the scene where the mobile home is being auctioned off. We get a glimpse of how alienating and strange America is for these people. There are other fascinating scenes that I don't want to spoil for anyone. This film is a must see for any fan of Herzog and anyone who loves films period. Some critics have described Stroszek as an attack on America but I believe it is an equal attack on Germany. These characters fall into a predicament of taking their sorrows with them wherever they go. They are unfortunately very naive. The final scene with the dancing chicken was a bit over the top and disturbing but it fits with the absurdity of the film as a whole.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stroszek is a German movie from almost 40 years ago and the second collaboration between Werner Herzog and Bruno S. Herzog initially planned to cast him as Woyzeck but chose Kinski for the role. To make it up to Bruno Herzog wrote this film here and it turned into one of his biggest successes with Bruno giving the lead character his uniquely memorable touch. He is a man who gets released out of jail and needs to stay away from the booze in order to lead a normal life again. After some violent trouble with a pair of pimps Bruno his girl played by Eva Mattes who got a German Film Award nomination for her turn and a friend move to the United States of America. And for the rest of the film we see how life for Bruno and his guys is over there. Sadly the American Dream is collapsing pretty quickly.The film runs for over 105 minutes and I personally found the parts in Germany early on more interesting really. But that is not saying that the second half of the film wasn't good. I thought it was a very decent watch from start to finish and I find it a pity Herzog hasn't made more films with Bruno or that Bruno has not starred in other movies in the 1970s and 1980s. I definitely liked watching him. In here as well as in Kaspar Hauser from 3 years earlier. People may say that there is not really that much happening in Stroszek but first of all I don't think this is a valid criticism per se and secondly actually there is a lot happening. Life is happening. We see a man going for his dream but sadly things don't go the way he hoped in the long run. I recommend Stroszek This film is more proof of how good Herzog was in the 1960s. And for authentic and honest Bruno S.'s acting was at the same time. Go check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "A tale of forbidden love TABU is bestremembered today as legendary German director FW Murnau's last film  he was killed in a car accident only one week before its New York premiere. Murnau had been working in Hollywood since the mid1920s and had already directed several films in the United States but of these only the famous SUNRISE 1927 was a success. By 1930 Murnau had become tired of the Hollywood system and was thinking about returning to Germany but a timely introduction to Robert F. Flaherty  at that time famous as the director of the classic documentary NANOOK OF THE NORTH  sparked an illfated collaboration that resulted in this gorgeous hypnotic and unforgettable film.At first Murnau and Flaherty intended to produce a Nanookstyle documentary of Tahiti and its people but several problems intervened Flaherty and Murnau turned out to have radically different ideas about filmmaking in general and this project in particular Flaherty's skills as a cinematographer were not up to the task and another DP had to be called in and Flaherty's working relationship with the domineering Murnau fell apart when  instead of being codirector as the two had agreed  Flaherty found himself spending most of his time in the lab developing Muranu's film. Only one scene directed by Flaherty remains in TABU  the opening spearfishing sequence  and sad to say the quality of this scene is no match for Murnau's exquisite footage. In addition Flaherty decided that he hated the story  he found it too Westernized and fairytalelike. After a period of mutual discontent Murnau bought out Flaherty sent the entire Hollywood crew back to California and took over the project completely  even training Tahitian natives in filmmaking techniques so he could employ the locals as his crew. With the exception of Anne Chevalier  a local FrenchTahitian woman whom Murnau discovered performing in a bar in Bora Bora  the entire cast and crew save Murnau and his cinematographer was made up of nonprofessionals.The film which resulted from this choice is a unique hybrid of documentary and fiction with a mythic fantasmatic air about it that is very hard to define  there is no other movie like TABU. Certainly the fact that we are watching actual Tahitian natives going about their daily business rather than professional actors lends the film a patina of authenticity and realism which makes it impossible to categorize TABU as some sort of Westerncolonialwhite people's fantasy of the South Seas  in fact the film's depiction of tribal culture is quite complex and thoughtprovoking as we will see...The plot of TABU is diagramatically simple  the idyllic lives of a Bora Bora fisherman called Matahi and his beloved Reri Anne Chevalier are destroyed when tribal elders decree that Reri is so perfect a specimen of local womanhood that the gods have selected her for the honor of becoming their sacrificial victim. Reri immediately becomes TABU  forbidden  to Matahi as she must come before the gods untouched by man. Not surprisingly Matahi disagrees with the gods' choice. He kidnaps Reri and the two flee to a neighboring island where they believe they will be safe. Unfortunately this particular island has been taken over by Western civilization and thus the innocent Matahi and Reri have to navigate some very unfamiliar and peculiar customs  like debt and credit. Matahi begins working as a pearl diver but he is unable to understand money or handle liquor and is threatened with violence when he cannot repay a debt. The couple flee once more desperate for a safe haven but they do not find one. Matahi and Reri's lives become more and more insecure and in due course of time the tribal elders track them down anyway. Realizing that the only choice they have is to return to the world they know Reri resigns herself to her fate but will Matahi accept the inevitable? A mere plotsummary cannot fully express what TABU is like as a visual and intellectual experience. The film's treatment of native culture is extremely complex  unlike the noble savage clich so popular among Western audiences and seen most recently in AVATAR Murnau's Bora Bora seems like Eden on the surface but is governed by a rigid code of conduct which squashes individuality and personality. Matahi and Reri's innocent love is doomed from the beginning as they are caught between two worlds and unable to find a place in either. Ultimately the beauty and simplicity of tribal life in Bora Bora  so seductive to the eye and ear in the first part of the film  is shown to be a souldestroying deathtrap governed by superstition and groupthink. Of course Murnau depicts the Western system as being no better  European civilization is shown as not much more than drunken greedy exploitative artifice out to rape the entire world for a fast buck. TABU is in many ways a terrifying film where pure love is doomed in the face of money and authority and even the gorgeous purity of the Tahitian Islands seems tainted by human greed and foolishness. This masterpiece will haunt you for a long time after you have seen it partly because of the riveting story and partly because of the exquisite cinematography by Floyd Crosby who deservedly won an Academy Award for his efforts. Do not miss this legendary masterwork of cinema!".

	schema:headline " A cinematic poem";
	schema:reviewBody "The brainchild of German genius F.W. Murnau and documentary innovator Robert J. Flaherty of Nanook of the North 1922 fame Tabu uses the beautiful untouched landscape of the South Pacific and employs non professional natives to tell the beautiful story of love found and lost and ultimately the death of paradise. Murnau died in an automobile accident shortly before the film's premiere and thus was his last gift to the moviegoing world. Though it doesn't come close to the iconic expressionist horror of Nosferatu 1922 or the dark satirical humour of The Last Laugh 1924 Murnau's epitaph is a simple yet heart wrenching cinematic poem.The best spearfisherman on Bora Bora is a handsome young man billed simply as The Boy Matahi. His legendary status and unparalleled skill makes him popular amongst the islanders and soon he has caught the eye of The Girl Reri  who went on to star on Broadway as Anne Chevalier. They romance each other but their affair is soon halted by the arrival of emissary The Old Warrior Hitu who proclaims Reri as the sacred maiden. She is 'tabu' and cannot be looked upon by any man unless he wishes the punishment of death. The couple brave storm and sea to escape an arrive in a Frenchcolonised island where Matahi start work as a pearl diver. But their happiness is fleeting and Reri is soon haunted by the image of Hitu terrified she may have angered the gods.The plot is hardly anything new but Floyd Crosby's Oscarwinning cinematography makes Tabu more socially aware that the film may have you believe. The subtle yet crucial involvement of the French colonists finding amusement at Matahi's lack of understanding regarding money and material wealth is a clear swipe at the creeping of Western civilisation. Bora Bora won't stay pure for much longer. And that adds a gravitas to Matahi and Reri's plight  not only is their romance doomed but so are their traditions and society. It is one of the last great silent films a reminder that sound can be an unnecessary distraction and that picture's can sometimes genuinely speak louder than words.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

MURNAU and ROBERT J. FLAHERTY. Photography Floyd Crosby. Film editor Arthur A. Brooks. Supervising film editor and production manager Edgar G. Ulmer. Music Hugo Riesenfeld. Coproducer David Flaherty. Assistant director Bill Bambridge. Music orchestrations W. Franke Harling and Milan Roder. Not copyright by MurnauFlaherty Productions. Released through Paramount. New York opening at the Central Park Theatre 18 March 1931. 6 reels. 81 minutes.SYNOPSIS Native boy loves Sacred Maiden.NOTES Academy Award for Cinematography. Floyd Crosby defeated a strong field including Edward Cronjager's Cimarron Lee Garmes' Morocco Charles Lang's The Right To Love and Barney McGill's Svengali. Filmed over a period of 18 months in the South Seas on the islands of Bora Bora and Takapota Tabu is a silent film with a synchronized music score and sound effects.Flaherty disclaims the film. He withdrew from the production before it was completed.On the Thursday before the New York opening F. W. Murnau was killed when his driver lost control of his car and it plunged over an embankment on the outskirts of Los Angeles.COMMENT The trailer which Paramount prepared well before the director's death tells us that over a thousand critics had voted Murnau as one of the world's greatest directors. His first Hollywood feature Sunrise 1927 certainly achieved triumphant status. Basically a silent film it was fleshed out with sound effects and a wonderful music score by Hugo Riesenfeld. However Murnau's next pictures Four Devils 1929 and City Girl 1930 failed to achieve comparable success both with the critics and public. Again both were basically conceived as silent films though this time with talking sequences. Murnau had little to do with the talkie sections. In both films these were staged by A.H. Van Buren and A.F. Buddy Erickson.When producer William Fox decided to expand the dialogue content of City Girl Murnau left the production and Buddy Erickson took over the direction.Murnau then formed a partnership with the famous documentary film maker Bob Flaherty. Together they journeyed to the South Seas to the island of Bora Bora then untouched by the advances of civilization. They wrote a simple but emotive script that brilliantly utilized their surroundings and commenced filming with an allnative cast headed by the lovely Anna Chevalier who is actually billed as Reri to disguise her French parentage.At some stage Murnau and Flaherty had a serious disagreement. In the upshot Flaherty left Bora Bora. Murnau completed the film by himself then took the rushes back to Hollywood where he supervised the editing in collaboration with his friend Edgar G. Ulmer. Another friend Hugo Riesenfeld wrote the magnificent music that underlines just about every minute of the movie's running time deftly inserting traditional native chants to add poetry realism and variety.It's about the music score that I want to speak first. One of the most remarkable and beautiful scores ever written for a motion picture it is so wondrously atmospheric that the viewer doesn't realize that the composer also supplies all the sound effects until a second or third viewing. The love theme is heartwrenching and poignant. By a happy chance this style of scoring with its repetitive phrases and crescendo orchestration was later used extensively by Alfred Newman. So unlike many other early 1930s scores this one seems astonishingly modern.Although not a single word of spoken dialogue issues from the screen we never have the impression of watching a silent film.

MURNAU and ROBERT J. FLAHERTY. Photography Floyd Crosby. Film editor Arthur A. Brooks. Supervising film editor and production manager Edgar G. Ulmer. Music Hugo Riesenfeld. Coproducer David Flaherty. Assistant director Bill Bambridge. Music orchestrations W. Franke Harling and Milan Roder. Not copyright by MurnauFlaherty Productions. Released through Paramount. New York opening at the Central Park Theatre 18 March 1931. 6 reels. 81 minutes.SYNOPSIS Native boy loves Sacred Maiden.NOTES Academy Award for Cinematography. Floyd Crosby defeated a strong field including Edward Cronjager's Cimarron Lee Garmes' Morocco Charles Lang's The Right To Love and Barney McGill's Svengali. Filmed over a period of 18 months in the South Seas on the islands of Bora Bora and Takapota Tabu is a silent film with a synchronized music score and sound effects.Flaherty disclaims the film. He withdrew from the production before it was completed.On the Thursday before the New York opening F. W. Murnau was killed when his driver lost control of his car and it plunged over an embankment on the outskirts of Los Angeles.COMMENT The trailer which Paramount prepared well before the director's death tells us that over a thousand critics had voted Murnau as one of the world's greatest directors. His first Hollywood feature Sunrise 1927 certainly achieved triumphant status. Basically a silent film it was fleshed out with sound effects and a wonderful music score by Hugo Riesenfeld. However Murnau's next pictures Four Devils 1929 and City Girl 1930 failed to achieve comparable success both with the critics and public. Again both were basically conceived as silent films though this time with talking sequences. Murnau had little to do with the talkie sections. In both films these were staged by A.H. Van Buren and A.F. Buddy Erickson.When producer William Fox decided to expand the dialogue content of City Girl Murnau left the production and Buddy Erickson took over the direction.Murnau then formed a partnership with the famous documentary film maker Bob Flaherty. Together they journeyed to the South Seas to the island of Bora Bora then untouched by the advances of civilization. They wrote a simple but emotive script that brilliantly utilized their surroundings and commenced filming with an allnative cast headed by the lovely Anna Chevalier who is actually billed as Reri to disguise her French parentage.At some stage Murnau and Flaherty had a serious disagreement. In the upshot Flaherty left Bora Bora. Murnau completed the film by himself then took the rushes back to Hollywood where he supervised the editing in collaboration with his friend Edgar G. Ulmer. Another friend Hugo Riesenfeld wrote the magnificent music that underlines just about every minute of the movie's running time deftly inserting traditional native chants to add poetry realism and variety.It's about the music score that I want to speak first. One of the most remarkable and beautiful scores ever written for a motion picture it is so wondrously atmospheric that the viewer doesn't realize that the composer also supplies all the sound effects until a second or third viewing. The love theme is heartwrenching and poignant. By a happy chance this style of scoring with its repetitive phrases and crescendo orchestration was later used extensively by Alfred Newman. So unlike many other early 1930s scores this one seems astonishingly modern.Although not a single word of spoken dialogue issues from the screen we never have the impression of watching a silent film. Cleverly the usual insert captions are used most sparingly and even then only and quite naturally employed to reveal the contents of three or four letters.Under Murnau's inspired guidance the acting of this entirely amateur cast rates as nothing short of superlative. The players come across with such complete conviction they seem for all the world like real people playing out this tragic romance before our very eyes.Finally the photography. Yes Floyd Crosby certainly deserved his award. Every single shot strikes the viewer as a masterpiece of composition lighting and atmosphere. It positively shimmers.

Any attempts to take away the virgin or deflower her is a curse for all but young love even among the superstitious allows no such circumstance to be separated putting the two on the run for their lives.Ending up on a nearby port the two lovers do their best to hide from those looking for them even having fun in a modern native dance nothing like they've ever seen before. But the dangers are constantly looming every glance at them is a risk of being caught and that keeps this flowing with excitement at breakneck speed. The attractive barely covered cast does a great job without dialog the only narration being a series of letters to indicate the passage of time and to reveal the most important if details. This is F.W. Murnau's masterpiece filled with reminders of the dangers these free loving people faced through nature through superstition through chance.

These were all highly innovative films and represented the absolute cutting edge in film. But TABU on the other hand just seems stuck and behind the times. While it does have a very interesting story excellent onlocation filming and nice music and sound effects the film looks like it was made pre1930 because there were no voices. I am a HUGE fan of silent films but still feel compelled to complain about this.Not a bad film but certainly a skipable film and nowhere nearly as welldone as his other movies. Plus in 1928 three years before TABU a very similar film WHITE SHADOWS IN THE SOUTH SEAS was made and Murnau's tale is of about equal quality.".

I am a HUGE fan of silent films but still feel compelled to complain about this.Not a bad film but certainly a skipable film and nowhere nearly as welldone as his other movies. Plus in 1928 three years before TABU a very similar film WHITE SHADOWS IN THE SOUTH SEAS was made and Murnau's tale is of about equal quality.";

The documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie. The landscapes are beautiful and the daily life activities of the islanders are interesting to watch. The film loses momentum though when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers. The storyline just never gets that interesting despite being handled well by Murnau. Won an Academy Award for best cinematography although the award probably should have been for best scenery. You can't really credit the DP for getting to shoot in such a beautiful location.".

But The Girl goes against him and hands herself in to The Old Warrior returning to their island to spare the life of The Boy and trying to follow swimming the ocean after the boat and trying to reach the island himself he dies from exhaustion. Also starring Bill Bambridge as The Policeman. I will confess that I found it a bit difficult to follow apart from the basic forbidden love story but all the culture disputes and activities or events going on I slipped in and out with it certainly looks good though with the locations so I suppose it is not a bad silent drama. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Worth watching!".

This meaty Western contains an interesting but twisted plot  thrills  action  doublecrosses  violence  shoot'em up and results to be quite entertaining . But overall Ringo the Lone Rider or Two Brothers One Death is entertaining to watch  with some good moments and against the backdrop of aftermath American Civil War that gives more firmness to the story . The movie deals with historical events and characters such as the Bushwhackers who are irregulars loyal to the South led by Bill Anderson and also appears the notorious Pinkerton Agency . It is also remarkable violence executed by band Bill  who doesn't care to kill some poor and peaceful Mormons to achieve their goals . The picture efficiently describes the atmosphere of violence in which was set the post Civil War dealing with fights between Bushwhackers versus Jayhawkers . It's a moving western with breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist  Peter Martell and Piero Lulli against Anderson band formed by customary Spanish secondaries such as Armando Calvo  Jose Jaspe  Alfonso De La Vega and Frank Braa . Nice production design creating an evocative scenario with luminous outdoors  mountains  rocky grounds under a shinning sun and fine sets by Cubero and Galicia from Colmenar Viejo  Madrid La Pedriza  and Hoyo de Manzanares's Westernfilm town .

	schema:reviewBody "Spanish director Rafael Romero Marchent's Ringo The Lone Rider ranks as an aboveaverage oater. Initially the title for this SpanishItalian western made greater sense Two Brothers One Death. If you've seen this movie you'll know why title is more suitable. Whereas Ringo The Lone Rider is somewhat inappropriate since our hero works alongside another hero. Of course it matters little that nobody in the film is named Ringo. Presumably the producers used Ringo in the title because Ringo was a popular Spaghetti western protagonist. Similarly many European westerns were retitled Django because of the success of Sergio Corbucci's masterpiece. Basically in this law and order horse opera scenarists Eduardo Manzanos of Pistol for a Hundred Coffins and Mario Caiano of Seven Pistols for a Massacre have our heroes tracking down and shooting it out with an unscrupulous gang of murderers. Meantime the villains constitute a rather ruthless bunch but this shouldn't come as a surprise since it chronicles the depredations of Bloody Bill Anderson's Confederate renegades. In real life notorious 'Bloody Bill' died during the American Civil War. Nevertheless he is the leader of a vicious cutthroat gang of killers in Missouri that terrorize the small town of Springfield. Spaghetti western stalwart Peter Martell plays a former Union Army officer from Tennessee who now works for the Pinkerton Detective Agency. It seems the infamous outlaw 'Bloody Bill' Armando Calvo of Duel at the Rio Grande has been marauding in the state of Missouri specifically the town of Springfield. The city fathers hire the Pinkerton Detective Agency to dispatch an undercover operative into to thwart these outlaws. Known variously as either Captain Bly or Don Blake our hero is a swiftshooting hardriding protagonist. The Anderson gang outnumbers our valiant hero until Ringo crosses trails with Daniel G. Samuelson Piero Lulli of My Name Is Nobody and the two form an alliance. Samuelson has no qualms of shooting unarmed men. He is a duplicitous character as he explains at one point to Blake. During the American Civil War he sold horses to the Union and information to the Confederacy. About halfway through this 80minute oater the bad guys decide to hightail it out of Missouri. They fall in with a wagon train of Mormons made up of strictly guys without any women. They tell 'Bloody Bill' about a tract of land and a ranch that they have bought. The catch is nobody knows what these Mormons look like so 'Bloody Bill' and his bunch wipe them out including a child too. Interestingly enough Ringo The Lone Rider came out in general release before Once Upon a Time in the West where Henry Fonda murdered a child. Fonda committed the killing because one of his henchman had called him by name and the teenage boy had to die since he knew his identity. Here the Mormon kid dies because Anderson's gang cannot afford to leave any witness behind who might testify against them in court. One of the gang however refuses to participate in this mass execution. Earlier before the outlaws left Missouri Blake shot one of them when they tried to hang two members of a Springfield posse. 'Bloody Bill's' men captured Blake but 'Kid' Michael Paolo Herzl of The Stranger insists that 'Bloody Bill' cannot kill Blake because Blake saved the Kid's life during the Civil War and he is indebted to him. They turn Blake loose and the Kid fakes the deaths of the two posse riders. Similarly the Kid refuses to participate in the mass murder of the Mormons and 'Bloody Bill' allows him to sit out the mass execution. Later Bill and his brigands ride to the ranch and claim it. This indicates how difficult it was to determine the basis for an individual's identity in the Old West as well as how easy it was for somebody to steal identities. 'Bloody Bill's' elaborate plan is to raid by night as outlaws and farm the property by day as Mormons. Our heroes pursue the Anderson gang and a huge showdown ensues. The villains here are interesting because they are ambitious. The complexity of the villainy in Two Brothers One Death is reflected in a secondary villain Judge Grant ngel Menndez of Night of the Walking Dead who is conspiring with 'Bloody Bill.' Judge Grant takes Bill's loot that he has stolen and launders it by sending it across the Mexican border in the hands of Gonzalez. Our heroes kill not only Gonzalez but also the treacherous Judge. Eventually Blake and the Kid square off against each other in a showdown. The major surprise of the film occurs during this confrontation because Samuelson makes the mistake of trying to intervene. You'll have to see this movie to learn what is so surprising about this showdown. The depth of the villainy sets Two Brothers One Death apart from most westerns. The orchestral soundtrack by Manuel Parada and Francesco De Masi adds to the grandeur of this sagebrusher.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yet another European Cowboy flick set after the end of the American civil War. This time the makers tried a bit too hard to make the film as American as possible producing a rather routine Western though some of the fist fights are shot with a spaghetti flavour. Eight ex soldiers feel the war has ended too soon so they start robbing banks in order to stay together. Actually more time is waisted on shots of them riding their horses than on the actual robbery. They never seem to be sure which leader to follow but one of them is a disgusting Jack Elam kind of guy while the other is a sensitive blond sissy boy. This is because he has a girl waiting for him in a Jefferson city barn. Unfortunately for him she keeps yapping about that famous outlaw Ringo.This Ringo at least in some countries he's the title character makes a late entrance. He is one of those strong silent types who observes from a far with the sun in his back instead of getting involved. For some reason he does team up with a man in black devinately not Johnny Cash after they help each other escape from jail. Still full of themselves they spy on the secret barn lovers for a bit and decide to take on the entire gang just for the fun of it. The Elmer Bernstein inspired riding theme returns as the chase shootout ambush starts. One things for sure the director of photography really enjoyed the sight of galloping horses.The robbers are getting more scrupulous they massacre a two part wagon train so they can put on their nice black suits and go live in their wooden house. Like a group of twisted Clark Kents they rob the same bank in their own clothes but change back into a suit and tie when they are done. Who do they think they are kidding? El Dos hombres easily track the red scarf gang back to their log cabin and take them on one by one leaving the confrontation between Ringo and Blondie for last. By that time this reviewer had lost track of whom to root for. Ringo and his triggerhappy pal never come over any better than the outlaw band and despite his misgivings neither does barn rendezvous lover boy.3 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "Yet another European Cowboy flick set after the end of the American civil War. This time the makers tried a bit too hard to make the film as American as possible producing a rather routine Western though some of the fist fights are shot with a spaghetti flavour. Eight ex soldiers feel the war has ended too soon so they start robbing banks in order to stay together. Actually more time is waisted on shots of them riding their horses than on the actual robbery. They never seem to be sure which leader to follow but one of them is a disgusting Jack Elam kind of guy while the other is a sensitive blond sissy boy. This is because he has a girl waiting for him in a Jefferson city barn. Unfortunately for him she keeps yapping about that famous outlaw Ringo.This Ringo at least in some countries he's the title character makes a late entrance. He is one of those strong silent types who observes from a far with the sun in his back instead of getting involved. For some reason he does team up with a man in black devinately not Johnny Cash after they help each other escape from jail. Still full of themselves they spy on the secret barn lovers for a bit and decide to take on the entire gang just for the fun of it. The Elmer Bernstein inspired riding theme returns as the chase shootout ambush starts. One things for sure the director of photography really enjoyed the sight of galloping horses.The robbers are getting more scrupulous they massacre a two part wagon train so they can put on their nice black suits and go live in their wooden house. Like a group of twisted Clark Kents they rob the same bank in their own clothes but change back into a suit and tie when they are done. Who do they think they are kidding? El Dos hombres easily track the red scarf gang back to their log cabin and take them on one by one leaving the confrontation between Ringo and Blondie for last. By that time this reviewer had lost track of whom to root for. Ringo and his triggerhappy pal never come over any better than the outlaw band and despite his misgivings neither does barn rendezvous lover boy.3 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "I can't say that I'm a Cronenberg fan since I haven't seen many of his movies and those that I have seen consists largely of his later works. I also can't say that stereo was the kind of movie I was expecting since the topic hasn't been the most popular subject in those movies that can be considered to contain any individuality. I wasn't badly disappointed or gladly surprised because this movie was indeed a bit rough. Still the subject and Cronenbergs approach to it feels quite fresh. Filming takes place in an architecturally interesting building complex. The building is filmed from inside and outside but in any shots no other buildings can be seen. This gives a nice enigmatic touch on the setting.I found it surprising how this movie tried to combine sexual behavior and pseudo scientific telepathy by using scientific biological and psychological approaches. The film doesn't try in any point to explain how telepathy is actually achieved but instead feeds the viewer with supposedly scientific data that is related to telepathy for example. functions on how strength of telepathic linkage is correlated on the distance of two telepathic persons how emotions affect telepathy etc.. Things told by the narrator are related to the images on the screen. He explains how emotions such as love are manipulated in an scientific experiment as a method on gathering information about telepathy. There is no soundtrack dialog or SFX only the narrators voice. The fact that all that is happening on the screen is explained in scientific termsreasoning without any scientific justification might make the story a little tough piece to swallow.Time to time the movie doesn't seem to progress very rapidly There are some long scenes where expressions are extensively filmed and some of them are almost funny for example when one subject very slowly raises his hand to his mouth while looking straight forward and one scene where man is eating a chocolate bar seem to last for an eternity. As the movie is carried forward by the narrator the scenes where he is silent are completely quiet. I don't consider this helpful while trying to keep audience interested on the subject. Since visual part of this movie can't by itself tell much to audience and is better left on the background to be explained by the narrator. This sure isn't a mainstream movie and it is also a rare piece in it's subject and style. I certainly don't regret watching this but as a word of warning it might not be too easy to watch. However this movie wasn't made just to entertain audience as later works by Cronenberg and despite low entertainment value it is one of the most interesting movies I have seen from him. If this one feels too heavy to watch check out 'The Fly' as you probably already have though I liked 'Naked Lunch' the best.".

This oddity is real hard to get into and it only goes for about hour but it does seem longer. Way longer! I wasn't entirely bored from this outing but I did become rather restless in the final twenty minutes. The film is shot in black  white and there's real no sound other than a voiceover that crops up every now again. This exhausting narration is bluntly monotonous with it's thick technical jargon that sometimes doesn't always tie in to what's happening on screen and you really have to concentrate to have a clue about what's going. At times I fell in and out of the context but I still had some sort of an idea to what was happening. It goes on to relate telepathic power with sexual awaking while looking into the behavioural patterns of these erotic and ESP activities and signals. Most of the time it feels like the film is meandering about aimlessly with a bunch of method actors who are just performing for a live crowd.

The look of the film showcases the professional eye that Cronenberg would go on to incorporate into his latter flicks and this was his first 35mm shot project.

This was the cold and distant style Cronenberg would go one to make his own and the subtext of the plot shows up again in some way in the film Scanners.If you want to be entertained look elsewhere because you'll mostly be frustrated.

	schema:reviewBody "This strange gem fits suitably in the creche of Cronenberg bit it's not for everyone that loves Cronenberg....Just the ones that are insanely in need of everything he has ever created. Its not because it's a bad film on the contrary it is very intriguing. Its just incredibly slow and the sparse environment lack of color and mostly silent audio makes for a surreal but not very compelling film. There is no soundtrack...At all. There is no real dialog just moments of narration which of course paints the picture moreso than the acting and mise en scene. Set in the Future we are treated to a pseudodocumentary based on the scientific workings of a parapsychologist named Luther Stringfellow a famed member of the fictitious Canadian Academy for Erotic Inquiry. His thesis It is hoped that telepathic groups bonded in polymorphous sexual relationships will form a socially stabilizing replacement for the obsolescent family unit. The subjects will be seven young volunteers who will submit to experimental brain surgery to endow them with telepathic abilities and quench their ability to speak and be recorded daily. The film serves as a record of said experiment. This is where the film kinda falls down. The film gives us some interesting characters to watch but their silence doesn't allow us to really know sympathize with them. Its like watching an acting class exercise in emoting or mugging. A pantomime this complex needs some form of interpretive audio. While it is interesting to watch the actors go about their telepathic play the drama comes off as stilted due to the highly scientific nature of the narration. Some long sequences that involve little or no narration do not pass quickly and create a kind of dream logic between film and audience. Are we getting what he is showing us? I dunno as some of the action is so interpretive that we could be on a completely different plane of reasoning than what Cronenberg could be trying to describe. Heady perhaps but I think that Cronenberg was not trying to be pretentious I think he was doing what a lot of first time film students do. Get in over their heads with grand ideas. I can forgive as I have done that myself which is why I gave it 7 stars. Its not bad its just not for everybody.".

	schema:headline " Although intriguing ultimately feels like struggling to stay awake in a University lecture";
	schema:reviewBody "Although he is better known for his 'body horror' work and scenes of squirminducing gore the most prominent theme that runs throughout the career of David Cronenberg is the idea of finding an extra stream of consciousness through sexual release. From his serialraping zombies in Shivers 1975 to his portrayal of Carl Jung Sigmund Freud and Sabrina Spielrein in A Dangerous Method 2011 he has adopted a psychoanalytical aesthetic between scenes of exploding heads and killer tots. His dbut Stereo is his student film that is an early reflection of his fascination with psychology made on an obviously shoestringed budget shot in one location.The film begins with the arrival at what looks like a research facility of a man wearing a black coat. As the narration begins to explain the man is a telepath a product of a social experiment to observe behavioural patterns between three telepaths in a closed environment. Having had their ability to speak removed they must communicate only via telepathy and through this telepathic bonding begin sexual experimentation. The experiment is being carried out by the unseen Dr. Luther Stringfellow who hopes that the powerful relationships which are forged through the telepaths  that evolve to deem such things as sex or physical attraction irrelevant  will come to replace and stabilise the traditional family unit.If you could label Stereo as anything it would have to be ambitious. Although the subject is purely psychoanalytical the approach is very scifi. The film is blackandwhite featuring no sound at all apart from the nearconstant narration which is spoken in the same dreary tone as you would expect from a student vocalising an essay. It's quite clear than Cronenberg was held back by budget constraints and equipment and although you could forgive the film's narrative flaws the lack of visual appeal combined with the monotonous jargonheavy quasi intellectual narration make the film a struggle to get through even at only 62 minutes. It would be harsh to say Stereo is for Cronenberg die hard's only as it is often intriguing but the film ultimately feels like struggling to stay awake during a University lecture.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

The story based around a scientific experiment by the Academy for Erotic Inquiry into inducing psychic communication through sexual relation delves into issues so essential to Cronenberg's body of work.

Such messages rife with psychological context rummage throughout the movie making it a somewhat fascinating and necessary experience for any Cronenberg aficionado helping understand his future work. Nonetheless this aseptic experimental movie with long austere shots and little in terms of plot burdens the viewer to a degree that a loss of focus is almost a given whilst a fast forward button seems a welcome option despite its roughly 65 minutes runtime. Tiresome but intricate Cronenberg opened his career with an intriguing insight but lacking any interest in viewer satisfaction basically a selfindulgent crash course into issues evolved in his illustrious career.For me personally Stereo was pure torture but the intellectual content is pretty evident whilst being a definite overreach typical for overzealous film students and anyone aiming at writing a thesis on Cronenberg should definitely start off with this intricate quasidocumentary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Due to IMDb word limits Part 1 of this essay can be found in my review of Eastern Promises Even when Viggo enters the low tech world of the East he is astoundingly high tech. In a world of knives Viggo is a cyborg our post Existenz society already producing biotechnological entities. Think the film's cunning ending Naomi Watts  already identified as a butch lesbian by David Lynch  becomes not the simulation of heterosexual domesticity seen at the end of A History of Violence but a husbandless she lives with uncle mother and child postergirl for the androgynous fragmented future of digital capitalism.By intercutting Naomi's goofy simulacrum with a scene of Viggo sitting mournfully at a table the following question arises at what price does Viggo establish his neutral status? Does he lose humanity in the process? Is this loss negative? The film's ending in which Viggo is revealed to be both criminal and cop good and evil but neither gangster nor cop neither good nor evil suggests a profound loss of humanity. Motionless and seemingly on the verge of tears Viggo now resembles Verhoeven's Robocop reminiscing about what it once was like to be human. In other words in accepting his neutral status Viggo removes himself from Naomi resulting in a kind of further androgynous disassociation. By living in the network society of the West you're already atomised and mechanised. When you buy cola from the dispenser you're servicing the Machine you are its corporeal extension just as Viggo is now the limb of two warring nationalist machines. Between one sociotechnological agency dominating the other between DNA programming and competing sociocultural and economic structures that build on this biological instinctive substrate the film says there's no place for human subjective agency. As Viggo mourns I am neither alive nor dead. I've been living in the zone since I was fifteen. In a scene in which rival football hooligans machostomp through a cemetery we sense the film's repressed xenophobia and nationalist passions. What Eastern Promises promises is a new Cold War America and the Eastern World in civilisational clinch in which the West will righteously and bravely undergo a little barbarism a little queerness in order to protect its children. And propping up this noble fantasy will be a legion of little Viggo's socially and psychologically fragmented but better off than the dirty few who are seduced by the false promises of the West only to end up as property at best dead or sex workers at worst.What Cronenberg unintentionally captures is the shift away from Michel Foucault's disciplinary society the film's East and towards a new sort of social formation which Gilles Deleuze calls the control society the film's West. Whilst the disciplinary society operates by organising major sites of confinement family school hospital factory prison etc in which individuals are always going from one closed site to another each with its own laws etc the control society breaks down all sites of confinement such that ultra rapid forms of apparently freefloating control take over.The differences between these two forms of social organisation between Viggo and the film's Mafia Chief are numerous. Where the disciplinary society was analogical the control society is digital. Where the disciplinary society was traditional and focused on stability the control society stresses movement fragmentation and capital. Where the disciplinary society is closed traditional and hierarchical the control society is open fluid schizophrenic and rhizomatic. Where the disciplinary society applied rigid molds as forms of confinement the control society is always in a state of flux always destroying and rebuilding. Likewise while the disciplinary society molds the individuality of each person the control society addresses us instead as what Deleuze calls dividuals identities constantly multiplied decomposed and recomposed on various levels medical records credit cards internet email passwords replacing signatures each identity used for different purposes etc.This is best seen in the way the film's Mafia Chief mourns the way London infects his macho son breaks him down and rebuilds him queer and the way the Mafia relies on codes tattoos and rituals to rigidly build its own people. In contrast Viggo not only belongs to the control society but has mastered it absolutely. He is able to ride the flux precisely because he's supremely disassociated alienated from mind and body.Everyone is subject to the master signifier. To stay alive in the game one has to renounce a measure of pleasure and power to be castrated whether male or female. So though Promises start out with the feminization motif  the knife slice the bleeding vagina the whorification of Viggo the queering of the son  it along with Cronenberg's entire filmography gradually moves to outright impotence. The son is a voyeur can only watch can't do anything for himself can't even kill a baby while the mother Naomi Watts is barren and Viggo has been neutered by the Big Other his body inscribed with tattoos which attest to a false history false tags of ownership etc. Supremely divided Watts and Viggo are the new sucessful mother and father parenting a child that doesn't belong to them without being married living worlds apart without even knowing one another. In this way castration is redefined in terms of territorialization. Territory is incessantly deterritorialized by the unspoken logic of global capitalism everything is broken down and fragmented but always allowing for the free flow of desires toward creationprocreation and productionreproduction which we see in the last scene. The family is nobly destroyed and what remains is only enough to keep it productive.910  Though one of Cronenberg's best Promises is too tightly packed lacking any critical distance or space for a Western audience whom the film primarily critiques to reflect properly on its fantasies.For Part 3 of my Cronenberg quest see my review of Cronenberg's Crash".

The family is nobly destroyed and what remains is only enough to keep it productive.910  Though one of Cronenberg's best Promises is too tightly packed lacking any critical distance or space for a Western audience whom the film primarily critiques to reflect properly on its fantasies.For Part 3 of my Cronenberg quest see my review of Cronenberg's Crash";

The lack of sound proves to be a huge problem as whole sequences that transpire in total silence are alas positively agonizing to sit through because they seem to go on for an excruciating eternity. Moreover the glacial pacing certainly doesn't help matters at all while the lack of characterization ensures that the volunteers for the experiment come across more like distant objects than sympathetic human beings. Fortunately the cast still manage to contribute remarkably expressive pantomime performances as Cronenberg explores his trademark themes of identity sexuality and science gone amok.

While none of these aspects are bad they aren't particularly noteworthy either.What it boils down to is that this short is an indulgent piece for Cronenberg. There is no dialogue and very little action and by action I don't mean gunfights or car chases or even horrific venereal sequences. It's a cold calculating scientific investigation of godknowswhat. Something Cronenberg had on his mind I suppose. Granted the script is an extended metaphor and has some nuances that I'm sure are very clever and in that regard it's interesting to consider what is being said in the voiceover that drives the film but it is not near as effective as for example his wrathchildren in The Brood or the realityblurring Videodrome etc. I could go on but you get the idea.Still for my money I don't regret the purchase. If you're a Cronenberg fan you'll want to check this out and have it in your collection. At this point in his career he simply didn't have the writing ability to expand upon his ideas to create interesting situations or plots but it's still the Cronenberg we know and love.

This film here is certainly a wellmade piece but it's one of those movies that you can respect much more than actually enjoy while watching. I say that because the film is certainly very wellmade and it has a terrific atmosphere and visual look. I loved the BW cinematography and I thought the director did a very good job with the look and style.I'd also argue that the actors do a fine job with their roles but with all of that said there's very little else going on with STEREO. The film was shot without any dialogue or even sound effects but every few minutes a narrator will fill us in on the plot. All of this just really doesn't add anything compelling and in the end the film is rather boring and hard to get through even at just 65minutes.".

He later escapes and people are murdered by a figure dressed in black wielding an iron blue glove with retractable knives. His twin brother two other brothers mother and sister are all concerned about his escape. The police investigate. Lots of secret passages and a sinister doctor is in charge of the asylum.Enjoyable but the ending seemed sort of contrived. Still I'd like to see more krimis and even read some Edgar Wallace.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Blaue Hand or Creature with the Blue Hand or The Bloody Dead really? is another German Edgar Wallace movie from almost 50 years ago. The director is once again Alfred Vohrer and he made many of these films based on the crime novel author. But there is one major difference compared to most other of these films. This one here has a real star in it even if Klaus Kinski was not really that famous yet in the late 1960s. And they also took the right approach of making this almost 100 drama. Other Wallace films have many comedic moments and they frequently do not take themselves seriously at all. Not so this one. And I think it was the right creative decision they made. Kinski is not for comedy. However what they made of Kinski in terms of quality and quantity is underwhelming. It starts off nicely with him getting lots of screen time early on but he quickly disappears and in the second half he is almost nonexistent. Also when I said quality I do believe that the way the character was written was not on par with Kinski's skill set. So it was definitely a missed chance. Another somewhat known actress in here is Ilse Steppat who plays one of the major supporting characters. She also was not too famous at this point but the fact that she played a villain in a Bond movie shortly before her death elevated her popularity a lot. Also just like with Kinski I felt she was underused. The actors in here were certainly fine. I also enjoyed the faces where I did not know the name. But the story really isn't. This is never scary this is never edgeofseat material. And the final plot twist is really ridiculous in a bad way unfortunately. I give it a thumbs down. Not recommended. The potential here was absolutely not fulfilled. Luckily the film stays easily under the 90 minute mark.".

The weapon of choice this time is a piece of ancestral armor a blue steel glove with razorsharp blades for fingers a la Freddy Krueger. Jumps scares and red herrings abound and a jazzy inappropriate soundtrack makes the film feel like an episode of MANNIX at times but I will say one thing there's always a decent body count in any given krimi. Characters drop like flies and no one cares least of all the viewer since the complicated plot's always in perpetual motion leaving no time for character development.Years later additional scenes were filmed on the same sets and a re edited version was released on the U.S. drivein circuit as THE BLOODY DEAD.

	schema:reviewBody "Klaus Kinski is the allure for this Krimi another solid thriller with multiple twists and suspicious suspects from director Alfred Vohrer concerning a series of murders associated with a wealthy family  how they are in connection with an insane asylum whose psychiatric director is operating under the orders of a mastermind after an inheritance. The film opens with Kinski's character Dave Emerson who is sentenced to life at an asylum for the murder of his gardener..a murder he insists passionately he didn't commit and is released by someone who shortly afterward kills a nurse as he's fleeing the scene. Dave's twin brother Richard mysteriously vanishes upon his arrival at the family mansion..Scotland Yard detectives Inspector CraigHarald Leipnitzand Sir JohnSiegfried Schrenbergdiscover Dave's attempt to assume Richard's identity but work with him to identify a killer donning a black cloak and hood..with a hole cut out to see through using a armor plated arm with sharp steel claws that extend..the blue hand designed from blueprints drawn up by Dave who is a successful sculptor of mannequins among other things. The creature with the blue hand seems to be targeting Dave's family members his brothers are killed and sister MyrnaDiana Krneronly escapes near death twice. Soon the asylum director Dr. Albert MangroveCarl Lange a colorful villain with a monocle has Myrna kidnapped often talking over the phone with his boss behind an operation to retrieve a fortune left to the Emerson family by their deceased patriarch attempting to force her signature on a document with her refusal being possible death..attempts to frighten her into signing include being thrown in a prison with dangerously violent lunatics and a padded cell containing a plastic cage housing an army of rats..also part of the punishment includes the release of multiple snakes. Working with Dave who temporarily takes Richard's place as he oddly remains out of the picture Craig will attempt to uncover the killer and mastermind behind the kidnapping of Myrna.As any good Krimi film there is an extremely convoluted plot yielding lots of suspects and red herrings and some intriguing twists which reveal the complex scheme as it unfolds with our detective Craig getting to the bottom of the mystery..who would want the Emerson kids dead and how is Mangrove involved? There's another neat disguise and weapon for the killer the intimidating armored arm with claws that often are buried deep into the chests of victims. You have any number of suspects who could be behind the murders such as Lady Emerson herself a sneaky butler who is always spying on people in the mansion the family's lawyer and even Kinski's two brothers themselves. The film does take away doubt that Dave's behind the scheme as he works closely with Craig but what about his brother Richard? Lange's sinister Mangrove is as much a memorable villain as the creature with the blue hand with his methods for disposing of those who get in his way such as a nurse attempting to expose his corruption or his torturous methods towards Myrna trying to get her written signature. The monocle and his unflinching willingness to harm people certainly craft Mangrove as a slimy cruel heavy wielding a lot of power thanks to his position and authority. Through his position as a director of an asylum..and the authority to pronounce people insane even if they aren't he indeed has methods at his disposal for dealing with folks others want out of the way. Thankfully Schrenberg's nincompoop Sir John doesn't figure prominently in this particular Krimi a goofy source of comedy often standing in the way of the more reliable detective..Craig in this casewith a firm grasp on how to solve the difficult case in front of him. While Kinski has two roles..although Richard isn't involved in the movie that much except in terms of the central plot he is more of a supporting character assisting Craig in catching the culprits behind the highly complex scheme to get at an inheritance. The mansion has a nifty secret passageway which offers the killer a method of travel..and this method of travel figures into how Dave was set up for the murder and the asylum is established as a repellent and unnerving place where you certainly don't want to wind up. The storyline keeps you honest all the way to it's wacky conclusion..fans might tell you that the Krimi genre is much like Scooby Doo mysteries as those responsible are unmasked as the detective gathers the remaining suspects unveiling the mastermind to our amusement.".

It's the story of man named Dave Emerson Klaus Kinski who has been committed to an asylum for murdering his family's gardener. Dave escapes and makes his way home which is conveniently located a stones throw from the asylum and attempts to convince anyone who will listen that he's innocent. But it's difficult for his family and Scotland Yard to believe Dave as the bodies begin to pileup? There's certainly plenty to enjoy in Creature with the Blue Hand  a crazy twin brother a devilishly sinister medieval glove with retractable spikes secret passageways a mad doctor and enough suspense to keep most fans happy. Creature with the Blue Hand is successful in creating that one ingredient necessary for a film of this type  atmosphere. The film has a nice pace to it and never seems to drag. The acting is hit or miss at best. Kinski gives a nice restrained performance. The sets are amazing and far exceed the film's obviously limited budget. Even though the film is set in modern times the sets would have been perfect for a period piece.The DVD I watched also features an American cut of the film retitled The Bloody Dead. This version contains 15 or so minutes of added gore scenes filmed some 20 years after the original movie was made. I haven't watched it yet and based on everything I've read I probably never will.".

Instead you got a reedited version of a German late 60's horror film called The Blue Hand starring a very young Klaus Kinski with some cheesy 70's American zombie bits edited in and rereleased.  The original Blue Hand is muddled and cowfusing as it is poorly dubbed and featuring bad fx the added scenes are even worse amateurishly acted obviously fake and basically pointless.  The two films cowbined create a very poor boring hopeless mess.  Klaus Kinski the German John Caradine plays two roles sort of! although it's never very sure who or what role he is in at any one time.  Kinski fans may want to see this only to see him at one of his earliest mooments but true horror buffs will be bored stiff. MooCow says don't even bother. 8P".

Some 10 years later he unsuccessfully tries to eliminate Barts but in the process makes the acquaintance of Henry Sturgess who teaches him how to fight and what is required to kill a vampire. The quid pro quo is that Abe will kill only those vampires that Henry directs him to. Abe relocates to Springfield where he gets a job as a store clerk while he studies the law and kills vampires by night. He also meets and eventually marries the pretty Mary Todd. Many years later as President of the United States he comes to realize that vampires are fighting with the Confederate forces. As a result he mounts his own campaign to defeat them.";

	schema:reviewBody "Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is exactly what you would expect from the title. A ridiculous overthetop and fun actionhorror flick. The serious tone and silly premise may turn off some people but the serious tone actually works to the films advantage and actually made the movie more fun. I actually think a goofy and comedic tone could've hurt the films in some ways by being a bit too tongue and cheek. The action scenes were well done and incredibly entertaining to watch. The final action scene was actually worth the price of admission alone. I also enjoyed how they included actual parts of Lincoln's history into the film. Benjamin Walker also surprisingly did a good job as Lincoln. The dialogue is corny but I actual think that played as a strength to a film rather than a weakness. The 3D effects are also used very well in the film and delivers a good mix of depth and gimmicky moments and really enhanced the action sequences. I would highly recommend seeing the film in 3D if you have the option. If I had any complaints it would be that I did feel like the film dragged a bit in the middle.Overall Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is a fun flick that delivers on exactly what it promises. Abraham Lincoln kicking vampire ass! If you don't go in holding the films premise against it than you'll have a blast with it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Supposedly the beginnings of Vampires in America and a story about Honest Abe Benjamin Walker as he hunts them down before becoming our 16th president. I had no idea who Benjamin Walker is. Anyone? Yes I suspected but had never heard the truth that Abraham Lincoln was a Vampire Hunter..until now. And now you will too if you watch this movie. I can hear you asking is it all true Well of course it is. Hollywood wouldn't make up something if it weren't true now would they? And yes they are finally admitting the truth about Edgar Allen Poe being a detective who wrote poems on his stakeouts. But on to Abe..as a Vampire Hunter.But first before you turn away from this one let me tell you of 2scenes that are worth your time. The first one is a battle between Abe and Vampire Jack Barts Marton Csokas on horses in a horse stampede. Yes that's right. In a horse stampede. The way this was done was nothing short of fantastic and you will ask yourself  how in the world did they do this? The second one is near the end on a burning bridge the train is crossing. Unbelievable how they did this. Again you will ask yourself how in the world did they do this? They took CGI to a new level. You will be talking about these two scenes for a long time. Kudos kudos and kudos again. The entire production photography dialogues were all first rate as were the actors within. The music was spot on especially with the train near the end chugchugging in time with the beat. Excellent.Yes there is some gore as Abe settles in to become the Vampire Hunter we know and love and his weapon of choice is an Axe. Hey he was a railsplitter at one time. Keep up.Abe is befriended by Henry Dominic Cooper who teaches him how to kill Vampires. But waitHenry has a secret.The main villain Vampire is Adam played by Rufus Sewell and he is always good. And we learn how the battle for Gettysburg was really won. Yes the North won but now you will learn how they did it. Never before told.One more thing finally someone decided on a Mary Todd Lincoln Mary Elizabeth Winstead who is easy on the eyes. Good choice. And yes Benjamin Walker makes a good Lincoln especially with the beard later on in the movie. It's true I didn't want to see this movie much less do a review on it. A friend I won't name Russ recommended it and thanks to him I discovered the truth and it set me free. Now I know all. Will you? 710Violence Throughout Sex No. Gore Yes there is some. Nudity Yes quick shot of a dead woman with a breast exposed. Language Only two fbombs were heard. Otherwise no language at all. 710".

	schema:headline " A Different Side of Abraham Lincoln";
	schema:reviewBody "When I discovered this movie skepticism washed over me. I mean Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter? Having one of the greatest presidents of all time as the character of a vampire hunter would be the last thing anyone would expect. When I entered the theater my initial thought was that this movie would bring me disappointment. But it turned out to be much better than expected and a fun film filled with lots of violence blood gore and vampire decapitations.So in the film adaptation of Seth GrahameSmith's fantasy novel Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter. But before he becomes that he's just an ordinary boy living in a world consumed by slavery. One night his mom died from an undiscovered disease and from then on he's waited and searched for his mom's killer only to discover a new large world of vampires. There he becomes a vampire hunter under the guidance of Henry Sturges who has a secret.However his vampire hunting career reaches a hiatus in the middle of a movie where Abraham is now interested in pursuing a career in politics. In the end he becomes the President of the United States only to have his career troubled by the devastating Civil War where vampires play a part in it somehow. In the 20 or so minutes that focus on his presidency I felt there was an issue with it as it shifted the focus of vampire hunting and focused on politics and the Civil War instead as nothing about vampires was stated during this 20 minutes.The vampires are led by a leader named Adam. Although he might appear to be the strongest I felt that the vampire John Barts killer of Abraham's mother was actually the main antagonist of the film and represented a bigger threat. While Adam had a lengthy climax the fight with John Barts was much longer and was more personal as only the two of them were involved and more engaging. The scene also displayed more of the abilities possessed by a vampire.Talking about action scenes they were all great and fantastic. They were energetic full of blood full of gore extremely violent and dead brutal. Most of them feature decapitations of the vampires and anyone seeking brutality deadliness blood gore and violence should be satisfied with the action scenes provided here. But what I noticed in the action scenes particularly the LincolnBarts fight and parts of the climax was that it was quite unclear. In the LincolnBarts fight the two were in a sandy place with many horses galloping. I felt that there was too much sand flying around and the fight became unclear and a bit brownish. This made it hard to see what was going on. It might intentionally done like that to give it more of an old feeling but it may also be a distraction because you don't know what's going on. The same happened in parts of the climax but this time smoke and sparks caused it.The script was a bit uneven. While the second half of the film was a bit better I felt that the first half of the film was a bit lacking in dialog. There was little talk and there was too many decapitations blood and gore. I felt that the scenes progressed too fast and they should have taken it more patiently. In fact most of the talk in the first part of the film comes from Abraham due in part to the narration of fragments of his diary. The others rarely talk and probably only talk so little and it's only by the second half that they talk more. However the performances by the actors were okay not too terrible to burden the overall movie experience.I also felt there was a bit of a disaster with the makeup. Since the time in the story spans from Abraham's early adulthood to his fifties we could clearly see a change in his facial appearance a beard. We can also see this change with Abraham's friend Joshua Speed. The same cannot be said with Abraham's wife Mary Todd and Abraham's other friend Will Johnson. Mary Todd doesn't appear to change with the exception of very few creases on her face whereas Will Johnson doesn't have a change in appearance at all. His face is exactly the same his hair didn't even turn white. However the 3D was excellent. It takes you and makes you part of the scenes and is recommended although some of the scenes would make the 3D a nuisance. But other scenes where there is blood will be enhanced by the 3D and some of the blood may even squirt out to your face. And the visual effects! Oh they're such a wonder. But of course impressive visual effects and eyecatching stunts would be what you would expect from a movie directed by Timur Bekmambetov.Overall Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is a film that offers moviegoers a fun time with plenty of bloody and gory action sequences filled with eyecatching stunts impressive visual effects and excellent 3D effects. Despite the interesting plot the film is downed by some poor unclear shots an uneven script that mostly focused on action not on dialog and poor makeup. Regardless Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is a movie you should see if you want a bloody fun time.Rating 710 Final Verdict Despite the uneven script some poor unclear shots and poor makeup Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter promises moviegoers a bloody fun time with gory action scenes eyecatching stunts impressive visual effects and excellent 3D effects with an interesting and somehow peculiar plot line.".

	schema:headline " A terrific action summer movie with a fresh visual style.";
	schema:reviewBody "After watching Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter at home I asked myself why I didn't go to see it in a movie theater during the summer. I should have but I guess the reason was that I thought the premise was silly. Too bad because this is a terrific action film. It's very entertaining but I stress that it's not dumb. All the actors deliver good performances. Benjamin Walker creates a fantastic hero in Abraham Lincoln a secret vampire hunter and the 16th President of the United States. Walker is good in the action scenes as well as at delivering Lincoln's historic lines. He begins hunting vampires as a young man with the assistance of his mentor Henry Sturges Dominic Cooper. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Lincoln's wife Mary Todd and Anthony Mackie plays his closest friend William Johnson. Rufus Sewell as Adam is the film's main antagonist a powerful vampire with an interesting story. The film is based on Seth GrahameSmith's mashup novel of the same name. It plays very much like a comic book movie and it takes liberties with the facts of Lincoln's life while poking fun at some of them. Director Timur Bekmambetov has a talent for creating impressive visuals but here with the assistance of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel the look of the film is often stunning. The scene in which Lincoln fights Jack Barts on horseback at sunset is just one amazing highlight. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter earned almost twice its budget at the box office but it should have been a bigger hit. It's serious fantasy horror. I won't be surprised if it becomes a cult movie. It's one of the best films of 2012 and I definitely recommend seeing it.".

Though it doesn't get as good as a good vampire film should it offers a fictional story with a nonfictional setting and characters. Benjamin Walker gives a good performance as the president who believes in vampires. Dominic Cooper as Henry was OK but could of been better. Mary Elizabeth Winstead I believe was miscast in her role as Mary Todd she was too young for me too believe her as an older Mary Todd. Other than that the film was generally entertaining if leading away to boring conversation parts. The fight scenes are done well and the weapon of choice An Axe which is well used in this film. If you like Abraham Lincoln and you like Vampires then you will love this movie!. Thanks for reading and enjoy the Film.".

I had the benefit of seeing this movie before it came out last night at my work and even I felt like I was being cheated out of time and money. I can't imagine paying to see this film. Now obviously I wasn't expecting a serious film. With the title I expected an entertaining film with a lot of blood gore and action sequences. This movie however tried to be so much more while retaining a ridiculous plot and ludicrous action sequences. Every fight scene was either poorly crafted or so unbelievably stupid I almost walked out of a movie I didn't even have to pay for. The plot itself was also terrible. Characters barely introduced somehow become relevant and acting was so bad at parts I laughed at the actorsactresses. It seemed like the only character who aged was Abe characters such as Mary Todd's fianc just disappear and every single one liner from the beginning of the film is repeated. You know that can work. SpiderMan's classic With great power comes great responsibility was okay. But when the characters repeat 6 or 7 different lines it gets old. fast. If you can't help yourself then go see this film. I was intrigued by the title and hoped to see Abe kick some ass. But this film is just so outright ridiculous. I feel like I've said that word way too many times but it's the only word to describe it. Abe goes from a frail and tall guy to an axe swinging backflipping badass without anymore training than chopping down a tree which was also a poorly done scene. I don't even think I can say something good about this film other than the idea. This movie could have been very entertaining had it not lost total sense of reality and human capability. I found myself yelling as if multiple times during the film. If you don't believe me see it for yourself.".

I understand that more often than not when books are adapted into movies things are changed cut for timestory etc. Preserving the main idea of a story can be done even implementing this method without the nuclear meltdown that occurred with this adaptation.I LOVED the book. I loved the way time was taken to carefully develop the characters  story  weave them into coordination with true historical facts  events.I'm not saying this needed to be Batman Begins i'm willing to accept the fact that studios aren't willing to provide unlimited funds for films they might consider going out on a limb.This movie would've been great if it had gone one of two ways A goofy campy slaying story in the spirit of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series which I thoroughly enjoy. Or if it had closely followed the tone  story of the novel. This movie did neither of those. The ONLY resemblance to the book are some character's names. Here are my quarrels 1. A completely changed  rushed back story. What was so carefully plotted out in the book  gradually developed both story  character wise so you can feel for Abe his plight motivations feelings  destiny is now a completely different story with omissions of important characters events situations mindsets emotions etc.  the addition of characters  situations not in the book. It's rushed through in approximately 5 minutes leaving you wondering why you should give a crap at all. You have no connection with Abe or any other character for that matter. I was actually stunned. 2. There's a training sequence that's laughable  approximately 3 minutes long with some of the worst CGI ever.3. Henry. His back story is unfortunately butchered  laughably unbelievable. As is his initial meeting and ensuing friendship with Abe. Gone is his meticulous nature and important contributions to the story and left is a husk of the character from the book.4. And what's this crap about vampires can't kill their own? And how vampires are made vampires? The explanation for how vampires are made vampires is so ridiculous you'll want to puncture your own eardrums for having heard it. 5. Continuing omission of key characters  events which continually leave you detached from any characters or the story. Adam  the female vampire ? name are a prime example of additional made up characters shoe horned in the movie. If they had followed the original story they would have had more than enough material without needing to invent these two silly cardboard characters6. Continuous unemotional passionless mind numbingly repetitive Matrix like slow motion vampire killing scenes. Silly fight in a herd of wild running horses....horse tossing. 7. Silly subplot about silver. It's not ever in the book as being harmful or the making of weapons from them. PS writers...stop putting silver in vampire movies save it for the werewolves.8. Mary Todd was never savvy to what her husband was up to. But here less believably distributing silver weapons out in the battlefield where she could then have a stupid scene where she shoots the female name? vampire who is running at her with full Ahhhhhhh!! battle cry. But I guess the writers figured they needed to amp it up  give her a scene where she does something.9. I'm confused as to what happened at the end. Who is it in the bar? Why couldn't they just have had the ending they had in the book? The ending in the film reminds me of that ending from Interview with the Vampire with Tom Cruise telling Christian Slater he's going to give him the choice he never had. Cheesy.Imagine my shock to find out that Seth GrahameSmith was involved with the screenplay. SHAME ON YOU SETH! Did you have little creative control or did you not care  sell out completely??!! Tim Burton should hang his head in shame too even though he hasn't been involved with a quality flick since Sleepy Hollowwith the possible exception of Sweeney Todd. In my showing there was a group of gabby tweens who literally burst into giggles every time something happened on screen. Most of the time it was something that wasn't meant to be funny but due to the nature of this film was. Normally this behavior annoys me but I couldn't even get annoyed with them as it was justified.So what did I like you might ask? If you're still reading. Well I liked Benjamin Walker as I thought he looked the part especially in Abe's later years  he tried. But due to poor writing and equally poor direction his performance throughout the film is uneven and shockingly wooden as Abe in his younger years.I liked Dominic Cooper as Henry who like Walker did the best he could with the crappy material and direction at least he had a little more passion in his performance. It's not his fault the script sucked.I liked that the vampires didn't sparkle.If you enjoyed or have any respect for the book this is based on I urge you to refrain from spending your hard earned money on a vastly overpriced ticket. You have been warned.".

The effects are good and at some points great. They fit well with the action scenes. At one point in the movie I remember it didn't feel like I was watching a movie due to the amount of action and great effects. But it was shortlived due to the silly plot. 810Plot PFFFFFFT. It's bad.

I constantly watched the trailers for it tried to avoid any plot details in case of spoilers and even looked up on some of the cast members I hadn't heard of before including Mr Lincoln himself Benjamin Walker. I got it the week it came out and I didn't regret it. As well as fun yet exciting action scenes the acting was just perfect from the majority of the cast especially Walker Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell. It also references Lincoln's actual life as a President very effectively as well as including this secret life as a vampire hunter. I also enjoyed the soundtrack mainly because of Linkin Park's 'Powerless' being featured at the end but all the other songs went very well with the scenes too. It may sound like a weird film but to me it's one of the most unique films made in a long time. A combination of horror action and even some elements of comedy and romance make this a big thumbs up on my films list.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning Contains some spoilers but not anything that would ruin it for you. This is not to say the movie wasn't ruined to begin withI don't even know where to begin with this movie. After wasting money a few years ago on another hyped up movie that turned out to be complete crap I promised myself I would never spend full price on movies anymore until they came to my local 2 theater. There was one move in which I broke my promise which was The Dark Knight and I was satisfied but for the most part I avoided movies particular new releases at all costs. I did all of this until Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter was released. I was familiar with the story ever since the book was released many months earlier and I finally get around to getting the book the Saturday after the movie release and completed it the following Friday. I really loved the book and while a fictional story the historical information in the book was accurate including Lincoln's family his sons birth and dates of death. In addition the Civil War accounts were also accurate in terms of dates and outcomes. The book did a really good job tying in the story of vampires into the real life of Abraham Lincoln and this nation. I was real excited to see the movie after finishing the book and while I expected the movie to not follow the book exactly perhaps omitting some aspects and combining characters I did at least expect it to be much better than it was. On the contrary I found this movie to be quite insulting and terribly done. Once again a Hollywood movie jumps the shark and completes an utter disaster of overdone action scenes needless characters and an unbelievable story. Its one thing to deviate a little from the book but its a complete other thing to throw all of the things that made the book great out of the window and replace it with a steaming pile of crap such as this. The book was tortured butchered and beheaded just as the unfortunate vampires Lincoln would encounter and destroy during his life.It only took 10 minutes into the movie to realize that this was going to be a disaster. The only thing they got sort of right was the death of Abraham's mother when he was a little boy but from that point on everything was completely different. I don't mind the story being changed somewhat but if you are going to change something at least make it worthwhile. The producers were so preoccupied with creating needless and overdone action scenes they completely threw historical accuracy out the window. Without giving away too many spoilers I must point out that the date of death of Thomas Lincoln Abe's father was wrong in the movie the movie also completely ignored Robert Todd Eddie and Thomas Tad Lincoln. Lincoln's other 3 sons. Henry who was Lincoln's mysterious and one of his strongest allies in the book was reduced so some young Tom Cruise like character who was weak unconvincing and boring. Mary Todd Lincoln who was psychologically weak in the book and in real life and understandably so due to the death of her sons turned into some powerful Joan of Arc wanna be which was also unconvincing. The movie also added two completely unnecessary main antagonists who were not in the book. These characters were your typical Hollywood ahole badaes and added NOTHING to the story except to make it even worse than it already was. The story itself jumped around so much and seemed the producers' only goal was to rush through the back stories just so they could get to more action scenes. I could go on all day of how many things I hated about this movie but I will end my many gripes here and only say that the final action scene was complete crap but what should I expect I suppose. I guess it was my fault for expecting a quality movie when I should know by now Hollywood treats us American viewers as mindless Neanderthals who can only respond to nonstop action and cheesy overdone special effects and constant violence. This is not to say that the book wasn't violent but I found the violence in the book to be much more believable than the movie which would just splash CGI blood every time Lincoln encountered a vampire.I guess if you are a teenager who hasn't read the book or one who can't yet appreciate what it takes to make a movie both exciting and thought provoking will absolutely love this movie. Older people on the other hand I suspect will find this movie quite insulting not only to the book but to American history in general. As the crowd sat in complete silence probably as disappointed and shocked as I was on how bad this movie was I saw on the screen that one of the executive producers was Seth GrahameSmith the author of the book. Such irony and such a shame that he can write such a good book but then contribute to a disaster like this. I'm going to try my best to wipe this movie completely out my mind and from this point on I will repromise myself not watch another movie in the theater until it comes to the 2 theater.I don't give out 1 star review for anything too often but I really can't find any redeeming quality that would push it up to two stars. So I will leave it at one. Probably not the worst movie I've seen but its pretty close.".

I was hoping since the screenwriter and the Author of the book is the same person a fan of the book may become a fan of the movie. I doubt I would have seen this otherwise and now after seeing this movie I wish I hadn't. I was at first disappointed but after milling it around for a day I am actually a little upset. Mr. Seth GrahmeSmith. why when you have such an opportunity to do a film from book justice did you totally screw this one up? The only character that slightly resembles a character from a fantastically written book is Abraham Lincoln. Henry comes off as weak when he tried to talk president Lincoln out of fighting the civil war He was actually a driving force for the civil war. And Adam where did he come from? where was Edgar Allen Poe? and vampires could kill other vampires. in the end of the book when Abraham Lincoln is still around during the JFK presidency he is still killing vampires. and in the movie Lincoln is supernatural. but in the book he trained very hard and still was only able to kill one vampire at a time and usually with help and the element of surprise. but yet now he is able to hack them down while running on the backs of horses I know vampires aren't real so I shouldn't expect too much realism but how is it a vampire can grab a horse running full speed and toss him at a mortal man and not kill said man. and then when they are grappling how is it that this same horse heaving vampire should struggle at all to bite Abraham's head off just ridiculous. you never understand why Abraham Lincoln has such a hatred for vampires it would help if you could add that vampires killed is grandfather his mother his sister his first love his boys and were responsible for missing children all up and down the Mississippi river all of those things happened before Lincoln even knew about them harvesting slaves. I could go on for days. suffice th to say if you like a good slasher film. put this one down on your list with the likes of all the scream movies chainsaw massacre Halloween Friday the 13th nightmare on elm street etc...".

And Adam where did he come from? where was Edgar Allen Poe? and vampires could kill other vampires. in the end of the book when Abraham Lincoln is still around during the JFK presidency he is still killing vampires. and in the movie Lincoln is supernatural. but in the book he trained very hard and still was only able to kill one vampire at a time and usually with help and the element of surprise. but yet now he is able to hack them down while running on the backs of horses I know vampires aren't real so I shouldn't expect too much realism but how is it a vampire can grab a horse running full speed and toss him at a mortal man and not kill said man. and then when they are grappling how is it that this same horse heaving vampire should struggle at all to bite Abraham's head off just ridiculous. you never understand why Abraham Lincoln has such a hatred for vampires it would help if you could add that vampires killed is grandfather his mother his sister his first love his boys and were responsible for missing children all up and down the Mississippi river all of those things happened before Lincoln even knew about them harvesting slaves. I could go on for days. suffice th to say if you like a good slasher film. put this one down on your list with the likes of all the scream movies chainsaw massacre Halloween Friday the 13th nightmare on elm street etc...";

	schema:reviewBody "1. For those who have read the bookThis movie should not even have the honor of having the same title as the book. There are approximately 4 characters that are the same and that is just because of their names. The storyline is in no way similar to the book. All movies that are based on book face the criticism of those who have read the book. The usual is that some things are left out due to a time constraint a scene or two may be added in for Hollywood drama or characters may look different due to the expectations of movie goers...This movie does not follow the usual. There is literally nothing that is the same. The characters personalities and intentions are completely different there is a storyline that runs throughout the movie that does not exist in the book and there is a main character in the movie that Does Not exist in the book. It is a disgrace that the author of the book would create a screenplay that does not only do injustice to the book but is Not even similar to the book. 2. For those who have not read the bookIf you have not read the book then storyline does not matter near as much because you don't know what happened. From a movie standpoint the acting is subpar the CGI is Terrible and the production of which I was sadly disappointed in Tim Burton was choppy and looks like it could have been done by a high school student. All in all it is a movie that is not worthing watching let alone pay for. Disappointing.".

The lead actor was really above average and the rest of the cast was honestly just as good. I don't know what else to say but this is a Bloody Good Time at the movies if you just suspend your disbelief at the door. This movie is very fast paced and the action was plentiful. Now this is a story that is a fantasy but just like the novel incorporates many true aspects of history but once again it is about vampires. The villains are also ugly creepy scary and not like the beauties from Twilight. Well I'm no expert but I hope that this helps someone someplace. Thanks!".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems to be a current literary fad of the moment to take an old classic and reinvent it with a deliciously twisted element of modern horror. Recent bestsellers include Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters and Android Karenina. Apparently noone has yet thought of 'Robinson Gruesome' or 'Uncle Tom's Cabin in the Woods' but it's surely just a matter of time. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is from the pen of Seth GrahameSmith  his other notable mashup of classic literature history and horror fiction is the fabulously titled Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. Word is that the book is pretty good but sadly the film version of it is a huge disappointment that's HUGE with block capitals just in case you're not getting the message. It opts for style over content unfortunately the style is a horrible mishmash of absurd CGI mayhem dumb dialogue and plottingbynumbers. It's almost as if Smith's technique for adapting the screenplay was to link a set of postit notes together with bits of string each one containing an idea for a spectacular set piece. What noone seems to have told him is that set pieces are only truly exciting and enjoyable if you build them around a story and characters worth caring for. There's nothing of that sort here.Young Abraham Lincoln watches his mother die from an illness which baffles the doctors called upon to save her. He keeps to himself the fact that he witnessed a local plantation owner named Jack Barts Marton Csokas attacking her in the night apparently feasting on her blood. Years later a grown up Abe Benjamin Walker decides to take vengeance by killing Barts. He shoots him late one night on the dockside only to find that he simply gets up uninjured and transforms before his eyes into a demonic monster. Abe is rescued from certain death by the arrival of Henry Sturgess Dominic Cooper a charismatic stranger who seems to know more than he should about the strange goingson in the neighbourhood. Sturgess tells Abe that the country is awash with vampires and teaches him how to fight against them. Armed with an axe and ready to get stuck into his new line of work Abe moves to the town of Springfield Illinois where he soon slays his first vampire. It isn't long before his vampire hunting antics catch the attention of undead master Adam Rufus Sewell a millenniaold monster who runs a plantation in the Deep South and has an army of vampires at his beck and call.Almost nothing about Timur Bekmambetov's film works. What kills it more than anything is the fact that the plot is handled with a misplaced sense of seriousness. Sometimes a movie cries out for a lightness of touch a tongueincheek approach if you like and this one needs it more than most. However instead of embracing the silliness of everything that's going on and using it to its advantage the film is played in deadly earnest. The performances are terrible but this is hardly surprising given some of the awful dialogue the actors are required to deliver. Visually the whole thing is rather ugly too with a saturated tone which is presumably meant to evoke times gone by but only succeeds in offending the eye.Two stars then for the intriguing title and for presenting a fairly original concept but in terms of final execution this movie is a train wreck of considerable magnitude. It looks likely that Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter will be remembered as the worst blockbuster of 2012's summer season.".

	schema:reviewBody "In New York City John is getting old but won't admit it and he is determined to play handball against Paco. But that one last game is too much for him and he falls over dead.John's family not only has to deal with the loss but also the realization that his business was in trouble and the family is broke. Everyone will have to take a job to keep the family from losing the house. Son Henry wants to be the breadwinner so his mother Grace will not have to work but he is in nursing school. Education will have to wait.Henry's Uncle Colin works as a doorman at 1500 5th Avenue so he gets Henry a job as a doorman. George the supervisor is very demanding and expects Henry to do everything right. This means no relationships with the tenants but treat them nice. Still after Henry starts work Henry and Scarlett notice each other right away.Henry works alongside Raul who does as little as he can get away with and he seems to date a lot of women. Ultimately he shows he cares.There are a couple of funny scenes involving an unsupervised kid with money and a pair of hookers. Henry should have been more careful.Henry develops a relationship with Scarlett as he makes deliveries to the penthouse apartment. Even though she has a boyfriend Buck is a rich drunk. At Scarlett's birthday party Henry even gets called on to use his nursing skills to save a life. And it's not the only time his nursing skills get used a gay couple has a dog who gets away from them and almost dies.When Scarlett's mother finds out about Henry she is not happy. Her husband Phillip though is more accepting.So will this Romeo and Juliet romance work out? Sarah Roemer is so pretty and easy to like. She's just perfect for the role of Scarlett. And the character is very patient and accepting of others who are different.On the other hand Mimi Rogers does what she does best a conceited but not necessarily mean rich person who wants only the best for her daughter.Joseph Cross makes a very good lead. He's easy to like and very determined.Annette O'Toole does a very good job as Henry's mother. Those who know her as the allAmerican mother of Clark Kent may not be pleased at what she ends up doing but she is still very much like what she was on Smallville. Only with a New Yawk accent.Rachael Leigh Cook is tough and independent and won't take attitude from anyone. I didn't like her as Henry's sister but she is very good.Whether you like him or not Joe Pantoliano does show talent here.Snoop Dogg is also quite good.It's a pleasant romantic comedy.".

An independent film that has cross over potential similar to 2002's Roger Dodger. The film has strong cinematography and is acted very well by the whole cast Joseph Cross very likable and charming Sarah Roemer strong presence and you care for her Rachael Leigh Cook fantastic support Joe Pantoliano always gives a committed performance Mimi Rogers made a snob totally believable Jim Piddock funny Snoop Dogg! played the reality very well and Annette O'Toole has a superb moment toward the end of the film. The production also has some cool alternative rock song tracks leaving you in a good mood. The only other nit picky criticism in my opinion is perhaps the repeat of too many shots establishing locations though I love to see New York on film and an unnecessary epilogue during the final credit sequence.But I think this simply told story has a sweet and realistic approach to an issue that one might think doesn't seem relevant in these times but shows and reminds you that in fact  though this movie has a preferred ending  still retains it's importance in this day and age giving the film a sympathetic struggle and a deeper conflict.Great job I recommend it!".

He does the same thing with a flower delivery guy.There is a scene where a dog gets killed in an elevator accident which should have beheaded the dog ... he saves it by giving it mouthtomouth? ... but when a homosexual kisses him to thank him he wipes his face and is repulsed. It was inappropriate for the guy to kiss him on the lips ... but the scene just comes across as Homophobic.In numerous scenes what the Lead does is creepy ... a Janitor is sleeping and he puts his hand on the Janitor's chest and puts his ear by his mouth ... the Janitor wakes up and freaks out that some stranger is touching him as would most people. The Lead then tells him he is a nurse and the Janitor has breathing problems ... and then walks away what a HEAD GAME! Then there is a scene were his Nursing School Dean asks him to hand her a plastic model of a vagina and he hands her the rectum instead a seriously bad Nurse ... but he makes a freaked out face when touching the plastic vagina and later does the same with plastic testicles? If plastic body parts freak him out ... do not be a nurse. The real ones are much scarier ... LOLWhen two Prostitutes show up to service a 12 year old boy that he had promised to watch out for while the child's parents were away ... he does not freak out and lets them up?!?! ... but when their Pimp shows up he lets him in the Lobby ...

This script is so bad I spent most of the film wondering why decent actors like Mimi Rogers Joe Pantoliano and Snoop Dog would agree to filming this. What kind of audience was this written for? It strives to be so innocent and charming but has no problem slipping in a cocaine scene an fbomb and even a porn shop surprise. There is an important message in this film about not defining yourself by your ocupation or with simple labels yet the film makes terrible jokes with flamboyant gays prostitutes and a bitter East Indian cab driver. One thing that this movie did teach me is that working in a porn shop is fine but being a hooker is the bottom. Got it.".

Story that may not matter to others but important nonetheless.This is a story of a middle class family whose world fallen apart because the breadwinner of the family died of old age and left them with no assets and full of debt. So the lead cast has to be the breadwinner now and he got a job as a doorman. He has to stop his study as a nurse for a while because he needs to take care of his family.That's where the story revolves. Of him of his career and the people around him. Of the tenants and of his boss and get this Snoop Dogg! Overall this film is as good as it gets though at times it seems a little slow but if it goes any faster it'll be as good as this. And I agreed that have you watched the trailer first you'd have an idea about how the story goes. But there is more to that and watching the whole film is not a bad idea after all.".

The whole film has a light feel and being generally predictable throughout you're never really in any doubt about the final outcome of... well everything. End quote.In my opinion this is Complete rubbish this film was one of a kind. And not all films are to be thrillers. They are all not supposed to be nonsuspecting of the end some films are easier to read than others Reviewing the SixthSense I doubt you expected that Mel was dead or how about Orphan that young girl was not a older woman. In real life that young girl was portrayed as a older woman portraying a young girl these are movies that you should rate the thrill and suspension on and definitely do not rate trailers. Young aspiring directors put them together for practice. You should know that the real Directors do not make them unless it's some over budget movie where major actors and actresses are starring then they budget for sequence's of things that could happen in the movie that never appear in the film but are used to bring in the audiences. Falling Up was a refreshing midtwenties college flick they depict a honest genuine young man. It was a good movie. A movie that morally shows what a real man should be in this day in age and this is coming from a 24 year old man white male out of a lower middle class that has not been emerged in the moral circumspect that most have innately been inherited but a realization of what a real man is to me was defined while watching Falling Up And in addition Men feel like they have to be a chieftain or controllers or they aren't real Men when in fact over 40 of men Are and Stay Obedient to there spouse. Because a real Man for 1Listen's for 2Compromise's and for 3Keeps Quite when there is an issue that is of a importance to there partner. Under 60 of men Are not EVER obedient! are not ever 'Let alone' Stay obedient to there partners. The men that think that they are Man. They can not Listen Compromise or Keep Quite they are not men and this all goes back to what are founding Fathers and ancestor marked and deemed what makes men A Man! And it is simple they are not strong enough nor are they intelligent enough for self restraint. To not need to hear themselves speak and to listen to someone else. To be strong enough to devour deliberate dexterous and sagacious comments and to acquiesce when told to to contravene what they have to say despite what they believe in and without contemplation of what is what. To have a inclination that is unmitigated from the anterior of the categorical countenance. To be strong enoughor Man enough haha to not get what they want. To realize in life life itself should be the object and the only object of your desire. Material objects have no importance or significance. To negotiate To compromise with what someone else needsor wants. It is hard to give up the gift of your needsor wants to give up a piece of your happiness to a stranger No it's not giving up your happiness it is distributing it. It is more sacred than sharing the divine holy spirit Empathy a Human gift for women and men alike to share with each other. Empathy separates us from the beasts so find and use empathy more to separate us from them. Compromise to complect everything. And finally to be a real Man's Man not just one of the men but a Man that is worthy. The power to Keep Quite to find the strength in silence many can say they have the aptitude to remain quite but they say it with there words. Most that can find this sovereign state will never break there censorship for you if what your saying matters to you. And with unprejudice opinions. Not necessarily homogeneous in thought but despite the most heinous of times thoughts or disagreements To Be and Keep Quite. That is what being a Man is to me.NOW!

It's funny because it's hard not to label the movie horror seeing as how it deals with a grotesque infection that spreads worldwide terror and brings civilization to its knees. However the infected aren't the antagonists here. Once you've been infected you're basically already dead.Ultimately I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. After reading other comments here it seems the general consensus is that the pace is too sluggish. I'd have to agree that it was a long 90 minutes but as someone who is prone to falling asleep during movies especially after an 8 hour shift my interest was effortlessly sustained throughout the movie.The production values here are top notch. I was never bothered by bad acting or at least too bad. The cast fit my tastes maybe only falling short with Piper Perabo but that would only be nitpicking. The photography wasn't jawdropping or even slightly innovative but it was still more than adequate.What actually impressed me most was the writing. There are some real gems in there but mentioning them would be spoiling some great scenes. I seemed to sense some antireligious or religious undertones however I honestly can't decide which. I suppose that's what I liked so much about it the morality was left quite vague.Anyway a solid effort. It's possibly lacking some more gore and action but that also could have just made it tasteless. I would recommend this to anyone who's a fan of biological horror but I'd say ultimately you should see it for the story and not the action.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite its premise Carriers is not a zombie movie there is a hint that this may be a possible outcome of the unspecified disease but it's quickly dropped. It's not even a horror movie. There are a few tense moments but overall the film is a tragedy.Four young people are traveling together after most of humanity is wiped out after an unexplained outbreak of a fatal and highly contagious disease Danny Lou Taylor Pucci a wouldbe Yale student if it weren't for the epidemic his brother Brian Chris Pine who's a selfproclaimed jerk Brian's girlfriend Bobby Piper Perabo and another friend Kate Emily VanCamp. They're all trying to get to the beach where Danny and Brian vacationed together as kids. To do that they're following three of Brian's rules The infected are already dead and they can't be helped. Always wear a mask around the infected. Wipe anything down that the infected have touched within the last 24 hours.Carriers is interesting because it explores something that movies of this ilk leave as an afterthought how would you function when society has completely vanished? No government no jobs no politics? The only rule here is to survive at any cost. It's an interesting question and filmmaking brothers Alex and David Pastor pose a few interesting conclusions.The acting is solid although the characters are only as interesting as the actors who play them. Chris Pine is making a name for himself as the guy who's a complete dick on the surface but with a heart underneath. Think the beginning of his performance in Star Trek taken to the next level. Lou Taylor Pucci who burst onto the indie film circuit with his performance in Thumbsucker unseen by me is also good as the brother who is straddling the line between compassion and selfish survival. Piper Pearabo is good as Bobby whose compassion for others can get her into trouble. Unfortunately Emily VanCamp who was terrific in Black Irish doesn't have much to do. Special note has to go to Christopher Meloni who manages to tug the heart as the father of a sick little girl and his daughter is adorable as well.The problem with this film is I wanted more. I wanted to see more of the little things that people would do without any rules. The film is a very short 87 minutes so it had some time to spare. This would allow for some character development which would make this a lot more effective.It's a movie to watch if it's on TV or if you're interested in exploring a situation not a zombie movie.".

Meaning Good but a bit slow.This Movie needs a little tightening to speed it up a little bit. It does a lot of things right! The characters are worked out properly the camerawork is top notch and the acting is very good. But sometimes there are scenes that last too long. You know where the Directors want to go you know how the scene will play out in the end but it still goes on and on and on... So again a little trimming would do the film good!Well and then there is this whole Wrong MarketingThing. At least here in Germany they try to sell this movie as a HorrorMovie. That's just wrong. Sure there are the classic HorrorElements but overall Carriers is a strong heavy Drama. There is virtually NO Action and even less gore in it. Instead there are long dialogs dramatic events and more dialogs. That's fine with me but it makes the movie hard to find it's audience. The GoreHounds will be disappointed by the lack of blood and guts and the DramaFans will be pushed away by the apocalyptic Elements...So. Once again Carriers has great potential but is a little bit to slow and to heavy on the drama to pass as a great movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The key unequivocal problem with the Pastor Brothers film 'Carriers' is that it just doesn't go anywhere it begins eighty minutes go by and then the credits roll. The narrative just trudges along from start to finish without further challenging the audience or without placing further emphasis on the dramatic choices at hand. Which is disappointing as this film had a lot of unearthed potential that would have certainly set it apart from simply being 'just another zombiepandemic' film. Instead it is unfortunately just another viral pandemic flick.Brian Chris Pine his brother Danny Lou Pucci and their two female friends Bobby Piper Perabo and Kate Emily VanCamp are your four typical justoutofcollege kids who are on the road to nowhere literally. After a viral outbreak incapacitates almost the entire population of the United States and potentially the world they decide to hit the road and hopefully find somewhere to stay or somebody to engage with who is free of the virus.'Carriers' would be more aptly placed in the drama genre than the horror or thriller section of the local video store as nothing as note actually takes place in regards to the latter genres. There are maybe two or three scenes ranging from two to three minutes in length which contain some suspenseful elements however the rest of the film is rather conventional. Even regarding the lack of blood and on screen violence after all the central on screen element is the deteriorating relationships between the characters.When the teens encounter Frank Christopher Meloni and his infected young daughter Jodie Kiernan Shipka in the middle of a desolate stretch of road just waiting for somebody to lend them some fuel the first of a few moralistic situations are shoved towards the audience. Would you leave them? Would you help them? The crux of 'Carriers' is based around one simple principle don't help anybody infected not matter how young or how vulnerable they are and YOU will stay alive. And it's how the characters engage with these various situations which they encounter along their journey and this manages to breathe a little life into this heavily deflated film.Chris Pine pre Star Trek gives a brilliant performance as the brother who has had the emotional consciousness beaten out of him throughout the pandemic to the point the where the survival of himself and his younger brother is the only objective. While Lou Pucci who portrays Brian's younger brother Danny also pulls out an equally inspiring performance as the younger brother who is constantly fighting with his conscience with regards to the tough decisions that Brian has to make.If Alex and David Pastor were given the opportunity to go back and shoot around thirtytoforty minutes worth of extra footage then 'Carriers' would have the potential to be a very good film. Instead however we are left with a film so short in length that once we have just connected and engaged with the characters and their desperate situations the credits begin to roll and the lights come up leaving you feeling incredibly empty inside and asking one brief question Is that it?".

I doubt that because the his brother cannot drink and drive does not intend to kill innocents and will not leave his girlfriend to die in the wilderness. So I assume that Brian is utter failure even as a teacher.That gives me some hope for the future. The ending is not optimistic but Brian is finally dead so there is some chance that this type of imbeciles will be extinct in the future. Actually there is hardly any ending at all because basically they will end in the very same situation where they have started. There is no point watching this redneckonwheels show.

	schema:reviewBody "There's a good movie lurking here but this isn't it. The basic idea is good to explore the moral issues that would face a group of young survivors of the apocalypse. But the logic is so muddled that it's impossible to get involved.For example our four heroes are understandably paranoid about catching the mysterious airborne contagion that's wiped out virtually all of mankind. Yet they wear surgical masks some times not others. Some times they're fanatical about wiping down with bleach any area touched by an infected person. Other times they seem completely unconcerned.Worse after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new killorbekilled world these people constantly behave like total newbs. They don't bother accumulating proper equipment or food. They're forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. They don't take elementary precautions when meeting strangers. And after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race they're as squeamish as sheltered debutantes. You have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long... and even if they did why anyone would want to make a movie about them.So when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions it's impossible to take their soulsearching seriously. Their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense.On top of all this we must contend with the dubious acting abilities of Chris Pine. His portrayal of an arrogant young James T Kirk might have seemed shrewd when viewed in isolation. But in Carriers he plays on exactly that same note arrogant and boneheaded. It's impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range.On the positive side the film looks excellent. It's got an oversharp saturated look that really suits the southwestern US locale. But that can't save the truly feeble writing nor the paperthin and annoying characters. Even if you're a fan of the endoftheworld genre you should save yourself the agony of watching Carriers.".

Yet they wear surgical masks some times not others. Some times they're fanatical about wiping down with bleach any area touched by an infected person. Other times they seem completely unconcerned.Worse after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new killorbekilled world these people constantly behave like total newbs. They don't bother accumulating proper equipment or food. They're forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. They don't take elementary precautions when meeting strangers. And after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race they're as squeamish as sheltered debutantes. You have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long... and even if they did why anyone would want to make a movie about them.So when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions it's impossible to take their soulsearching seriously. Their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense.On top of all this we must contend with the dubious acting abilities of Chris Pine. His portrayal of an arrogant young James T Kirk might have seemed shrewd when viewed in isolation. But in Carriers he plays on exactly that same note arrogant and boneheaded. It's impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range.On the positive side the film looks excellent. It's got an oversharp saturated look that really suits the southwestern US locale. But that can't save the truly feeble writing nor the paperthin and annoying characters. Even if you're a fan of the endoftheworld genre you should save yourself the agony of watching Carriers.";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER Although the film sells itself as something entirely different  the story of a group of people trying to survive in the aftermath of a devastating catastrophe Carriers is really the story of a jerk. A jerk named Brian. Sure here and there we are reminded that there has been a devastating catastrophe but this fact is entirely overwhelmed by a far more unpleasant fact  that there is a huge jerk called Brian who has not been devastated or even affected in anyway by the aforementioned catastrophe. The catastrophe a virulent and highly contagious disease is actually of no consequence. For Brian is such a jerk that it might as well have been a giant asteroid strike an enormous tsunami or hordes of giant cockroaches. It would have made no difference to Brian who is without doubt in the top ten of cinema's all time irritating on screen jerks. Brian talks like a jerk. Brian acts like jerk and in fact Brian IS a jerk. This film is no thriller. This film is actually a mystery and the mystery is  why make a film about a complete jerk called Brian? After 10 minutes of watching you'll be thinking 'Goddamn it I can't wait 'til that jerk called Brian gets killed and we can get on with the movie. That guy Brian has GOT to die real soon it's obvious the director wants us to hate him he's so irritating he's just a minor character and he'll be out of the way any second'. But no. And here's the only thing actually scary about the movie  Brian doesn't die until the last 2 minutes! Yeah that's right! Unbelievably Brian is THE main character. The movie is ALL about Brian the jerk.So to summarise  if you've ever wanted to see a movie about a one dimensional monosyllabic irritating pain in the ass nonstop jerk called Brian then Carriers is the movie for you.".

Yes there are a few jump sequences and a few clichd 'horror' scenes where the infected scare and chase the survivors. In my opinion most of these sequences weren't even necessary. Yet the writing is mostly good and the atmosphere is wellcreated even though nothing outstanding. The cinematography too is adequate. The two female leads lacked character development. Even so Piper Perabo manages to somewhat rise above especially in her final sequences and Emily VanCamp fails to impress. Chris Pine is quite irritating while Lou Taylor Pucci carries the movie. Christopher Meloni does a brilliant job in a supporting role. 'Carriers' is quite a change from the traditional zombie flick and even though it doesn't match up to 'The Road' it's a decent effort.".

It's more than just look scared! act cocky! act snooty! Everyone has a real human range of emotion this movie will break your heart at least a couple of times. It dares to stare in to the souls of the victims and the actors pull it off great. Of course having great dialog helps too.The writing and story are very well thought out. This movie has a lot to say about being human. Make no mistake that it is bleak and it is terrifying. I felt real danger and tragedy in their situations. Sure it's PG13 and lacks the horror of mutilated corpses and whatnot but it's doesn't need it it is scary enough on its own. It could have very easily gone the zombie route as far as the infected go but that would have castrated the emotions of the story. It's also partially a Body Horror movie since it's about a virus that can take a few days to show up in its victim and is airborne. It analyzes the terror of wondering if you're infected constantly searching your body for signs and being afraid of not only other people but of yourself and what you can do to your friends. It also explores what inhuman lengths people will go to preserve their survival. It's not about the death of humankind it's about the death of humanity.This movie scared me and made me very uncomfortable but I think it only works if you really let it put its hooks in to you. It's not the greatest movie ever but it deserves so much more recognition than it's receiving right now.GO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATER WHILE YOU STILL CAN!".

	schema:headline " Almost completely the wrong way to start a film";
	schema:reviewBody "Most films especially genre pictures like horror or suspense are initially strong and then fade a bit as they go along. Pretty much every aspiring screenwriter and director gets hammered into them the importance of grabbing the audience right away though few are capable of sustaining that attraction through an entire story. Carriers is the exact opposite. This thing actually gets a bit better as it goes along. Unfortunately it has one of the weakest and most dramatically illconceived beginnings I've ever seen. This movie opens up by completely emasculating its own premise and spends the rest of its time on screen struggling to overcome that crippling mistake. And since this is a PG13 horrorsuspense flick it doesn't have nearly the amount of violence nudity and other provocative material to get the job done.The plot concerns a quartet of young people driving through the country in the wake of a disease outbreak that has all but destroyed civilization. Brian and Danny Chris Pike and Lou Taylor Pucci are brothers. Brian is the older bro and is sort of the high school jock a few years after graduation who hasn't quite realized his best days are behind him. Danny is the younger smarter brother who's always played second fiddle to his more assertive sibling. They're joined by Brian's girlfriend Bobbi Piper Perabo and Kate Emily VanCamp a girl who knows Danny but the two of them are not together. They're traveling to a beachside hotel Brian and Danny's family visited in the past now long abandoned and hope to set up camp there and stay alive until the outbreak ends. As you might expect they run into other folks along the way that complicate those plans and find that avoiding infection is harder than they thought.Now I want to emphasize that Carriers is not a bad little film when taken as a whole. It's fairly clichd but those clichs are well utilized and it throws a few new wrinkles into the mix. For example Brian and company live by a set of rules. Avoid the infected disinfect anything they've touched and you can't save the sick because they're already dead. They wear surgical masks and rubber gloves and always have bleach at the ready. Then they encounter another band of survivors who've taken it to the extreme of always wearing fullon gas masks and home made hazmat suit and it's interesting to compare and contrast the level of fear and social disintegration between the two groups. Chris Pine and Christopher Meloni as the father of an infected girl also do very good work conveying the inner struggle of what it's like to be the guy who has to try and keep it all together when the world is falling apart.I'm not sure any of that ultimately matters because Carriers comes damn close to ruining itself within the first 15 minutes. Brian and company encounter the aforementioned father and infected girl on the road. To that point the audience hasn't seen any bodies or heard any terrible stories of the outbreak. This is the moment in the story where the amount of physical danger is supposed to be established and by extension the level or moral and ethical pressure facing all these characters. This is the scene that sets the stakes and asks the audience to consider what they would do in such dire circumstances. So what do Brian and company do with the father and his infected daughter? They let them hitch a ride in the back of an SUV with only a thin layer of plastic and duct tape separating Brian Danny Bobbi and Kate from certain death.Really? Millions possibly billions of people are dead from disease that's very easy to catch and is 100 lethal. The crisis is so severe that basic government functions have ceased and the world has become a jungle of all against all. And in that situation rather than take more conclusive action to protect yourself you rely on a plastic sheeting and duct tape risking miserable death just to be kind to a couple of strangers. Really?I'm sure writerdirectors Alex and David Pastor could provide a reason for why they started their movie like that and how it fits into the rest of the plot but it doesn't matter what they intended. What they did in fact was to fatally undermine and defang the threat that is at the core of their story. Instead of the disease being a civilizationending catastrophe it's presented to the viewer as a bad case of measles or the mumps. It's something you don't want to get but nothing so virulent that it justifies extreme action to protect yourself. Even if you don't want to crank the Dramaometer up to 11 right away and leave yourself nowhere to go after that you also can't turn it all the way down to zero and leave the audience wondering what the big deal is supposed to be. The rest of Carriers does an okay job of trying to crawl out from under such a glaring and massive error. I'm not sure anyone who watches is going to care.Without such disastrous storytelling at the opening I would have said this film was worth watching. However the rest of it isn't good enough that I can honestly recommend something with such a selfnegating start.".

	onyx:emotionText "Most films especially genre pictures like horror or suspense are initially strong and then fade a bit as they go along. Pretty much every aspiring screenwriter and director gets hammered into them the importance of grabbing the audience right away though few are capable of sustaining that attraction through an entire story. Carriers is the exact opposite. This thing actually gets a bit better as it goes along. Unfortunately it has one of the weakest and most dramatically illconceived beginnings I've ever seen. This movie opens up by completely emasculating its own premise and spends the rest of its time on screen struggling to overcome that crippling mistake. And since this is a PG13 horrorsuspense flick it doesn't have nearly the amount of violence nudity and other provocative material to get the job done.The plot concerns a quartet of young people driving through the country in the wake of a disease outbreak that has all but destroyed civilization. Brian and Danny Chris Pike and Lou Taylor Pucci are brothers. Brian is the older bro and is sort of the high school jock a few years after graduation who hasn't quite realized his best days are behind him. Danny is the younger smarter brother who's always played second fiddle to his more assertive sibling. They're joined by Brian's girlfriend Bobbi Piper Perabo and Kate Emily VanCamp a girl who knows Danny but the two of them are not together. They're traveling to a beachside hotel Brian and Danny's family visited in the past now long abandoned and hope to set up camp there and stay alive until the outbreak ends.

It's usually either an unremarkable remake The Ring being a prime exception to the rule or dull teen centered horror. Few people seem to realize what can be done with a PG13 horror movie. Well fortunately Carriers manages to be an exception to the rule of PG13 horror sucking.The film deals with two men and two womenDanny Lou Taylor Pucci his brother Brian Chris Pine Kate Emily Van Camp and Bobby the usually likable Piper Perabowho are all headed to the beach. Well there is a problem though a deadly incurable virus has wiped most of humanity out. As they try to make it in time they are forced with tough decisions that test them mentally and physically. As the film continues it becomes more hopeless and our protagonists soon realize the only thing that may be worse than the epidemic is themselves. Plus Brian's behavior doesn't help matters either.Sounds like a zombie flick doesn't it? Well hold your horses Sherlock because that's not what you get here. That's right this isn't another apocalyptic zombie flickthere are no zombies to be found here. What it is though is a smart blend of horror and human drama about lossthe loss of friendship the loss of life the loss of family the loss of the human race and the loss of one's humanity. Fortunately the filmmakers responsible know how to work this within the PG13 rating making it a movie that stands heads and shoulders above much of it's similarly rated ilk. The acting is mostly good with Pine doing a great job of making Brian both an complete ahle and a somewhat sympathetic man forced into extreme circumstances and Perabo and Van Camp doing great jobs with their roles. Chris Meloni also shows up adding to the moral fiber and quandary the film has.And the moral fabric is what makes the movie work the most. This isn't a movie of huge action scenes and apocalyptic grandeur. This is a movie about human reaction to dire times. What would one do in a world mostly robbed of humanityboth people and what makes them human? It's a slow horror flick but one that's more about the journey than it is action. There are a few flawsPucci is a bit weak as Danny and a few shots and directorial choices reek too much of obvious symbolism.That out of the way this is a mostly great take on the plague movie that focuses more of human drama than it does gotcha moments. It's a shame Paramount barely released it in theatersit's a movie that will probably disappoint those hoping for a zombie flick but those wanting something different should check it outit could very well become a cult favorite on DVD.

	schema:headline " Funny entertaining and original";
	schema:reviewBody "This could've been just another Bonnie and Clydestyle crime caper but it's more than that.  Bandits starts out as a slick actioncomedy and evolves into a sweet romantic comedy.  When I found out Barry Levinson was the director I assumed the film would be at least halfway decent.  Levinson has a keen eye for character development and that's one of the things that interested me.  Normally a film like this would be consisted of cutanddry stereotypical characters but we gradually fall in love these three characters.  After reading the rave reviews Joel Siegel voted this as one of the best films of the year despite poor box office numbers I had high expectations for this filmhigher than they were after watching the trailer.  For some reason this just doesn't look like a film that would receive 4star reviews.  Now that I have seen it I can't regard it as a 4star film but it's good and entertaining and I wasn't disappointed. Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton make a great teamthey really have an impeccable chemistry.  I hope to see them teamed up again in the future. They have the potential to be the next Martin and Lewis.  Billy Bob especially steals the film playing a neurotic Woody Allentype.  He is absolutely hilarious!  Bruce flashes his trademark grin and speaks in his usual soft tone but his role doesn't exactly require the talents of Pacino or DeNiro.  Still Bruce is entertaining and his constant banter with Billy Bob makes the experience even more entertaining.  And last but not least I will mention Cate Blanchett who gives another incredible performance.  I was lucky enough to rent 2 Cate Blanchett moviesthis film and The Giftby coincidence.  I got to see her sweet charming performance in Bandits as well as her powerful dramatic performance in The Gift.  Just watching those 2 films gives me a great idea of her scope as an actress. It's sometimes hard to believe she's an Australian actress.  How she pulls off such an impeccable American accentI don't know.  I think if I were to hear her speak in an Australian accent I'd think she's feigning it.  Well Blanchett perfectly completes the trio of actors and has a great chemistry with the 2 male leads.  And it's great to see that Willis Thornton and Blanchett all seem like they're having fun.  When first watching this movie I found some of the bank robberiesthough very slick and originalto be quite implausible.  If the film wasn't as charming and likable I'd probably have a difficult time suspending disbelief.  But then I found out the story of the Sleepover Bandits was actually based on a real duo of bank robbers.  Of course this is nowhere close to a biopic and most of the story is obviously fiction the concept of these two guys sleeping over the bank managers' houses and robbing their banks the next morning was based on truth.  Why these managers didn't call the cops while the two guys weren't watching or why they didn't try to strangle the two guys in their sleepI don't know.  The truth really is stranger than fiction.  But the bandits did have an interesting gimmick they only robbed banks since the money belonged to the government they never snatched money from people's pockets.  There's actually a scene in the movie in which they bust out of prison and rob a lady's car.  Willis hands the lady her pocketbook and says Don't forget your pocketbook.  The film evolves into a romantic comedy during the second half.  I guess that's why audiences were disappointedthey probably expected a sheer actioncomedycrime caper and not a romantic comedy.  But I think the fact that the screenwriter and Levinson stretched this out into a romantic comedy made it all the more better.  It added new dimensions and helped us better fall in love with these amiable characters.  It was fun watching the strong and macho Willis vie lanky pushover Thornton over the love of alluring Blanchett.  It creates an interesting conflict and spawns some very funny scenes.  The film concludes picking up from where it left off in the beginningwhich is the two bandits pulling off their last bank robbery. The twist ending is nifty and unpredictable and left me satisfied.  Though this is basically a feelgood comedy that kept me smiling there's no cheap schmaltz or trashy sentiment.  That's what happens when you're under the wing of a great director.  This is not an excellent film like some critics saidI don't think any movie that contains Blanchett's horrible rendition of Walk on By deserves to be regarded as excellent Cate should DEFINITELY stick to acting!but it's good solid entertainment.  And I love the use of U2's Beautiful Day!My score  7 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "This could've been just another Bonnie and Clydestyle crime caper but it's more than that.  Bandits starts out as a slick actioncomedy and evolves into a sweet romantic comedy.  When I found out Barry Levinson was the director I assumed the film would be at least halfway decent.  Levinson has a keen eye for character development and that's one of the things that interested me.  Normally a film like this would be consisted of cutanddry stereotypical characters but we gradually fall in love these three characters.  After reading the rave reviews Joel Siegel voted this as one of the best films of the year despite poor box office numbers I had high expectations for this filmhigher than they were after watching the trailer.  For some reason this just doesn't look like a film that would receive 4star reviews.  Now that I have seen it I can't regard it as a 4star film but it's good and entertaining and I wasn't disappointed. Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton make a great teamthey really have an impeccable chemistry.  I hope to see them teamed up again in the future. They have the potential to be the next Martin and Lewis.  Billy Bob especially steals the film playing a neurotic Woody Allentype.  He is absolutely hilarious!

	schema:reviewBody "BANDITS  2001 12 out of fourBarry Levinson's clever romantic comedy Bandits makes stealing money look fun and simple. I can see it now young influential criminals holding up entire banks with magic markers. Certain things in this movie make such perfect sense we wonder why nobody's thought of them before.Even the casting makes perfect sense. Who better to play a handsome spontaneous ladies man than Bruce Willis? And who could portray an intelligent hypochondriac better than Billy Bob Thornton? Together these two characters make the perfect man. Of course it's only a matter of time before a woman becomes involved and finds herself split between the two.But Bandits is anything but your average runofthemill romantic comedy. Willis and Thornton play Joe Blake and Terry Collins two criminals in a high security prison. As the movie opens they escape from prison in such a way that probably makes the other prisoners hit themselves on the head and ask Why didn't I think of that?Just as soon as they switch getaway cars Joe and Terry rob a bank to finance their upcoming adventures. After hooking up with an old friend of Joe's a wannabe stuntman played by Troy Garity the criminals devise a foolproof plan to rob banks they take the bank manager hostage the night before a heist sleep over at his house then go into the bank with him the next morning before business hours. No unexpected holdups. No complications. Just take the money and leave before the first customer arrives.The Joe and Terry dream of escaping to a tropical location and opening a margarita bar. Their success as bank robbers eventually puts them at the top of the FBI's most wanted list. Things become even more complicated when Kate Wheeler Cate Blanchett runs into one of the crooks and wants to become a part of their lifestyle. When she falls in love with both men the situation really starts to heat up. Oscarwinner Barry Levinsion gives Bandits a humble sense of reality. He doesn't place Joe and Terry on a pedestal and treat them like superheroes he actually opens the film revealing their presumed demise. Although in interviews he explains that he was initially unsure how to handle the material his uncertainty does not show in the final production. He has found the perfect blend of romance action and comedy to satisfy all tastes and styles. Bandits opens with a bookend revealing parts of the film's finale. This doesn't really work. Normally this technique is used when a movie is more about a journey than what actually happens at the end. Although Bandits is indeed more about a journey the movie's structure does not support such an opening. It doesn't provide us with enough information to work effectively and after a final twist at the very end this technique seems pointless since it doesn't reveal the actual ending anyway. Nonetheless Bruce Willis Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchett deliver fine performances forming a charismatic unlikely love triangle. Troy Garity gleeful and eccentric steals all of his scenes in memorable supporting role. Despite the various structural flaws the cast alone is enough to redeem Bandits as an above average comic adventure. It's one of the year's most fun surprises.".

The only thing I knew about it was that it was a crimecomedy and that Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton portrayed the leads. I didn't think it would be so funny and thoroughly entertaining. The idea is somewhat original though slightly derivative of movies like Bonnie and Clyde. The plot is very good it details the various bankrobberies of two very different partners in crime. The pace is very good too though I found parts of the last half hour of film somewhat dragging. The acting is great Bruce Willis is great as the aggressive and determined robber Billy Bob Thornton does a great job as the hypochondriac and very nervous robber and Cate Blanchett gives a great performance as the slightly neurotic hostage who eventually falls in love with both robbers. The characters are wellwritten and credible. The comedy crime and drama was wellintegrated and welldone. I didn't care too much for the romance angle though but for what it's worth it's not a bad one and definitely not the worst I've seen. The actors have great onscreen chemistry and they are wellcasted. I liked the way the story was told it left you thinking that you were merely following the events leading up to the end but then during the last few minutes there is an excellent twist which took me entirely by surprise and made a great ending for a great film. Considering that the film is a PG13 rated twohour long comedy which deals with crime and has some drama integrated in it it's really good. It's very funny entertaining and original. The humor is welldone rarely falls flat and mostly works great in the film. I liked that they mostly dodged stereotypes and cliches instead of wallowing in them like many other comedies nowadays do. I recommend it to fans of comedies crime related films and dramas. To a lesser extent it's also recommendable to fans of romance. Most general movie fans should also enjoy this at least to some extent. 710".

I recommend it to fans of comedies crime related films and dramas. To a lesser extent it's also recommendable to fans of romance. Most general movie fans should also enjoy this at least to some extent. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "Writer Harley Peyton puts a spin on the script of Bandits making his trio of bank robbers compassionate harmless and down right funny. You end up rooting for them as the movie progresses. Director Barry Levinson is brilliant as he makes his robbers become the heroes while the police are deemed the bad guys.Joe Blake Bruce Willis and Terry Collins Billy Bob Thornton are inmates who partner up in an escape from prison by stealing a cement truck. Once out they decide to rob a bank by using a yellow highlighter as their sole weapon. In order to fulfill their much longed for dream of opening a nightclub in Mexico they expertly plot a series of bank robberies. To secure them from ever being captured the plan is to enter the home of the bank manager the night before the robbery sleep over and escort that person to work the next morning. All is well until an unstable woman named Kate Cate Blanchett enters the game by hitting Terry with her car. After much quarreling the duo decides to keep the woman on board allowing her to join in the fiasco. Their title quickly becomes The Sleepover Bandits as a TV tabloid show Criminals at Large follows their every move.Willis and Thornton make a marvelous team. Opposite in every way possible Joe is the sexy strong criminal while Terry harbors the neurotic brain behind the operation. Thornton's choices of his character's facial ticks his compulsive manner and nervousness are brilliant in its exploration. Willis is pretty much the same aggressive man going for the girl Kate and yes he succeeds. Although it's nice to see that macho Joe doesn't get to keep pretty Kate. He must share her after she falls for his other half Terry. The movie takes a turn after Kate professes her love to both men. Now the movie focuses less on the robberies and more on who gets to keep Kate. She says that she cannot decide between the two and that together they make the perfect man.Cate Blanchett is an extraordinary actress but is a bit too crazed in this movie going overboard with her character as a dissatisfied housewife. At times you feel compassion towards her character and at others you just want her to shut up. Maybe this is what she intended but it doesn't make her character too lovable. Blanchett shows her vulnerable freespirited side while singing a hilariously disastrous rendition of Walk On By. This scene follows along the lines of Cameron Diaz's impromptu version of I Just Don't Know from My Best Friend's Wedding.Worth mentioning is the lesserknown actor Troy Garity as Joe's cousin Harvey whom Joe talks into joining the gang. Harvey is an aspiring LA stuntman who ends up driving the getaway car for each heist. While perfectly fitting in between Thornton and Willis Garity brings very amusing nimrod qualities to Harvey as we watch him fall off buildings and set himself ablaze.While the movie is cute and seemingly funny in its entirety it is too long. Cuts to the tabloid show Criminals at Large are not necessary to further any plot. Neither are flashbacks from the ending scene as a narration for the entire movie. It's nice to use that technique of having the characters narrate the movie from the end but it doesn't help any here. Plus we've already seen it done many times and if removed wouldn't affect the movie at all. It would just tighten it. Otherwise this movie is a great escape for the country right now a nice dose of comedy mixed in with a pinch of action and voil you have America smiling.".

Everything about it is great including the feel to it and you simply love the characters.It's about two bandits who rob banks in a peculiar way they sleep over the bank manager's house the night before the robbery holding him hostage and then go with him the next day before hours to the bank take the money and run. Then they accidentally stumble upon a woman who stays with them and they both begin to fall in love with her. Also as the movie goes on the public begins to become less and less afraid of them because they know the robbers so well since they hear about them on the news all the time.This is a very good movie very entertaining and well made and I highly recommend it to everyone! It's also very thrilling for you fall in love with the characters so much that basically any bad thing that happens to them feels like a tragedy.But I also must go into detail about the soundtrack. There is Rod Stewart U2 including my favorite song Beautiful Day and all these songs set the perfect mood for the movie. And that mood is a fantastic one.This is a very memorable movie and in fact the only reason I don't own the DVD is because i'm an absolute nut about only getting Collector's Editions with tons of features so i'm waiting for a better DVD edition to come out first!! The movie itself is a gem.I love it! I give this a 10 our of 10.".

Levinson starts with a close shot of her as she peers into her refrigerator and he captured those luminous wolfen eyes Cate is known for then she launched into an improv singalong to Bonnie Tyler's I Need a Hero as she fashioned dinner for her husband  and it's a showstopper. you sit forward in your chair in anticipation of how her life will intersect with Billy Bob and Bruce Willis and when it does you laugh until you cry. my favorite line from Cate comes as she weaves in and out of traffic at a hundred miles an hour and Billy Bob pleads with her to pull over and let him out. she says i'm not crazy i'm unhappy and there's a difference as she roars through traffic then roars through their lives like a summer fire tearing through a wheat field ...it's a treat to watch her creates such an unforgettable character.i liked all of the minor roles from Harvey dog Pollard to the woman who played the bank manager who wouldn't give Bruce Willis the money. and pink with those big blue eyes and breck girl hair played a memorable albeit minor part.the film obviously falls down with the LAPD's inexplicable lapse in security at the end. nothing and no one would have left their perimeter until the LAFD EMT people pronounced the obvious and then the county coroner would have had to agree with their pronouncement of death let the LAPD know that it apparently was by their own hands and then they'd have put place markers down for the shell casings taken photos up the gazoo and then and only then would those bodies have been moved. and even then they probably would have been given the ambulance or the coroner's van a three to six car LAPD escort. minor point.i loved the film even though i saw it for the first time on DVD not on the big screen and since at this point that's probably where you will see it i highly recommend its purchase. i put it right back on and watched it a second time and liked it more the second time. if Hollywood made films like this every time they tried with smart dialogue great acting and a get out of the way and let the talent work attitude by Levinson they'd make more money than Saudi oil princes.no it's not Shawshank but i'd put it only a slight notch beneath Get Shorty and that's high praise. this is a very entertaining film and in some places it's laugh out loud funny. a good way to judge films like this are scene by scene and i can't recall a weak scene in the film. they're all good and some like Cate's singing in the kitchen and Willis and Kate dancing on the beach at night shot through the window of their cottage are as good as it gets. everyone who worked on the film should be proud of their efforts. i bought it on DVD so i can have a good laugh whenever i'm so inclined and i've been so inclined three times since the purchase. i say bravo.".

	schema:reviewBody "A true overlooked movie Bandits is a gem waiting to surprise people. With a guy like Barry Levinson directing having classic comedies like Diner and Toys another illreceived winner under his belt and dramedies like Rain Man you know you will be entertained. If you still feel unsure after finding out it stars Bruce Willis and two of the best actors working today in Billy Bob Thornton when not playing the vulgar schlub he has lately and Cate Blanchett you don't enjoy cinema. This trifecta of actors really shine together causing laughs at every turn while still grounding the film enough to keep the serious criminal consequences relevant.Breaking out of jail on a whim Joe Willis and Terry Thornton find themselves free men needing money. They decide to rob banks long enough to make a nest egg to run a hotel club down in Mexico yes that is where they are keeping Acapaulco these days. They become the sleepover bandits as they kidnap the bank manager the night before the crime so as to take the money without hostages causing a problem. Just the satirical notion of these hardened criminals becoming overnight celebrities where bank managers revel in the thought that they can be victims is funny enough. Throw in Cate Blanchett's manicdepressive housewife on her last thread Kate and we have some really laughoutloud hijinks. When she is singing to cheesy 80's Bonnie Tyler music while cooking and driving you can see the amazing comic timing she possesses to go along with the dramatic chops she usually shows. One of our most versatile actresses maybe not quite deserving of the Oscar last year but definitely worthy of the Oscarwinner status there hasn't been a bad performance by her that I have seen. I can't wait until later this year when she joins heavyweights Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu and Guillermo Arriaga with their emotional epic Babel.Bruce Willis shows again that playing against his toughguy type is really where he succeeds best. Joe has all the charisma and muscle of an action hero but also the sarcasm and wit to really poke fun at the stereotype. Thornton gives a magnificently physically showing as the hyperchondriac Terry. His idiosynchrsies are hilarious to watch and the banter with both Joe and Kate is perfect. There are so many oneliners that spew from his fasttalking too smart for his own safety mind. You know the hardest thing about being smart? You pretty much know what's gonna happen next. There's no suspense. He also has the uncanny demeanor to switch personas midsentence acting tough and then when ridiculed about his disguise almost quietly as though to a confidant asking if it really is that bad.Rounding out the comic genius is relative newcomer Troy Garity. His stuntman is the ultimate stereotypical guy's guy whom needs to be babysat at every turn by the two criminal minds. The childlike fascination is perpetually ingrained into his features and expressions as he is just a kid in a candy store. Garity's charm makes the role successful and an integral part to the story. Credit writer Harley Peyton for loading his script with so many disparate characters which when mixed together work together like clockwork. After writing ensemble work with quirky roles in the likes of TV show Twin Peaks one can see why. Hopefully we will be able to see more from him in the future and also more like this from Barry Levinson who's last film Envy was so bad it was released after a hiatus on the shelf for two years.".

The chemistry between Willis the tough guy and Thorton the clever yet a bit crazy guy is genuine and very entertaining. Adding Blanchett the mentally unstable woman only creates more possibilities for events.Although the storyline isn't anything unique or even special there are several moments in this movie that really are the result of creative thinking on the writers behalf.

Has nothing to do with Elmore's book.  They were bank robbers in the early 80's who really did rob banks as depicted in the film.  Much of Peyton's excellent script was lifted from real incidents. Do a search on the net and you'll see I'm telling the truth.In any event I LOVED this film and recommend it highly for anyone whop likes good smart writing and amazing performances from Thornton Willis and Blanchett.

	schema:reviewBody "Tim Robbins's 'Dead Man Walking' is a brave piece of cinema. Though the film is about a man on death row and a nun's struggle to help him I liked how he presented both sides of the central theme of capital punishment. This isn't a preachy film about capital punishment being wrong or right as I doubt one's opinion would change on that after watching the movie. But it's more of a subtle movie that tells the story of two people who form an unlikely friendship.This couldn't have been an easy film to make yet he manages to pull it off. Poncelet is a ruthless murderer and in no way does Robbins condone what he has done but he and actor Sean Penn manage to win Poncelet the viewer's sympathy. The execution is terrific. The last scene particularly stands out. We see in flashback what had happened while Poncelet meets his ultimate fate. We see how he and Helen make the final connection we see remorse in his eyes we see him dying a slow death and at the same time the horror of the crime is exposed to us. We know that what he did is unforgivable but he finally took responsibility for that which allows us to see him as a human being rather than a ruthless killer. This also makes the whole tragedy more astonishing because you just ponder like Sister Helen on how such a normal human being commit such a heinous deed? Both Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon deliver powerful performances. We pretty much see most of the film from Helen's point of view. Sarandon clearly has put a lot of heart into the role as she skillfully downplays her part showing tremendous depth and pathos. Sean Penn plays his difficult complex character with ease. The supporting cast do well watch out for a young Jack Black and Peter Sarsgaard.The score is mesmerizing especially the Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan tracks. I also felt that sense of isolation that was brought out in the prison scenes. The terrific writing grips the viewer's attention right from the start. Even though we can predict Poncelet's fate we are drawn into the fascinating transforming journey of these two intriguing characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen many films that really truly made me rethink a longheld position or opinion on a thorny issue but Dead Man Walking is one of them.I read Sr. Helen Prejean's book upon which this film was based when it first came out in 1993.  At that time I was utterly supportive of capital punishment  to quote the script I felt anyone who committed crimes horrible enough to land them on Death Row was an expendable human being suckin' up tax dollars.  I also had personal experience with the issue when an entire family whom I knew in my childhood were slaughtered by a man who is now on Death Row for his crimes.As you might imagine I was disgusted with Sr. Helen's book.  I thought that trotting to death row and holding the hand of some scumbag who'd killed innocent people was about the lowest thing anyone could do and as a Catholic I was offended by the seeming hypocrisy of it.Because I had disliked the book I never saw the film until about two weeks ago when I bought a remaindered copy of it in a video store.  I have watched it four times since then mostly because I am trying to work out my feelings on it.  I am still a supporter of capital punishment but it's going to be less easy for me to ignore the fact that to quote again There's nobody with money on Death Row  and quite a few more blacks now that I think of it AND the fact that like Matthew Poncelet's character the men who are being executed are human beings who have feelings and fears. It's easy to jeer at Matthew on the day before his execution fretting nervously about whether the lethal injection will hurt like a little boy at the doctor's office for a penicillin shot since his victims' last moments certainly hurt. What isn't easy is to realize that while the victims of these inmates didn't know they were about to die until it was too late the inmates themselves have what seems like a blessing at first but upon deeper examination is the greatest curse  knowing the exact hour and day they will die and having to face it day by day hour by hour minute by minute.I'm sorry if this review offends people who are sincere death penalty supporters.  I still consider myself to be one but my thinking has been reformed somewhat and I'm more ready to listen to the opponents and try to make compromises maybe that's what this issue needs more than anything.  I will say finally that ONE part of this film did offend me as a Catholic the symbolic crucifixion of Poncelet during the last words scene.  That was the one place where Robbins strayed from his evenhanded approach to the issue  the only one I could find.In all this was a fine film that made me rethink an explosive issue and I recommend it highly to anyone debating the pros and cons.".

	schema:reviewBody "Coming from the Hollywood couple notorious for their strong political convictions and social consciousness Dead Man Walking is a multilayered and thorough examination of a controversial issue.  With this film Tim Robbins really proves himself as a writer and a director leaving no stones unturned in addressing the many key elements of capital punishment.  In what I consider the best film of 1995 Robbins' take on the death penalty is both compassionate and incisive.  Though he Susan Sarandon and Sister Helen Prejean the Catholic nun who wrote the book upon which the movie is based are against the death penalty Dead Man Walking goes to great lengths to encourage debate and to examine the issue from all angles.  It provides us with just as many arguments for capital punishment as it provides against capital punishment.Dead Man Walking is perhaps most successful in depicting the families of both the murderer and his two victims.  The scene in which Sister Helen visits Mr. Delacroix father of the male victim after he has criticized her for not doing so in the first place is particularly moving.  As the scene ends the camera slowly moves back revealing a quiet and still living room. This shot alone perfectly suggests the shattering toll a murder takes on a family.  In fact this film has plenty of subjective camerawork that is both subtle and potent at the same time.  Never does Robbins' feel that he has to hammer in the pain that these families face.Sean Penn gives the performance of his career as Matthew Poncelet the trailertrashy and racist deathrow inmate.  This is the role that should have won him the Oscar had there been any justice.  A great testament to Penn's acting is that he does not try to win sympathy for his character.  He simply plays Poncelet as is and presents him as human in the process.  I have seen this film many times over the years and my heart still skips a beat when Poncelet finally lets go of his ego and owns up to his responsibility in the murders.Susan Sarandon is simply wonderful as Sister Helen Prejean playing her with a combination of bravery and vulnerablility.  It is also great to see a Catholic nun depicted in a nonstereotypical way.  Just as Penn gives a human face to a hardened criminal Sarandon makes Sister Helen equally human.I also strongly recommend the book!  I have read it twice myself and I am sure that I will be affected by it once more the next time I pick it up.  By reading the book you will notice that Robbins has taken a few liberties with the actual events.  The character Matthew Poncelet is actually an amalgamation of two death row inmates that Sister Helen describes in her book.  The spirit and compassion of the book is deadon accurate.  It amazes me that Robbins' screenplay adaptation was not even nominated for an Oscar in addition to the other four nominations this movie did receive.  As far as I am concerned Robbins' direction and writing are assured and I continue to look forward to his next projects.".

	schema:headline " Outstanding Performance by Susan Sarandon";
	schema:reviewBody "In a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list moreover it does it objectively and realistically and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's measuring stick.  And to add some irony to it all even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty it is not.  At the heart of Dead Man Walking' directed by Tim Robbins is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all and with good reason because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really and truly understand.  And it is what this film is actually all about  Forgiveness.  Real forgiveness not excusing a heinous crime or the perpetrator thereof not saying that what's happened is okay but finding the strength to go on and to do so by choosing life.Directorscreenwriter Tim Robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean in which she discusses her involvement with the deathrow inmates to whom over the years she has ministered her faith in God.  As chronicled in the film what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice but human dignity began with a simple letter from a deathrow inmate at the Louisiana State Prison at Angola.  Sentenced to death for rape and murder Matthew Poncelet Sean Penn was reaching out to anyone who would listen when his letter ended up in the hands of Sister Prejean Susan Sarandon who soon found herself venturing into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience.  And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey succinctly while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality which makes it not only real credible and believable but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience.  Through the medium of the cinema what was once a personal significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean becomes one for everyone who sees this film as well.For her soulstirring impassioned portrayal of Sister Prejean Susan Sarandon deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress.  Sensitive and fraught with emotional depth her performance is incredibly touching and real especially in the way in which she conveys Sister Prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of Poncelet and in reality a total of five since she began.  Whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film Sister Prejean is without question an individual of heroic proportions which Sarandon exquisitely personifies here and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics but rather by keeping it real by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization.  It's an extraordinary performance arguably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career. Turning in a careerbest performance as well is Sean Penn who was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Poncelet he lost out to Nicolas Cage who won for his performance in Leaving Las Vegas.  Perfect for the part in every way Penn has quite simply never been better before or since.  He effectively presents Poncelet as a real person rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes depicted here.  Not that it makes Poncelet any less despicable just the opposite in fact.  It makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things.  And that's the strength of Penn's performance it's so disturbingly real presented with depth and nuance you have but to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul.  A terrific performance and  as good as Cage was in Vegas' Penn should have received the Oscar for it.In another standout performance Raymond J. Barry is memorable in a supporting role as Earl Delacroix father of one of Poncelet's victims. With limited screen time he nevertheless develops his character in such a way that enables you to empathize with him as well as with Sister Prejean as it is through him that we are given some insight into just how complex and seemingly tenuous her position is at least on the surface.  Barry presents Delacroix in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to underscore the message of the film.The supporting cast includes R. Lee Emery Clyde Percy Celia Weston Mary Beth Percy Lois Smith Helen's Mother Scott Wilson Chaplin Farley Roberta Maxwell Lucille Poncelet Margo Martindale Sister Colleen and Jack Black Craig Poncelet.  It is doubtful that this film will change anyone's mind one way or another about the death penalty but that was never the intention what was intended was to make a thoughtprovoking emotionally involving film which is exactly what Robbins has accomplished with Dead Man Walking.'  Regardless of your personal point of view this film will have an impact and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness.  For as we see through the character of Earl Delacroix true forgiveness is not something one merely decides to do but is a task that can become a lifetime's work.  And it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish and you come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like Sister Prejean who has selflessly dedicated her life to helping those in need and to filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon for bringing her to life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known her.  I rate this one 1010.".

	onyx:emotionText "In a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list moreover it does it objectively and realistically and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's measuring stick.  And to add some irony to it all even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty it is not.  At the heart of Dead Man Walking' directed by Tim Robbins is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all and with good reason because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really and truly understand.  And it is what this film is actually all about  Forgiveness.  Real forgiveness not excusing a heinous crime or the perpetrator thereof not saying that what's happened is okay but finding the strength to go on and to do so by choosing life.Directorscreenwriter Tim Robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean in which she discusses her involvement with the deathrow inmates to whom over the years she has ministered her faith in God.  As chronicled in the film what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice but human dignity began with a simple letter from a deathrow inmate at the Louisiana State Prison at Angola.  Sentenced to death for rape and murder Matthew Poncelet Sean Penn was reaching out to anyone who would listen when his letter ended up in the hands of Sister Prejean Susan Sarandon who soon found herself venturing into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience.  And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey succinctly while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality which makes it not only real credible and believable but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience.  Through the medium of the cinema what was once a personal significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean becomes one for everyone who sees this film as well.For her soulstirring impassioned portrayal of Sister Prejean Susan Sarandon deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress.  Sensitive and fraught with emotional depth her performance is incredibly touching and real especially in the way in which she conveys Sister Prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of Poncelet and in reality a total of five since she began.  Whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film Sister Prejean is without question an individual of heroic proportions which Sarandon exquisitely personifies here and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics but rather by keeping it real by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization.  It's an extraordinary performance arguably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career. Turning in a careerbest performance as well is Sean Penn who was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Poncelet he lost out to Nicolas Cage who won for his performance in Leaving Las Vegas.  Perfect for the part in every way Penn has quite simply never been better before or since.  He effectively presents Poncelet as a real person rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes depicted here.  Not that it makes Poncelet any less despicable just the opposite in fact.  It makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things.  And that's the strength of Penn's performance it's so disturbingly real presented with depth and nuance you have but to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul.  A terrific performance and  as good as Cage was in Vegas' Penn should have received the Oscar for it.In another standout performance Raymond J. Barry is memorable in a supporting role as Earl Delacroix father of one of Poncelet's victims.

All the performances were great..without question. But while the movie dealt with the grieving parents vaguely it played to anti death penalty advocates to a degree that I found almost unbearable. I felt absolutely no empathy for Penns character which basically tells of how much of a genius actor he is.But the film for me just reeked of anti death penalty rhetoric as it portrayed the victims families as narrow minded and bloodthirsty which I thought was unfair. It's more than obvious that I am pro death penalty and I don't believe that this movie satisfied both sides of the argument. Don't misunderstand me..ALL of the performances were great.

Surely the answer's not in the film itself because that is nothing but flawless but in its reception. The film caused controversy in its portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and its antideath penalty attitude. And so obviously the more conservativeminded user probably didn't like the film as you can see from some of the other comments. So DEAD MAN WALKING gets a ranking that's nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality. Those people didn't understand what the film wanted to say and maybe they didn't WANT to understand being pro death penalty. So now I get it It's all political. You're pro death penalty you don't like and therefore don't want to hear what the film has to say.I'm truly sorry there are still so many people out there who simply tune out when a new perspective questions their beliefs.Mr. Robbins your movie's issue split people's opinions. Some reconsidered their pointofview some simply didn't listen but you made a very important point. Your movie will probably never show up on any TOP 100 MOVIES OF ALL TIMElist but it'll be remembered long after films like Braveheart or Babe or Apollo 13 all of which were unjustly preferred over your film at the Oscars 1996 are forgotten.

	schema:headline " A lot more than a debate on capital punishment";
	schema:reviewBody "SpoilersThe easiest thing is to turn a comment on DMW into en emotional debate on capital punishment. Let's just put that aside for a moment. Watching the scene of the last gathering with the family in the afternoon before the midnight execution may make some of us recall similar images of sitting around with beloved family and friends saying a different kind of goodbye. The comparison is not that ridiculous and the sentiment is well reflected in songs over the years from 'Harbor Light' to 'Leaving on a Jet Plane'. And the similarity is not that far fetched as in some cases you may not know when you'll see them again. You try to sound controlled engage in small talks refusing to break down. Then you hear 'Now is the Hour' for those who still remember that one in your mind. Among other things DMW focuses on the development of the relationship between two people convicted murdererrapist Matthew Poncelet Sean Penn who struggles to grab a straw to haul himself out of the death sentence and Sister Helen Prejean Susan Sarandon who answers to that call but is not sure of she can handle the challenge. It's most interesting to observe how the camera takes us through the stages of this development. We start out seeing them exactly the way they see each other through the wire screen that divides the prisoner and the visitor. Then the camera moves past the wire screen and we start to see the faces behind them but with the shadow of the grate cast on the faces. Then we finally get the clean shots of the faces as if there is nothing between them. Once we get beyond realism into the camera's world various techniques present interesting possibilities. Effectively used is the favorite technique of simultaneously showing the face of the speaker asis and the reflection of the listener on the glass panel dividing them. We also see dialogues presented in sideways profiles of the faces of the two facing each other from opposite ends of the movie screen. Through these visual images we follow the development of the relationship between these two human beings from the initial stance of sizing up each other to the silent shaping of the final words 'I love you' and 'I love you too' not in any erotic sense the minute before the execution.In addition to the very fundamental premises like good and evil faith forgiveness prejudice DMW touches on many other things. For example there is the issue of how to survive after losing a child. Two recent good films dealing with this that immediately come to mind are In the Bedroom and Moonlight Mile. Susan Sarandon actually starred in the latter.As the depiction of the two key characters deepens we see more and more of their human side. When confronted by victim's father Earl Delacroix Sister Helen is caught a little unprepared and after trying to explain that she did not intent to ignore the victims' parents offers her card and asks him to call her when in need. 'Me call you? How arrogant!' said Earl Delacroix. Of course he is absolutely right. This just goes to show that to err is human and Sister Helen is after all human. For Matthew Poncelet we see him playing cool and tough throughout most of the film but finally breaks down regretting that his tough talks about wanting to join the Nazis had reduced his already slim chance for pardon. And both are not devoid of a sense of humor. Even on the day before the execution when Matthew lights a cigarette Sister Helen quips 'Those things will kill you'.Most of the audience would have at least some degree of sympathy for Matthew until toward the very end when it is revealed that he did take part in the murder and rape. At that point some of those sympathy would evaporate I'm not sure how much but would think a lot. Even if the final verdict is that he deserves capital punishment there is still one question. The prison guard said to Sister Helen 'In Louisiana when we say life sentence it is' something to that effect meaning that there is absolutely no chance of parole. I'm not sure which is the worse punishment and which fits the crime  being put to death or allowed to live on with no hope of ever leaving the prison cell.Sean Penn got a shot at the Oscar and lost to Nick Cage. Lost two more tries 1999 2001 and finally won last year with Mystic River. Susan Sarandon won her well deserved Oscar after 4 previous tries starting in 1981 with Atlantic City a gift of sorts form husband and director Tim Robbins.".

Susan Sarandon actually starred in the latter.As the depiction of the two key characters deepens we see more and more of their human side. When confronted by victim's father Earl Delacroix Sister Helen is caught a little unprepared and after trying to explain that she did not intent to ignore the victims' parents offers her card and asks him to call her when in need. 'Me call you? How arrogant!' said Earl Delacroix. Of course he is absolutely right. This just goes to show that to err is human and Sister Helen is after all human. For Matthew Poncelet we see him playing cool and tough throughout most of the film but finally breaks down regretting that his tough talks about wanting to join the Nazis had reduced his already slim chance for pardon. And both are not devoid of a sense of humor. Even on the day before the execution when Matthew lights a cigarette Sister Helen quips 'Those things will kill you'.Most of the audience would have at least some degree of sympathy for Matthew until toward the very end when it is revealed that he did take part in the murder and rape. At that point some of those sympathy would evaporate I'm not sure how much but would think a lot. Even if the final verdict is that he deserves capital punishment there is still one question. The prison guard said to Sister Helen 'In Louisiana when we say life sentence it is' something to that effect meaning that there is absolutely no chance of parole. I'm not sure which is the worse punishment and which fits the crime  being put to death or allowed to live on with no hope of ever leaving the prison cell.Sean Penn got a shot at the Oscar and lost to Nick Cage. Lost two more tries 1999 2001 and finally won last year with Mystic River. Susan Sarandon won her well deserved Oscar after 4 previous tries starting in 1981 with Atlantic City a gift of sorts form husband and director Tim Robbins.";

And where one would expect a juxtaposition of the brutality of Poncelet's and his coperpetrator's nefarious act with an equally cruel demonstration of statesponsored execution Robbins shows Poncelet's death to be clinical and quiet in comparison to his sordid deed.  It is this type of restraint that not only adds credibility to the work but also power.The performances of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon as Poncelet and Sister Helen Prejean respectively are stellar.  Penn's grim nuance pervades his character as he moves from stoical rancor to the contrition that provides the denouement.  With the incisiveness in which his acting has become associated he provides the edge in which Sarandon impinges her role. Appearing perpetually exhausted she immerses herself in the sturm and drang of her part and counters Penn's fringe with an enveloping emollient.  Even her expostulations and attempts to save Poncelet from perdition do not even approach pontification or the banal.In the end this movie did not change my opinion on the death penalty such conversions only occur via gradation.

The lovely Lois Wilson as the heroine and a young Alan Hale as the villain are much better. It is curious that the Cruze portrayed legendary mountain man Jim Bridger Tully Marshall as an absentminded liquor swilling comedy relief.The ending is strictly Hollywood.

The audience is way ahead of the double minded lady as to whom she will finally choose.James Cruze directed the production and failed to enliven or distinguish any of the much needed action sequences whether it be a big scene an Indian attack on the wagon train or a smaller one a fist fight between Kerrigan and Hale.The film is noteworthy however for its photography and in showing the far flung vistas on the horizon does convey a sense of bigness. Also enlivening the film to a degree are the performances of Tully Marshall as a fur trapper and in particular Ernest Torrence as a grizzled wagon scout stereotypes as they may be. Torrence and Marshall are entertaining enough that eight years later they would be reunited for essentially the same roles in a 1931 wagon train tale of negligible entertainment value Fighting Caravans.The Covered Wagon might have been considered to be a big deal for the film world in 1923 but today this trip put west is I'm sorry to say is just not a standout.

Along the way there are various internal battles as well as dangerous issues with Indians as well as other problems with their journey.One could watch THE COVERED WAGON today and say that it doesn't have anything original to it but they would be missing the point. This was a very original movie when it was originally released and it has been copied so many times since 1923 that some people might forget or just overlook the fact that the rules were formed here for all future Westerns. There are certainly some flaws in the film but at the same time there's no question that this is a highly entertaining movie and one that works on many levels.As I said the film is basically about this large wagon train heading out West and we see the various problems that happen on the journey. This includes a love triangle between the three main characters. You've got the good guy Will J. Warren Kerrigan the bad guy Sam Alan Hale and then there's Molly Lois Wilson who both want. This leads to some very fun scenes including an extended fight sequence that was perfectly directed by James Cruze. You've also got some other great action including a river crossing a buffalo hunt and a sequence where the wagons are attacked by Indians.There are some flaws with the film including Kerrigan not being that strong as the lead. I thought he gave a fine performance and I thought he was good to watch but at the same time I think the film would have benefited from a stronger lead. Hale was wonderful as the villain and Wilson was cute enough for what she was asked to do. The film featured some very good cinematography and I'd also argue that the editing itself was good. The locations were great and while the story itself wasn't the strongest it was at least good enough to hold your attention throughout.THE COVERED WAGON is certainly a landmark Western and one that influenced everything that was to follow. The movie isn't perfect but it's about as entertaining as you can get.".

	schema:headline " Interesting war story with distinguished cast but mediocre result";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is a sequel to Sam Peckinpah's CROSS OF IRON 1977 which I have not seen. The lead character Sergeant Steiner of the Wehrmacht is played by an aging Richard Burton who despite only being 54 at the time looks more like 74 because of his dissolute private life. He only had five more years to live. The story of the rebellious German sergeant who does not support the Nazis has twice refused promotion as an officer and wishes to assist an antiHitler general make peace with the Allies in Normandy against the wishes of Berlin is intriguing. The fact that Burton looks so old and 'past it' and is so wooden and stiff in the role actually makes it more believable. After all such a man could convincingly be at the limit of what he is prepared to put up with and might really rebel against his own side in this way. In contrast to the comatose Richard Burton Robert Mitchum aged 62 seems twenty years younger than Burton and has all the energy and verve of a twentysomething as he bigshoulders his way through his scenes with all of his usual aplomb and confidence as an American colonel who meets up with Burton and tries to facilitate a 'deal on the side' to break peace early. Unlike Burton he had another 18 years to live. Curd or Curt Juergens is superb as General Hoffmann who is part of the plot to kill Hitler and asks Burton to carry a secret message to a senior officer on the other side of the lines. Rod Steiger is also only 54 like Burton but he looks let us say 70 not quite as ravaged as Burton but still pretty ropey. He plays an American Brigadier General but is getting too fat for it and has lost most of his fire by this stage of his career. There is not much 'young blood' visible in this wartime tale. There are the usual nasty Nazis and gumchewing Yanks. The result is a mediocre film which has never been issued on DVD so that I watched an ancient video of it. It's just interesting enough not to switch it off but not interesting enough to seek out and watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is a sequel to Sam Peckinpah's CROSS OF IRON 1977 which I have not seen. The lead character Sergeant Steiner of the Wehrmacht is played by an aging Richard Burton who despite only being 54 at the time looks more like 74 because of his dissolute private life. He only had five more years to live. The story of the rebellious German sergeant who does not support the Nazis has twice refused promotion as an officer and wishes to assist an antiHitler general make peace with the Allies in Normandy against the wishes of Berlin is intriguing. The fact that Burton looks so old and 'past it' and is so wooden and stiff in the role actually makes it more believable.

Burton  Mitchum both seasoned actors spend the majority of the film phoningin their lines  you get the strong impression that this movie was nothing more than contractual obligation for the both of them. The other aspect of this film that we thought was really amusing was the number of times a high ranking military officer is out walking around alone or with one other person in the middle of the night well within the front lines. Who the heck does that!?The other thing we found odd about this movie is the fact that the production values reek of late 70s  early 80s madeforTVmovies.

	schema:headline " A Fairly Typical World War II Movie That Could Have Been Better";
	schema:reviewBody "Though one can hardly tell it this film is meant to be a sequel to Sam Peckinpah's 1977 World War II Cross Of Iron. I one for one didn't realize this until after seeing the film which shows you that this is a sequel in the loosest of terms. While it most certainly is not in the same league as Cross Of Iron Breakthrough is still your fairly typical World War II film. It's also an example of how to underuse and misuse the talents of good actors.I'll admit the major reason I saw this was for its actors and especially Richard Burton my favorite actor. That said the talents of the cast are sadly underused or misused for the most part. Burton is certainly miscast in the role of Sargant Steiner as he is too old approximately fiftyfive if I remember correctly to be believable even as an older Sergeant in the German Army. The same can very much be said of Robert Mitchum as American Army Colonel Rogers who looks a bit too old to be realistic in the role. While they may be too old for their roles both Burton and Mitchum give fair performances though far from their greatest moments to be certain. The movie does make some decent use of its supporting cast especially Rod Steiger and Curt Jergens as American and German generals respectively. The test of the film's supporting cast gives fairly middle of the road performances as well. As a consequence the overall acting quality in this is less then one might have expected.The production values music and direction as well are nothing incredible either. The entire film has a very low budget feel to it from the opening credits which in fact use footage from Cross Of Iron to barely decorated sets and beyond. Not to mention the score from composer Peter Thomas that with a very electronic feel to it seems more evocative of the disco music popular when the film was made rather then a score more befitting to a World War II film. The film's direction also seems to be a bit lacking as well in many scenes which seems a shame considering that it was directed by Andrew V. McLaglen the director of things like The Wild Geese also starring Burton and the World War II actionadventure movie The Sea Wolves. All said the production values music and direction are all things that let the film down.This brings us to the script of Breakthrough. The script certainly has an interesting premise by taking some of the characters of Cross Of Iron organizing circumstances to get them to the other front of World War II Europe and then throwing the July 20th plot to kill Hitler into the middle of it. The problem is that while the first two things are done somewhat believably things start going downhill as soon as the Hitler assassination plot comes forward. The whole thing is setup rather strangely and requires a couple of major leaps in plot Steiner to go towards American lines in the middle of the night at the exact same time Rogers goes looking for antitank guns to get things moving and once they do things don't get better. What could have been an interesting thriller plot instead descends into your rather standard World War II shot 'em up by the time it's over with. The result is an uneven film that seems to just go from plot line to plot line in hopes of one of them taking charge of the film. The sad fact is none of them ever do.Somehow Breakthrough feels like a list of missed opportunities. With an underused  misused cast low budget production values an out of place score uninspired direction and an uneven script there's plenty of instances where things could have been something better. Instead we get a fairly typical World War II movie with an interesting but sadly misused premise. In short it could have been better especially as it's a sequel to Cross Of Iron.".

	schema:reviewBody "A film can usually be judged on its own merits. But a film claiming to be a sequel to Peckinpah's Cross of Iron and featuring some of the greatest actors who ever lived needs to be held to a high standard. Breakthrough is a waste of time and fails in virtually all departments.The plot cannot be taken seriously. It begins in late May of 1944 during the German retreat on the Eastern Front. Cross of Iron is set in January of 1943 yet our sequel begins where it left off yet it's almost 16 months later. We are immediately introduced to several familiar characters none of whom seem to measure up with their personalities from the original film. Sergeant Steiner Richard Burton is ordered by Captain Stransky Helmut Griem to blow up a railroad tunnel in order to prevent the Russians from using it. Steiner's squad fails miserably. Stop again Coburn's Steiner was a crack NCO. He wiped out several different Russian outposts patrols and tanks  with style. It's out of character for Steiner to be defeated to easily by one lousy Russian tank. Anyway Steiner takes a breather in Paris right as the Allies land in Normandy. His unit is transported to France where they occupy the village of St. Bologne. General Hoffman Curd Jurgens appears and orders Steiner to cross the enemy lines and inform the American commanders Robert Mitchum and Rod Steiger that the German high command is plotting to assassinate Hitler and would like to surrender. This plan comes undone and the American forces move to attack St. Bologne  which Stransky has planned to blow up  a plot which will wipe out the attackers and the civilian inhabitants.That's quite a bit to cram into one film and McLaglen doesn't seem to know where he's going with this material. This is a very openended film with little to link the sequence of events except pure coincidence. The script is serviceable on its own but nothing here compares to Cross. For starters this new film ignores the last ten minutes or so of Cross and picks up right after the death of Lt. Triebig. Steiner appears to have no remorse against Stransky and along with Kruger Klaus Lowitsch and Anselm Dieter Schidor joins the retreating force. Burton's portrayal of Steiner is simply unacceptable. For one thing he's a bit too old and haggard to be considered a combat sergeant. He never gets involved in any physical action for this exact reason. Instead he merely delivers dialog with a phony German accent and kills just as many Americans as fellow Germans as he seems confused as to whose side he's on. Unlike Coburn's Steiner Burton's fails to stand for anything he is loyal to his men but winds up killing several of them in order to keep a promise to Colonel Rogers Mitchum.The film also fails miserably because despite a slew of Hollywood legends and some familiar German actors the acting is banal and limited. Mitchum and Steiger are both wasted in mediocre roles as American officers. Steiger's part is particularly disappointing as he always seems sincere but isn't given very much to work with. The only American actor in the ensemble who seems properly placed in Michael Parks in a small but seeminglyenjoyed role as Sgt. Anderson who tags along with Mitchum on various dangerous outings. Dare I forget to mention the presence of the legendary Curd Jurgens who gets little to do here but plays his typical typecast role of an aristocratic German General with gusto despite his obviously forced surroundings!The cast is chock full of German supporting actors all of whom are forced into roles beneath their acting ability. Helmut Griem The McKenzie Break is a pretty sorry standin for Maximilian Schell. He sure seems interested in getting his Iron Cross but theme is reduced to an occasional reference or gag. The new Stransky is nothing more than a typical onedimensional Nazi out for American blood. Klaus Lowitsch is back and is a lot of fun as Corporal Kruger although his character has changed too now he's wearing a German uniform and it's hard to tell is his cynicism is sincere. Werner Pochath Wartime is a predictable pervert amongst the ranks of Steiner's squad Gunter Meisner Is Paris Burning? pops up in his usual role as a creepy SS officer Horst Janson Shout at the Devil is completely wasted as Steiner's company commander even Joachim Hansen The Eagle has Landed has a minimal role as Hoffman's aide. This film yearns for James Mason and David Warner whose characters are simply forgotten in the midst of the chaos. On its own Breakthrough still fails to make any sort of impression. The lack budgetary restrictions show up in nearly every frame. The first few scenes are composed almost entirely of stock footage from Cross of Iron and The Battle of Neretva while the rest feature a tremendous lack of extras and flair. We rarely see more than halfdozen actors on screen at one time and the battle in the St. Bologne uses many of the same shots more than once alternate takes of some shots and some rather shabby soundstages. The direction always seems pretty standard and unimaginative McLaglen who's usually at least a competent director doesn't take any chances in this film. Nothing happens that we haven't seen before and the lack of flair makes the whole affair seem even more pedestrian. The music score is illfitting and badly written. It's composed mostly of symphonic cues which belong in a spaghetti western  or perhaps one of Antonio Margheriti's early scifi adventures  but certainly not an antiwar film! Fans of the cast will be disappointed. Fans of its predecessor will be severely disappointed. It's even a letdown for me and I consider myself a pretty openedminded war film fan. Don't even bother with this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another in the never ending supply of War is Hell films this one is a time killer and nothing more. Thankfully Mitchum and Steiger are playing Americans but no thanks to having Burton play a German Sergeant. Now in my opinion James Coburn was also miscast as Steiner in 'Cross of Iron' but since most everything else was well done in that film his Americanisms could be tolerated somewhat. Not so with the ageing and mostly immobile Burton his growling Welsh baritone making no pretense of Germanic origin. Surrounded by an allGerman supporting cast Burton stands out badly. And worse he's a bore. He rattles his boozeravaged physique through the motions while his craggy scowling face makes occasional movements belying its nearcomatose state... meanwhile his Great Actor's voice grumbles or barks its lines. Then there is the everlethargic Mitchum phoning it in as an American Colonel. His character's obsession with discovering the German Army's antitank capabilities is ludicrous. Sure it could've been a point to ponder but having Mitchum prowling behind enemy lines and grabbing German soldiers just to find out what they might have handy to destroy Allied tanks is ignorant nonsense. Just as absurd is the final battle with Burton's character submerged into a muddle of conflicting emotions and actions alternately killing Americans and trying to save them. Jurgens as a German General need not appear on set at all his performance could have been spliced from footage in any one of a number of films where he plays the same part. And Steiger as an American Brigadier General does his surly overemotional routine yet again... but at least we're spared his usual dissolve into tears. Technically the film is mostly a bust. Unlike 'Cross of Iron' which benefited from its Yugoslavian location and availability of correct tanks from that period this one was filmed in Austria and thus uses that country's available hardware which is the usual anachronistic postwar tanks that annoy war buffs. Only the opening footage of the film which is lifted from 'Cross of Iron' shows the correct tanks of the period. In addition the main thrust of the plot concerning Jurgens' and Burton's attempt to obtain a cease fire after Hitler is ostensibly assassinated is interesting but badly handled. For instance it features a forced meeting of our two stars Mitchum absurdly searching behind the lines for info on those antitank guns he's obsessed with and Burton a lowly sergeant looking for an American to make his cease fire pitch to. Steiger's character is absolutely correct to scoff at the notion that a mere sergeant would be the point man to offer surrender of an entire army AND be privy to a plot to kill Hitler. The only two things that feel right in this film are Parks as the laconic drily humored sidekick of Mitchum's and the few scenes of German soldiers razzing each other with the dark humor of soldiers near their doom. And the music score is terrible a weird mixture of futuristic electronic noodling and medievallike horn blare.".

James Coburn as Sgt Steiner getting on the wrong side of Maximillian Schell's Captain Stransky on the Soviet Eastern Front in 1943 . BREAKTHROUGH as it's known in Britain is a film trying to market itself as a sequel and I'm afraid if it resembles anything it probably resembles a plot device in DOCTOR WHO called regeneration where a Timelord can turn in to the same character with a completely different physical appearance and personality . In the case of Steiner he was last seen as being a cynical character with a strong resemblance to James Coburn who suddenly looks like a much respected stage actor from Wales who's slumming it in a not very good movie . Strangely enough Captain Stransky is also a Timelord . I suppose that's an advantage if you've got several million soldiers in the Red Army who want payback for having their families strung up with piano wire There are a couple of good battle sequences at the start of BREAKTHROUGH but if you've seen CROSS OF IRON you'll instantly know where these scenes were stolen from . You also can't help noticing a bizarre lack of continuity to these scenes . Steiner you remember was a soldier's soldier  he might be fighting for a murderous regime but his loyalty was to his men not to the regime and for some strange reason he is now wearing a dress uniform on the front line and these's not even a speck of dust on his uniform . Maybe his clothes can regenerate after every battle with the Soviets ? You can't fail to notice how crap he is in a battle either . He's given an order to blow up a tunnel . Arrives at he tunnel  staggers down the tunnel no doubt looking for the nearest drinks cabinet  staggers alongside a Soviet tank  drops a grenade in the tank  and gets back in to his truck looking for the nearest bar . All he had to do was connect a wire to a plunger and blow the tunnel up which seems beyond his capabilities . In fact if this is the standard of the average Wehrmacht soldier the Soviets must be glad they didn't have to fight any Italian conscriptsI'm being very kind here because I awarded BREAKTHROUGH four out of ten on its own merits  not as a sequel to CROSS OF IRON in which case it would have been awarded minus points . It is a totally disjointed film especially where editing is concerned where the story jumps around from location to location with little rhyme or reason with the big name cast realising they're just doing it for the money . It says a lot when its predecessor was directed by someone suffering from intense substance abuse and was a hundred times better than this".

	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to rate this film higher I saw it's in the 4's overall now which it really doesn't deserve. But after watching it fully the ending does justify a lower rank so I'm giving it a 6. It seems to use stock footage from other war films while at the same time has a lot of military hardware filmed so it does have some kind of a budget going for it. Plus it has a cast that merits attention so I cannot see this as a war film that rates it's actual 4 score. With that said. Have you ever noticed that Soviet war films are scored very high on IMDb? I am going to guess that's the same reason why this film ranks so low. The overall vote on the Soviet films are bolstered by Russians and leftist travelers that I am going to say give it an overall plus 1 to their rating. Likewise here. this is a film about taking down Hitler in a way so I'm guessing for all those 10 votes the travelers give those soso Soviet films there are many pro Nazi types that give this film a 1 rating. As far as the cast goes casting Mitchum as a 35 year old Colonel when he's in his 60's and not looking very excited about the role is the blaring casting mistake. Burton actually looks older then Mitchum here like an old man with dementia in most of his scenes and is the second casting mistake. Mitchum would excel later on as a Naval officer and that is a role he can pull off not here though. BTW what Colonel's full bird old American ones go behind enemy lines? That's what a Colonel tells a young Captain to do! And hey get a haircut reflecting 1944 Robert! Jurgens was good but that worn out cap didn't cut it for him being a Prussian General even if it was his WW1 cap. Steiger was good also and realistic and BTW the same age in real life as Burton and in much better looking shape health wise. Michael Parks rounds out the cast I recognize as Mitchum's NCO and Quentin Tarantino says he's the best actor still alive FYI so you may just want to watch it for his role which is fairly major. The hardware in the beginning looks close enough for me probably taken from a Russian or East European war film and using those post war US tanks for the Western front scenes is much more forgivable then using them as German tanks like in The Battle Of The Bulge! But what was up with using German bomber footage during D Day? Probably HE 111's from the Battle Of Britain film. That was crazy but only one scene so I can laugh about that one. Those anti tank guns are obsolete by 1944 also and not realistic. The film score absolutely sucks too as others have mentioned so in retrospect maybe it's worth it's 4 rating here but I did stay with it and was overall entertained so I'm sticking to 6. The ending is stupid crazy but overall it was a lot better then many WW2 films from the late 70's so I'm going to give it a 6. Worth watching once for us war film buffs.".

	schema:headline " Steiner  Stransky Together Again.";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS After having their differences in the previous WWII epic The Iron Cross both Sgt. Steiner Richard Burton and his former company commander Let.now promoted to MajorStransky Helmut Griem are reunited and as bitterly opposed to each other as everin Paris for a well deserved period of RR rest and recreation from the Eastern Front.Sgt. Steiner's RR ended abruptly after spending his first dayand nightin Paris bedding down Maj. Stransky's French girlfriend Yvette Veronique Vendell when he's called by the German High Command to report to the Normandy Front. As luck would have it The allies decided to storm the French beaches just days after the battle weary Steiner arrived in that country for his first time besides being hospitalized for battle wounds away from the battlefield since the war began!Doing what he does best Sgt. Steiner rustles up and inspires his men to fight off the Allied advance into France in a daring and at times suicidal holding pattern action that stalls the US Armys push beyond the Normandy beachheads. It's then that Steiner is told by his former divisional commander back on the Eastern Front Gen. Hofmann Curt Jurgen that the assassination of the German Fuhrer Adolph Hitler is in the works by him and a number of fellow and disgruntled in how the war is going German Generals. Why Gen. Hoffman would confide all this to a lowly enlisted man who can turn him in and have his entire plan scuttled is never really explained! It's only assumed that Steiner is really a Hollywoodstyle Good German in spite of his excellent combat record that shows that he's as fanatical a German or Nazi in the defense of his country as Hitler who's being targeted by Gen. Hoffman to be killedis! It's then that for no explainable reason at all that Steiner has a sudden change of heart in fighting and risking his life for the Fatherland!Steiner decides to turn his services over to the victorious allies by selling out his own men whom he's now in command of! This shocked me in that Steiner being the loyal and dedicated German fighting man that he is would on a dime turn on his own men as well as country just because Gen. Hofmann  Co. are planning to do in his supreme commander Adolph Hitler! If anything Steiner who had fought for his Fuhrer so valiantly all these years would have turned in Hofmann for treason not like he did go along with him so willingly.As history showed us the assassination attempt on Hitler was a complete dud with him miraculously surviving off camera the suitcase bomb explosion in his bunkerThe Wolf's Lairin the East Prussian woods. This put Gen. Hofmann in hot water together with his fellow conspirators who ended up being rounded up and shot and in some cases hanged and decapitate by the Nazi Gestapo. In the case of General Hofmann himself he put a bullet in his head to avoid being made to stand trail before a kangaroolike Nazi People's Court!With Sgt. Steiner sticking his neck out in secretly negotiating a surrender of his troops to the US Army he's now in the unenviable and dangerous position of stopping his own troops commanded by his sworn enemy Maj. Stransky from stopping the US armored advance by having them gunned down by himself before they can do it! The film Breakthrough also has American actors Robert Mitchum as Col.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS After having their differences in the previous WWII epic The Iron Cross both Sgt. Steiner Richard Burton and his former company commander Let.now promoted to MajorStransky Helmut Griem are reunited and as bitterly opposed to each other as everin Paris for a well deserved period of RR rest and recreation from the Eastern Front.Sgt. Steiner's RR ended abruptly after spending his first dayand nightin Paris bedding down Maj. Stransky's French girlfriend Yvette Veronique Vendell when he's called by the German High Command to report to the Normandy Front. As luck would have it The allies decided to storm the French beaches just days after the battle weary Steiner arrived in that country for his first time besides being hospitalized for battle wounds away from the battlefield since the war began!Doing what he does best Sgt. Steiner rustles up and inspires his men to fight off the Allied advance into France in a daring and at times suicidal holding pattern action that stalls the US Armys push beyond the Normandy beachheads. It's then that Steiner is told by his former divisional commander back on the Eastern Front Gen. Hofmann Curt Jurgen that the assassination of the German Fuhrer Adolph Hitler is in the works by him and a number of fellow and disgruntled in how the war is going German Generals. Why Gen. Hoffman would confide all this to a lowly enlisted man who can turn him in and have his entire plan scuttled is never really explained! It's only assumed that Steiner is really a Hollywoodstyle Good German in spite of his excellent combat record that shows that he's as fanatical a German or Nazi in the defense of his country as Hitler who's being targeted by Gen. Hoffman to be killedis! It's then that for no explainable reason at all that Steiner has a sudden change of heart in fighting and risking his life for the Fatherland!Steiner decides to turn his services over to the victorious allies by selling out his own men whom he's now in command of! This shocked me in that Steiner being the loyal and dedicated German fighting man that he is would on a dime turn on his own men as well as country just because Gen. Hofmann  Co. are planning to do in his supreme commander Adolph Hitler! If anything Steiner who had fought for his Fuhrer so valiantly all these years would have turned in Hofmann for treason not like he did go along with him so willingly.As history showed us the assassination attempt on Hitler was a complete dud with him miraculously surviving off camera the suitcase bomb explosion in his bunkerThe Wolf's Lairin the East Prussian woods. This put Gen. Hofmann in hot water together with his fellow conspirators who ended up being rounded up and shot and in some cases hanged and decapitate by the Nazi Gestapo. In the case of General Hofmann himself he put a bullet in his head to avoid being made to stand trail before a kangaroolike Nazi People's Court!With Sgt. Steiner sticking his neck out in secretly negotiating a surrender of his troops to the US Army he's now in the unenviable and dangerous position of stopping his own troops commanded by his sworn enemy Maj. Stransky from stopping the US armored advance by having them gunned down by himself before they can do it! The film Breakthrough also has American actors Robert Mitchum as Col. Rogers Rod Steiger as Gen. Webster and Michael Parks as Sgt. Anderson in it as the GI's that Sgt. Steiner is secretly dealing with who look and act as if they would have liked to have been somewhere else.

It really is a very badly made movie. Burton looks miscast here he tries to put on a faux German accent but it doesn't work overall he looks more like a Chelsea pensioner than a hardened combat soldier. I thought Robert Mitchum did his usual thing well as did Rod Steiger even with the clichd dialogue but I put it all largely down to bad staging and editing. Perhaps there were budgetary issues with this film because it really shows and it only last 90 mins so what was cut out?Helmut Greim was particularly bad as Stransky but had to follow the magnificent Maximillian Schell from the first movie. Again Greim looks miscast here perhaps even more so than Burton. Clearly when a film project is launched all the essential elements don't quite come together and here is a clear example. Despite all the failings it still manages to be entertaining because you find yourself enjoying these big name movie stars being so badly represented.".

Anyway without rehashing a plot synopsis all over again it centers around the impending defeat of the Nazi's around the time of DDay. It's basically a subplot concerning an effort by some of Hitler's generals trying to bump him off and negotiate a ceasefire with advancing Allied and Soviet forces before Germany is completely defeated and occupied.

All I can say is that it was worth the effort.The two leads bounce off of one another with brilliant comic timing and both manage to make their flawed characters utterly likable. Yes the plot is predictable and no there is no joke that made me fall out of my seat. However it did deliver on many levels. The comedy was sharp and although the ending was a little contrived it did manage to put a goofy smile on the face of a cynical teenager IE moi. 'Baby Mama' is perfect chick fare and I am disappointed in the cinemas who have cleared all their screens in preparation for the release of 'The Dark Knight'.Poehler and Fey sparkled and were supported by an excellent cast Steve Martin was odd providing some light comedy but it was Sigourney Weaver and Greg Kinnear back on form and looking less haggard whom i felt really carried the film in the absence of the two leads.Baby Mama was refreshing and a great indication that we should see more of these two girls on the big screen.45 Stars".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the trailer for Baby Mama I just thought this movie was going to be a total disaster it didn't look funny and like another typical chick flick. But my friends wanted to see it so we saw it opening weekend and actually I was surprised I did like a lot better than what I was expecting. Baby Mama is something that looks like from the Lifetime Network but it's all good it has some really funny moments and was just cute. Amy Poehler and Tina Fey are two very funny women from Saturday Night Live they also did Mean Girls together and made their characters an absolute joy to watch so seeing them as the leads in this film was going to be an interesting turn. Tina Fey definitely has a lot of talent not only as a writer but as an actress she made her character believable and as neuritic as she was she was still likable. Amy Poehler made her character a little too SNL at times but these girls made the movie enjoyable and a fun flick to watch for the afternoon.Kate is a single and successful woman who seems to have it all in life but one thing she wants so bad is a baby. But one problem her uterus isn't liked by her doctor in other words she has a one in a million chance of getting pregnant. After adoption woes and sperm donor failures she decides to get a sergeant mother who will get pregnant and give her a child. She meets white trash couple Angie and Carl. Angie moves into Kate's apartment after her break up with Carl so this odd couple has to teach each other some new moves in life.Baby Mama is actually worth the watch I was very impressed with how much I liked it like I said from the trailer it doesn't seem like a good movie but when you watch it you get the laughs and the smiles that the movie promises. It is a chick flick warning to people who have a strong hatred for them but I'm not a fan of chick flicks and you know what? I thought that this was just a fun movie that if you let go and even enjoy the predictability you'll find yourself loving Baby Mama.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Say what you will about the marketing machine but I truly think the people behind promoting Baby Mama did a bang up jobeven if I believe they did so without trying. They make expectations so low in the trailer that you almost have to enjoy the film. Was it a great comedy? No. However it was much better than I ever could have hoped as Michael McCullers takes us places you never would expect going in. I thought that it would be a waterdowned overlong SNL skit with one woman asking another to carry her baby leading to a generic odd couple pairing with hijinks and gags piling on top of each other collapsing under its own weight. Instead we are treated to a pretty sentimental and touching portrait of two women learning to grow and evolve with help from the other a person in both regards that they never would have thought could teach them anything. Even the pregnancy aspect takes a ton of twists and turns never becoming the straight shot gimmick just bringing everyone together. The surrogate mother here must make some tough decisions as she continues along on her journey lending a side to the tale that actually brings it to a level of intrigue that no Lorne Michaels film has done in recent memory.I don't want to ruin the plot points of Angie Ostrowiski's pregnancy but let's just say it isn't cut and dry. Her motives aren't genuine something that is obvious from the start just not quite in the way you anticipate. There are surprises for her and secrets hidden from the other characters as she wrestles within herself. A whitetrash loser attached to a man that believes waiting on the phone to be the 132.7 caller is a job Angie learns a lot while with momtobe Kate Holbrook. Kate being the professional VP of an organic food market is a very detail orientated woman who is by the books and unafraid to tell others what they should do. It is an oil and water connection butlike all good relationships of this kindbreeds some real funny and touching moments. Who thought watching Karaoke on the Playstation could be so much fun? Sure many instances feel like skits written separately and plugged in later the clubbing while pregnant the press conference ambush and the surrogate therapy sessionprobably the funniest scene without question but they are surprisingly strung together to make a pretty coherent whole.The other thing that the trailer hides is the inclusion of two great male roles. Did anyone know that Greg Kinnear and Steve Martin were in this thing? I for one was completely surprised by both almost chuckling that they would have a small cameo until I realized that both were key roles to the whole. In the best turn of the film Steve Martin is crazy hippie genius. His earthy style of living complete with long ponytail and soft speech even when angered is classic as is everything uttered from his mouth. He is so good that I would be thrilled to have him offer me 5 uninterrupted minutes of staring into his eyes as a reward for a job well done. For Kinnear's part he plays the usual love interest that is commonplace in films of this ilk. It's not flashy and it's not very original but Greg is a stalwart and pulls off the good guy persona even including a little bit of physical humor at the end.Overall though this film is pretty standard fare. It goes into very broad comedy at times and very sappyoverlysentimental drivel at others. There are some good jokes sprinkled throughout and for the most part keep it fun for the duration. Definitely feeling longer than it is I never quite felt bored and I did begin to get invested in the story to see how it all would turn out. A lot of that can be credited to the chemistry between Tina Fey and Amy Pohler as Kate and Angie respectively. Both these women do a great job with their roles fleshing out the psychotic relationship to perfection. One of the successful dynamics is how Fey becomes a mother figure to her surrogate. Even going so far as having temper tantrums and rubberfaced reactions Pohler is a child.It's also nice to see some fun moments from the supporting cast but again nothing really sticks out to vault anything into must see territory. Sigourney Weaver is actually kinda scary in a very weird role Romany Malco has plenty of great oneliners and facial expressions and John Hodgeman is a bit odd in a small bit with laughs coming more from the recognition of his Mac commercials than anything he does in the film. In the end while nothing overachieves it all adds up to a pretty solid comedy worth a view. Is it necessary to see on the big screen? Probably not but if you were worried that it might be a trainwreck just know that it never takes any chances to risk derailing and that's not a bad thing.".

	schema:headline " Not Quite Groundbreaking But Exceeds Expectations";
	schema:reviewBody "Saturday Night Live whether or not you consider it still funny is going through a great period. Ratings are fairly high coming off of the writers' strike. The show is riding the Democratic nomination race wave pretty well featuring either Clinton Obama or both in at least one sketch per episode. Due to their recent successes it makes sense that SNL's comedians want to branch out into movies like they successfully did in the 90s with Wayne's World. Baby Mama serves as one of these movies featuring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler at the helm and at least two more members from the SNL team in the background namely Will Forte and Fred Armisen. Steve Martin a frequent SNL host can also be found in this movie. After reading the character list it's clear where the SNL comparisons and references come from.Considering its origins and its genre abroad I went into the theater with relatively low expectations. At most I hoped for a sort of feelgood comedy that had a lot of laugh scenes that made up for some corny drama scenes. I got the laugh scenes but surprisingly the drama scenes weren't very corny. Baby Mama as can be determined from the title deals with Kate Holbrook Tina Fey's character a powerful businesswoman and executive in an organic foods company and her burning desire to have a baby and build a family regardless of the difficulties. Unlike most comedies this is actually a surprisingly serious topic which enhances the dramatic parts of the plot quite a bit. You can actually take the characters and the story line quite seriously. Actually Kate's character is almost entirely serious aside from the occasional jokes on how uptight and socially inept she can be. Most of the laughs come from Angie Ostrowiski Amy Poehler's character a not exactly highclass girl working for Chaffee Bicknell's played by Sigourney Weaver surrogacy agency that offers to be Kate's surrogate after Kate attempts and fails to get pregnant multiple times. As can be expected from Poehler Angie is completely and totally ridiculous. Poehler is actually extremely good in this role since she manages to play a white trash stereotypical character without coming off as corny or at least most of the time.Don't get me wrong there are times when you can't help but cringe. A small portion of the humor is just far too corny and can't make you laugh no matter how ready you are to laugh. However anyone who watches Saturday Night Live is already used to this since everyone knows that not every SNL skit is funny. Not by a long shot. However the entire movie is irresistibly cute. The character development is fantastic and Poehler and Fey working together really carries the entire movie. In fact the men in the story are almost entirely irrelevant. Carl played by Dax Shepard Angie's lowclass tactless boyfriend could have been much funnier than he actually is. Rob played by Greg Kinnear although a nice character and a nice addition really only serves as an attractive male and yes he is very attractive in this movie and someone to move the story along a little bit. Barry played by Steve Martin the president of the organic food company Kate works for is an absolutely insane hippie that provides a lot of humor to the parts of the movie where Kate is at work. Five minutes of uninterrupted eye contact anyone? You'll get it when you watch the movie.At the end of the movie you do really feel for the characters or at least Angie and Kate. The other characters are sort of background even at the end but they're still necessary since there would be no offset to the FeyPoehler humor that can just be taken in small doses to avoid becoming too corny to be enjoyable. I did find myself screaming on the inside a little at the end because there's a gigantic time gap that left a lot of questions unanswered and irritated me quite a lot but in reality in order to fill out the entire story this would either have to be a 3 hour movie or there would have to be a sequel. This isn't the kind of movie to have a sequel so I can see why they did it. I just think that some of the time that they wasted on Carl could have been used to develop that a little more.Overall Baby Mama is cute and that's all I can see it ever trying for. It also seems to me to test the waters a little bit for a Fey and Poehler matchup that when smoothed out a little around the edges will be a very strong comedy duo. I did enjoy this film very much and I would highly recommend it to someone who watches SNL frequently and likes Poehler's style of humor or someone who just wants to go to the movies to have fun and feel good. It's certainly worth it. However what I find more significant at the moment is my excitement for films in the future that will feature Fey and Poehler and I truly hope that the film industry doesn't miss out on this potentially hilarious team.

	onyx:emotionText "Saturday Night Live whether or not you consider it still funny is going through a great period. Ratings are fairly high coming off of the writers' strike. The show is riding the Democratic nomination race wave pretty well featuring either Clinton Obama or both in at least one sketch per episode. Due to their recent successes it makes sense that SNL's comedians want to branch out into movies like they successfully did in the 90s with Wayne's World. Baby Mama serves as one of these movies featuring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler at the helm and at least two more members from the SNL team in the background namely Will Forte and Fred Armisen. Steve Martin a frequent SNL host can also be found in this movie. After reading the character list it's clear where the SNL comparisons and references come from.Considering its origins and its genre abroad I went into the theater with relatively low expectations. At most I hoped for a sort of feelgood comedy that had a lot of laugh scenes that made up for some corny drama scenes. I got the laugh scenes but surprisingly the drama scenes weren't very corny. Baby Mama as can be determined from the title deals with Kate Holbrook Tina Fey's character a powerful businesswoman and executive in an organic foods company and her burning desire to have a baby and build a family regardless of the difficulties. Unlike most comedies this is actually a surprisingly serious topic which enhances the dramatic parts of the plot quite a bit. You can actually take the characters and the story line quite seriously. Actually Kate's character is almost entirely serious aside from the occasional jokes on how uptight and socially inept she can be. Most of the laughs come from Angie Ostrowiski Amy Poehler's character a not exactly highclass girl working for Chaffee Bicknell's played by Sigourney Weaver surrogacy agency that offers to be Kate's surrogate after Kate attempts and fails to get pregnant multiple times. As can be expected from Poehler Angie is completely and totally ridiculous. Poehler is actually extremely good in this role since she manages to play a white trash stereotypical character without coming off as corny or at least most of the time.Don't get me wrong there are times when you can't help but cringe. A small portion of the humor is just far too corny and can't make you laugh no matter how ready you are to laugh. However anyone who watches Saturday Night Live is already used to this since everyone knows that not every SNL skit is funny. Not by a long shot. However the entire movie is irresistibly cute. The character development is fantastic and Poehler and Fey working together really carries the entire movie. In fact the men in the story are almost entirely irrelevant. Carl played by Dax Shepard Angie's lowclass tactless boyfriend could have been much funnier than he actually is. Rob played by Greg Kinnear although a nice character and a nice addition really only serves as an attractive male and yes he is very attractive in this movie and someone to move the story along a little bit. Barry played by Steve Martin the president of the organic food company Kate works for is an absolutely insane hippie that provides a lot of humor to the parts of the movie where Kate is at work. Five minutes of uninterrupted eye contact anyone? You'll get it when you watch the movie.At the end of the movie you do really feel for the characters or at least Angie and Kate. The other characters are sort of background even at the end but they're still necessary since there would be no offset to the FeyPoehler humor that can just be taken in small doses to avoid becoming too corny to be enjoyable.

	schema:reviewBody "There is a smattering of smart laughs in this 2008 comedy but firsttime director Michael McCullers really plods his own coincidencedriven script along with little sense of style or dramatic resonance. At times it feels no better than a formulaic romantic comedy from the 1960's usually starring smallscreen celebrities trying to break into the big time. Sure enough this time we are offered Tina Fey currently of NBC's 30 Rock and Amy Poehler former Saturday Night Live Weekend Update coanchors and definitely the cream of the current funny lady crop. The problem is that McCullers a onetime SNL staff writer who also cowrote the Austin Powers movies with Mike Myers doesn't elevate the screenplay much beyond the limited dimensions of an extended comedy sketch. That puts most of the pressure on the two women to make this farce work as a distaff version of The Odd Couple with a pregnancy angle and they often  you should pardon the expression  deliver.Ideally cast with her smart bespectacled looks Fey plays 37yearold Kate Holbrook single and professionally successful as the VP of an upscale organic supermarket chain much like Whole Foods. She hears her biological clock ticking and is taking every step possible to have a baby. Her last straw is to pay an agency 100000 to find a surrogate. Naturally her polar opposite shows up as the ideal candidate  a junkfoodeating Red Bullswilling piece of white trash named Angie Ostrowski who comes with her moneydrubbing boyfriend Carl. Kate is so desperate she is practically begging Angie to carry her egg so Angie willingly accepts. Somehow the women end up living together during the pregnancy and inevitably get on each other's nerves more Angie on Kate's nerves since a few revelations threaten to upend the deal. Convenience appears to trump logic in tying up the plot's loose ends of which there are many. However McCullers' alternately sauntering and piercing Judd Apatowlike approach helps compensate for the bigger lapses.A game cast also helps. Although fairly limited as an actress Fey is sharp and likable as the often dour Kate and has the ability to bring the implausibility of her character's situation into more human focus. Even though she is entirely too old for her role Poehler is a more natural comic presence as Angie terrifically manic but surprisingly poignant during key moments. It's obvious their joint casting has more to do with their proved rapport than dramatic credibility. In a turn worthy of Jeff Foxworthy Dax Shepard credibly makes Carl a mercenary sheep. Romany Malco memorable as Andy's hornedup coworker in The 40YearOld Virgin is given little to do as the streetwise doorman the same fate of Maura Tierney bland as Kate's supportive sister. Greg Kinnear must be getting awfully tired playing the same type of romantic foil over and over again but he does do it well even though his scenes also seem strangely truncated. Two veterans threaten to steal the picture in acts of petty larceny  a ponytailed Steve Martin very funny as Kate's Zenseeking boss whose idea of a reward is allowing her to stare at him for five minutes and Sigourney Weaver as the overtly selfsatisfied and alltoofertile head of the agency. SNL regulars Will Forte and Fred Armisen show up in cameos. A fitfully funny farce.".

At 37 Kate decides it's time to try and have a child on her own but her plans are smashed when she finds out there is only a small chance that she can actually become pregnant. With no other option Kate finds an unlikely surrogate in Angie Amy Poehler a trashy and lowrent girl who could really use the money. After learning that Angie is pregnant Kate begins babyprepping. Only what she doesn't expect is the arrival of a pregnant Angie at her door with no place to go.Director and screenwriter Michael McCullers suggests to us early that Baby Mama is going to be a tired trip down formulalane. Kate is an ordernut Angie is a messy freespirit put them together and you have the most predictable storyline ever told. Thankfully enough McCullers proves clever in finding some fresh laughs here whether they be from the scary and awkward process of connecting your life with a complete stranger or in the trivialized world of modern pregnancy where babyproofing the fears of bad eating habits and chemicals in household products and research books and videos have become exaggerated to the point of causing constant anxiety. The movie is actually damn funny and when it's not it's usually really lovable and it's nice to see a comedy that relies more on wit than on the next crude gag for a change.Fey and Poehler are also a fantastic match. Fey plays selfdeprecating and unhip better than any actress out there and Poehler is a loonier and more zany comedic actress and their previous work experience on SNL really shows here. Like some of the better buddy comedies of the past they establish a chemistry that is as friendly and amusing as it is rocky. Having Greg Kinnear play Fey's love interest and Dax Shepherd play Poehler's idiot boyfriend is also perfect casting as I had just as much fun watching these two comedic actresses toss around with them as I did with each other. And having two veteran and respected actors in your movie helps too. Sigourney Weaver as an older woman whose still as fertile as ever and Steve Martin as Fey's hippie vegan boss are both absolutely hilarious.Baby Mama begins with an oh no but quickly settles into something witty and lovable. The script is smart and funny and the cast couldn't be better especially Fey and Poehler who seem very comfortable playing off one another. This movie is a good start to two promising careers and with any luck two careers that will hopefully cross paths again in another movie someday.".

But my friends wanted to see it so we saw it opening weekend and actually I was surprised I did like a lot better than what I was expecting. Baby Mama is something that looks like from the Lifetime Network but it's all good it has some really funny moments and was just cute. Amy Poehler and Tina Fey are two very funny women from Saturday Night Live they also did Mean Girls together and made their characters an absolute joy to watch so seeing them as the leads in this film was going to be an interesting turn. Tina Fey definitely has a lot of talent not only as a writer but as an actress she made her character believable and as neuritic as she was she was still likable. Amy Poehler made her character a little too SNL at times but these girls made the movie enjoyable and a fun flick to watch for the afternoon.Kate is a single and successful woman who seems to have it all in life but one thing she wants so bad is a baby. But one problem her uterus isn't liked by her doctor in other words she has a one in a million chance of getting pregnant. After adoption woes and sperm donor failures she decides to get a sergeant mother who will get pregnant and give her a child. She meets white trash couple Angie and Carl. Angie moves into Kate's apartment after her break up with Carl so this odd couple has to teach each other some new moves in life.Baby Mama is actually worth the watch I was very impressed with how much I liked it like I said from the trailer it doesn't seem like a good movie but when you watch it you get the laughs and the smiles that the movie promises. It is a chick flick warning to people who have a strong hatred for them but I'm not a fan of chick flicks and you know what? I thought that this was just a fun movie that if you let go and even enjoy the predictability you'll find yourself loving Baby Mama.".

It was truly a great comedy but it didn't show the light hearted side of surrogacy I was hoping for.I went into the theater wearing a proud surrogate tee shirt and came out with my sweater zipped over it.Surrogacy is something that is extremely controversial and we needed a movie that showed the good side of it. It's so easy to imagine what can go wrong in a situation like that but the truth is it's NOTHING like that. It's a very beautiful amazing thing and I know that first hand.They portrayed the surrogate as white trash. But I have a group of surrogates I've become very close to and they are the most insightful smart caring women I've ever met. I've yet to meet a white trash surrogate. I've also yet to meet an intended mother who would enlist the help of someone who smokes lives in a bad neighborhood who's in an abusive relationship etc... It simply doesn't happen like that.For those of you questioning why she wouldn't just adopt...The simple answer is what she said in the movie. It can take 5 years to place a child with a single woman and she felt her biological clock was ticking. It had nothing to do with money. Yes surrogacy is more expensive than adopting. 100000 is completely unrealistic by the way... Surrogacy is not a way of avoiding adoption. It's simply another option.The more complicated answer is why would you care? Most people are blessed being able to have children. And nobody ever asks them why they didn't adopt. It's a very personal choice. And anyone who calls it stupid or pointless is simply uneducated and unsympathetic in matters of infertility.".

It's asinine and predictable and it contains every clich in the book about career women pregnancy fertility treatment African American men vegans organic food white trash and what have you. There's not a shred of originality in the entire movie. Amy Poehler and Dax Shepard who's great in Parenthood! are utterly unconvincing as white trash. The actors are talented and they certainly tried but they couldn't salvage the breathtakingly stupid screenplay. I want my hour and a half back! Luckily we got it through Netflix so at least my pregnant wife and I didn't pay for two movie tickets to see it.".

This movie is about as formulaic as it getsSingle career woman Tiny Fey decides to have a baby but discovers she can't so she hires a white trash surrogate to have the baby for her. The surrogate Amy Poehler and her devious boyfriend Dax Shepard concoct a scheme to fake her pregnancy in order to take advantage of the desperate career woman but the surrogate and the career woman begin to form a bond. Meanwhile career woman meets handsome successful small businessman Greg Kinnear who conveniently enough is single.Does anyone really need to guess what happens next?There is absolutely no originality in this movie. In addition to the inconvenient fact that Tina Fey is not a very good actress and cannot carry a movie for 100 minutes even her supporting cast is clichd. I spotted at least four current or former cast members of Saturday Night Live in the movie  I propose that Congress pass a law that anytime an alumnus of SNL makes a movie heshe is prohibited from using any other SNL cast member. There is only one other standout supporting character in the movie and even he is the standard cool streetwise black guy with the heart of gold.".

The white trash shtick is a bit old but Amy Poehler did the best she possibly could with it. Amy is a natural comedian and there is some great but not overboard physical humor. Tina Fey was as witty and deadon as ever. Although the premise has been done to death the writing is updated and hip enough to keep us interested. The real surprise was Steve Martin in a wonderfully sublime role as Tina's postNew Age boss. Absolutely hilarious. And Sigourney Weaver was perfect as the weird aging surrogate clinic madame.

No.  With the help of Mothra's fairies who just happen to be visiting Japan during this global crisis Mothra is sent to Godzilla and Rodan to try and convince them to help the people of the world and fight Ghidrah.  The twin fairies probably fatigued from singing a couple fine songs translate what the mosters say.  Rodan and Godzilla are wary of helping mankind and would rather beat on each other making one Japanese spectator remark These monsters are as stupid as human beings! This is a fun film.  The monsters look as you would expect.  Rodan for whatever reasons looks particularly cheesy and fake but Godzilla is fitted with a neat rubber suit.  Yep miniature towns are destroyed in this one too.  The acting all around is very good for a film like this.  The story is pretty good too.  You cannot go wrong with a giant lizard a giant reptillian prehistoric bird and a giant caterpillar duking it out with a threeheaded space monster.  Throw in two charming musicallyinclined island fairies and an assasination plot of a princess into the mix as well... not to mention the directing skill of Inshiro Honda and the fabulous music of Akira Ifukube and you just cannot miss!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the seventh kaijyu monster movie written by Toho's screen writer Shinichi Sekizawa and the first to portray the monsters in a comical light which would become Toho's style for the following 10 years. The story differs somewhat between the Japanese version and the American version. This commentary is about the Japanese version.Princess Mars Dourina Salno Eiko Wakabayashi of Sergina requests Japanese police to give her protection due to political instability of her country. Detective Shindo Yosuke Natsuki is assigned by his boss Okita Akihiko Hirata to body guard the princess but the plane carrying the princess explodes on its way to Japan. Shortly afterward a woman proclaiming to be from Venus appears and prophecies that Rodan and Godzilla will appear in Japan. Thinking that his assignment was over before it got started Shindo goes home reads about mysterious Venusian woman who's attracting media's attention looks exactly like princess Mars. Convinced that the self proclaimed Venusian is princess Mars he launches his own investigation. His sister Naoko who is a reporter is also on the heel of the Venusian woman. In the mean time a mysterious asteroid falls in the Kurobe area of Japan. Assistant professor Murai Hiroshi Koizumi is the team leader that's sent to investigate the asteroid witnesses the asteroid turning into a three headed monster. Naoko finally catches up with the Venusian woman and escorts her to a near by hotel. By this time assassins from Sergina is also on her trail suspecting that the Venusian woman is princess Mars. They converge at the hotel and shooting ensues between the assassins and detective Shindo. Assassins flees and detective Shindo and Naoko escorts the Venusian to Dr. Tsukamoto's Takashi Shimura lab to see if her memories can be revived. In the mean time Rodan and Godzilla is sited and they converge near Mt. Fuji and starts a battle. Vanusian woman tells a story that 5000 years ago Venus was attacked by the monster King Gidora and was turned into a waste land and that Gidora is now on earth. Mothra is called to Japan to ask Godzilla and Rodan to fight against King Gidora but the two monsters aren't exactly interested in helping mankind.The plot of this movie is superbly written with each element supporting the entire flow of the story. Many die hard Godzilla fans might not like the campy flavor of this movie but so many elements crammed into this movie that runs just over 90 minutes has intricacies and originality never seen in previous Japanese monster movies. This movie by far has the most intricate plot of movies written by Shinichi Sekizawa but is hidden behind the tong in cheek humor that runs throughout the movie. In the US released DVD three men accuses the Venusian woman as kichigai crazy. The broadcast code in Japan has tightened up since this movie was made and this word is no longer allowed to be used in a movie so the Japanese DVD has this word changed to another dialog but you will hear it as it was in the US release DVD. Princess Mars' full name Mars Dourina Salno is a play on the Japanese phrase Ma sudori nasaruno Are you just going to pass me by ? and is intended to be an injoke.You'll get much more out of this movie if you catch the details of the movie. It was the first time Gidora was seen on screen. Gidora became a staple of subsequent movies guaranteeing a crowd draw for Toho.Watch this movie to see if you can catch the details.".

	schema:headline " I Love This Film!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is one of the original series' best in my opinion. Four of my favorite monsters coming together for the hugest battle yet seen at the time of course. This film also holds a very special place in my heart seeing as it was the first GOOD Godzilla movie I ever owned. Back when I must've been four I'd estimate. The only Gfilm I'd seen prior to this was Godzilla vs. Megalon but compared to this film it only looks even crappier! I unfortunately broke my VHS copy of it at nine due to excitement over a new Gfilm I'd been given as a present and up until 2007 I thought I would never see the film again. Fortunately Classic Media recognized its greatness and released on a spectacular DVD. Another reason I love this film is the fun plot. Of course it's dropped any mention of nukes or strong themes but I still find it one of Sekizawa's best. Next time around let's say Princess Salno used a parachute instead of leaping in between dimensions. As for the characters this film has a really good cast. Akikko Wakabayashi the PrincessMartian prophet is excellent and fine by the way. Takashi Shimura stars as another 'Dr.' character and his performance is as usual top notch. Akihiko Hirata stars in a small role where as Yuriko Hoshi returns playing a very similar character to her previous role in Mothra vs. Godzilla done well. Along with all the other actors every one gives entertaining performances Honda even adding some cool shoot out scenes.The special effects are mostly good. King Ghidorah was an incredible accomplishment for Eiji Tsubaraya. The three headed dragon looks magnificent both on the ground and flying. The gravity beams were done exceptionally well where as Godzilla's heat ray became a mist due to the money spent on Ghidorah. Anyways the space demons rampage scenes are beautiful and I love the odd shriek. All the sets are huge and well constructed my favorite being the downwards sloping hill where Ghidorah or Ghidrah as he's called in the dubbing is first confronted by Godzilla and Mothra. Godzilla and Rodan's battle is just cool and full of energy and Ifukube's music fits it perfectly. The best two parts were Godzilla using his tail and Rodan lifting the King of the Monsters into the sky and dropping him onto the electrical tower. The continuity is still there and still no aliens although King Ghidorah is technically an extraterrestrial. Godzilla looked great considering it's the incredible suit from the last film. Except for its eyes which didn't look as imposing. Rodan looked decent but nowhere near as impressive as the 1956 original. The final battle is an excellent display of SFX and real action. Total highlight of the film no doubt.When you're a seven or nine year old watching these films you don't notice these things but times change. Whereas Sekizawa was quite the writer it can be noted he brung the first essences of campiness into the original Godzilla series. The monster summit isn't really campy per say but it does lower the seriousness of the film. It is the beginning of Godzilla's hero stance which will soon become the beginning of the end for his career till 1984 Godzilla 1985 begins the second series of films. Luckily Godzilla still gets his menacing scenes at Yokohama harbor and he does kill hundreds of innocent people on a cruise boat when he first emerges from the ocean depths done nicely. The characters still fear him and don't look at him as a hero just yet. In a way he just settled a brief negotiation. But I didn't know Godzilla cursed Oohhh Godzilla what horrible language twin fairies translating at the monster summit. In the end it's rather funny so I appreciate it more and more with each viewing. And seeing as I as I watch the film on a weekly basis you get the idea.Well the first three Gfilms had elaborate and often unnecessary Americanization's with added American scenes changes to the SCORE and even changing Godzilla's name to Gigantis! Mothra vs. Godzilla was the first to avoid it but this film to a degree didn't. The story is left intact and there are no American actors edited in but Ifukube's score is AGAIN tampered with!! Thankfully not as much as in King Kong vs. Godzilla. Other than that the American cuts actually make sense and actually fix that continuity error with King Ghidorah buy the Classic Media DVD and watch the Japanese version. Overall I love this film for several reasons and if you haven't seen it you most definitely should.".

A three headed horror named King Ghidorah from the stars arrives and begins a destruction spree. Ghidora looks definitely the best in this film the scenes of him flying in and out of Tokyo and demolishing landmarks with his lightning breath look incredible. Mothra larval tries to ask Godzilla and Rodan who are still evil to help her fight Ghidorah. They refuse until they see King Ghidorah destroy a town and brutally attack poor Mothra and then they leap into action and the battle for Earth begins. This is a great creature feature film it has everything a creature feature film should the four most famous monsters missing princesses martians killers scientists. The effects by Eiji Tsuburaya are dazzling and the Godzilla and King Ghidorah suits look the best they've ever looked while unfortunately Mothra looks like a living poop and Rodan looks like a chicken. I recommend this to kids and adults alike!".

Unfortunately the design of the suit was changed to look less menacing. This is when the series begins to gear towards children. Godzilla becomes a reluctant hero. In a rare instance of continuity in the series Mothra vs. Godzilla is referenced. Invasion of the AstroMonster or Monster Zero followed a year later and these 3 films really form a trilogy.The DVD includes both the Japanese and American versions of Ghidorah.

While Godzilla and Rodan weren't too happy to meet each other it was actually Mothra who urged the two monsters to cooperate to battle Ghidorah and help mankind. And this movie has a whole lot towering monsters a Martian a princess detectives doctors reporters and of course Mothra's tiny twin fairy priestesses who once again did their little song and dance and chat in unison. Honda's solid directing Sekizawa's terrific script and Ifukube's fantastic music score permeated the movie's success. There may be a lot more human scenes than monster scenes but since the plot is so solid it made each human scene interesting and inspiring.

The key to a good Godzilla flick is a solid plot even if it's just interesting in a hokey Bmovie scifi way and interesting human characters because let's face it the monster action only actually makes up less than a third of the movie itself so if the rest is torture to sit through there's almost no point to watching it unless you're a completist like myself.Ghidora the Three Headed Monster doesn't quite have the most interesting story of any of the Godzilla movies but it's solid enough and we get a healthy dose of the lovable singing fairy girls. It's really the plot inconsistencies that let it down. I would forgive them especially given that this is a Godzilla movie but they are so glaring and obvious why would the fairy girls not wanting attention appear on TV? that they become annoying. The comedy in this film also really just doesn't work at all.Ishiro Honda is once again the director and as usual he proves that he is a more talented director than many would give him credit for. This most certainly wasn't the worst Godzilla movie he directed but it's a shame the special effects couldn't be a little better and enhance the movie a bit. Although I quite like the monster suits themselves for both Godzilla and Ghidora the model work and the puppet work is especially bad and a surprising step down from the previous installment. Everything about Ghidora the Three Headed Monster is a step down from the excellent Mothra vs. Godzilla but this is still an entertaining and welcome installment in the series if deeply flawed.610".

MOTHRA and GHIDRAH THE THREEHEAD MONSTER both 1964. It has come to my attention that the two other monsters that team up with the big G had their own movies before they were involved. Rodan and Mothra. Akira Ifukube's score is awesome and the special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya are wonderful. This movie has a sense of wonder. They are many reasons why people rooted for Godzilla Rodan and Mothra when they fight the threeheaded golden dragonlike Goliath. To me even though he is modeled after the hydra from Greek mythology it is because before hand there was this multiheaded dragon from the DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS cartoon that scared me read my review on that cartoon and seeing Godzilla take him down with his fellow teammates reminds me of the 70's HannaBarbera cartoon of the big G also read my comment on that cartoon. This was the movie that turned Godzilla from villain to hero and he will do that over the next 11 years. King Ghidorah would be a recurring character in the franchise. So there you have it. I highly recommend it. Bottom line Give it a watch because it's great fun. Not rated but a G would be nice.".

They play a big part in the film convincing Godzilla and Rodan to join forces with Mothra and save Earth from Ghidorah. This would mark Godzilla's official turn to hero for future sequels. The special effects are a lot of fun. If you see the American version you'll get lots of amusing dubbing. As with most of these Godzilla movies there's a lot of time before any monsters show up. I haven't seen one of the sequels yet that couldn't have benefited from losing 10 or 15 minutes of people standing around talking. At least with the American versions the most boring segments have some cheesy entertainment value from the silly dubbed voices. Anyway it's all harmless fun with nice visuals and ideas. The selling point of course is when Godzilla  co. do their thing. The monster battles are awesome. The rock fight between Godzilla and Rodan is especially goofy. The climactic battle has Godzilla Rodan and Mothra versus King Ghidorah  what's not to love about that?".

The plot goes something like this Detective Shindo is assigned to protect princess Selina Salno. However her plane is destroyed en route by a bomb and is assumed dead. She turns up again claiming she's a princess from mars and making prophecies of forthcoming disaster. However her predictions start coming true and Rodan rises from a crater and Godzilla emerges from the sea. Meanwhile a meteor crashes. The Shobijin Mothra's fairies don't go on a boat taking them to birth island because of Selina's prediction and it ends up being destroyed by Godzilla. Selina then reveals that mars was destroyed by a space dragon King Ghidorah. And that he's already arrived on earth in a meteor. Anyway thats the main plot. What I wanna talk about is Ghidorah. He has a rather interesting design. Three heads two tails big wings and no arms plus the ability to fire bolts of gravitational from his mouth. This film has its actionorientated parts like the the gunfights between Shindo and Selina's assassins and the giant monster battles. It also has its comedic parts such as when Ghidorah zaps Godzilla in the nuts or when Rodan and Godzilla laugh at each other after getting sprayed by Mothra. The special effects are average for a Japanese film. Rodan's hand puppet looks like crap. The acting is suburb and feels pretty real except for a few scenes. Overall this is one of the better films in the series.".

Of course they're only around for about twenty minutes which really isn't enough in a 90 minute movie Mothra never even metamorphoses. But don't forget  there's the absolute lunacy of the rubber suit universe to confound us while we wait for fights.It can be a wonderful plane of existence this manga world where rules are made to be stomped on. A chic princess steps out of an exploding airplane at 30000 feet and lands on earth dressed as Che Guevara and claiming to be the Venusian Cassandra  in a nod to the Greeks nobody listens to her. In fact conspirators in Foster Grants and Elizabethan syphilis collars try to assassinate her with a letter opener. She is aided by 8inch sisters who have a flying carpet but sometimes travel by pet carrier. The sight of these Liliputian twins singing Do not forget to smile! to a giant maggot on a Where Are They Now? TV show is not one I will soon forget. King Ghidorah is my favorite rubber monster for a couple of reasons. One is his three heads which always look dangerously out of control whipping manically as they spit their deathrays. Another is the deathrays themselves which except for Toshiro Mifune's sword are the most destructive force in any Toho film. This is after all the monster who killed Venus  usually it takes an entire civilization of alien monkeys to threaten a whole planet. These rays rip up cityscapes and topple buildings more effectively than Rodan's wings or Godzilla's breath which has all the damaging power of tepid steam. However the premium placed on puppeteers and pyrotechnics made Ghidorah the most expensive monster to film so we never really get enough of him especially this time when he's barely on screen long enough to blow up an amusement park. Also appearing are the standard early60s Garfieldeyed punchy boxer version of Godzilla a buzzardlike incarnation of Rodan several snazzy suits and more stingybrim hats than James Bond could toss onto a hat rack all photographed in a very pretty if staid use of 70 millimeter Tohovision.

This is probably the most purely entertaining of the Inoshiro Honda Godzilla films and proves that Honda who could get pretty heavyhanded with these puppet monster movies was capable of real wit. The earth monsters are given believable humanlike personalities that massdestruction aside make us warm up to them right away.

The Mothra twins get to sing a couple enjoyable popsongs the VenutianPrincess is stunningly beautiful the actress would go on to be a Bond girl in You Only Live Twice and the dialog is the snappiest of the first phase of the early Big G. series. The relationship between the appearance of the monsters and the mystery of the VenutianPrincess is wellhandled while the plotting isn't all that tight it does hold together surprisingly well. And the special fx are still credible for this series in its time.One sad note apparently the Japanese version lacks a line that is an alltime favorite of the series and which must have been added by the dubbing team  Shobijin Oh Godzilla such terrible language!  spoken while Godzilla and Mothra are arguing whether to save the human race.However when this film is rereleased on DVD it really must be this DVD that gets to America. There is a wonderful added value to this DVD a collection of homemovies shot by a crewmember during the making of the film! Absolutely marvelous I didn't realize just how much effort and care went into the making of what most believe to be silly rubbermonster films. At one point a woman is seen building a model house  which will be on screen only long enough to get stomped by Godzilla 10 seconds? and she is painstakingly applying each individual shingle to the roof  a good day's job for just the one house!

	schema:headline " Would have been better if they established Gidorah a bit more.";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a rather good Godzilla film one that introduces us to a new monster that would become a regular foe for Godzilla in many films to come King Gidorah. The plot has a princess of a small island nation coming to Japan but her plane explodes. She later turns up saying she is from Venus and predicting doom for all mankind. We learn in a strange television show that one of the Mothra twins from the previous movie have died but the other one is doing fine as the twin girls sing a song for some kids on said strange television show. A girl who is part of some sort of mystery type show is trying to get to the girl is talking about dangers at a volcano and a cop recognizes her as the princess he was supposed to protect had she made it to Japan. Well I am guessing this is Rodan's second appearance in a movie as he emerges from the volcano that was his apparent doom and Godzilla soon arises out of the ocean once again terrorizing mankind. If this were not bad enough a new monster emerges from a meteorite a monster the princess who claims she is from Venus says destroyed her planet and wiped out all civilization. To top it all off the princess has the most persistent assassins ever as they try to knock her off even as Godzilla Rodan and King Gidorah are destroying the countryside. The movie is rather good it comes on the heels of Godzilla vs Mothra and I was happy to here about the death of the other Mothra in the Japanese version as I don't think they went over this in the American one. Of course Godzilla survived being tossed in the ocean why wouldn't he? He is kind of an ocean and land monster. Rodan also makes his second appearance and for some reason he and Godzilla just want to fight. At the end you have a big monster battle royal featuring Godzilla Rodan and Mothra against the new threat who I thought should have had a few more scenes of him destroying things to establish him a bit more as a super heavy hitter. The assassins are a bit over the top too as I think most people would give up after the monsters were running rampant and heading their way. So there you go a new monster that would be one of Godzilla's most powerful foes. Though this begs the question who is Godzilla's most powerful foe I say it is between Gidorah and MechaGodzilla and I will give the edge to MechaGodzilla as that robot has quite a few wins against Godzilla while in later movies Godzilla literally blew Gidorah's heads off and once completely vaporized him.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is film 5 in the Godzilla series and it's an uneven but ultimately enjoyable addition. For the first time we get to see Godzilla Rodan and Mothra all together as they battle the infamous monster from outer space King Ghidorah the preferred spelling.I say the film is a little uneven only because there are a lot of different story elements going on simultaneously and a good deal of the time is spent on the human characters. For example the film begins with a detective who is assigned to guard a visiting princess who's been targeted by an assassin. When the woman arrives in Tokyo she has been taken over by strange alien forces and reveals herself as a Venusian prophet who warns of impending Earth disaster in the form of Ghidorah a dragonlike threeheaded monstrosity who has already wiped out all the life on another planet.In the meantime Godzilla and Rodan have awakened from their usual slumbers and they have a quarrel with each other while the latest version of Mothra the younger caterpillar type tries to intervene by urging these two to drop their personal grievances and join forces to help protect the world against the threat of Ghidorah. The delightful twin fairies of Mothra's island always help make these films fun and this time they're actually able to translate monster talk when Mothra attempts to convince Godzilla and Rodan who are reluctant at first to team up to fight Ghidorah. Here you can already see how the films are beginning to get a little more juvenile at this point as evidenced not only in the monster conversations but also in the comical encounter between Godzilla and Rodan they play volleyball by bouncing a boulder back and forth!. Still these goofy exchanges are kind of charming in their own way and this would be the start of turning Godzilla into a more heroic figure for the children which I never thought was a completely bad idea by this time personally.Godzilla starts to look more like Sesame Street's Cookie Monster with this chapter but the effects are generally quite good when seen in the original Japanese widescreen edition and the multimonster teamup at the climax is well done. And added plus is the really coolsounding music score. 12 out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "Other than introducing Ghidorah perhaps the second most popular monster in Toho's bestiary Ghidorah the ThreeHeaded Monster 1964 has little to recommend it. The fifth entry into the Godzilla canon opens with an unnecessary background story involving a missing princess who inexplicitly survives the inflight destruction of her airplane after hearing voices. She resurfaces as a selfproclaimed Venusian oracle who predicts a number of kaijubased disasters in involving Rodan Godzilla and the space monster who was responsible for the destruction of Venusian culture. All of this comes true as Rodan frees himself from entombing lava Godzilla wades ashore and Ghidorah materialises from a mysterious meteorite. While secret agents continue to attempt to kill the princessVenusian James Bond films having become very popular the miniature twins from Infant Island appear and recruit Mothra to fight Ghidorah. This leads to the climatic brawl on the slopes of Mt. Fuji with the three 'Earth's monsters' squaring off against Ghidorah the first of many external existential threats our planet. The movie marks the beginning of the 'Godzilla as a hero' trend that continued into the '70s. The overall story is relatively dark but the monsters are almost comic and the fight includes lots of rocks being batted back and forth and child pleasers such as Godzilla scampering around after being burned on the butt by one of Ghidorah's lasers. Rodan who was almost majestic in his debut movie Rodan1956 now is now a bit bugeyed and as suitmation doesn't really work well for birdlike kaiju unconvincing when not in flight. Another revision to the canon is the obvious sentiency of the monsters as Mothra in her larval form argues with Godzilla and Rodan translated by the twins about the ethical and pragmatic pros and cons of helping mankind defend the Earth. The debate includes odd statements from the monsters such as Godzilla's complaint that he was bullied by mankind. Like many of the later entries in the Showa era films Ghidorah the ThreeHeaded Monster is the kind of silly fun that most westerners' expect from Godzilla films. Although there is a bit of blood spilled as the assassin stalks the princess and some of the language in the subtitles is more adult that the story calls for the movie is essentially for the kids with heroic monsters cooperating to take on a threeheaded bully and a simple 'why can't we all get along' message. note this review refers to a subtitled Japanese version.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ghidorah the Three Headed MOnster is a very significant Godzilla Film. It has a lot of first in it.This time a meteor hits earth and scientists go to investigate it. Also around the same time a meteor destroys the plane of a princess who jumps out of the plane before it is hit. Later she shows up but thinks that she is a martian from Venus or mars in the American version. She warns people that the Earth is coming to an end. The police feel that she will be a target and if she is killed her country will revert to communism. So they try to keep her protected. Soon she warns that the monster Rodan will reappear and Rodan emerges from Mount Asho. Later she warns of Godzilla. Attackers who plan on killing the princess are constantly after her but she believes that she is from another planet. The princessmartian warns of a terrible monster named Ghidorah that emerges from an area that was impacted by the meteor. THe shobjin are contacted to help with the threat of Ghidorah. THey fear that Mothra in its larval stage will be no match for Ghidorah but they think that if ROdan Godzilla and Mothra work together they could beat Ghidorah. Will it work or will it fail.This film is very good. It introduces Ghidorah for the first time. Ghidorah is truly a breathtaking monster. He can fly has three heads shoots gravity beams and seemingly is unbeatable. Ghidorah would go on to be Godzilla's most popular foe and a constant reappear.This is really the first Godzilla Film to be made in which the main focus is not on Godzilla. Godzilla is in it but so are Rodan Mothra and GHidorah. Also this is the first film in which Godzilla saves Japan and acts more as a hero than a villain. I never was a fan of this aspect of Godzilla he is much better as a bad guy. THe aspect of a bad guy turning good has worked on other characters in movies and comics and television but I do not like how they did this with Godzilla. Godzilla being good is just something that does not feel right why would he change his ways just like that? But it is not the end of the world I just like him way better as a bad guy.Rodan shows up for his first appearance in a Godzilla film. WHich of the two Rodan it is well if it was either I would say that it is the male since this Rodan is referred to as being a male. I guess he survived but he could be another Rodan altogether if it is a survivor from that climatic ending in Rodan I feel bad for him having lost his mate but I think the events of that film really do not matter at all in Ghidorah. Rodan looksa lot worse in this film than he did in Rodan. When he is on his feet on the ground his neck is too long and he is taller than Godzilla. Also his head looks a little different not as evil looking. Maybe they wanted to make him look nicer to appeal to public after all they did this with Godzilla. This is easily the worst look for Rodan in a film when he is walking around but he looks much better in other films but he never looks as cool as he did in Rodan. His roar is the same though and that is good. Rodan looks better when he is flying in this film helps tremendously against Ghidorah and also he gets in some good action with Godzilla. THey put on an evenly matched fight against each other. I like Rodan a lot way more than Mothra and he is a lot cooler than Mothra in my opinion.Mothra comes back unfortunately. I always disliked mothra. Probably because he defeated Godzilla in Godzilla vs Mothra. I just hate Mothra especially in his larval stage which is what he is in in this film. How can a little grub like him beat Godzilla? OK I am getting a little off track. Mothra shows up and stops Rodan and GOdzilla from fighting. WHAT THE HELL???? That bugged me because Rodan and Godzilla never got their own film against each other and when they actually do fight Mothra comes in and stops it. I wish they just would have gone after Mothra for doing that.The fight scenes are great in this film. Both the fight between Godzilla and ROdan and Godzilla ROdan and Mothra against Ghidorah are great. Another thing I did not get is why Godzilla's atomic breath looks so bad in this film? It just looks like dust or sand.The human scenes are kind of weird at times. The princess who believes that she is a martian survived a fall from her plane down to the ocean? And how does she get the powers that allow her to predict when monsters are going to appear. It is also interesting that she talks about how Ghidorah destroyed other planets but I have to wonder how reliable a source she is. After all she did know when Rodan and Godzilla would show up so I am guessing that she is right about Ghidorah also. But I love the part where the guy gets hit in the head by the wrench and he yells Eeeeee Yahhhhh!!!! This is also the first time Godzilla works with other monsters to fight a different monster. This idea would be re used again.So I think this movie is very good one of the best. Definitely a significant film that had a lot of firsts. Go and see it and you will not be disappointed.".

Heck I don't even know if I'd let Reb lead me in a game of horseshoes let alone on a reconnaissance endeavor. No tears are shed on this journey as people are killed and you have no iota clue or concern about who they are or what purpose they serve except as bullet fodder. Thrill at the menacing Omega 1 that reminds me to get multivitamins at GNC this week as his state of the art pixelated killovision makes him...well pretty lame. His 8 bit speech makes him sound like he contracted a form of Robot Tourettes. I can't be too angry with him as he helps to thin the herd thus providing a semblance of entertainment. Herr Mattei also had access to bio lab skeletons and you're bloody sure that he was going to use them!All levity aside many thanks to Smoke Manmuscle I mean Reb for making this trial somewhat amusing. Whether it's his high shrilled heliumated octaves of unforgettable lines such as 'Incoming get out of here!' and 'Move out!' or his constant bickering with Mascher less than Carl Weathers and more like Andy Richter's shady uncle Murphy Black weathers the storm to the beat of a Casio laced soundtrack.

	schema:reviewBody "There was very little chance of this film not being badass. A combined ripoff of Predator and Robocop directed by hack trash grand wizard Bruno Mattei and starring veritable Colossus of kickass charisma Reb Brown in the Arnie role along with Massimo Vanni looking like Chuck Norris and the always reliable Jim Gaines and a script by husband and wife superscribes Claudio Fragasso Troll 2 Zombie 4 After Death and Rosella Drudi. Oh and our Claudio is also the guy in the robot suit credited under his regular pseudonym of Clyde Anderson. Anybody reading this already knows whether this film is for them or not people generally are either Mattei fans or have sh!tty taste. But for your sake dear reader I shall go on lest you not be quite convinced. The pacing is the only drawback here the film takes a little while to really get into the groove so during the first third there's mostly the dialogue to go on. Fortunately the dialogue is worthy of Mamet my favorite line being probably You walk like a ruptured duck . Clearly a film that should be shown to screen writing classes as an example of how to get this sort of thing right. The action is pretty steady when it gets going though. Things tend to alternate between people and trees being shot up real good and trees and huts being blown up real good with occasional people being blown up real good for varieties sake. Oh and there is a bit of knife work but I don't know that I'd describe it as real good. It's OK though.Basically if you like films full of people walking around in the jungle and shooting at trees with occasional explosions and a robot that speaks in comically mangled digital gibberish then this is a film for you. I like all of these things so Robowar was definitely a film for me. It even musters up occasional pockets of genuine excitement and suspense in amongst the hilarity and repetition with a climax that is more affecting than one might expect. There's no gore other than mangled corpses and a severed limb and no sleaze which definitely hurts things but as far as goofy action trash aimed at the undemanding goes this is definitely a winner. Not as good as the classic Strike Commando mind you but in Mattei rip off terms this is pretty darned decent. Way better than Shocking Dark at any rate. So watch it folks!".

Why waste my time cooking up a synopsis right? A virtual scenefor scene shotforshot remake of the big budget scifi epic ROBOWAR is bad. So bad that it is amazing. There are some liberties taken with the source material though. Reb Brown's top secret unit is named B.A.M. Bad Assed Mutherfuckers. When they assault the village Brown throws a smaller knife into a mercenary and then quips Hang around! as opposed to Arnold's Stick around. Oh yeah and the group's native empath is named named Quang and of Filipino descent. Sadly no What's got Quang so spooked? line. Mattei usually wouldn't settle for just one flick to rip off and throws us a curve ball by also copying 1987's other classic scifi flick ROBOCOP. You see Omega One turns out to be part man part machine. Even funnier the human chunks inside are Brown's old Nam buddy Woodrig. And yes Brown does say Woodrig it's you!".

But no one until Mattei had the gall to just brazenly ape a popular movie scenebyscene shotbyshot linebyline.ROBOWAR is an obvious remake of PREDATOR only changed slightly to accommodate the total lack of budget.

Thankfully the bulk of the actual film is largely stockfootagefree though you'll recognize a lot of the locations from other MatteiFragasso Filipino films like the old hut from AFTER DEATH.The great cast including Romano Puppo Massimo Vanni Jim Gaines Max Laurel etc. actually turn in surprisingly good acting. Even star Reb Brown performs much better here than in his other ItaloFilipino outings. Not Olivierquality of course but COMPARATIVELY good. It's amazing too considering Mattei stages them either theatrically everyone crammed into a mastershot or shoots them shotforshot like scenes in PREDATOR. Good yet idiotically staged action scenes come fast and furious but are interspersed with more than enough filler shots of Reb Brown and Co. wandering through the jungle.The only real kudos go for the pyrotechnic crew for plenty of lovable slow motion explosions as well as Al Festa and his wonderfully cheesetastic 80's synthesizer spectacular score. While nothing as heinously 80's as AFTER DEATH and COP GAME it's in a pretty similar league.People who like this film and get a kick out of linebyline ripoffs should also seek out Mattei's notquiteasfunbutstillhilarious SHOCKING DARK which did the same thing with ALIENS and TERMINATOR.".

The answer is definitely yes! For a movie with almost no plot it's surprisingly fastpaced and rather than have a lot of dialogue it's mainly yelling and shooting machine guns. However there are some gems such as You walk like a ruptured duck!. Maybe something was lost in translation but we're sure glad it was. There are other silly oneliners but this was our favorite.Fanfavorite Reb Brown is out in force here  looking especially ripped in his childsize halfshirt he gets to command his team with his trademark screams. But let's not forget about the cool nicknames of the people he's stranded in the jungle with  Blood The Hunter and Papa Doc. Naturally they were picked for this mission because they're The Best. As for the robot we get some pixelated robovision and it seems like a guy in a motorcycle outfit. But he also has a confused scrambled robovoice as well which seems heavily influenced by Buck Rogers' Twiki and his famous bidi bidi bidi. It doesn't exactly inspire terror but hey who's to say how we'd feel if we were in that situation? As if this wasn't awesome enough the robot can shoot lasers. Of course they're of the pew pew variety! That alone raises the coolness quotient of this movie. And because this never received a VHS release in America maybe they didn't want to roll the dice with rights issues? we were sadly deprived of this minor gem in the 80's and 90's. Honestly it's still pretty hard to find presumably having been released largely in Japan and Italy and we thank Sutekh over at Explosive Action for hooking us up with a copy.If you ever wished Predator was an Italianmade Exploding Hut movie shot in the Philippines and had a robot instead of a Predator this is surely the movie for you. Featuring a great synth score by Al Festa and released in the golden year of 1989 Robowar is shameless...ly entertaining fun.For more action insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

One of the last films Mattei made before his death was called Cannibal Ferox 3 Land of Death and it was an extremely blatant imitation of Predator where he simply replaced the intergalactic hunter with a tribe of cannibals. When I watched that film I didn't even know yet that Robowar existed and was thus unaware of the fact that Mattei already pulled off the exact same trick nearly twenty years earlier! This is again a shameless and outright ripoff of the classic 80's action flick starring Arnold Schwarzenegger yet this time replacing the alien with an outofcontrol robot that was initially designed as a  surprise surprise  hi tech secret warfare weapon. Every other even remotely memorable element of Predator gets copied here like the testosteronedriven lead characters rotting human cadavers lying all around the jungle the blurry computerized view from inside the robot's helmet entire pieces of dialogs and even the whoplayedwho end credits! Needless to say this is a terribly inept and laughable Bmovie exploitation product but it is guaranteed entertainment to watch especially in case you're an avid fan of typically Italian trash. Bunch of beefcake mercenaries all of them with badboy attitudes and carrying around heavy artillery to compensate for their lack of brain capacities are sent into to the jungle to complete a mission they know absolutely nothing about. They end up facing a practically indestructible handmade killing machine although it suspiciously looks like a guy in a latex suit talking like he's a defect cassette with songs for children on it. The RoboSoldier wipes out everyone before the replacement Arnie leader Reb Brown discovers it was constructed using spare body parts from his buddy who died in the Vietnam War. End of story. Obviously Robowar is just an insignificant and utterly brainless popcorn SciFiactionWar flick with nothing else than explosives and violent shootouts. Speaking of which I guess Bruno Mattei spent most of the nearly nonexistent budget on explosives and ammunition! These dimwitted mercenaries literally fire off gazillions of bullets. Multiple sequences exist of one hireling randomly starting to shoot at trees and the others joyously join in and waste an entire arsenal. But hey giving the quality of the acting performances a serenade of bullets is actually less painful to listen to than the atrocious dialogs. The robot is hilariously cheesy especially when he produces noise and recollects his past. I cannot possibly reward this movie with a rating that is any higher 3 out of 10 but please rest assured it is recommended and guaranteed entertainment!  note if you are like me a sucker for old movie posters and DVD illustrations you might have noticed that the cover image depicted here on this page is not Robowar but for Robo Man an even obscurer 70's SciFi sleeper.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robowar 1988  out of 4Maj. Murphy Black Reb Brown leads a group of men into the jungles where they can't possibly imagine what is about to attack them. Inside the jungle is an alien creature who will slowly stalk and kill them.Plagorism is one of the most serious crimes that a writer can commit and often times it will end their career or at least put a black cloud over it. For some reason filmmaker Bruno Mattei ripped off countless movies in his career. Often times he would not only ripoff plots but also entire sequences lines of dialogue and much more. With that said for some reason Mattei is still a legend in his own way as bad movie lovers flock to his films.ROBOWAR is a ripoff of PREDATOR but it also rips on ROBOCOP. The alien here stalks the people in the jungle just like PREDATOR but his outfit is pure metal like ROBOCOP. I can understand how some people would watch movies like this and have a good time with their badness but sadly this film isn't in that so bad it's good range. Instead ROBOWAR is just a really lowbudget movie and a really bad one at that.The performances direction editing story and pretty much everything else are downright awful but that's to be expected. What's so bad about this movie is that it really doesn't reach a sleazy level as the violence is rather tame and there's not much blood or gore. In fact just take a look at a sequence where a group of men are shot up with some large guns. The men are hit with countless bullets but not a drop of blood spills.The action scenes are all rather stupid but the ending is nice in terms of explosions. As far as the alien goes it looks incredibly silly and it almost looks like a futuristic version of the killer seen in THE NAILGUN MASSACRE. I'm sure some might find a few laughs in how bad the movie it but sadly it's too boring to be enjoyed.".

Also Omega1 is really a cyborg with he brain of Murphy's old friend Lt. Martin Woodrie.Only Murphy and Virginia survive despite numerous attacks by the cyborg. At the end the cyborg corners Murphy in the jungle and shows him how to initiate his selfdestruct sequence. And that's that.Even I can't defend the fact that I waste nearly ninety minutes of my life watching this movie. On my deathbed I will pull my family close and whisper I only regret one thing.

This one is just a pain to watch. As for Mattei while he's considered by many to be the Italian Ed Wood he needs to just leave originals alone and stop trying to ripoff other versions of good movies. It's bad enough he would end up making a ripoff of TERMINATOR 2 even though it's more like ALIEN than T2. This movie is confounded by bad acting lame dialogue and from the looks of it the script is only about 15 pages long!! It rarely makes any sense at any given time! It is interesting to see Catherine Hickland in an early role she would gain notoriety in the world of soap operas...more specifically One Life to Live. This film is rubbish!".

Believe me you haven't seen anything like this before.Reb Brown Strike Commando stars as Reb Brown Strike Commando leader of the Big As Muthfckas a squad of soldiers hired to go into the jungles of Venezuela to stop guerrilla activity. What a line up! You've got Romano Puppo Street Law Bronx Warriors 2 Jim Gaines After Death and a buffed up Massimo Vanni Street Law Bronx Warriors 2 and After Death. Some other guys too including an ethnic guide in touch with nature Where does Bruno get these ideas? a doctor and a mysterious gentleman along for the ride that Reb is suspicious of but judging by the skin tight halftshirt Reb's wearing when he gets off that boat I'm guessing Reb doesn't think about things too deeply so he lets him come along anyway.Things get strange for our macho mofos the moment they discover a pile of human bodies torn to bits. What we the audience know but Reb and co don't is that there is an experimental soldierrobot on the loose killing everything in sight and that guy who's joined them is its creator. I know it sounds a bit like Robocop but Bruno has the insight to inject a bit of originality to the film including Reb going head to head with a bunch of guerrillas and picking himself up a chick sidekick into the proceedings.The lads start to get the idea that they're being stalked which leads to several scenes of Massimo et al firing wildly into the foliage no doubt a satiric remark on Mattei's part regarding the futility of US military might versus guerrilla warfare in Vietnam. Also Reb and Jim Gaines! scream like girls every time they fire their machine guns a reference to Strike Commando. Reb also gets in a couple of quips saying 'Don't move' to a guy he's impaled with a machete complete with a wink to all the ladies out in the audience. Hollywood take note this is how you do an action horror film.Okay okay I'll level with you. This film bears a lot of similarity to another film you may have seen set in the jungle and involving marines facing something they've never encountered before being picked off one by one in various gory ways. And that film of course is After Death. Not only does the hospital from that film turn up here in an unforgettable home made napalm set piece but the very soundtrack from that film turns up at various times. As an even more glaring example of the intricities of Bruno Mattei's conceptual continuity the director of that film here plays the killer robot. Vast legions of fans devote themselves to finding all these 'clues' in Mattei's film.So although Massino Romano etc put up a good fight you know the film is going to boil down the Reb being the Final Girl. There's a few twists at the end I won't reveal here and I'm sure Mattei's making some comment about the faceless terrorist threat the West faces every day by having the Venezuelan extras played by Filipino actors but that's just the multilayered complexities of a Bruno Mattei film hell I'm still finding things in Zombie Creeping Flesh after all these years.This film is crying out for an American remake probably starring someone weedy and terrible like Adrian Brody. I can't think of single person who could replace Reb in such a role. Also check out the mixed up credits for Jim Gaines and Massimo Alex McBride Vanni  another little injoke for us uberfans.".

I don't want to write spoilers in this review since the film debuts this week in Israel. I will only say that Tehilim is one of the strongest attempts ever made in Israel to make a truly religious work of art but due to tragic screen writing failures this film is doomed to be an unfulfilled attempt. what a shame!".

To begin with the mystery of Eli Frankel's disappearance is never solved which in my view makes the movie more interesting real life is full of unexplainable unresolved situations. Second the movie is a pitiless indictment of religious fanaticism. The reaction of Menachem the eldest son his uncle Aaron and his grandfather Shmuel to Eli's disappearance is finding obsessive refuge in religion prayers need to be said following strict rules otherwise they will be ineffective. It doesn't seem to occur to anybody that there is a need to talk with people that Eli knew at work and elsewhere that photos of Eli need to be posted on walls and newspapers or that a private investigator should be hired the police is not able or willing to help as would happen in any country. Nobody in the family seems to have the slightest curiosity about Eli's fate. Uncle Aaron seems a rather good natured fellow although somewhat inconsiderate with his sisterinlaw Alma Eli's wife Alma's opinions or ideas don't seem to be very relevant to any of the male characters. Grandfather Shmuel is anything but a good fellow. He has an abusive personality he refuses to understand that Alma wants some space for herself a need that she clearly states. Shmuel's conversation with Menachem about the lost prayer books uncomfortably resembles a police interrogation in fact the policemen and policewomen in the movie are more gentle and caring than him. Cruelly he insinuates that Eli's disappearance was caused by Alma's secularism. This probably does not mean that Alma is not religious but that she is not as much of a fanatic as Shmuel we see her celebrating the Sabbath with her family. Menachem idolizes his grandfather and as the movie progresses shows disquieting character traits that resemble those of Shmuel.If anything the tribulations of the Frankel family show that religious fanaticism unlike genuine religion does not coexist easily with plain logical thinking or with the skills needed to survive in today's society. Then again in a movie as openended as this one conclusions are dangerous for instance does somebody in Eli's family knows something about the disappearance that the audience doesn't? And finally the boundary fanatlcismgenuine religiosity is difficult to identify.Acting is excellent throughout. Characters are fleshed out with skill and the action progresses without slack. Music is haunting. First rate work by script writer Vincent Poymiro and director Raphal Nadjari.".

And young and leggy Susan George who was 18 at the time is also both touching and delightful as Lola as the two turn heads every were they go in the movie from London to New York City. Scott who's really not at first in love with the very frisky and overbearing Lola falls for her more out of not wanting to hurt Lola feelings then anything else. Scott even leaves his what seems like fianc UrslaSue Llyodfor the young and perky Lola without as much as a second thought. Lola's parents who at first are shocked with her relationship with an older man and writer of Adult Novels later give in and give the two their consent to marry. Before you know it the two lovebirds are married in Glasgow Scotland and off to New York City to meet Scott's parents who are about to get the shock of their lives and live together as man and wife.In the Big Apple things start to unwind when it becomes obvious that Lola isn't exactly the woman that Scott is willing to spend the rest of his life with.

Scott fears that a breakup would lead to her killing herself and staying married would have him as well as Lola be miserable for the rest of their lives. It's in the end that Lola is the one to end the relationship by leaving Scott a Dear John letter on her blackboard as well as her pet black cat Mouse for him to take care of. As she left for London to get back to the life she left when she fell in love with him. Not as bad or corny as you might at first thought Lola treats the relationship between the much older Scott and the teeny bopper Lola much better and honest than you would have expected from that kind of a movie. The movie does it with both sensitively and care not with sleaze and sensationalism. The movie also has besides Charles Bronson and Susan George an all star cast that you also wouldn't expect from a lowbudget and unknown film like it with Honor Blackman and Michael Craig as well as Paul Ford and Key Medford as Lola's and Scott's parents. There's also the very talented but rarely seen in motion pictures Orsen Bean as Scott's best friend and family lawyer Hal and look for a very young Jill Ireland who was later to become Mrs. Charles Bronson as an extra at the airport in the movie.".

There are other visual attractions besides the leads though  some nice settings and camera work.The problem is that whilst the basic plot itself is somewhat plausible it's just not handled to the depth that it could be. Bronson does a passable job as the writer who tries to be Hubby but ends up feeling more like Daddy half the time but it is not his best effort by far. He really does better in thrillers like Telefon. Susan George as well as most of the actresses playing her friendspeers comes off as being fairly vacuous and acts more like she's 11 than 16. Perhaps this is meant to help us share some of Bronson's character's discomfort  but then he married her because she guilts him into it or he guilts himself? Or what? I'm not buying it. Perhaps if there were some genuine deep chemistry and passion between the two but I don't get that. The entire relationship comes off more like a long uncomfortable playdate.Okay maybe it's supposed to  but then what's the point?And whilst as a male with the typical appreciation for the female form I can't say I really object strenuously to this but hey  she wears a miniskirt in every scene even in NYC in the wintertime? C'mon...The soundtrack is also fairly hokey even given when this film was made and makes it feel even more contrived.I gave this film a 6 of 10 because it's pleasant enough entertainment for the I'venodatetonight circuit and because I'm a Bronson fan but no higher because it really never draws in the viewer and fails to make any lasting statement or impression.".

After the initial interaction between the two in Bronno's flat Twinky burns his breakfast  hilarious!! they rush off to Scotland to get married Twinky rushes off to show her school friends her new bloke then the pair rush off to New York to meet his family.All this rushing means the movie gets sillier and sillier as Twinky joins a protest Charlie B goes to prison and the viewer doesn't know what absurd event will happen next. With the final denouement a fight where Charles gets a bit shirty cos Twinky is distracting him and so she hides for three days my patience finally wore out  these two people have nothing in common and never have for the entire length of the film. Even when Twinky returns for England the viewer was left with a sense of the ridiculous as why would they divorce after their very first fight?Insomnia has a lot to answer for  I was up at 2am watching this messy film I saw it through to the end but I have to say it was bit too silly. My only recommendation would be to watch is as a good example of the aforementioned sexual wishfulfillment and of sixties fashion or if you just can't sleep!".

	schema:reviewBody "Swing right into this undoubtedly silly but mildly charming lightheaded 60's British sex comedy  drama starring the stonelike persona of Charles Bronson and the young scarlet Susan George. Actually it's her long legs that become the centre piece because most of the time she's fluffing about in miniskirts. The story focuses on a middleaged American erotica writer who falls in love with a sixteen year old British school girl. When her family finds out about their relationship everything is turned upside down. Despite that they eventually marry in Scotland since the law there allows it and then head to America but this is when their relationship is put to the test.Now the subject matter here is risky but the whimsical script and Richard Donner's peachy direction makes light of it by having fun at its expense. So if anyone is looking for something raunchy and perverted. Look elsewhere. Susan George brings a playful innocence to her role maybe too much for a 16 yearold? but on the other side of the coin Bronson's casually brooding performance is a hard one to make out. The chemistry between the two is terribly spotty. A glowing support cast are nothing more than nutty inclusions. Honor Blackman Michael Craig and especially Trevor Howard are great fun to watch as Lola's family. In lesser but worthwhile turns are Lionel Jefferies Jack Hawkins and Robert Morley.After a quirky and spirited poplike firsthalf where the story amusingly moves back and forth between Twinky's parents and her confronting Scott about her parents knowing. Then the film changes when it reaches America. Becoming quite glum laboured and fairly straight well just say not as kooky. The relationship begins to crumble but at the beginning it wasn't all that convincing that you wonder how did it last as long as it did. The whole thing feels messy and so does its message. There's just no depth or structure to it all to leave an impression. The ending is rather awkward too. Richard Donner does a serviceable job and includes some fashionable filming techniques slowmo freeze frames montages and the jazzy score with plenty of colour and features some bogus theme songs.".

I've never seen Bronson like this and never known him to be a romantic lead. I would love to know what Susan George thought of Bronson while filming this.

He plays an American writer of pornographic novels living in Britain who gets involved with a teenage British girl Susan George. Her parents are less than thrilled although personally I'd be too scared to tell Bronson he couldn't date my teenage daughter. But the real trouble comes when he takes her back to America to meet his own judgmental family and where the disparity in their ages starts to take its toll.The American title of this Lola may suggest it was inspired by the notorious Vladimir Nabokov novel Lolita but the original British title was actually Twinky and it was allegedly based on an autobiographical! story by screenwriter Norman Thaddeus Vane who might have been even more sexcrazed than Roman Polanskiat least Polasnski didn't make movies about his affairs with underage girls. The title Lola without the diminutive ita is somewhat appropriate though because casting the then 19yearold Susan George in the role takes away the seriously perverse elements of the story you'd have to be a sick pervert to NOT be attracted to her. So this becomes more of just an absurd comedy about an older guy trying to carry on an affair with a much younger girl who he is really more of a father figure to.This is probably not a favorite of Bronson fans but he was such a rigidly typecast actor kind of like John Wayne that its nice to see him play a different role He's miscast but not nearly as much as Wayne was playing Genghis Khan. Susan George doesn't really have much to do but ride around on a bike in her schoolgirl outfit but believe me that's plenty. Director Richard Donner seems a little embarrassed by this he took his name off the print I saw but this is the same guy that made those stupid Lethal Weapon movies with that douchebag Mel Gibson. . . This isn't great but you just can't go totally wrong with an oddball offbeat movie like this.".
