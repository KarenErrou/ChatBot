	schema:reviewBody "According to The Films of Edward G. Robinson this entry in the 2008 Film Noir Series at the Egyptian on April 18 was pretty much dismissed by critics and the star itself. After all this came right after his masterful performance in John Huston's Key Largo for which he teamed up with Humphrey Bogart for the last time. This film barely shows up in Gail Russell's bio who's probably best known as John Wayne's costar in Angel and the Badman the first time he utters pilgrim as that was what she played. However Night did generally get a positive response with modern audiences. Director John Farrow father of Mia provided a good atmosphere and generally kept the narrative at the good pace. It begins with John Lund the third name above the title saving Russell from suicide. From there they meet Robinson at a restaurant and who has already ordered exactly what they want. Then he tells in flashback that he actually knew her parents quite well. As played by Virginia Bruce and Jerome Cowan hey manage his clairvoyant act in which he actually gets glimpses of the future. In fact he actually quits when an unfortunate event happens that I won't give away. Where he retires to is of special notice to old time Angeleno fans. He's seen going to his Bunker Hill residence from taking Angel's Flight. It is from there he brings the audience back to the present. Of special interest among the cast is William Demarest who appeared in just about every Preston Sturges comedy during this time period. Playing straight he's nevertheless is quite comical as the dumb police detective. The ending is actually quite well written. It has an intriguing twist and some of the best prose Robinson's voice was ever given to speak. A great film noir.".

However other stories of his written under his real name or as William Irish became film. THE LEOPARD MAN one of the first of Val Lewton's Bfeature productions was based on one of his stories. So is THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES.Edward G. Robinson is a clairvoyant who worked with Jerome Cowan in a mentalist act. Only one problem  Robinson discovers he actually can predict the future. Unfortunately in Woolrich's realistic view of the seen and unseen world having a psychic power is not necessarily good. Robinson can foresee good things he forsees that Cowan's buying into a potential oil field operation will make millions but he also sees tragedy frequently. The woman he loves the third person in the act wants to marry him but he suddenly refuses  he sees problems about her pregnancy. She marries Cowan  and dies giving birth to the daughter who becomes Gail Russell. Robinson soon discovers he cannot stop tragedy. When he warns a newsboy to be careful going home he tries to reassure the boy by giving him a large tip. The boy starts running home and gets hit and presumably killed by a car. Robinson has contacted Cowan to warn him that he should not go flying. Cowan's plane crashes and he is killed. Robinson than contacts Russell to try to help her. Her boyfriend John Lund at first rejects Robinson's warnings but as they uncannily come true becomes increasingly convinced that Robinson not a faker. But Detective William Demerest in a curious mixed role half serious and half comic is not sure  it seems somebody tampered with the wiring of Cowan's plane. So the movie progresses  is Robinson legitimately psychic and trying to help Russell or is he the evil genius in some plan to get control of the fortune. And as Cowan was in the middle of a major oil merger when he died many others are interested in knowing the truth...or hiding it.This film for some reason always gets mediocre reviews in the New York Times movie reviews. Actually it's quite compelling and far more inviting a story about sixth sense powers than many more important and expensive productions. I feel that it is close to Robinson's most sympathetic role and the conclusion of the film certainly makes it almost Shakespearean in it's tragic denouement.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't think of a film from any era that has a more captivatingly mysterious mood than this film. Ever since I saw it on TV in the early 60's I've never forgotten it.John Triton Edward G Robinson is a clairvoyant with a phony act who begins to realize that he can predict the future for real. However he feels this gift is more of a curse because although he knows what will happen he is never able to reverse the outcome. A troubled man he withdraws into anonymity for 20 years. He returns when he predicts the death of an old friend and then that of the man's daughter Jean Courtland Gail Russell. Eventually he tries to alter the course of the prediction which also portends his own death.The seductive style of this film told for much of its length in flashback is due to inspired choices in script direction photography and music and of course to Cornell Woolwich's original novel although most of his plot and characters were jettisoned. What the film did retain was the novel's allpervading mood. Like other films based on Woolwich's stories such as Rear Window and Original Sin not much beyond the original idea was ever retained.Most importantly Night Has a Thousand Eyes has actors who draw you into the story and hold you there. As the story unfolds you feel that Edward G Robinson's character has gained painful wisdom  he is infinitely patient with all his doubters. Robinson is the focal point of the story and his mellifluous narration sweeps us along.The other person who gives this film depth is the beautiful and ethereal Gail Russell as Jean Courtland. Her performance has added poignancy when you know of the star's real fate  she died at 36 from selfdoubt as much as from anything else. She always seemed to project a sense of sadness in her films. What a presence she had she was always good but especially so here.Look how much mood is generated with all the references to the stars above John Triton predicts that Jean  will die at night under the stars. Jean becomes haunted by the thought and feels the stars are Like a thousand eyes. Watching! Although there are only a couple of shots of starstudded skies in the film much of the story is set at night and we feel the presence of the stars all the time. Adding to the sense of something beyond the tangible is Victor Young's velvety score.The film has a measured pace particularly Gail Russell and Edward G Robinson's delivery. Expatriate Australian director John Farrow Mia's dad directed the film and much of its style must be down to him. The film was shot mainly on studio sets except for a very effective sequence in San Francisco.Odd that this film has been so hard to track down it is simply one of the best of its kind and is impossible to forget.".

Robinson is one of those night club mind readers who tells the audience things about themselves with the help of an associate who plays clues at the piano. By the way one of the customers that he stuns with his amazing but phony powers is a pretty young lady named Agnes. Agnes has only one line but she became the mother of Sally Field the flying nun. Few people are aware of this portentous datum outside the Field family but I pass it on to you as an act of personal generosity. That will be fifteen cents.The first half is kind of interesting. Robinson is wheeling through his fakery when he's interrupted by a sudden vision. He urgently sends an audience member home because her house is on fire. After the show his puzzled assistants ask what it was all about and Robinson dismisses it as a passing thought he'd had and after all what difference does it make? Later they find that the house really WAS on fire and a child was barely saved. Robinson is troubled but his partners aren't.Eventually he leaves the act holes up for twenty years and reappears in time to save a girl who might well have been his own daughter except for an act of self sacrifice. The girl is Gail Russell and she's well worth saving. Russell was plucked out of a local high school because of her looks hurriedly given a few acting lessons and thrust before the cameras. But she was self conscious and terrified of appearing in the movies took to drinking to steady her nerves wrecked her life and died in her mid30s desolate. Any wrecked life is a misfortune but in her case it was a little more than that because she was almost infinitely appealing  not gorgeous by Hollywood standards but with her tentative girlish voice her mane of curly black hair and her pale blue eyes she radiated a combination of vulnerability and sex appeal. In this film she winds up with John Lund which may have been a milestone along her downward trajectory  or maybe the cause of it.Robinson turns in a competent and thoroughly professional performance as the showman who changes from a freewheeling bankrupt into a man genuinely tormented by the possibility that he himself  through his visions  is somehow CAUSING the disasters he predicts.I'm not going through the plot because if the first half is simple and neat the second half has a loopy logic and turns into a highbudget Charlie Chan mystery. Well I'll give one example. Robinson has had a vision of Russell being murdered under the stars the titular thousand eyes at eleven o'clock at night. He's taken seriously enough that the police have guards all around her mansion. She's also attended by some skeptical business managers of her estate. The rooms are guarded the doors locked and all that. The tension increases as eleven o'clock approaches. At about fifteen minutes before eleven a hand reaches slowly from behind a curtain and moves the time on the grandfather clock ahead by ten minutes. When the clock strikes eleven everyone breathes a sigh of relief. Whew. It's now past eleven and Russell still breathes. Of course the REAL eleven o'clock hasn't yet got here. So when the relaxed Russell wanders out alone into the garden a few minutes later she's attacked by the murderer who is a person of no significance whatever to the plot and who is just trying to stop a business deal from going through.Okay. So why did the murderer move the hands of the clock ahead? Why didn't he wait until the REAL eleven o'clock had come and gone. After all what the hell does HE care about what time he murders Russell? This is Charlie Chan territory.But I enjoyed it. The hint of the supernatural is always fascinating. As Robinson observes we've all felt something similar at one time or another  we know who's on the phone before we pick it up or we enter a strange room and we're certain we've been there before. And Robinson may be right about it. It was about twenty years ago that the American Association for the Advancement of Science finally added a Section H covering paranormal phenomena. Who knows?".

In fact the production pulls off the difficult trick of making occult happenings seem almost plausible something Hollywood rarely cares about doing. Robinson's turn is firstrate as a stage magician suddenly burdened with the power of precognition. Watching Triton Robinson slowly succumb to the terrible reality of foreseeing the future amounts to a dramatic triumph. He has no control over these pre visions and they're almost always of dark happenings especially when involving the sweetly vulnerable Jean Courtland Russell. The climax is a stunner as the clues to Jean's bleak future slowly come true while there seems no alternative to fate having its evil way.This is one of the darkest of noirs both literally and figuratively. Generally the lighting is too shadowy to catch the ethereal Russell's pale blue eyes a feature that would have added to the overall mood. It's also nicely ironic that the real occult would step into the life of a magician who only pretends to conjure other dimensions for the delight of paying audiences. It's like a punishment for presuming to toy with the surreal. I also like the way others remain militantly skeptical since that would be a natural reaction.In my book the movie's clearly underrated by the professionals and I'm not sure why. If the production's got an overriding flaw I can't find it though I could have done with less of the theramin whose eerie sound is like gravy on soup. Nonetheless for me the overall result is one of the best to deal with a topic that's usually made hokey as heck by Hollywood and that's besides having one of the most intriguing titles in movie annals.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first scene is Elliott Carson John Lund rescuing his fiance Jean Courtland Gail Russell from committing suicide  he was told where and how by John Triton. He takes her into a nearby caf where John Triton Edward G. Robinson is sitting at one of the caf tables. Elliot assumes because of Jean's wealth that Triton is part of some kind of con game. Triton then begins his story in flashback. Years before he had a vaudeville act in which he pretended to be one who could see the future. As he says it was a phony act but it was a firstclass phony act. Then one night in the middle of a show he has his first real premonition and tells one particular woman that her child is in danger and she must run home. Another time he is talking to a little boy behind the theater and has a premonition that he will be run over by a car. He says something to change the boys plans  he gives him free tickets to the show. The boy says he needs to go tell his mom and of course he's run over by a car anyways. Meanwhile his  let us be kind and just call him less deep and thoughtful  colleague Whitney Courtland Jerome Cowan is using John's ability to make a fortune in finance.Meanwhile John is haunted by the bad premonitions he is getting about which he can do nothing. The last is the worst though. He sees the future of his love Jenny Virginia Bruce. In his premonition the two marry there is a child the child lives but Jenny dies. So one night he clears out and decides to become a recluse. If he doesn't talk to anyone he can't see their bad end which he can't seem to change anyways. He knows Whitney will take care of Jenny and he does. The two marry have a child and just as in his premonition Jenny dies in childbirth. Gail Russell's character Jean is the daughter that would have been his so he does keep track of her over the years. He moves to L.A. just to be in the same town as she and her dad. And then the trouble starts again. First he gets a premonition about Whitney's death when he hears about him trying to break a flight record. Thus he chances meeting Jenny's daughter Jean and warns her about the premonition he has. She tries contacting her dad but it's too late. His plane has cracked up and Whitney is dead. Then John gets a premonition about Jean's death under the stars and we are back to the present in the caf.John wants to retreat back into his little world but not until he can finally save someone and not just anyone. He wants to save the daughter that might have been his had things been different. Of course now he has the suspicious fianc to contend with along with the police whom the fianc calls who say they found foul play involved in the crack up of Whitney's plane and suspect John as being part of some conspiracy plus they think he could be a little nuts and have the police psychiatrists examining him. Meanwhile Jean is in danger and is being guarded by skeptics. How will this all pan out? Watch and find out.Edward G. Robinson plays the melancholy clairvoyant just brilliantly as you can see how this supposed gift is weighing him down. Like Peter Boyle in the XFiles episode Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose a gift is not much of a gift if all it does is give you visions of pain and death you can't seem to change. It is a very gloomy film from the start with the atmosphere of a noir but not with the kinds of characters and situations normally associated with noir. Highly recommended.".

The visions reveal the future to Triton in the most upsetting and frightening ways. Quitting his act as psychic Triton the Magnificent when he realized that he in fact did have psychic powers Triton has been living in the wilderness away from civilization in the slum drastic of Los Angeles for some time. That until he ran into both Jean Courtland and her pop Whitney Gail Russell  Jerome Cowam at a local L.A fund raising dinner and all of a sudden all these strange and terrifying visions started to come back to him. This lead to Jean attempting to kill herself by jumping in from of a speeding locomotive which her fiance Elliott Carson John Lund saved her from doing.We soon learn that all of Triton's troubles started when he was working on stage as a psychic with both Jean's parents Whitney  Jenny Virginia Bruce Courtland some 20 years ago. It was then that Triton suddenly developed these psychic powers in seeing the future that completely freaked him out. Now seeing what's in store for Jean he's doing his best to prevent that from happening. The story is a long one but it's all about Whitney's involvement in the oil business. Having made millions over the years he now wants to cash in his chips or oil interests but there's someone behind the scenes that's trying to prevent him from doing it. Going so far in fixing his plane to make sure that Whitney end up crashing in it on his coast to coast flight from NY to LA. And it's Triton who foresaw that and couldn't prevent it from happening.

A fact that Triton knew all along but kept from the police as well as himself ! In one of his most unusual roles Edward G.

	schema:headline " A Tale Of One Man's Personal Hell";
	schema:reviewBody "This decidedly creepy screen adaptation of Cornell Woolrich's novel of the same name is offbeat and gripping right from the start. Its story of a man who's troubled by his ability to foresee the future becomes increasingly distressing as his unwanted talent gradually destroys his life and fills him with guilt about the tragedies that he sees in his visions. Sadly because his visions can't be controlled and noone can change the hand of fate there seems to be no way out of this man's personal Hell.Suicidal heiress Jean Courtland Gail Russell is standing on a bridge poised to leap in front of an oncoming train when her fianc Elliott Carson John Lund suddenly appears and prevents her from jumping. When the young couple retreat to a nearby caf and meet up with the man who'd saved Jean's life by alerting Elliott to the danger that she was in their conversation proves to be very enlightening.John Triton Edward G Robinson explains that twenty years earlier he and Jean's parents Whitney Jerome Cowan and Jenny Virginia Bruce had been partners in a touring vaudeville act in which he was a phoney mindreader his best friend Whitney played the piano and his fiance Jenny was the glamorous assistant. During this period John started to have visions that proved to be accurate predictions of future events and Whitney capitalised on this by using John's tips to prosper through gambling and playing the stock market. One night when they were all on stage together John became terribly upset and had to bring the performance to a sudden end when he had a vision of Jenny after their marriage dying in childbirth. In order to prevent this premonition from becoming a reality and without telling his partners what he'd seen he decided to leave the act and simply disappear but not before giving Whitney some advice about making an investment in an oil business.John became a recluse and after some time had passed with no word from him Whitney and Jenny married but Jenny subsequently died in childbirth. John went on to live a very quiet and lonely life in the Bunker Hill district of L.A. until a short time before Jean's suicide attempt when he contacted her because he'd had a vision of Whitney dying in a plane crash. Jean's efforts to contact her father proved unsuccessful and as predicted he perished in the wreckage of his plane.Elliott is very sceptical and thinks that John's a charlatan working on some sort of scam to get his hands on Jean's money but Jean trusts him implicitly. This is because she remembers how fondly her father had spoken of his best friend and his impressive psychic powers. John then becomes distraught after having a vision in which he foresees Jean's death and despite the apparent futility of the idea becomes absolutely determined to prevent her demise.This moody thriller has a strange mesmeric quality and a level of tension that grows steadily with each new development. Its ominous atmosphere is beautifully complemented by Victor Young's effective score and John F Seitz's top class cinematography but it's the knockout performance by Edward G Robinson that provides the real icing on the cake. His tragic character sums up his predicament at one point when he says that this gift which I never asked for and don't understand has brought me only unhappiness. Having lost the love of his life and his best friend because of his gift and being condemned to a life of isolation and loneliness  he then gets openly disrespected by most people who think he's a fraud or a criminal and knows that all he faces in the future is the unending torment that he'll inevitably experience until his own demise.What Robinson captures so brilliantly is John Triton's innate decency as well as the melancholia that has understandably engulfed him as a result of his experiences. The supporting cast is also consistently good with Gail Russell standing out as a great choice for her role because her appearance and deportment make her privileged but troubled character so convincing.".

Robinson lends some dignity to Night Has a Thousand Eyes which concerns a fake psychic who reads peoples' minds and answers their questions about love and happiness but the psychic soon discovers he has strange premonitions about people dying. These premonitions come true. We open on Gail Russell running at night paranoid of being watched and about to end her life but John Lund saves her. The film's story is told by way of flashbacks in the beginning as to how Edward knew her father and how Edward affects her life. A mystery soon develops as her father dies from a plane crash which he predicted but the plane had been sabotaged. Edward is trying to help Gail find the killer but the police suspect him. The main criticism of the film is that it has a depressing and foreboding sense of doom which bogs the film down too much making it feel rather heavyhanded. But director John Farrow gives it gradeA production values and Robinson is always good in everything he does and he makes this more of mustsee movie experience with him than it would be without him. By the end you'll probably be impressed with him but a little depressed considering the ending".

The plot shows what a trip wire could do to a horse and yet they surely used trip wires for the falls. I got an extra appreciation for the danger of the runaway stage stunt when I learned of a recreation trail ride a few years ago where the team of a wagon was spooked and one of the horses died after getting entangled backwards in the harness.Odd that someone named Kentucky didn't even try for a KY accent.  I went to a Ken Maynard film festival in Columbus IN put on by a family member. I'd never heard of him before that. We saw some of his silent movies. It's interesting that a boy from Vevay IN could perform in carnivals and circuses then go west and become a trick rider with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show a circus rider with Ringling Brothers and have a career in Hollywood. He also managed to squeeze in a stint with the army in WWI apparently escaping being crippled or traumatized.It was an exciting time for an adventurous soul. Cole Porter from Peru IN born only four years earlier than Ken went the opposite direction and took NYC by storm. He however wasn't as lucky with his horse poor guy. The mingling of the sophistication of the cities with the still fairly primitive conditions of the West and Great Plains made for excellent contrasts in early westerns. It gave the audience the feeling that they could go there and have amazing things happen to them too. It was part fantasy and part advertisement.".

The Plot has to do with Ken helping out the owner of a dude ranch that is wanted by a gangster. First the gangster fixes a horse race and then he resorts to murder and robbery framing Maynard in the hope of getting him out of the way. Good action packed film is slowed down by too many songs. The songs aren't bad but it takes up too much room with the result being that the first 40 minutes is rather leisurely while the final 15 or 20 minutes is a race to the wire. I wish things had been more spread out especially since the film kind of slows to a crawl after the horse race. Still its worth a look preferably as part of a double feature evening.".

However in the film In Old Santa Fe the studio accidentally found an answer to their problemsin the form of Gene Autry and Smiley Burnette. Both were only in the film a few minutes to provide some musical numbers but they did such a nice joband the executives decided to feature Autry instead of Maynard in an upcoming film. From here on Maynard's career was in a tailspinworking for smaller and smaller studios for less and less pay until he was pushed out of pictures just a decade or so later. So In Old Santa Fe marks the beginning of the end for Maynard. And to make things worse years later some bozos pasted Autry's name at the beginning of the filmeven though he's barely in this movie! The sad truth is that In Old Santa Fe is a terrific filmone of the best of its kind. If Maynard had only been a nicer person he could have remained a first tier starand he is wonderful in this movie. It's far better than his later films and showed that he could appear to be a heck of a guy.The movie begins with Kentucky Maynard and Cactus Gabby Hayes heading to the Miller H.B. Warner ranch. On the way Miller's daughter is driving pretty recklessly but it gives her a nice chance to meet handsome Maynard. Maynard is smitten and Cactus is wonderfully grouchy both here and throughout the film! However in the meantime a nasty piece of work Chandler Kenneth Thomson shows up and begins trying to blackmail Miller and vows to force Miller to give him his beautiful daughter! Naturally Kentucky is in the way and Chandler and his evil sidekick vow to destroy Kentucky. But being a cowboy hero you just know that he'll somehow save himself sweet Lila Miller and her father! This is a terrific filmprobably better than any Roy Rogers or Gene Autry film I've seen and I've seen a lot. The plot is surprisingly good the acting very good I loved Gabby in this one the musical numbers by Autry and Burnette were excellent and the film SHOULD have been just one more nice film in Maynard's long career! Too bad but I guess this is indeed a case of what goes around comes around. A mustsee for fans of the genre as well as Autry fans.".

As far as the story goes it's a pretty standard one in which the hero outwits the bad guys and wins the pretty female lead Evalyn Knapp as Lila Miller by the time the sun goes down. Kentucky Ken and partner Cactus Hayes uncover a scheme in which villain ChandlerKorber Kenneth Thompson attempts to blackmail pretty Lila's father H.B.

Autry only appears on screen for a few brief moments and his voice sounds a little twangy singing 'In Old Wyoming' while Smiley is a hoot introducing his froggy voice with 'My Momma Don't Allow'. You also have to credit Maynard's palomino Tarzan for a major role in the story what with all the tricky maneuvering around obstacles over jumps and rugged terrain in that horse race through the canyon. If the story had anything to do with Old Santa Fe you could have fooled me but then again it WAS one of the songs done by Gene Autry.".

	schema:reviewBody "SOBREVIVIRE I WILL SURVIVE is a fine little film from Spain circa 1999 that because of recent important legislation in that country becomes even more pertinent than when it was made. Cowritten and directed by Alfonso Albacete with assistance from David Menkes and Luca Etxebarra this is a fresh look at relationships and the human needs and the compromises faced in the search for happiness. SOBREVIVIRE is probably the healthiest and most intelligent examination of pan sexuality it takes on tough issues and allows them to nurture the comedy that is life! After an introduction of her childhood idiosyncrasies we meet the adult Marga the superb Emma Surez wholly in love with Roberto Adri Collado joyfully creating a home for their upcoming marriage. There is a car accident and Marga is injured but Roberto is killed devastating Marga who has learned that she is pregnant with Roberto's child. At the same time she loses her job due to her disruptive friend Trini Rosana Pastor and must strike out on her own. She is denied government funds until she gives birth to her child and in desperation she falls into a video store ownership and takes on a Cuban au pair Rosa Mirta Ibarra who lightens not only her domestic load but also her spirit. Some years pass and Marga and Rosa become fast friends.As Marga begins to feel the loneliness of being a single mom she meets handsome Iaqui Juan Diego Botto in her video store. Iaqui is recovering from a breakup with his boyfriend Oscar Alberto San Juan and is as attracted to Marga as she is to him. Iaqui informs Marga he is gay a fact that Rosa and other friends have already prepared her for. In full knowledge of each other's pasts they embark on a relationship that flowers with a subtlety and tenderness that allows us to feel the anxieties of each while letting the innate comedy shine through.Iaqui tries to forget his sexual orientation and is even able to override some temptations that occur. Marga fears that eventually the warmly human Iaqui will eventually leave her and they admit to each other that neither has 'heard the music' that is supposed to come with romance. Rosa meanwhile has found love with a performer Rolando Manuel Manquia and convinces Marga to fly to Cuba to be part of her marriage. When Marga returns she realizes her devotion to Iaqui and since that devotion is mutual is shared the two marry. How the film ends is magical yet real and deserves to be discovered by each viewer. Suffice it to say that it is a very realistic and intelligent ending.Each of the actors in this bouncy little film is excellent with special kudos to Emma Surez a truly fine actress. Yet all of the other main characters are superbly handled and the supporting cast is equally fine especially the 'together couple' Jos Alex Brendemhl and Carlos Javier Martn. The music the sets the pacing the editing and especially the direction are first class. This is one of those little movies that deserves a very wide audience. In Spanish with English subtitles. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

When it rains the rain adds even more emotion to the apartment building.I can't believe that this film was released in 1999 that was ten years ago. It still has the contemporary touch.The gay flight attendant's dancing is not very good a little cheesy which made that scene funny. His body is not very ripped. Then again most people look like that. And his briefs is a little too loose. Same thing applies to the guy who Inaqi met in the fitting room his briefs is also a little too loose. If it was done by the Hollywood people I am sure that they will pick someone with real muscles and wears tight briefs.Overall this is a very good movie. I am surprised that only so few people have voted and left comments for this movie. You don't have to be straight or gay to watch this movie searching for love is something that everyone wants to do.".

Interestingly enough two of Schell's future Oscar nominations also dealt with Nazism namely THE PEDESTRIAN 1973 which Schell also directed and the film under review which garnered him his second Best Actor nod. Once again he came against an iconic performance  Jack Nicholson's Randle P. McMurphy in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST  but lost out to it this time around for the record I have just came across the obscure GIVE'EM HELL HARRY which was the only Best Actor James Whitmore nominee from that same year which was still eluding me...THE MAN IN THE GLASS BOOTH is the fourth of 14 productions from The American Film Theater that I have watched  following Lindsay Anderson's IN CELEBRATION 1975 Guy Green's LUTHER 1974 and Joseph Losey's GALILEO 1975 which more than anything sought to record and preserve renowned pieces of theatre that often featured notable actors. In this case Arthur Hiller transposes Robert Shaw's play about a Jewish industrialist afflicted by the delusion of being a notorious Nazi officer this controversial ruse undeniably elicits comparisons with THE RULING CLASS 1971 where Peter O'Toole's mad aristocrat first thinks he is Jesus Christ but then morphs into Jack The Ripper by the end of the film! Curiously enough Shaw initially objected to Edward Anhalt's s adaptation of his material and asked to have his name removed from the film's opening credits after watching it however he relented and agreed to put it back on but by then it was too late and indeed his name does not appear anywhere in the film's opening credits In any case there seems to have been no animosity between the two multitalented actors as Schell eventually directed Shaw in END OF THE GAME 1975 and they costarred in Shaw's untimely swan song AVALANCHE EXPRESS 1979.Given the film's title source of origin and subject matter I was under the impression that the film would be entirely taken up by the trial which when it actually comes on in the second half Is indeed riveting  with concentration camp survivors brought face to face with their tormentor members of the aggrieved public rising from their seats to beat him up following his latest animated diatribe Schell's own doctors 'confirming' his identity until one of them Leonard Cimino breaks down and admits that the evidence was planted by Schell himself! In this part of the film the presence of passionate prosecutor Lois Nettleton and sensible Magistrate Luther Adler also makes itself felt. While the film's central conceit  a wealthy Jew exposed publicly as a notorious Nazi but ultimately emerging as a delusional Jew  is a fascinating one it is quite contrived in fact the surprisingly fanciful first half set atop paranoid Schell's NYC apartment is somewhat heavygoing and even hardtotake at times. That the film ends up being a worthy one regardless is mostly due to baldheaded bearded and bespectacled Schell's tourdeforce performance interestingly despite the actor's Germanic heritage he would again impersonate Jews in THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK 1980 TV and THE CHOSEN 1981. For the record the copy I acquired suffers from lipsync issues that can prove distracting at first but one grows accustomed to that fault before long.".

I see Arthur Goldman's allusions to Jesus throughout the references about the Catholic Church's forgiving the Jews for deicide his staging of the super before knowingly putting himself in the crosshairs of the Mossad to capture him and finally most telling... his crucifixion like pose against the inside of the booth at the end as the magnitude of the Holocaust finally descends upon him.Did anyone else see this powerful subtext of the movie?";

The range nuance and dramatic mood shifts he brings to this part which demands polar opposite emotions are astonishing. How he was not nominated for an Academy Award to my knowledge is unbelievable. His performance is what animates this complicated set of twists and turns and brings enrichment of plot turns to a well crafted story with authentic psychological resonance at the climaxe of the film. Well worth your time! It is fascinating by the way to pair this movie with a viewing of Judgment at Nuremburg in which Schell plays the defense attorney of Nazi war criminals.".

It's a shame that this movie is not more available.To really appreciate Schell's performance and get the full impact of this story it helps to have an understanding about Hitler and the theories about what motivated his actions and beliefs.  Without this background this movie will come across as hopelessly contrived but taken as an allegory about the dictator it is extremely powerful.  It is curious why Robert Shaw had his name removed from the credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "Actor Robert Shaw in addition to being a great player both before the stage lights and screen camera also wrote this unusual and challenging play about a strange and troubled Jewish man. On Broadway it ran for 264 performances in the 196869 season and starred Donald Pleasence. For the screen Maximilian Schell took over the role of Arthur Goldman a rich concentration camp survivor who moved to America and became a wealthy builder. As his friends and former wives know Schell is probably the most anti Semitic Jew on the planet earth constantly making disparaging remarks about his own people. A lot of Jews who went through the Holocaust experience lost faith in the religion that did not deliver them from evil unleashed. But his remarks are really in horrible taste yet he's rich enough that people tolerate a terrible eccentricity.But one fine day men from Israel come and kidnap him and the next thing we know Schell is in a glass booth in a courtroom on trial for his life. For he's being accused of taking the identity of Arthur Goldman and really being the commandant of the camp where Goldman was one of the many slaughtered. A determined prosecutor played by Lois Nettleton seems to have the goods on Schell.Schell is defiant to the end even insisting on wearing an S.S. uniform in court. In the end however he is humbled in the most humiliating lie of his whole life. It turns out his was a case of self hatred he was a collaborationist Jew who the Nazis used both in camps and in city zoned ghettos to control the population.It's impossible to discuss The Man In The Glass Booth without revealing the ending. Internalized self hate is a powerful weapon indeed used by one group of people keeping another one down. In his authorized biography Branch Rickey told a story of a black man he went to school with who could not have the athletic career he wanted up against white American prejudice and breaking down and sobbing about how cursed he was with his race.I'm in a minority group that only in the last century found its voice and united to stop centuries old prejudice. Internalized homophobia is one of the worst things a gay person has to overcome in order to function. Until recently society just pounded how inferior we are into our every day and we had no recourse. Many opted for suicide sadly many still do.Schell's character is no different than many self hating gays I've known. If he was a gay man in the camp instead of a Jew he might have more willingly allowed himself to be used as a sex object. If you recall in Exodus Sal Mineo survived in the camp by being just that albeit an unwilling one. What do think Larry Craig or Ted Haggard might be doing in Auschwitz?The poor soul that Schell played and I say that because he might have become wealthy but his soul was starved indeed was maybe someone who sold out his own people for an extra bit of ration just trying to survive in the most horrible situation imaginable. He was filled more with shame than with hate and in the end it destroyed him.Maximilian Schell received an Academy Award nomination for a man inside the dock as opposed to being a defense attorney for the Nazis as he was in Judgment at Nuremberg. He won his Oscar for that role but didn't make it on this try Schell was up against Jack Nicholson for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest a film about a different kind of psychosis.The Man In The Glass Booth has the distinction of being the last production of that worthy endeavor called the American Film Theater which sought to bring quality work to the screen that otherwise might not be considered commercial enough for Hollywood. Why it failed ultimately is the source of lots of speculation but it did sadly enough. Still this film was a worthy curtain call to that noble idea.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Man in the Glass Booth is a challenging movie. One finds it difficult to understand completely. FirstSome observations The original novel and play of this story were written by actor Robert Shaw whose inspiration seemed to come from the 1960 abduction of Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann was captured in Argentina by Mossad Israel's intelligence service transferred to Israel tried there found guilty of war crimes and hanged in 1962. For some unknown reason Shaw did not want to have his name credited in the movie. Maximilian Schell was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for this movie filmed by The American Film Theatre. It seems to have been hard to find this movie for some time either on VHS or DVD but is now available through Amazon Prime streaming with no extra cost. Personally I am happy for this since in my opinion its dialogue is rich and dense and several viewings may be necessary for me at leastto understand it. Due to another user's comment I am not alone ..this film deserves even demands repeated viewing due to its complex and difficult to understand plot.Schell presents an overthetop performance here in which he completely dominates all the other actors. The play seems to touch on many topics Religion Ethics Morality and Law both national and international Finally the very issue of what sanity and insanity is is explored if it is measured in terms of one's relationship to ones' culture and surroundings.  Arthur Goldman Maximilian Schell is a VERY rich Jewish industrialist who lives in a Manhattan highrise overlooking his childrenthe many buildings of his empire. His young assistant is Charlie Cohn Lawrence Pressman who carries out his orders and listens to his endless ramblings about Christianity Judaism sports and his life in general. While Charlie is looking through Goldman's papers he is shocked to see a newspaper from November 20 1964 that is enfolding 2 million dollars in baggies. Why so much cash on hand?!! The why of the cash is not as interesting to Goldman as what the old New York Herald Tribune had reported The Pope had just forgiven the Jews for Christ's killing and should be held absolved of any such crimes. Charlie puts up with a lot of Goldman's ramblings which often seem to verge on paranoid schizophrenia. Goldman sees people in the street that are not there and imagines that a Mercedes is following his every move. He sees his father in the street pushing a pretzel cart even though his father had been killed in a Nazi concentration camp in 1943 at the age of 70. Through his topfloor telescope Goldman also sees men in Nazi uniforms which sends him into a fitWhy do I live he says. However when Goldman receives a phone call from a wrong number he goes into action as if he were in danger and needed to prepare for it. He prepares for it as if his own passion play were about to begin. He burns the under surface of his left arm with a candle of his menorah and prepares for the abduction he knows is to come but why does he do that? His abduction does come when several menIsraeli secret agents Mossadbreak into his apartment. They search him from head to toe and even throughout his body cavities. Then they take him to Israel for trial on charges of being a Nazi war criminalCol Dorff. During the trial he demands the right to argue in his own defense and wear his German uniform. He is placed in a bulletproof glass booth so that no one can harm him during the trial. During the trial he takes on the personality and arguments as if he were Dorff. He asks probing questions of his accusers as they present experiences of their time in the concentration camp of Dorff. But what gives them the right to judge him guilty anymore than Christ was judged guilty by a system without any clearcut legal authority? Where did THEY get their authority? In the end how can they even prove that he is Dorff? Note There are many interpretations of this play. If you don't believe me read the user reviews. I have my theory. What's yours?".

My expectations were high but the film was quite a letdown.  Hiller's direction was dull and generic and had the look and feel of a bad 70's television episode while Schell brings new meaning to the term overacting his Oscar nomination makes more sense in light of Al Pacino's Oscar win for his incessant mugging in Scent of Woman.The producer of the film mentioned that writer Robert Shaw from which the source material came and a famous actor in his own right asked to have his name taken off the film upon reading the screenplay and then apparently asked to have it put back on later.  Not having read his play I found much of the dialogue awkward and stilted although many of the statements and speeches in the film give an introspective view of not just the tragedy of the Holocaust but also the logical if deluded mindset of those Germans that perpetrated such atrocities. Given the intriguing premise it would have been interesting to see what the film would have been like in the hands of a better director and with the lead character played a bit more understated and nuanced a great example would be Ian McKellan's brilliant performance in the otherwise flawed Apt Pupil.  To be fair the predominantly older Jewish audience I saw it with enjoyed it although I would guess more out of obligation to the subject matter then to it's artistic merit.  All in all a fairly mediocre film for its' time with a overthetop performance by Schell neither of which have aged well. 510".

Schell is startlingly good considering what he has to do balancing out two different eccentric personalities that are part of his one character. The character he plays is the most intriguing element throughout but it does have a tendency to dominate and therefore overshadow the things that film has to say. It also takes a while to get where its going however the second half is highly intense stuff and the film is merited by interesting ideas the whole time through.".

It is nice to see some good production values of the seventies at their best as well as some funny hair styles and well conceived props but this doesn't make up for the lack of sense.

Good films need original ideas well developed and well solved. If you launch the great question you have to propose an answer based on sound consideration or as it should be the case in a film on a consistent outline for your story.

Unfortunately the son of the apache chief gets killed by Santa Maria the villain who also steels the money. So Ranger and Abahachi go look for a treasure map to find a diamond Abahachi once hid a long time ago.The story is secondary the emphasis on this movie is on FUN. I gave it a 9. Go see it and wait till the end. After the credits Winnetouch has a little scene.";

The comedic timing with Abahachi and Ranger were perfect and Winnietouch added even more of a twist and even more laughs  being a gay Indian. This movie was meant to bash a German writer back in I'm not sure the late 1800's who wrote about the American Wild West even though he had never been there. So of course his stories were ridiculous and often hard to believe. Der Schuh des Manitu embodies everything a spoof should be with love affairs gay Indians misunderstandings random happenings and of course a truly spectacular cast! I hope this encourages everyone who reads this to definitely check out this movie because it's definitely worth it!!".

It is such a feelgood movie that no matter how foul my mood is that day after I've seen it I'm really uplifted. It is very easy to get addicted to this movie because the characters are so lovable and it pays sort of hommage to one of my childhood heroes  Winnetou. The dialogues are made of phrases that we in Munich use in daily life and Abahachi Winnetouch and Ranger speak the same dialect as my friends and I do so it is more like following our neighbours lives than watching a movie except maybe for the locations and the costumes. The camera work is splendid and the musical score is very touching. Michael Herbig has done great in writing and directing and his unforgettable performances as the Indian twin brothers are way too good for words. A highly recommended movie if you are in need of a laugh. And stay till after the end credits you won't regret it!".

	schema:reviewBody "This wacky as well as raunchy spoof is packed with a lot of silly laughs and great entertainment and fun . Demystified parody based on Karl May's Winnitou  as well as amiable Western that changed the concept of this particular genre each bent on disproving a popular myth  yet tinged with humor  spoof and combining with antiheroes  crazy Indians and many other things . Amusing take off on Indian movies in which a rambunctious temperance leader called Abahachi Michael Herbig  Chief of the Apache Indians  and his blood brother called Ranger Christian Tramitz maintain law and order in the Wild West . These two main characters Abahachi and Ranger who deliver their peculiar peace and justice were referred to as WinnetouPierre Brice and Old ShatterhandLex Barker in the skits of the Bullyparade . One day  Abahachi needs to take up a credit from the Shoshone Indians to finance his tribe's new Saloon . But Santa Maria Sky Du Mont  who sold the Saloon  doublcrosses Abahachi  takes the money and leaves . Soon after  the Shoshones are on the warpath to get their money back  and Abahachi is forced to organize it quickly  then chaos and wreak havoc ensue . Luckily  Abahachi and Ranger go Winnetouch's home  his twin brother . There Winnetouch shows Ranger the picture of his father he actually shows Pierre Brice playing the title character in The Desperado Trail  1965. He tells Ranger that his father could speak French fluently and nobody knows why in fact  deceased Pierre Brice was born in France . Then  Abahachi his twin brother Winnetouch Michael Herbig  gorgeous dancer Uschi Marie Bumer and the Greek Dimitri each own a quarter of a valuable map . But at a hidden cave  Santa Maria already awaits them to take their new treasure away as well . Unfortunately  he did not think about the determination of Abahachi's bunch formed by Ranger  Dimitri Rick Kavanian  Hombre Hilmi Szer whose role bears remarkable resemblance to Going South's James Belushi  all of them join forces to find a treasure map that leads them to 'the shoe of Manitu' . It's an entertaining story and very amusing tale with the Farceur Michael Herbig as director and at double role . This bemusing movie is packed with tongueincheek  slapdash and slapstick  a steady stream of gags  lively situations abound  sheer belly laughs  crazy humor  too much fun and to be perfect for the kiddies and adolescents . It contains simple and raunchy humor and lots of entertainment and funny scenes . The spoof is surrealist  extreme and grossout with the ordinary bunch of loonies and loopies  but is also bold and intelligent with a myriad of imaginative sketches with no sense  many of them unabashedly tasteless . This movie basically is a big spoof of the Winnetou filmsnovels by Karl May  such as The treasure of the silver lagoon which are very popular in Germany  in fact the character Karl May in the tavern is a reference to him . The picture contains an unstopped string of gags each thirty seconds and silly jokes from the start to the ending with some lively touches . The comedy and humor are interminable for that reason the viewers will laugh uncontrollably with the habitual quirky and lunatic characters . The sympathetic Michael Herbig steals the show  the puts paces grimaces  and overacting by means of excessive mimic gesticulation especially in his hilarious scenes as the Indian gay . Furthermore  it provides a sprinkling of selfparodyc situations with laughers and amusement from start to finish . The screenplay besides having more than its fair scraps of funny lines  throws up rich as well as amusing characters and it shows in the confused melange of styles and some bad taste . Lively musical score by Ralf Wengenmayr with catching songs and enjoyable musical numbers . Colorful and shimmer cinematography shot in Almeria  where in the sixties shot lots of of SpaghettiPaella Westerns  however  the WinnetouPierre Brice movies had been filmed in Yugoslavia . This motion picture titled Manitou's shoes 2001 was well and originally directed by Michael Bully Herbig . It is generally considered as being the most successful German movie ever with 12 million viewers and the broadcast television premiere of this film earned German broadcaster highest rating in its history . Herbig is an expert on parody based on known characters  such as Sissi in Lissi and The Wild Emperor and  of course  Vickie the Viking . This second feature movie he directed  became the most successful movie in Germany and Austria ever . The film will appeal to absurd  unruly  wacky comedy fans . This raucous Western spoof is a Michael Herbig vehicle  if you like his crazy maniac performances  you'll enjoy this one . Rating  65 . Acceptable comical Western film appointed for children and adolescents and  of course  for vintage series fonds . Well worth seeing .".

If the film had been shown on the German channel in the original language I would not have watched it. I know only about 300 words in German.As it was shown in dubbed English with Spanish subtitles I was able to understand almost everything. The dubbing was accurate animated and much better than others I've seen. I didn't even care what the original language was until I saw the credits. Regrettably the credit crawl with some funny bloopers was in German but by then it was time for dinner.If you have a chance to see this film Der Schuh des Manitu from 2001 just forget about what the Germans know or do. This is truly lowbrow comedy. You'll be reminded of Mel Brooks' best comedies. I agree that some dubbed films lose something in translation but this one did not. Some of the Bavarian dialect was lost and ironically this American Western parody film was actually shot in Spain. I give this an A on Ellen's Entertainment Report card. 1010 Ellen Kimball KGW.com Portland Oregon".

Michael Bully Herbig is a very good comedian and some of his TVPartners from BullyParade that is popular in Germany are greater in other roles than this film.The jokes are old the actors not at their best and the idea to make a film of a small part of the BullyParade has probably worked in Germany but many jokes cannot be translated because of the idiomatic expressions.My remote control came into reach the more the film went on.In my opinion the film is overrated 210 is all I can give.";

If however you sawliked the original you'll likely still enjoy it..but you'll know exactly what's coming next because it is very faithful to the original. In fact in most scenes it's a linebyline remake and many camera shots are virtually identical to the 1976 version. What has changed is that Damien's parents are younger and it's been updated to reflect a contemporary world of today. Also the screenwriter decided to throw in 911 and recent disasters as indicators that the Armageddon is on it's way via Damien Thorne. SPOILERS FOLLOW There are elements of Final Destination but the original Omen was in fact the first to play with this type of death scenes where things mysteriously happen to people through strange accidentsetc. Having said that these scenes are a little different from the original most of them anyway and again as a horror fan you'll enjoy the fact that they don't pull any punches graphically.Acting wise the film was somewhat weak  particularly Mia Farrow's performance. In an fitting homage to Rosemary's Baby Farrow is cast as Mrs.Baylock the satanic disciple summoned to protect the Devil's son in a sense like her character in Rosemary's BabyDamien Thorne in the form of a nanny. I found that she was not nearly as creepy and menacing as the original actress. Julia Stiles was not strong either and Schrieber was OK. The kid who plays Damien isn't bad but it's just another brooding kid role with few lines so it's tough to screw that up.Visually i loved this film and a few sequences in particular were very very well done. As for the scares there aren't many at all and a few could be seen coming a mile away dream sequencemirror open then shuts to see apparition in rearetc.. I did jump physically in one sequence where i wasn't expecting it which i won't mention specifically so it may surprise you too.So it was an entertaining 2 hours. Nothing terribly new and not as creepy or Gothic as the first one. In a way i was hoping it might go in a different direction but perhaps it's the producers' ultimate compliment to the original  keep it very similarjust updating it for a new generation of horror fans.

The date of June 6th 2006 was probably the most tempting thing for producers to release a new version of this film now.Well you can't say they did a bad job. This year's The Omen is solid as a rock and very faithful to the original. So faithful in fact that one has to wonder what the whole point of it is.Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles are an odd choice for the leading couple but they're both okay in their respective roles. The direction is just okay too but you gotta be thankful that no cheap scares or not too many of them were thrown in to keep viewers interested. On the other hand it must be said that the movie is a bit slow at the beginning especially if you already know the plot. Opinions will differ on how well recent events such as 911 the tsunami in Sri Lanka or the death of Pope John Paul II. were integrated into the story but that's not really a major issue. The few changes John Moore made involve a different way of dying for one character and two or three rather effective dream sequences the last one sticks out  it's a sequence of really creepy images without any sound effects at all probably my favorite moment of the whole movie. Also watch out for a nice reference to Don't Look Now.The most interesting thing however is the complete absence of the infamous choral score that made the original so scary. God knows why it's not here it sure wouldn't have seem dated.If I realized anything watching this movie it's how amazing the script was in the first place. It builds up perfectly it's thrilling as hell excuse the pun and there are no plot holes to be found. This is why The Omen still works greatly and will hopefully be enjoyed by a lot of young people who haven't seen the original. For everyone else there's no reason to spend money on a movie we have already seen in a superior version.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was able to get into a press screening leading up to Fox's big Omen press junket in NYC.Judging by the IMDb boards people seem to be going into this remake with some very strong preconceptions. People who hate the mere idea of an Omen remake so much they'll never allow themselves to enjoy this will obviously come away disappointed. But I'm a fan of the original and I can honestly say I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. It may be the first effective horror remake Hollywood has pumped out.First let me clarify this is not by any stretch a shot for shot remake in the style of Gus Van Sant's Psycho. It is fairly faithful to the original plot this is in my opinion a good thing but various things have been added and those scenes remain the same have all been reworked either in minor or significant ways. I just rewatched the original a month ago so it may be that I was more attuned to the differences but I found they hit a good balance in keeping close to the original while adding flair and revamping certain things.The remake starts out in the vatican with a scene comparing modern day disasters to eerily similar imagery foretold in the Book of Revelations. I wasn't thrilled with the idea of clueing in the audience to the fact that the antichrist was coming so early in the film but the scene is well done and was effectively creepy. The use of 911 footage as well as starving africans and hurricane katrina apparently caused someone to storm out of a QA with the director later in the week alas I wasn't present at that event. I didn't find it tasteless but I'm guessing this might divide audiences. At any rate it's a genuinely unsettling opener.We're then introduced to the new Robert and Kate as she's called a few times in this one Thorn. There's a brand new death right at the outset of the film which I won't spoil but which fits in well and offers an explanation for the young couple's sudden rise to power. From there the plot unfolds pretty much as expected but with a few twists. Kathy's paranoia is emphasized a little more heavily with some nightmare sequences relating to her newfound pregnancy. And a couple of the deaths are redone. Kathy's new death is particularly hairraising. Immobilized in a full body cast with her jaw wired shut she can only cry and try to scream quietly as she's held down and a murder of a particularly medical nature is exacted. Mrs. Baylock also gets a brand new sendoff involving a sledgehammer a car and a rainstorm. The audience I saw it with mostly critics even! cheered at her death.The original's deaths weren't exactly lowkey and for the remake they clearly wanted to up the ante. This isn't necessarily a bad thing  the results are fun to watch and sometimes disturbing. But I did find myself snickering occasionally at how over the top the offings were. It's not enough that the priest get impaled he has to get a face and chest full of glass too. Not enough that the mother fall and break a rib she has to plummet down the tallest foyer in the history of movie sets and shatter every bone in her body who decides to casually water flowers on a teetery chair overlooking a three story drop anyway!?. And so on.The biggest surprise of the remake is that it's scarier than the original which I always considered to be more of a creepy drama than a horror film anyway. This is shot like an outandout horror movie and it works well. There are only a few jump out scares but it has a much tenser more nailbiting pacing than the original.The cast is for the most part very good. The supporting cast is actually more memorable than in the original with David Thewlis and Mia Farrow being the standouts. Farrow's Baylock is particularly interesting masking her true intentions with a sickly sweet exterior. Her approach to the character is a departure from the original some may miss Billie Whitelaw's icy turn but I thought it was one of the best things about this remake. Pete Postlethwait and Michael Gambon are their usual reliable selves. The leads are the weak spot. Liev Schreiber's a damn fine actor and he actually holds up well as long as you don't try to draw any direct comparisons to the legendary Gregory Peck. But Julia Stiles is merely adequate. It's not a great role in the first place and unlike Lee Remick she doesn't do anything to make it memorable. She's not bad but she doesn't bring any weight to the part.The one tangible failure of the remake is the score. Marco Beltrami's music is effective and in other circumstances I might even laud it as a solid effort. But it just isn't as distinctive or memorable as Jerry Goldsmith's legendary Ave Satani. The fact that Beltrami didn't even see fit to work some of the original themes into his score is a just a painful missed opportunity. And by the time some Goldsmith finally does show up over the end credits it's just salt in the wound.Minor reservations aside this is an effective movie in its own right and it won't poop all over your fond memories of the original. Whether a remake was needed at all is another debate but considered on its own merits I found the new Omen to be good scary fun. I'd advise people to go in with an open mind  you might just like it.".

Not enough that the mother fall and break a rib she has to plummet down the tallest foyer in the history of movie sets and shatter every bone in her body who decides to casually water flowers on a teetery chair overlooking a three story drop anyway!?. And so on.The biggest surprise of the remake is that it's scarier than the original which I always considered to be more of a creepy drama than a horror film anyway. This is shot like an outandout horror movie and it works well. There are only a few jump out scares but it has a much tenser more nailbiting pacing than the original.The cast is for the most part very good. The supporting cast is actually more memorable than in the original with David Thewlis and Mia Farrow being the standouts. Farrow's Baylock is particularly interesting masking her true intentions with a sickly sweet exterior. Her approach to the character is a departure from the original some may miss Billie Whitelaw's icy turn but I thought it was one of the best things about this remake. Pete Postlethwait and Michael Gambon are their usual reliable selves. The leads are the weak spot. Liev Schreiber's a damn fine actor and he actually holds up well as long as you don't try to draw any direct comparisons to the legendary Gregory Peck. But Julia Stiles is merely adequate. It's not a great role in the first place and unlike Lee Remick she doesn't do anything to make it memorable. She's not bad but she doesn't bring any weight to the part.The one tangible failure of the remake is the score. Marco Beltrami's music is effective and in other circumstances I might even laud it as a solid effort. But it just isn't as distinctive or memorable as Jerry Goldsmith's legendary Ave Satani. The fact that Beltrami didn't even see fit to work some of the original themes into his score is a just a painful missed opportunity. And by the time some Goldsmith finally does show up over the end credits it's just salt in the wound.Minor reservations aside this is an effective movie in its own right and it won't poop all over your fond memories of the original. Whether a remake was needed at all is another debate but considered on its own merits I found the new Omen to be good scary fun. I'd advise people to go in with an open mind  you might just like it.";

The remake is a slightly glossier affair which is enjoyable enough but doesn't really take the story in any new directions although it hints that it will. Opening images of 911 and the Asian tsunami promise a new take on the tale but with the exception of the very final scene this doesn't really happen. The set pieces of the original were beautifully done  here they're well done but don't seem to last long enough they don't feel 'special' enough. The cast is good but again it lacks the gravitas of the original. This ambassador is no Gregory Peck. Overall this isn't a bad way to spend two hours in the cinema  it's a hundred times better and more cinematic than The Da Vinci Code for instance  but could have been a lot more than it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "A remake of the original horror classic of 1976 this film offers nothing more than the original film has already given us besides some admittedly impressive death scenes. This remake is far below the standard set by the original film. The acting is stiff and stilted with Liev Schreiber as Robert Thorne giving a thoroughly onenoted performance which proved to be quite frustrating to watch for over two hours. Even when he finds out about the incredibly terrible events that consistently occur throughout the film Schreiber keeps an indifferent expression on his face. This undoubtedly makes many problems arise how can the audience get involved in a movie if the actors are unconvincing in their roles? Julia Stiles does well but she doesn't work in her role as Robert Thorne's wife but Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock gives the film a bit of a spark in an otherwise dull film. The main thing is is it scary? Damien is creepy enough and there are some OK dream sequences that offer a couple of good jump scares. But this is all it offers in scares. The film is basically just a reshooting of the original scenes except they lack the energy and tension. There is no sense of foreboding and it's almost as if the film makers and actors were just bored and wanting to get it over and done with it's as if they hardly cared about making a good film. What was meant to be a gripping horrific and intense viewing experience right up to the stunning climax becomes a boring and plodding time and you just about lose interest in the whole story and the characters. Overall a very disappointing remake which begs the question Why did they remake it in the first place?".

	schema:headline " Another Insult To A Horror Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "First I'd like to say that Richard Donner's 1976 The Omen is not so much a horror film as it is a supernatural thriller. My Summary merely refers this film coming latest in a parade of bad horror remakes Texas Chainsaw Massacre Dawn of the Dead The Fog etc..As most know The Omen was a 70s movie about an ambassador who's baby dies shortly after its born and agrees to take another baby in its place without telling his wife. Five years later deaths start to occur and he begins to fear he's raising the antiChrist. It was a wellmade subtle smart suspense film. What made it a classic also made it a prime target for remaking.It's not the 70s anymore it's the 2000s so naturally some things have changed. I expected them to. The poem from the first film is here interpreted to refer to recent events like 911 and that Tsinumi. Since this version takes place in present day it only makes sense. However opening the film with a slideshow of these things at The Vatican is not only extraneous but insulting to the viewers intelligence. We all know quite well what time we are living in.Ignoring that we have the pleasure of watching the truly talented Liev Schreiber tackle the role of Robert Thorn originally played by the late and great Gregory Peck. Naturally he's good and easy to watch. However when paired with Julia Stiles trying to claw her way into Lee Remick's role as Katherine Thorn things don't work out so well. Working from almost the same script the sympathetic mother through pure delivery is transformed into a shrill and spoiled nag. The actors sort of cancel each other out talentwise.Ignoring that we come to the action. As in the original the plot is moved along by mysterious and terrible deaths. Save for the first one added for spice I guess they are nearly identical to those in the original. However director John Moore is of the hyperfast Xtreme school he also made Behind Enemy Lines so Richard Donner fans beware. I won't spoil things but I will say that adding screams flashes glass shards fire and then subtracting the showiest death of all did NOT help this story or this film.Ignoring that if one can ignore so much is the music. Jerry Goldsmith won an Oscar for his score to the 1976 version. It was a very hard won Oscar too because it was pitted against not one but two scores by the great Bernard Herman Obsession and Taxi Driver and right after his death meaning Goldsmith competed against great talent and Acedemy sentiment. In short it was a great score. Marco Beltrami's score to this remake was hardly a match for it. I can hardly remember it. Goldsmith's Avi Satani will be with me until I die or lose a piece of my brain.Ignoring all that... assuming I'd never seen the original I'm sure I still would not be impressed with 2006's The Omen. The uneven pacing the poor delivery the unscary dreamsequences and the generally bad direction make this movie a stinker. It was obviously made to try and cash in on the gimmick of 6606 which is cute at best. They might as well have realized the cheese factor and thrown Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast on the soundtrack no offense to Iron Maiden.The original was a classic for a reason. It's sequels and this remake all remind us why it should have stood alone under its own still potent strength.".

There's probably only one scene in the entire movie that I enjoyed only because it looked a bit more realistic than in the original. But why pay 4 or 5 dollars to rent a movie out for only one scene? It's just not worth it.I can only hope that they don't remake Damien Omen 2 my personal favorite of the Omen trilogy I don't count the fourth one they made with the little girl in the starring role of the AntiChrist which is a joke.

I don't see what was great about the movie I found myself fidgeting in my chair and awaiting the end. I faintly remember the 70's version of the film but I do recall the fact that it kept me interested it provoked me to stay watching. But unlike the older classic version...the new updated Omen is a bore and actually caused me to laugh more than jump or cringe in my seat. Sure it had it's moments when I jumped due to the seemingly calm atmosphere and then a jolt of loud music but besides that I was not pleased with the lack of suspense or even gore that this movie did have. A couple good bloody parts but lacking a true horror feel.I'm not sure whether or not my movie theater just got a special version of this film or whether everyone saw it too but ignored the everoccurring audio equipment. Was it just my group of viewers who were introduced to the large microphones being dangled over Julia Stiles' head and the bobbing black tip of the equipment at the top of the screen. I do believe that overall we got to see the audio equipment a good 10 minutes or so. It caused a good laugh and made me pay attention to the film instead of the numbness in my behind. They gave me a disclaimer for The Ring 2 but I got nothing when walking into this movie which made it all the more amusing.So Dan Zimmerman maybe you need to figure out how to edit a film? But looking at his list of works he's more into the editing of a comedy film maybe he wanted to add a little humor? Beats me. Either way I'd go see it for a laugh if it wasn't so damn expensive to see a movie.".

As usual with remakes I now wish I hadn't as all this film does is remind me of how good the original is. Indeed there is nothing that the remake has over the original and all it is offers is a tired retelling of a very good story. The plot hasn't been changed but the film does offer some new ideas all of which are misplaced and don't work well  bringing the two towers into it being a case in point. Anyway the plot focuses on Robert Thorn the British ambassador and a man who unwittingly takes on the Devil's child after his own died at birth. A few odd events later and Thorn becomes convinced by various parties that Damien is the devil's spawn and so sets off to get some daggers to kill him with.The cast is one of the most annoying things about this remake. Liev Schreiber is a poor successor to the brilliant Gregory Peck while the likes of Julia Stiles Mia Farrow Michael Gambon and Pete Postlethwaite all fail to impress in their respective roles. The kid that they've got to play Damien isn't menacing at all and this is a huge dent in the film as this is an important role that the audience must believe is the root of all evil. The film has none of the atmosphere of the original and the glossy cinematography does the plot line no favours. The over the top death scenes were a big part of the 1976 classic but here they suffer from the same problem as the rest of the film  that being the fact that they're well known now and so don't have the power that they did in the original. A lot of the people that see this won't have seen the original but for those of us that have watching this remake is an excruciating waste of time. The original Omen received a couple of pretty terrible sequels but not one of them not even Omen IV are even half as bad as this crappy effort. Overall I can't recommend this film to anyone  fans of the original will hate it for not living up to the standard and those that haven't seen the original will hate it because it's just so poor. Don't bother is my advice to everyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not one of these crazy people who go mental every time Hollywood remakes a movie. Such movies can be appropriate and interesting if they are brought into a contemporary setting or given a new political twist. But for every brilliant Dawn of the Dead there are a million pathetic Wicker Men or The Grudge. It's an easy lucrative business practise but the shocking thing is how often directors screw it up when the template on how to make a good movie from the material is right there in front of them.Let me begin with saying that The Omen 2006 is hands down one of the worst films I have even seen in my life. Simply saying this is an understatement I left it feeling insulted offended and angry. But I don't want to waste energy and wordspace aptly describing how wretchedly incompetent the film is at absolutely everything so we'll leave it at that.It's been over a decade since I saw the original I was about 12 when I caught it on TV late one Saturday night. It would probably wouldn't scare me now but I was mildly freaked out by it then. With Richard Donner behind the camera you can rely on it being a strong movie regardless of the scares. Working from more or less the exact script hack nobody director John Moore hasn't got a ratarsed clue and makes a mess of this from the very beginning.Ditching the scopewidescreen photography of the original he shoots the film in plain old 1.851 which would be fine if he did something slightly artistic with it. But instead he gives us the blandest cinematography possible and it looks incredibly TVmovieish. Which is weird considering his cheap WalMart widescreen photography in Behind Enemy Lines and Flight of the Phoenix another remake. Every single 'scare' he has up his sleeve is no more than an amateurish simpleminded 'stinger' which you will ALWAYS see coming because they only 'work' when they are put into a scene of total silence. So whenever there is a sudden silence in the movie prepare for the 'boo'.I can't see any reason why any of the cast would appear in this drek other than the fat paycheck. Liev Schreiber sleepwalks his way through almost entirely monosyllabic role or perhaps he's just a terrible actor while surrounded by a bunch of equally stupid characters who deserve to die for being so foolish. All the slashermovie elements are in place here eh? That's all it is.Considering the material there was so much potential for so much more. How about some insight into the inner workings of heaven and hell? How about the tiniest bit of plot logic? Where's the atmosphere? But no! They chuck it all away because their imagination and creativity cannot stretch that far and serve up yet another bogstandard runofthemill crapfest that will only appeal to braindead philistines.Marco Beltrami's generic score is this man capable of anything else? is almost as bad Moore's direction if you can call it that.

Nobody NOBODY from the director all the way down to the dolly grip gave anything to this far inferior remake. It was a chore to make and a chore to sit through.Of all the terrible remakes that have come and gone in recent years it's frightening how many there are now this one has to be the most pointless. How stupid do they think we are? Who on earth would fall for this crap?

	onyx:emotionText "I'm not one of these crazy people who go mental every time Hollywood remakes a movie. Such movies can be appropriate and interesting if they are brought into a contemporary setting or given a new political twist. But for every brilliant Dawn of the Dead there are a million pathetic Wicker Men or The Grudge. It's an easy lucrative business practise but the shocking thing is how often directors screw it up when the template on how to make a good movie from the material is right there in front of them.Let me begin with saying that The Omen 2006 is hands down one of the worst films I have even seen in my life. Simply saying this is an understatement I left it feeling insulted offended and angry. But I don't want to waste energy and wordspace aptly describing how wretchedly incompetent the film is at absolutely everything so we'll leave it at that.It's been over a decade since I saw the original I was about 12 when I caught it on TV late one Saturday night. It would probably wouldn't scare me now but I was mildly freaked out by it then. With Richard Donner behind the camera you can rely on it being a strong movie regardless of the scares. Working from more or less the exact script hack nobody director John Moore hasn't got a ratarsed clue and makes a mess of this from the very beginning.Ditching the scopewidescreen photography of the original he shoots the film in plain old 1.851 which would be fine if he did something slightly artistic with it. But instead he gives us the blandest cinematography possible and it looks incredibly TVmovieish. Which is weird considering his cheap WalMart widescreen photography in Behind Enemy Lines and Flight of the Phoenix another remake. Every single 'scare' he has up his sleeve is no more than an amateurish simpleminded 'stinger' which you will ALWAYS see coming because they only 'work' when they are put into a scene of total silence. So whenever there is a sudden silence in the movie prepare for the 'boo'.I can't see any reason why any of the cast would appear in this drek other than the fat paycheck. Liev Schreiber sleepwalks his way through almost entirely monosyllabic role or perhaps he's just a terrible actor while surrounded by a bunch of equally stupid characters who deserve to die for being so foolish. All the slashermovie elements are in place here eh? That's all it is.Considering the material there was so much potential for so much more. How about some insight into the inner workings of heaven and hell? How about the tiniest bit of plot logic? Where's the atmosphere? But no! They chuck it all away because their imagination and creativity cannot stretch that far and serve up yet another bogstandard runofthemill crapfest that will only appeal to braindead philistines.Marco Beltrami's generic score is this man capable of anything else? is almost as bad Moore's direction if you can call it that. Once again here we have so much potential for a great score Jerry Goldsmith knew this and won an Academy Award for the original but you need talent to do this or care about the project instead of just being involved for the sake of food and heat.

	schema:reviewBody "For those who never saw the original this is a good movie. It's intense nicely photographed with excellent surround sound and capably acted.For those of us who watched the original in 1976 the one that starred Gregory Peck and Lee Remick we have to ask What is the point of watching this? For us  at least most of us  the original is superior but not by a wide margin to be fair. I have no problem with remakes if they are not cheaply presented and I was entertained by this presentation even though I knew the story.As an admirer of the '76 movie my main objection to this was the casting and mainly with two women Julia Stiles as Katherine Thorn and Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock. Stiles is a competent actress but she has a face that could pass for 15 or 16. At least Lee Remick looked the part the wife of a mid30s American diplomat. Farrow has the same problem in here too soft and pretty a face and voice to be playing an evil nurse. Perhaps Mia has a fondness for films about the devil dating back to Rosemary's Baby in 1968 but she was totally miscast. Billie Whitelaw in the original version oozed evil in her role and was genuinely frightening something Farrow didn't come close to being in here.Liev Schreiber meanwhile had the unenviable task of supplanting Gregory Peck. Schreiber can't be faulted for not having Peck's film presence but his character in here is such a downer that he almost has an evil countenance himself. I don't remember Peck playing this character so unsympathetically. Stiles too has a character that wasn't as pleasing as Remick's.This film seems to emphasize the couple's lack of spiritualness more so than the previous film. I may be wrong but I don't remember Peck going to these lengths to give his bias against religion nor do I recall Remick wanting an abortion nor do I remember the priest saying I'll see you in hell Mr. Thorn. Perhaps they did and I just don't recall. No priest by the way would act like that except in the movies nor would any cleric look and act as goofy as the ones in here.In both films the theology is laughable  pure Hollywood and the priests in here are too being clueless about what grace and the cross are all about. Filmmakers generally won't deal with those topics but they do a good job in making a case for Satan I'll give them that. You saw a similar instance of this in The Exorcist.As for the other characters the young boy  who has no dialog  is similar to the boy in the original but a little less evillooking and David Thewlis in this movie did an excellent job as the photographer as did David Warner in the first movie. Overall I thought the first film was creepier than this one but since I was already familiar with the story prior to watching this a comparison may be unfair.It was interesting to see this with the updated technology both off digital surround sound etc. and on the screen laptop computers cell phones etc. but the story is still similar enough that owning both of these films is questionable. Given the choice I would stick with the 1976 film but  I repeat if you've never seen The Omen this movie is recommended. It's entertaining that's for sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "It does seem like Hollywood is running out of ideas and to cover themselves they have turned to churning out remakes of old classics. As it is this film is one of the better remakes in recent times. Based on the 1976 film 'The Omen' sees Robert Thorn the American ambassador to Britain taking in an orphaned baby to take the place of his stillborn son. However he and his wife Kate remain unaware their new 'child' Damien is the Antichrist. As Damien grows from infancy to childhood evidence starts to mount of Damien's satanic origins and the Thorns are forced to face the truth.The acting isn't on par with the original. Liev Schreiber makes a good effort as Robert Thorn but he doesn't have the same sense of paternal love and devotion of Gregory Peck's Thorn who left you feeling his turmoil at the thought his beloved son could be a monster. Julia Stiles tries her best in her role of Kate Thorn but she is just far too young to play mother to a sevenyearold when she looks barely out of high school herself. She was completely miscast and came across more as Damien's harassed elder sister than his mother. The member of the cast who shone out was Mia Farrow as Mrs. Baylock Damien sinister nanny sent from Hell to protect him.'The Omen' is an enjoyable enough film but it doesn't strike out as really being worth the money spent on remaking it when it offers nothing new aside from being glossier. It doesn't help that what worked in 1976 doesn't work in 2006 where viewers are more discerning. The British media doesn't care what the American ambassador is up to not when there are cheap celebrities to be stalking nor could I see this ambassador receiving a police escort when it makes more sense that discretion is the better option. And it is almost impossible to walk into a hospital ICU and kill someone what with CCTV and monitor telemetry hooked up to the nurses' desk. They have made Damien more outwardly creepier and wee moppet Seamus DaveyFitzpatrick does rise to the occasion in the role but surely the Devil has enough brains to ensure his son seems so innocent and sweet that noone would ever suspect who he is. Damien might well have been wearing a sign saying 'I'm Satan Junior' with the way the character is portrayed. And why does a child raised in the UK have an American accent? He might have American 'parents' but he mixes in school with British children hence why it made sense for a British child to take the role in the classic version. And I can't emphasise enough how much Jerry Goldsmith's legendary 'Ave Satani' soundtrack is missed.Overall it is a better film than other remakes and it passes the time if there is little else on television but if you want proper Gothic horror stick with the Seventies original or if it's psychotic children you wish you see check out 'Joshua' or 'The Bad Seed'.".

His star Nikolai Cherkasov played a hero who used brains as well as brawn in Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky and a politician who becomes almost demoniacally subtle and unscrupulous in Ivan the Terrible. As Don Quixote he plays the wouldbe knighterrant with such quiet dignity that his delusions begin to seem preferable to the reality around him. Sancho Panza as solid and earthy as his master is gaunt and unworldly shows up the nobles who amuse themselves by playing along with Don Quixote's delusions as even more deluded and out of touch with reality. One can't help seeing a reference to Soviet society perhaps too subtle for the censors to catch. This film as well as Kozintsev's Hamlet and King Lear are overdue for release on DVD in the United States.".

As Don Quixote he plays the wouldbe knighterrant with such quiet dignity that his delusions begin to seem preferable to the reality around him. Sancho Panza as solid and earthy as his master is gaunt and unworldly shows up the nobles who amuse themselves by playing along with Don Quixote's delusions as even more deluded and out of touch with reality. One can't help seeing a reference to Soviet society perhaps too subtle for the censors to catch. This film as well as Kozintsev's Hamlet and King Lear are overdue for release on DVD in the United States.";

	schema:reviewBody "Cervantes' Don Quixote is a notoriously difficult novel to adapt for the screen. It's long and digressive and both humorous and sad. And it expresses its story through a very episodic series of events. The method here is to choose a few of those to abridge for the screen and just drop many others  and while in the shorter confines of a movie it doesn't always seem cohesive it does on the whole work. Essentially the funnyandsad tone is preserved. Nikolai Cherkasov is an extremely good Don Quixote sincere noble and dignified in his madness. But unlike other screen versions this film does not glorify Quixote in his delusions. Through all his funny misconceptions he remains unequivocally a sad deluded old man in the eyes of the film. There is nothing heroic here about his getting caught in the windmill he decides to battle. But for that his attitude is so noble and admirable that we nonetheless root for him automatically against the trickery of Carrasco. The film looks excellent as well with good cinematography and costumes and an excellently realized costumes. One shouldn't normally have t comment much on sound engineering but there seem to be some problems with it here some of Quixote's lines sound like they were dubbed in later and recorded in a very echoinducing studio. Though it necessarily resorts to an episodic nature and some quick exposition due to its source material and its makeup this ends up a very effective film. And it understands the necessity of making us admire The Knight of the Mournful Countenance not because we are asked to but in spite of how pathetic and deluded he is  as despite his madness he is only ever deceived because he is more principled honest and loyal than the sane people he meets.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perro come perro alias Dog Eat Dog has been announced as a groundbreaking feature film in Colombian cinema mainly for being a participant in Sundance Festival 2008. I even got to read a review saying that it would be the next Amores Perros of South America and that it marked a new period for Colombian cinema. As an openminded person who loves cinema I was very much persuaded of seeing the film for the positive reviews I definitely expected a whole lot more of what I got to see on the screen. Those propagandistic reviews are the motivation behind this personal commentary.PCP is seriously flawed in many ways. We may start on the overacting of most of the cast. Now then if it hadn't been for the superficial way in which the themes were dealt with the spectators could have empathised with at least something but there's no space for empathy to happen. On the contrary the supposed seriousness of the main characters' problems is ludicrous.The plot in itself is quite straightforward it's a film based more on atmospheres than on actions. If the movie fails to portray a plausible atmosphere is because of its overdirecting. Without any relevant plot twists and several obvious elements it tries to appeal in any available form to the audience even resulting in ridiculous comic relief situations. The soundtrack original music and title sequence seem like made for another kind of movie. The 'over the top' postproduction colour correction editing sound design only makes us too aware of the directorial efforts to be innovative. Let's face it if you're going to do another Colombianviolence relatedgangster film try at least not to step on the abundant clichs available for the genre. Instead we get to see a handful of badly used cinematic resources within a weak story.Besides the flaws aforementioned what I least liked is its thematic emptiness. There are so many pointless situations!! This is made especially annoying with some exaggerated gratuitous violence scenes. All in all I never got the point of the film not the story which is far too simple. What I mean is that it doesn't really say anything new or interesting about the topic nor it has a cinematic proposal that would rescue the film from being a commonplace empty gangstersicario movie as what it really is.".

This is also the debut film of writerdirector Carlos Moreno and he offers up a dark crime drama mixed with dark comedy in this film set in infamous drug cartel city of Cali. victor Marlon Moreno and Eusedio Oscar Borda are two low level criminals one who has stolen a bag of his bosses drug money and the other who has killed the bosses godson. The consequences of their actions drive the darkly witty plot with lots of twists turns and gruesome killings. It's a fast paced script from director Moreno along with Alonso Torres and colorful cinematography by Juan Carlos Gil. Still it's a typical blood and guts mob movie about greed and betrayal but it does have several interesting characters and some strange comedy like a Quentin Tarantino might have. I would give it a 7.0 out of 10.".

This is also the debut film of writerdirector Carlos Moreno and he offers up a dark crime drama mixed with dark comedy in this film set in infamous drug cartel city of Cali. victor Marlon Moreno and Eusedio Oscar Borda are two low level criminals one who has stolen a bag of his bosses drug money and the other who has killed the bosses godson. The consequences of their actions drive the darkly witty plot with lots of twists turns and gruesome killings. It's a fast paced script from director Moreno along with Alonso Torres and colorful cinematography by Juan Carlos Gil. Still it's a typical blood and guts mob movie about greed and betrayal but it does have several interesting characters and some strange comedy like a Quentin Tarantino might have. I would give it a 7.0 out of 10.";

As cruel and cynical as Tarantino's and Rodrigues' artificial works it's based on real Cali life. And it's deeply moralistic despite all its cruelty. The movie boasts with at least four brilliant acting performances each of them worth festivals' laurels. Charismatic Marlon Moreno acts unforgettably with glances and silent pauses being responsible for the dramatic tension throughout the movie. Multifaced Alvaro Rodriguez deserves the Best Supporting Actor award at any festival. But the truly brilliant is Blas Jaramillo El Orejn a theatrical actor from Bogot who wasn't able to see the final cut having left this world because of pancreatitis and peritonitis in his 39.No dogsuffering scenes.".

I think that's exaggerated. I do think some actors overact like El Orejon Blas Jaramillo. Nonetheless i don't believe like others that this is a bad movie on the contrary i think that looking and comparing it with other Colombian films it's probably one of the best. I don't think the intention of the writerdirector was for us to empathize with the characters like somebody said it's more a movie of atmospheres and i think that is the way the story plot is narrated rather than the story itself. Is more the form and structure than the content the story turns around two main characters Luna Negra Oscar Borda and Pearanda Marlon Moreno and around the way the sensationalist journal El Caleo retakes an element of the plot and presents it to the public as something that has already happened but that the characters who read it don't even suspect that they are involved in it one way or the other sometimes neither those the viewer. This is something that goes unnoticed for many viewers of the film. And the other element is the man who's always calling to the motel room asking for a woman who isn't there we believe this is just some kind of joke but it has a consequence in the end. Another interesting thing are the two main characters one which is cursed by a voodoo sorceress which uses a picture of him in a glass with a millipedes that crushes the picture as a symbol of what's going to happen to him. You can see how the character's condition deteriorates throughout the film the nightmares the hallucinations the vision of his victim drowning in the sewer and the way his little donutlike antistress object is dragged mysteriously by the sewer. The other character Pearanda is the streetdog who thinks his more clever than the mobsterpedigreedog and who thinks he's going to get along untouched with his plan. The end of the film is somewhat predictable a way of saying that crime doesn't pay".

Don't get me wrong it's great to see Stephen Elliott ham it up as Bronson's boss in Assassination or Juan Fernandez as a creepy pimp in Kinjite Forbidden Subjects but aside from one or two OK performances good old Charlie was too often surrounded by gradeC actors or good but uninspired actors the last two decades of his career. Messenger of Death however is an exception.Here the legendary actionhero is surrounded by the likes of Jeff Corey Daniel Benzali John Ireland Charles Dierkop Police Woman and given likeable female support from Trish Van Devere. The story itself is just average but certainly not as ludicrous as the paperthin material in movies like Assassination and Death Wish 4 and 5 and you know where I'm going.British veteran director J. LeeThompson Cape Fear The Guns of Navarone did an impressive nine movies with Bronson and Messenger of Death was their 8th teaming. It opens with a horrifying scene where a large family is executed in cold blood the entire scene is brilliantly done and much better than what one would expect from someone who just did Death Wish 4 and Firewalker. The movie then delivers a lot of beautiful scenery a smashing actionscene with some trucks and a likeable finale where the guilty party is unmasked.Compared to most Bronsonfare at the time this is betterthanaverage much thanks to the afore mentioned good supporting cast. But don't expect mindless vigilante action Bronson plays a reporter but he still gets to kick some ass and he does a nice job considering he was in his late sixties at the time.".

Images of women amiably chatting and young children peacefully playing in the morning sun get barbarically interrupted when suddenly a shady figure holding a shotgun comes driving up to the house. Without speaking one word the man unhesitatingly butchers the women one pregnant one before turning towards the children and shooting them too. The latter killings occur off screen but the footage is nonetheless shocking considering the madman's emotionless modus operandi. This bit of content represents the promising beginning of a compelling and highly suspenseful  albeit flawed  thriller starring the almighty Charles Bronson in an unconventional at least for him role. Charlie depicts a journalist of the Denver newspaper who sinks his teeth into the circumstances surrounding the tragic massacre and stumbles upon a story bigger than he bargained for. The murders initially appear to be a dramatic consequence of a longrunning vendetta between a separated family of Mormons but our courageous reporter gradually uncovers a convoluted and inhumanly cruel conspiracy which concerns  of course  eminent politicians and wealthy businessmen. I honestly expected to find a slightly higher rating and more positivetoned reviews for Messenger of Death around here to be honest. Admittedly the evolution of the storyline is rather predictable and the eventual settlement is too tame but the film definitely maintains a high tempo and a good number of sequences are very tense and literally actionpacked. Charles Bronson tries his hardest to come across as a plausible journalist but there are definitely some problems regarding his character. Bronson isn't exactly known as the most talkative actor in Hollywood a trademark that usually fits his regular roles of mercenaries The Mechanic Violent City and tormented avengers the Death Wish franchise very well. But even here his number of speeches and dialogs are kept to an absolute minimum which isn't normal when you're a reporter. Moreover in spite of his 'normal' job and lifestyle he still wipes the floor with professional hit men and stuntdrives his way out of an assassination attempt! Since when do Denver journalists receive training in martial arts and defensive driving? The remote Colorado filming locations as well as the largely unfamiliar traditions of Mormon families add up to the ominous atmosphere but still director J. Lee Thompson Cape Fear The Guns of Navarone doesn't use up the full potential of these terrific. Messenger of Death is an interesting film to say the least and it deserves a bit more appreciation from Bronson fanatics as well as fans of suspense films in general.".

Tough 'Denver Tribune' crime reporter Garret Smith Bronson  he was about sixtysix years of age when he appeared here persuades him to help him in the case of the slaying of his family . As there is an extreme feud between different Mormon sects  one being led by Willis Beecham Jeff Corey and the other led by his brother Zenas Beecham John Ireland . Smith  helped by Jastra Watson Trish Van Devere  uncovers a strange conspiracy around oldrich real state . This light entertainment and standard Bronson movie is full of action  thrills  and disturbing scenes . Here Bronson rules in his usual stoic acting and displays efficiently his weapons  killing mercilessly nasties . The meaning and relevance of this movie's title is that it refers to a drawing featuring an avenging angel of death that is left at a crime scene at the beginning of the flick . The title also suggests that Bronson is a 'Messenger of Death' the word messenger also being a play on words with this as his character is a reporter  a job which involves writing news articles  they being messages in a sense . In the film there is frantic action  thrilling cartrucks pursuits  shootouts  intrigue  little bit of violence and including a twisted as well as suspenseful finale . Based on a book and scripted by Paul Jarrico  as its source Rex Burns novel 'The Avenging Angel' was first published in 1983  though the film has little in common with the novel it is based on . From the beginning until ending the actionpacked and fast moving is continued and that's why the picture results to be entertaining . This is one of the last films last movie was Kinjite Charles Bronson made for Cannon Films and it represents the ninth and final of ten teamings between producer Pancho Kohner and star actor Bronson . Charles Bronson acting is wooden as being habitual in his roles as an investigatorexecutioner . Here he plays a reporter who carries out an investigation and finds out about economic motives for a massacre . This journalist evokes the crime writer character he played in St. Ives 1976  the first movie he made with Thompson . The great spotlights of the film are the spectacular chases  car crashes between Bronson's car and the big juggernaut as well as the ending confrontation that's stimulating and moving . Nice and wide support cast  such as  Daniel Benzali  Marilyn Hasset  John Cedar  Penny Peyser  Tom Everett and Gene Davis who starred a heinous killer in 10 to midnight by Thompson . Special mention for Laurence Luckinbill who gives an overacting with quite gesticulation . And the elders of this movie's religious groups are played by three stars of old Western movies  Charles Dierkop  Jeff Corey and John Ireland . It packs and evocative and adequate cinematography by Gideon Porath . Atmospheric soundtrack by Robert O. Ragland  including stirring choral score in the title and final credits composed in Jerry Goldsmith's Omen style . The fare was regularly directed by J. Lee Thompson  though he fell ill during the making of this film  the picture was then finished by the first and 2nd unit director  Robert C. Ortwin Jr. and George Van Noy . It's narrated understanding as well as hardly . This movie represented the eighth and penultimate of nine teaming of director 'J Lee Thompson' with star actor Charles Bronson . This Thompson movie was theatrically released between his pictures Death Wish 4 The Crackdown 1986 and Kinjite 1989  both of them starred by Bronson .

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Bronson plays investigative reporter Garret Smith for the Denver Tribune in this motion picture about a blood feud between two brothers of different Mormon sects. With outside political as well as economic overtones. A decent story about religious jealousy and the behind the scenes politics of exploiting it. The feud between brothers Willis Jeff Corey and Zenas John Ireland Beecham is instigated when Willis' son's Orville's Charles Dierkop family is massacred. Willis believes that it was the work of Zenas and starts an all out war against his brother which ends with both brothers getting killed. But there's something else that has nothing to do with the feud between the brother's that's central to the story A lake of artesian water under brother's Zenas' property that can be used to turn common and plentiful shale into valuable and scarce fuel oil. Charles Bronson is still believable at age 67 as the tough reporter that gets to the bottom of the story with his fists as well as his typewriter to uncover the truth about Orville's family being murdered. As well as who ordered it that instigated a war between his father and uncle and why.With the exception of the beginning the movie Messenger of Death cuts down on the violence and concentrated more on the story which made the movie more interesting to watch. And also gave the audience more time to think who's behind the murders that happened to the Orville Beecham family which built up to a better then average ending. The ending of Messenger of Death though a bit contrived and what seemed forced still tied the story together and made it believable. One of Charles Bronson's best later efforts when he was still effective as an action hero or in this case an action reporter on the screen.".

The music score is great the plottwist okay and the scenery makes for something completely different after seeing Charlie deathwishing in the Big City gutters.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very good Bronson thriller that's at times creepy with an amazing performance from Charles Bronson!. It's pretty engaging and at times very creepy and the ending was very memorable plus it had quite a few shocking moments. The first 10 minutes were absolutely fantastic it had lots of tension and was very creepy and it was cool to see Bronson do something different plus it was unpredictable throughout!. If your looking for lots of action look elsewhere however if your looking for a very good thriller look no further as the film provides plenty of thrills and suspense! plus the finale was great and very suspenseful. I wasn't expecting much from this film because a lot of people consider it to be one of Bronson's worst however i enjoyed it very much and i highly recommend it!. The Direction is very good. J. Lee Thompson does a very good job here with good camera work and keeping the film at an engaging pace!. There is a tiny bit of blood. We get quite a few bloody gunshot wounds but that's it. The Acting is excellent!. Charles Bronson is AMAZING as he always was and is Amazing here he is extremely likable convincing was intense kicked that ass and was tons of fun to watch! Bronson ruled!. Trish Van Devere is okay with what she had to do and did her job adequately. Laurence Luckinbill is good when he was on screen and did his job well. Daniel Benzali is also good with what she had to do. Charles DierkopJeff Corey and John Ireland are all awesome as the Beecham's. rest of the cast are fine. Overall highly recommended!. 12 out of 5".

It appears some whackjob lost his gauge on reality and unloaded on an entire Mormon family. Even killing the kids. It does not take a prophet to get the fact no one cares for this .Bronson befriends the Mormon family patriarch and a strange friendship starts. He first tells the man's father who then accuses his own brother. We then hop off to Glenwood Springs  Colorado where the local not so friendly sheriff points Bronson to the farm of the accused brother.After hitching a ride with one of the brothers many cousins  the accused brother accuses the brother who accused him. More back n forth than a washing machine in motion. Bronson doesn't buy it. The tanker truck that suddenly runs them off the road certainly makes the brothers doing it not wash. As Bronson digs deeper he finds the debutante of a very powerful businessman owns the tanker truck company.Back home in New Zion the brother has decided that when it comes to the violent murder of his grand children God can sit judgment out. After organizing his flock he heads to Colorado for a shootout with his brother. Bronsan warns the brother moments before a shootout begins and during the fire fight learns this piece of land has billions of gallons of water under it  that guess what some nearby water company has been dying to get their hands on  even with all the pieces he can't stop both brothers from killing one another .Afterwards  the tanker truck returns with its friends  and demolishes the vehicle Bronson Is leaving in. Back in Denver the chief of police is holding his first fundraiser via his old business partner Fox. After the death of a source and an earlier knife fight with the killer Bronson comes face to face with the cutthroat again. After a brief struggle we get all the answers.Disclaimer  A Golan  Globas production. That's 80's film speak for B Rate  but remember without these two you would never know who Chuck Norris is.I have to admit it was a good script no problem with it. The acting could be shaky at times and the direction clearly had a problem with achieving the psychological moods in scenes. There is enough here to pass a Sunday afternoon sometime but not much else.".

Ultimately the filmmaking  storytelling is pretty simplistic which is a shame as this look at a certain culture could have yielded more interesting results. Bronson plays a more upbeat character than usual but Garret or Garr as friends call him is still a typical Bronson bad ass who can hand others' asses to them without expending much energy himself. The opening set piece of the killing of innocent women and children is pretty chilling and there's one action highlight of two big rigs sandwiching a truck in between them. But the ending is rather weak wrapping up too quickly and producing little satisfaction.Bronsons' supporting cast is pretty damn good Trish Van Devere Laurence Luckinbill Daniel Benzali Charles Dierkop Corey Ireland Gene Davis Bronsons' nemesis in 10 to Midnight Jon Cedar Tom Everett Kimberly Beck William Phipps.

There's a decent cast  Bronson van Devere Benzali Ireland Corey  and an intriguing setting but the plot is fatally anaemic and the direction considering it comes from an old trooper like Thompson is surprisingly shoddy. Much of the acting is secondrate at best while characters perform abrupt about turns for no explicable reason. For instance Orville Beecham Charles Dierkop a cleanliving Mormon farmer is crazy for revenge after mysterious intruders murder his wives and children and yet is full of forgiveness after the rest of his family is wiped out in a gunfight.The film opens well with an atmospheric prologue in which two mysterious gunmen massacre the wives and children although why the gunmen's identities are concealed is something of a mystery as they disappear for the next thirty minutes and are immediately confirmed as the killers when they reappear. Anyway from this neatly paced opener the film goes rapidly downhill. Charles Bronson plays a Denver reporter who gets involved with the warring Mormon clans who go to war over the killings and he's pretty bad here. He was 67 when the film was made and he looks bloated and tired. On top of that he's saddled with an awful script and a frankly ludicrous storyline  which is a crime really because the unusual subject matter here deserves much better writing than that offered by 73yearold writer Paul Jarrico. Director J. Lee Thompson manages a couple of effective scenes and there is a good sequence in which two water tankers attempt to crush Bronson's vehicle on a winding country road but for the most part his direction is flat and uninspired and the story simply fails to engage.Bottom line give this one a miss.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well this doesn't mitigate the sump that Charles Bronson found himself in in the 1980s but at least it's a variation on his them of hardboiled avenger. Here he's an investigative reporter for a Denver newspaper. He only fires a gun once and at an empty coffin. He gets to beat hell out of a scowling wouldbe assassin  twice  but the blood is minimal. He never wrenches off anyone's head with a wisecrack and pees down the neck cavity. That has to be a variation right? The story is pretty simple. The women of a rural family in Colorado are slaughtered along with half a dozen young children by mysterious visitors. Bronson is on the case. The patriarch luckily absent at the time of the shootings leads Bronson to an angry fundamentalist Mormon of the John Brown type  all bulging eyes stentorian voice and oversized gestures. That would be Jeff Corey. The massacred family was part of Corey's flock. Corey blames his brother a balding John Ireland who runs a huge farm nearby. Bronson intervenes when the two feuding families begin to exchange shots but both Corey and Ireland are offed  not by their opposing clans but by outside snipers on a distant hill. Something like that anyway. Who cares? It made no difference to the screenwriter.Those distant snipers it turns out represent the Colorado Water Company. Water is precious in them thar hills. There's plenty of water to drink but far more has to be shipped in at great expense to provide the six barrels of water that the shale company needs to produce one barrel of oil. Ireland's farm is sitting on top of a huge aquifer that would provide all the water for a pittance but Ireland has refused to sell. This is our land. We live on it. It's our home and so forth.Well you see the Colorado Water Company WANTS that land of Ireland. To them it's an emerald isle. So someone is trying to start a feud between Corey's clan and Ireland's clan in hopes that with the land passing into other hands the Colorado Water Company can buy it up.But who's behind it all? Bronson through his newspaper knows some of Denver's elite including the owners of the Water Company. You can tell they're the elite because at parties they wear tuxedos sip champagne and nibble canaps instead of wolfing down Rocky Mountain oysters after a shot and a beer. But although the chief miscreants are somewhere among them it's hard to tell just who they are. There's the ambitious Chief of Police running for mayor. There's Laurence Luckinbill as a goodnatured pal of everybody. And there are the owners of Colorado Water the husband who gave the company to his wife as a Christmas present and the pretty wife who seems to know nothing about managing the company.The film is more of a mystery than an action movie and that's rather refreshing in itself. I mean imagine Bronson only slugging a snarling heavy twice and shooting a gun only once. Still there's a nifty scene of Bronson and his colleague Trish Vandevere almost being squashed between two eighteenwheeled tankers. It's a familiar crisis though. I always find myself wondering why the driver of the car doesn't just stop his vehicle and let the two trucks keep going.If you or I were to make a Charles Bronson Movie we might do it exactly the way that GolanGlobus did. You begin with a sloppy screenplay that ends with a ludicrous climax. And you hire a director and all the principal actors who are over the hill just sitting around somewhere in Tonopah Nevada living off residuals. They don't have to act anyway just say their lines and move along. It doesn't matter if like Charles Dierkop the patriarch of the slaughtered family you can hardly act at all. What difference does it make when you're given nothing but stilted lines that avoid contractions in order to sound some Biblical resonance  We did not ask you to come we do not ask you to stay it is the Lord's angels who will seek out vengeance. Mormons don't speak like that not even the polygynous fundamentalists who lived in Short Creek Arizona fifty years ago. Nor do they call themselves Mormons. That's a Gentile appellation. They are LDS to each other. On top of that Mormon angels don't have wings unlike those shown in this flick. I suppose the writers avoided setting the story in the location we'd have expected Appalachia because the stereotype had become too familiar. So they created a new set of stereotypes.I was glad that the film gave Bronson a chance to wash the gunpowder residue off his hands and that we get to see some of Colorado's magnificently chilly scenery  but what a sloppy job by all concerned.".

	schema:headline " An '80's GolanGlobusCannon Charles Bronson Action Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a wonderful slice of the '80's and I was only too pleased to watch this again. The story is actually a whodunnit as a group of Mormon women and children are massacred a couple of the religious factions are blamed for the incident. Especially when one of the factions believes that by killing some of their congregation they are helping them to find enlightenment in the afterlife.This is where Bronson as hardened reporter Garret Smith comes into the story. He starts to investigate the murders and what he finds sets him and the people around him on a dangerous path to the truth. Let me start by saying that I admire Bronson as an actor though when he signed to the CannonGolanGlobus deal they wanted him as the hardman. So when he's in Death Wish he's an architect... though you definitely wouldn't want to get on his mean side when he goes for revenge. The same can be said here. Even though he's a reporter he holds himself in a way that says don't mess with me! That aside as with all his films he still puts in the acting skills he's acquired over the years and is always a pleasure to watch. He was one of my Dad's favourite actors and I'm glad he introduced me to his films. What you get in this film is plenty of action and above average acting. In fact there are quite a few good actors in this flick including Laurence Luckinbill Daniel Benzali Jeff Corey and John Ireland. It's also nice that the guilty party is not revealed until the last minute. The writer and director do a decent job of weaving your thoughts and the suspects together in a way that you're never really sure. However the ending is a little strange  I would have written it differently though the sudden ending really does work well with this style of movie.My favourite thing about this was the car and truck chases that had a reminiscent feel of Spielberg's Duel. I doff my hat to the stuntmen and drivers in these scenes. These are real vehicles with real stunts and explosions  nothing is CGI.If you like an entertaining action film with a hint of a whodunnit then this film should be right up your street as long as your not being chased down by a Semitruck. If you were wondering what was so special about the '80's then this will enlighten you especially since it's a Cannon  GolanGlobus Movie  it just couldn't get better.".

But after the first few scenes everything just falls apart deteriorating into something so slipshod and amateurish it wouldn't even pass as a TV movie. Does anyone know the backstory on the production of this movie? Was the script not finished when filming began? Did director J. Lee Thompson get sick during production? Did the GolanGlobus factory demand that the movie be made on an Ed Wood type schedule and budget?

Well maybe I was in for a surprise. You never know. So I took the risk and rented the film. But in the first moments of the film I noticed that this one was not different at all  it was just another brick in the wall.To begin with apart from the differences of sex and looks there's nothing to really differentiate the characters in this film. Other films are able to provide simple characters even if onedimensional ones with whom we can identify with. This film gives us a very superficial glimpse of the characters their relationships conflicts.. What we see in All the boys love Mandy Lane is just a bunch of stereotyped American teenagers like we've seen so many times before.And how is Mandy Lane? Mandy Lane as portrayed by Amber Heard is just your typical high school girl. There are many girls like her  in any high school there are dozens of Mandy Lanes. Amber Heard has nothing really distinctive about her. She's pretty that's all. Then why do all the boys love Mandy Lane? This is a film that's why.That said let's go to the film. As you well know all the guys are mad about Mandy Lane. The boys with the help of the girls prepare a party. Mandy Lane is invited to this party. The party is to take place in an isolated ranch. No one had succeeded till now in scoring Mandy. The objective of this party is to ease things out. A girl in the group wants to make it with a guy there are rivalries frustrations and last but not least there's someone that loves Mandy so much that heshe is ready to kill for her. But make no mistake anyone will guess from the beginning who the killer is but prepare yourself for a wild twist that will put everything upside down.If the script had managed to give us flesh and body characters and describe in more detail the relationship among the characters their emotions their conflicts... this film could have been a memorable slasher teen flick. Had the film been done in the right way there would be in it a growing sense of fear of encirclement. Conflicts fights suspicion and death advancing on and on.. outside just the empty fields... but the film is unable to build up the suspense. All the boys love Mandy Lane is just a passable entertainment and nothing more. If you want to see a film with more substance try High Tension Haute Tension a very good french slasher flick.".

Mandy's friend Emmet's Michael Welch provocation to another fellow student to show his love for Mandy leaves the fellow student drunk and jump down to death. Nine months pass and Mandy is invited for a summer weekend to a secluded ranch by her teenager friends  three girls and three boys go there! There is a security guard Garth Anson Mount who works at the ranch. During the first night itself the killings take place  one by one the members of the group are killed. Who is behind the killings? I wont tell here to spoil sports Did I like the movie? NO. After usual interesting opening  the movie takes a downward turn with every unfolding of event. By halftime when the killer is revealed one looses all interest in the remaining proceedings. There is a last twist in the tale to shock viewers but rather it made me shake the head in disbelief and laugh! All this for suspense? Huh! Amber Heard acts and plays her role well as a shy and conscious girl  who is aware of her beauty and men's desire for her. The remaining cast are usual  nothing to say about. There are so many movies made of teenager boys and girls going to a secluded place and slowly someone killing them one by one  that it does not interest me anymore.Director Jonathan Levine tries hard to make the movie interesting by using contemporary chat talks of teenagers loaded with sexual overtones but does not allow the movie to rise above the mundane.The only and the most appealing saving grace of the movie is its cinematography by Darren Genet  who captures beautiful picture perfect images! Stars 3 out of 10".

And what's the motive of Mandy Lane at all? Emmet does everything what Mandy wants from him but why does she do all that? There seems to be no reason to take revenge for something or anything else? Only that they go on her nerves that they all want her? That's too airy. Maybe the friends of the guy who crashed at the edge on the swimming pool gave him from then a hard time. But there's nothing to see about that in the movie. And even though it wouldn't make sense because why should Mandy help Emmet to take revenge when she's not giving' a damn about him?The reasons why i'm giving it not less than 5 points is that the film has a nice photography an acceptable soundtrack a promising start and the direction is a little better than the usual teen horror movies. It's a bit more realistic slasher and two or three elements are interesting.But considering that it became so much so good criticisms this is NOT such a great or innovative slasher movie.

When the film isn't obeying the supposed rule of tell don't show the film will make sure to objectify Mandy by constantly filming every inch of her body in slomo and making sure that the light is always cascading around her like she's in a calendar shoot. It gets even worse when Amber Heard thinks that acting like you are the most desired female in all of existence means just look at the ground smile weakly and play with your hair. That's the most acting you get out of her.It's clear this movie wanted to be one of those iconic teen slasher films from the 70s and 80s but it just didn't feel like finding the energy or desire to do so.Hi!

It gets even worse when Amber Heard thinks that acting like you are the most desired female in all of existence means just look at the ground smile weakly and play with your hair. That's the most acting you get out of her.It's clear this movie wanted to be one of those iconic teen slasher films from the 70s and 80s but it just didn't feel like finding the energy or desire to do so.Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies! So much so that I write a blog where I review whatever movie I am watching at the time.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow I didn't expect much from this movie considering that its story sounded pretty mediocre. But it didn't take long to realize that All the boys love Mandy Lane is far from the typical Slasher Movie and that is because its in all ways superior done... biggest plus is the stunning visuals and cinematography that captures you in a strange dreamlike feeling throughout the movie and is well supported by the use of music which is kind of cynical and used very little but effective. Seeing that this is the first feature film production of Producer Levine I have to lift my thumbs way up for this one! So what do you get... Mandy Lane is a beautiful but rather distanced girl and most boys in her school are after her. After a friend of her dares another guy who is after her to impress Mandy by jumping from a roof ending in a serious accident Mandy distances from him and gives in to join a couple of cool guys and girls on a weekend stay at a land house. You pretty much know whats coming when you got a bunch of teenagers in a house far from other people so soon the first ones start to disappear. What makes this movie work is the indepth depiction of the characters most having their issues behind the mask they wear at high school. A big part of the movie seems to look into a rather bleak and cynical youth making it seem like a modern high school version of Stand by me on acid that heavily mixes with Slashers like Scream. If you are in for some serious slashing you don't get much but there is some scenes that are incredibly harsh not so much for the blood but rather for the cynical editing and use of stopframes and music. After all you are in for 12 twists in the end and to me the movie leaves a lot to your own interpretation. But all this makes it enjoyable and different. Definitely give this movie a try because it would be a shame if it got lost in the masses of redundant slasher movies... if you got a little bored with the genre like me All the boys love Mandy Lane is a real gem.".

It's not perfect but it did have its moments with the following of recent trends in the slasher genre that bad guys don't have to necessarily finish last.

All The Boys Love Mandy Lane also has a really good soundtrack of melancholy pop music culminating in a song that everybody knows One of the creepiest pop songs of all time. You will know what it is.

There are good performances and an inventive script touching on interesting issues such as sexual attraction jealousy the school hierarchy peer pressure and rivalry and the problems of the modern body image.Hey!

	schema:headline " Okay Here's My Analysis of the Ending of Mandy Lane";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers.....................................Mandy and Emmett are in on it together at first after the pool party. She is probably 100 into it because Emmett was ostracized when the first jock got killed at the pool party and her looks got her an instant acceptance into popularity. She stayed friends with Emmett on the sly. Emmett is a little more off the deep end than Mandy mentallyshe's being wanted and adored and he is shunned. 9 months pass. Prior to reaching the ranch Mandy and one of the boys stays behind to wait for the ranch hand to pick them up because the rich girl doesn't want to drive over a cattle guard. When the very adult ranch hand appears in the jeep after the boy makes his move there is a change in Mandy's expressionstarstruck would be a good description. She'd been dealing with boys so Garth is probably her first experience with a grown male outside of school teachers. When the party arrives at the ranch there's a slo mo of Mandy looking around almost like she is casing the place. Her bond with Garth hasn't formed yet so she is still team Emmett. Up to when Garth is shot by Emmett Mandy's hands if not conscience is clean. She stays in the main ranch house to patch up Garth. Red and Chloe make a run for it. Mandy's administrations have a definite sexual overtone all on her part. You can see her alliances shifting Garth has obviously not been included in the plans. Red gets shot Chloe runs finds the bodies like somebody has to in a slasher. Garth tells Mandy his jeep keys are in his cottage and to go get them. While Mandy is getting the keys she finds a sharp knife with an antler handle on the counter. She takes both. Emmett drives after Chloe through a hay field obviously capable of running over her but choosing to chase her cat and mouse style. Mandy sees her yells for Chloe to run to her and Chloe does. As Mandy hugs Chloe to her she stabs her fatally with the knife while telling her with real emotion it will all be okay. She hugs Chloe for two reasons she didn't want to kill her friend so holds her close to soothe her through her death two Mandy needs blood on herself so Emmett would believe she killed Garth. The suicide pact probably was real when the two of them cooked it up but Mandy has changed her mind. Mandy refuses to take the pills that will kill her. She sees Garth stumbling behind Emmett and she cries out for Garth to shoot Emmet. Emmett gets hit but still has some strength to beat more crap out of Garth until Mandy distracts him and she starts running across a field only to fall into a pit where diseased cattle had been killed discussed earlier. Emmett still thinks he can persuade Mandy to come back to him but she beats him to death with probably a leg bone leaving him with the line she'd like to finish high school. Clues of Mandy's involvement culminate in her waking up in the kitchen with a streak of blood in her hair as if Emmett had to stroke a strand when he was in the kitchen making the refrigerator magnets line up to spell Wake Up not only to wake up from sleeping but that it was time for her to do some of the bloody work another reason she chose to kill Chloe over Garth she needed to have blood on her for when she saw Emmett face to faceit was a bonus for Emmett to see her kill Chloe too. Approaching Garth at the end Mandy has the knife and there is a brief moment where you might think she's going to finish him off too but she has chosen him as her man. I'd argue she chose him as soon as she took the truthdare to go to his cottage and invite him to the party. It isn't exactly a move for a shy virginal girl to do. It shows her interest in Garth and that she trusts he isn't going to hit on her as every other boy does. She bundles Garth alive into the jeep and they drive off into the sunset ? to one of the many appropriate melancholy remakes of the cheerful hit songs of slasher golden days. Garth is the male figure she wants not only as a role model but as the final bachelor. So sayeth I who was around in the 1970's to see the original slashers. The twist is killer haha but it makes sense when you think about it. Emmett is the willing killer for a warped love. Until this weekend and her encounter with Garth I don't think Mandy had any sexual feelings at all other than to repel them. But once Emmett was in full tilt she was forced to participate. I would almost class Mandy as a suicidal prone person used to being objectified by peers and abandoned she's an orphan. Garth has integrity maturity values and an adult role model with sexually controlled behavior who admires Mandy particularly at the end when he says she saved them which gives her more self worth than just her looks. If it lasts who knows.".

Garth is the male figure she wants not only as a role model but as the final bachelor. So sayeth I who was around in the 1970's to see the original slashers. The twist is killer haha but it makes sense when you think about it. Emmett is the willing killer for a warped love. Until this weekend and her encounter with Garth I don't think Mandy had any sexual feelings at all other than to repel them. But once Emmett was in full tilt she was forced to participate. I would almost class Mandy as a suicidal prone person used to being objectified by peers and abandoned she's an orphan. Garth has integrity maturity values and an adult role model with sexually controlled behavior who admires Mandy particularly at the end when he says she saved them which gives her more self worth than just her looks. If it lasts who knows.";

Of course it is aimed more at the teentwen audience but what slasher isn't.

One wonders if the story will be developed in a sequel to evil. Although the ending is unexpected the film is fair to its audience in providing adequate clues along the way to the source of evil rather than providing only red herrings to miss lead the audience.The movie was beautifully filmed in a striking location in dry land Texas.

	schema:headline " Cream of the chop";
	schema:reviewBody "I attended the world premiere of All the Boys Love Mandy Lane at the Toronto Film Festival. From that night on I couldn't stop talking about it. This film is a gem in so many ways. Young first time director Jonathan Levine has crafted a brilliant twist on the old school teen slasher flick. With a script by Jacob Forman who clearly has a passion for the genre Levine assembled a frighteningly talented cast of young actors who made these characters so real that it seemed improvised. As it turned out much of it was as pointed out in the QA which followed the screening. When they partied they partied. And it results in a natural carefree ensemble performance that makes this film what it is  pure fun. The production values belie the film's meager budget 500K?. For example the effective use of neutral film stock underprocessed at times gives segments of the film a home movie look a la Blair Witch. The selective use of slowmo and freezeframe add to the big movie feel of this little indie. As with all good horror films Levine infuses the film with an appropriately foreboding score. And as an added bonus the soundtrack features 80's classics which enhance the old school feel especially if you're old enough to have been in school then. There's plenty of blood and gore here of course but tongue is also firmly planted in cheek.File these names under people to watch Michael Welch Aaron Himelstein Luke Grimes Edwin Hodge and Whitney Able. Amber Heard is Mandy Lane she also shines in Alpha Dog. Anson Mount rounds out the cast and is a familiar face to many. Many of the cast were present at the screening also seeing it for the first time along with the audience. Those I chatted up afterward were humble and gracious and worthy of all the attention this film deserves. I don't consider myself a horror fan but of the 30 plus films I saw this is among the cream of the crop. Or should I say cream of the chop. Put All the Boys Love Mandy Lane at the top of your list.".

It actually takes the time to create intriguing and complicated characters who are more than just horrormovieteenagers Everyone involved did an amazing job in front of and behind the camera. The movie looked incredible and had a great soundtrack. I was at the Toronto Film Fest premiere and it was crazy!Almost everyone involved seemed to be there and they seemed thrilled at the warm reception they received. Everyone from the cast was supernice and really downtoearth. All of the actors did a wonderful job at making you really care about what would happen to their characters. It's rare that a horror film in the teenslasher mold takes the time to actually put in some genuinely touching character moments but this film has many. It really has a lot to say about the difficulties and contradictions in teenage life. It's just too bad that Amber Heard couldn't be there. Her performance was truly amazing. She has to be one of the most beautiful and magnetic actresses working today. Whenever she's on screen you can't take your eyes off of her  not only because of her beauty but because of all of the subtle little things she does in her performance.

If it's true what a friend told me that this script had been rewritten 18 ! times then Jesus Christ I don't wanna know what the first draft looked like.

For instance in one scene the girls are talking one whips down her trousers to sit on the toilet and her friend starts ribbing her about her pubic hair. The film carries on in this general manner although not graphic or titillating or offensive this snap shot into the lives of oversexed American teens is just kind of embarrassing to watch especially with relatives. The camera hovers at breast height for the majority of the film especially when Mandy is running or jumping which is great! but again makes you feel a bit guilty you are watching so avidly maybe it is an English thing.The film gets plus points for...Good production but not overly glossy.The gore has been kept down but the murders still make you wince.Stays inside the classic 90 minute barrier.Keeps you guessing you will work out the ending ahead of time but not before mixing it up with lots of other theories.Over all it is an okay film takes a while to heat up then burns out fast. No notable moments of horror genius but no really terrible movie blunders either.A solid horror just don't expect too much.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't go into this film with any real expectations  most of the reviews I'd read were good but as any veteran of this site will know the first reviews submitted for any film don't tend to be very reliable! It turns out that is the case here too as despite a couple of good ideas this is nothing more than another tired teen slasher flick. In 2005 Australian horror flick Wolf Creek attempted to bring back a seventies Grindhouse style to the slasher movie and this movie does too. Ironically they both suffer from the same major problem  that being that it's far too long before something finally happens. As the title suggests the main player here is a young girl called Mandy Lane who believe it or not is fancied by all the boys at her high school. Apparently she suddenly got hot over the summer and the film starts out with a sequence that shows how far some of the male population will go to impress her. Some time after some of the kids at this school are going for a party at a secluded ranch and they decide to invite Mandy along...and after a while they start being picked off one by one.It seems obvious that director Jonathan Levine was trying to make a movie in the seventies style and for that reason it's a real shame that this wasn't better as I'm a big fan of the stuff that this takes influence from. The director packs the film with pop songs which is OK but it soon gets tired and he could have chosen better also. As mentioned the film is far too slow after the opening sequence it seriously is about an hour before anything of interest happens and I was already turned off long before it got to the end. The cast is obviously made up of young actors and despite the fact that all the characters in the film are completely one dimensional they do manage to put in good performances as an ensemble. Amber Heard is good enough in the lead role...though doesn't really stand out much which is a shame considering she is the lead and the one that the film is all about. When the killings finally do happen they're not bad and there's some gore on display. It all boils down to the token slasher twist  and it's not a good one. It can be seen coming a mile off and there's not a lot of justification for it either. Overall I don't rate this film much at all  it's not a complete disaster but not far off.".

I can kind of see that.. but there was a sick humor to Sleepaway Camp that is NOT present in this film.Honestly.. at LEAST in Sleepaway Camp.. you could like some of the characters.. of dislike others.. this one really you're kind of just.. I don't really care at all.. they could be the killer.. killed... or thrown off a cliff or hit with an Acme rocket at least that would have spiced up the proceedings. What really we are missing is backstory which in Sleepaway Camp is very BRIEF.. but the opening of the film establishes it.. and you get the twist at the end.. this one.. you kind of fill in your own answers to.. but do you really care to? Therein lies the PROBLEM.All the guys love Mandy Lane? Yeah.. I can admit it.. guys are selfish and conceited.. and hey we're shallow not like you're innocent here ladies. The entire.. I'd say almost 510 MINUTES of the film is devoted more or less to the fact if not more that all these guys are powerless to struggle against her beauty.. of which.. there is no question of.. but.. is she THAT hot? or perfect? Not really.. and the other characters? I mean.. just.. stupid.. showcasing the worst in what kids can be.. its almost cartoonish! Which does make it kind of funny.. but as much as this film had been lauded on genre site Bloody Disgusting that I enjoy reading.. it felt like a very big let down.It's a film that is very much in the cookie cutter tradition an homage to the 80s low budget slashers not the Freddts and Jasons.. but as I said earlier it did as someone pointed out most remind me of the original Sleepaway Camp especially with the very last frame it almost SCREAMED it.. although this is a.. common film trick.. but its something I associate with that particular film.I don't want to get into spoiler territory here.. but the whole premise of the film.. about guys bringing out a bunch of girls.. one of whom has always been kind of.. stand offish in a bid for all of the guys it seems to take her virtue and be the guy to score Mandy Lane.. but for a film really honoring the whole 80s tradition of BAD acting and there is A lot.. just deal with it there's really very little in the way of over the top gore and nudity which were staples of the genre.So.. in the end.. while the reveal is interesting.. you have a rather just.. I won't say bloodless.. but gore lite badly acted lousy characters and writing while at times interestingly shot film.. that just falls flat until the last.. 15 or so minutes..which are interesting but by that point is much too far gone to save the film. I know it sounds that I HATE the film.. but I don't.. I just.. meh.. its an OK film.. but we've seen better even when they were making these films 20 years ago. And while it may be a fun diversion.. that's all it'll be.. maybe a bit better thought out than just a plain old.. crazy guy with no explanation hacking away.. it it a bit more.. intelligent at least like I said.. as I assumed what the motive was you really don't have a motive which is odd in itself you are left to infer it. Which is another problem.. trying to paint what is a very much B grade slasher as an art picture? Which.. it clearly is NOT by any leap.. It's an interesting watch.. but to see something more recent and actually interesting in this genre I actually recommend Behind the Mask The Rise of Leslie Vernon its a weird.. and unwieldy title.. and I had not given it a shot.. but is actually an interesting take on the slasher genre giving it a new twist.. not more of the same old..".

	schema:reviewBody "Operation Mad Ball is a peculiar combination of MASH and McHale's Navy taking some of the best elements of both tried and true military service comedies. Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs are a pair of beautifully matched antagonists.It's France after VE Day and our army is just an army of occupation now and awaiting orders either for home or may be the Pacific Theater. Jack Lemmon would like to throw a big blowout for everyone before they all separate. But the killjoy of the proceedings is Ernie Kovacs who is a petty martinet and constantly getting in the way of all Lemmon's schemes the way Captain Binghamton used to do with Lieutenant Commander McHale. And sad to say he doesn't have an island at his disposal where he could ship McHale off to the way Joe Flynn exiled Ernie Borgnine and the rest of his PT Crew.There's a little bit of Frank Burns on Kovacs's character as well as he tries to do things the military way while the commanding officer Arthur O'Connell is a doctor who just wants to run a hospital. See what happens at the beginning when Kovacs tries to court martial Lemmon and how O'Connell just gets out of it.But the main problem is getting the party together without Kovacs finding out about it. Lemmon is nothing if not resourceful and his main problems is getting women for the party. What's a party without them but the only women available are the nurses and the army's seen fit to commission them bringing in that pesky no fraternization rule. That in fact is what almost got Lemmon that court martial as Kovacs thought he was getting to familiar with Kathryn Grant. After all that was territory he had staked out and no enlisted man was going to move in on him.Look for a nice performance by Mickey Rooney in the small role of a human encyclopedia running a port facility a key guy in Lemmon's plans. And you haven't lived until you've heard an extremely bad version of In The Mood done on harmonica and ocarina. Good thing Glenn Miller had died before listening to this.Operation Mad Ball sad to say is too little seen these days. It's a great introduction to those who want to study the comedic art of Jack Lemmon. Try not to miss it when broadcast.".

You see early on that there is a Captain Ernie Kovacs who is a total jerk and an enlisted man Jack Lemmon who is always outsmarting him. Because the war is over and the men are longing to blow off some steam Lemmon plans for a giant partyone where the enlisted men can fraternize off the record with the nurses. But since this is clearly against regulations and the annoying Captain is looking for an excuse to bust Lemmon they need to tread very very lightly. Along the way there are tons of complications I liked the one involving the body and whether or not this insane ball will take place is constantly in doubt.The film is a nice little comedy with lots of nice twists and interesting characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Crazy Stupid Love. is one of if not the best American romantic comedies of the past decade. This may come as a shock to some as it surely took me aback but there is no other way to describe it. Going into an advanced screening of the film earlier this week I had my doubts that it would be anything outside of generic. But instead of tripe I got one of the most unexpected surprises I have seen all year.Cal Steve Carell and Emily Julianne Moore have hit a rough patch in their longtime marriage and Emily inadvertently announces to an entire restaurant that she wants a divorce. Down and depressed Cal starts drinking away his sorrows at a local bar attempting to make sense of his predicament with anyone who will listen. Jacob Ryan Gosling a professional bachelor takes notice and makes it his personal mission to help Cal get over his wife and become a new man in the process.But this is just the main plot thread of the movie. It also follows Jacob's relationship with the absolutely stunning Hannah Emma Stone throws in a bit of curveball with Emily being romanced by David Kevin Bacon and even has a bit of a focus on Cal's son Robbie Jonah Bobo pining over his older babysitter Jessica Analeigh Tipton. It may sound a little packed with threads and too many characters but Crazy Stupid Love. is able to navigate between each character and couple with ease. It reminded me a lot of Valentine's Day and how its main goal was to depict how different love is for a sizable amount of couples and singletons. Except it failed miserably at it and stood out more as an example of every romcom stereotype you could imagine. Thankfully Crazy Stupid Love. takes the higher road and breathes new life into a stale genre.While the impeccable cast is more than enough reason why the film succeeds so well in being an atypical film in the genre it is the crew behindthescenes that surprises even more. The film is written by Dan Fogelman who is best known for a string of Disney films and the atrocious Fred Claus and is directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who wrote and directed the sadly little seen I Love You Phillip Morris and wrote the now classic Bad Santa. These three would not be the first group on men I would turn to for a film like this but their relative lack of expertise helps propel the film to the heights it reaches. It takes darkly hilarious turns in certain instances plays other sequences totally unconventionally play even more out with a foreboding sense of drama the trailer merely hints at and trumps more than its share of genre stereotypes. Weaving between the plots lines they make the film feel unique and different from others all while giving it an aura of authenticity. While they stumble a bit in the final act with a series of sitcomlike shockers that border on ludicrous they manage to pull off the rare feat of actually making the audience wonder if these characters will all end up together in the end or if they will walk their separate ways something that is truly uncommon for this genre.Acting wise the film delivers in spades. Carell gives one of his best performances to date as Cal moving as swiftly as the script requires between depression and humiliation and touching and hilarious. The film stretches his dramatic muscle more than most and allows him to give a performance that does not rely on laughs. The expressions on his face are just devastating in some sequences and the wonder in other scenes is ridiculously hilarious. It is a performance I hope to see him come back to again and make even better. Gosling plays against type and gives an absolutely hysterical performance. He shines brightly in every scene nailing every line and mannerism while making this scumbag of a lothario become someone to really care about. He exudes chemistry and helps make everyone else's performance better. Moore and Stone also give great performances easily balancing the humour with the drama. They are not given nearly as much to do as the guys but hold their own on screen.The supporting cast does even better. Bobo is phenomenal in his role conveying an innocence and naivety that is more mature than I thought possible. He acts like more of an adult than some of the older cast does in many instances and gives the performance a wellrounded other young actors would be incapable of. Tipton is not nearly as good but plays the role of a confused teenager a little better than you would imagine. Bacon does great in a small turn as does Liza Lapira as Hannah's best friend. But it is Marisa Tomei who steals the show from everyone playing one of Cal's conquests. She is dementedly unhinged and ridiculously overthetop but never falters. Her performance may be onenote but it is easily the most memorable thing about the film.If I hold anything against the film other than the final act stumble and the ohso convenient way one particular scene comes together it is that it ended. I know I have harped on how unlike other typical romantic comedies Crazy Stupid Love. is but there is really no other way I can rave about it. I easily could have spent more time with these characters and pined to find out what happened to each of them after the final fade out. The incredibly unlikely pair of Ficarra and Requa has crafted a truly wonderful and hilarious film that is nothing like what you could have expected watching the trailer. It is bittersweet and easily one of my favourite movies of the summer. And this is coming from someone who loathes almost every single romantic comedy ever conceived.8.510.".

It has tremendous heart and charisma and it's so very easy to get caught up in to the lives of these characters.

The two of them have great chemistry together and provide plenty of laughs along with touching moments. I just saw this movie yesterday and I already want to see it again.

	schema:headline " Crazy Stupid Love is a real crowdpleaser";
	schema:reviewBody "It was roughly twothirds of the way into Crazy Stupid Love when I realized how invested the audience in my theater had become. The key scene involved a mom cleaning her daughter's room a seemingly mundane moment that produced gasps and cries of Oh no! even before the character makes a very revealing discovery. It's a scene that much like the rest of Crazy Stupid Love a heartwarming and at times painfully honest depiction of three couples at various stages in each of their relationships unfolds not with predictability so much as inevitability. Unlike your average generic romanticcomedy this movie focuses less on the end on who will end up with whom than on the special and often surprising connections that are made along the way. What's more it achieves the remarkable and alltoorare feat of actually moving the audience to care about the central characters to cheer when they come out on top and sympathize when they don't.Using a witty compassionate and eversoslightly subversive script from Dan Fogelman directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who are best known for writing the pitchblack comedysatire Bad Santa and only have one other directorial effort under their belts last year's I Love You Philip Morris guide the production along with subtle ease. They strike an ideal balance between humor and drama allowing the overall tone to develop organically. Laughs come mostly in chuckles at the cleverness of a line or its delivery and are never awkwardly forced in to lighten up a scene while the emotions feel genuine without becoming manipulative. Most of all their restrained approach allows the actors to breathe and to fully embody the characters they've been given.Speaking of which has there ever been a more likable group of people assembled for a film much less a romantic comedy? The cast gels remarkably well and at no point is anyone singled out as a villain even when a character threatens to become unlikable the actor portrays him or her with such keen understanding that it ultimately becomes hard if not impossible to not root for each and every one of them. Whenever the film tiptoes the line toward schmaltzy they pull it back making every line and emotion feel utterly real. As the unquestionable lead of the film Steve Carell displays a tenderness and dramatic depth he'd only hinted at in previous works like the unexpectedly moving The 40YearOld Virgin and occasional episodes of The Office while Ryan Gosling all immaculate grooming sly grins and twinkling eyes is perfectly cast as his foil Jacob a suave ladies' man who's really using all that money and swagger to disguise the emptiness he feels inside. Julianne Moore and Emma Stone are both lovely as Emily and Hannah respectively radiating a downtoearth presence and relatability that many other Hollywood actresses seem to lack. Also worth noting are Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo who form Crazy Stupid Love's youngest romantic pairing and have been all but ignored by the movie's publicity campaigns despite their obvious talents.What truly sets Crazy Stupid Love apart from other modernday romantic comedies aside from the perceptive writing and direction and a dream cast is that it strives to be meaningful rather than just mindless predictable fluff. Though the movie employs its share of clichs precocious kid guy falls for the one girl who initially rejected his advances etc.  it's often done with a knowing wink most obviously when after an altercation with Emily his ex and rain begins to pour down on him Carell's despondent Cal mutters What a clich. It shows that love is messy irrational sweet and universal filled with regrets and tears as well as hope and joy. It celebrates movies like Say Anything or Jerry Maguire where sentimental wasn't a bad word and love meant more than sex diamond earrings and expensive candlelit dinners where those small precious moments of quiet intimacy  a shared look a simple but honest conversation a laugh a smile buying a mint chocolate chip ice cream cone a spontaneous phone call  speak as loudly as the grandest most dramatic craziest gestures.In short Crazy Stupid Love does what the best romantic comedies do it gives us a glimpse into the raw human moments that collectively build to bring two people together  or at times tear them apart we fall in love with them just as they fall in  or out of  love with each other. It's the perfect date movie and so much more. To all the other ones the mediocre cornball lazy offensive romcoms and chickflicks out there Ryan Gosling has a message for you be better than The Gap. Be better than The Gap.".

Most of all their restrained approach allows the actors to breathe and to fully embody the characters they've been given.Speaking of which has there ever been a more likable group of people assembled for a film much less a romantic comedy? The cast gels remarkably well and at no point is anyone singled out as a villain even when a character threatens to become unlikable the actor portrays him or her with such keen understanding that it ultimately becomes hard if not impossible to not root for each and every one of them. Whenever the film tiptoes the line toward schmaltzy they pull it back making every line and emotion feel utterly real. As the unquestionable lead of the film Steve Carell displays a tenderness and dramatic depth he'd only hinted at in previous works like the unexpectedly moving The 40YearOld Virgin and occasional episodes of The Office while Ryan Gosling all immaculate grooming sly grins and twinkling eyes is perfectly cast as his foil Jacob a suave ladies' man who's really using all that money and swagger to disguise the emptiness he feels inside. Julianne Moore and Emma Stone are both lovely as Emily and Hannah respectively radiating a downtoearth presence and relatability that many other Hollywood actresses seem to lack. Also worth noting are Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo who form Crazy Stupid Love's youngest romantic pairing and have been all but ignored by the movie's publicity campaigns despite their obvious talents.What truly sets Crazy Stupid Love apart from other modernday romantic comedies aside from the perceptive writing and direction and a dream cast is that it strives to be meaningful rather than just mindless predictable fluff. Though the movie employs its share of clichs precocious kid guy falls for the one girl who initially rejected his advances etc.  it's often done with a knowing wink most obviously when after an altercation with Emily his ex and rain begins to pour down on him Carell's despondent Cal mutters What a clich. It shows that love is messy irrational sweet and universal filled with regrets and tears as well as hope and joy. It celebrates movies like Say Anything or Jerry Maguire where sentimental wasn't a bad word and love meant more than sex diamond earrings and expensive candlelit dinners where those small precious moments of quiet intimacy  a shared look a simple but honest conversation a laugh a smile buying a mint chocolate chip ice cream cone a spontaneous phone call  speak as loudly as the grandest most dramatic craziest gestures.In short Crazy Stupid Love does what the best romantic comedies do it gives us a glimpse into the raw human moments that collectively build to bring two people together  or at times tear them apart we fall in love with them just as they fall in  or out of  love with each other. It's the perfect date movie and so much more. To all the other ones the mediocre cornball lazy offensive romcoms and chickflicks out there Ryan Gosling has a message for you be better than The Gap. Be better than The Gap.";

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. From the opening scene it is clear we aren't in for a typically lame romcom with caricatures instead of characters and punchlines instead of feelings. Instead this one is all about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain anger hope and frustration. Now don't misunderstand. It doesn't go too deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.Cal Steve Carell and Emily Julianne Moore are sharing one of their many restaurant moments over the course of their long steady marriage. Only this time something spoils the comfort zone. Emily says she wants a divorce and later tells Cal that she had an affair with a coworker Kevin Bacon. What follows is as close to real life reactions as we could ever hope for in a romcom. Cal is hurt. The kids are angry. Emily is confused. Their friends take sides.The intertwining story lines and characters are both sad and funny. We see how people react when they are attracted to others ... or not. We see how people react when they wonder if their decision was rash. We see how basically nice people try to do the right thing for themselves and others but still mess it up sometimes.After moving out Cal heads to a local upscale lounge that seems to be stocked with gorgeous women and only a handful of men ... every night. In real life the line of men waiting to enter would be wrapped around the block. Still one of the regulars is Jacob played by Ryan Gosling. He is a thing of beauty to look at it and always quick with just the right line. His science is making women believe he cares about nothing but them. Cal is discouraged by Jacob's incredible success rate. Jacob notices Cal's negative vibe and agrees to train him. But first the makeover ... wardrobe haircut and conversation skills.The polar opposite effect of what you might expect from Hollywood  these nice people begin to question their direction. Cal longs for Emily. Emily still thinks about Cal but dates her coworker. The son Jonah Bobo has a crush on the older babysitter who has a crush of her own. Even Jacob falls hard for new attorney Hannah Emma Stone who has just walked out on her wet rag boyfriend Josh Groban who offered her a job rather than a ring. Oh what a tangled web we weave. And that's just the stuff I can tell you! Cal's first conquest utilizing his newly learned skills is a teacher played with full energy by the terrific Marisa Tomei. She only has a couple of scenes but as usual Ms. Tomei makes the most of her screen time. The baby sitter is played well by Analeigh Tipton but it's interesting to note in real life she is 3 days younger than law school grad Hannah Stone.All of the actors are top notch here. Steve Carell continues to get better ... this is a superior movie to Date Night with Tina Fey. Julianne Moore is solid though her character is mostly mopey. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both outstanding. Gosling is none for mostly offbeat dark independent films but shows again how easily he slides back into sex symbol. Ms. Stone is headed for superstardom. She was really good in Easy A and has a starmaking turn in the upcoming film The Help. After that it's on to the new SpiderMan for her.Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are the codirectors and were responsible for the much less mainstream I Love You Phillip Morris with Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor. Surprisingly the film was written by Dan Fogelman who is known for his script writing on the animated Cars movies.No question women will enjoy the film but the surprise is many men will relate to what's going on with the Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling characters. There is enough humor to keep everyone happy and enough strong writing to say this is a very good movie.".

	schema:headline " Crazy Stupid Love";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start off my review of this film by saying that I hate Steve Carrell. Watching him on The Office for all those years was painful because his character and it seemed his acting style was unbelievably stupid and bland. While he has occasionally been a decent funnyman I hadn't seen him in a role where he was remotely interesting and believable.Yesterday I was at the movies pretty much the whole day and decided to check out Crazy Stupid Love because it had decent critical and audience reactions better than I expected for a romantic comedy and it had some of my favorite people in it including Julianne Moore Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. And to say the least I was caught by surprise.One of the reasons for this is because Crazy Stupid Love works as a romantic comedy and a drama. Most romantic comedies I find are predictable stale and essentially one carbon copy after another of the same exact story played out in a slightly altered way. You probably won't guess where Crazy Stupid Love is going. While the ending itself is a lot like I predicted it there's a big plot twist that presents itself in the climax that I really didn't see coming. And that's reason enough to see this movie.However there are many better reasons. One of the big reasons is that it avoids making any of its characters caricatures. Each character is real and flawed screwed up and deals with his or her problems in a very grounded and grownup way. It revolves around Cal Carell a man who has been married to Emily Moore for 25 years and is rocked by the revelation that she wants a divorce after sleeping with a coworker Kevin Bacon. Cal begins hanging out at a chic pickup bar where he meets Jacob Ryan Gosling a lothario who takes a different woman home every night. He picks up on Cal's depression and helps him turn into something of a womanizer. Meanwhile Cal's floppyhaired thirteenyearold son Robbie has a crush on his older babysitter who has a little crush of her own. Also Jacob meets Hannah Emma Stone a young lawyer who has heard every pickup line and therefore has a quite jaded outlook on love.And it is the first film or TV show to portray Steve Carrell as a human being. He can act! Who knew? I actually liked him in this role because I felt that he wasn't Michael Scott or that guy from Get Smart or The 40YearOld Virgin but an average guy whose life didn't turn out as he had hoped. I bought him in this role. He more than keeps up with the rest of the film's stellar cast.Another revelation here is Ryan Gosling. I've mostly seen him in depressing dramatic roles Blue Valentine The Notebook while here he proves himself to be a cunning comedian. He has spectacular comedic timing and clearly has a lot of fun here with the other actors. He seems to be the superficial funnyman at first and like the rest of the cast in this terrific film opens up and surprises the audience.While Julianne Moore is always great her character and Carrell's character mesh in a way that makes you believe that their marriage lasted 20 years. Emma Stone is on fire right now doing a great role in The Help she shines just as much here if not more. Her character is instantly lovable and I can't wait to see what she does next. This film also features Marisa Tomei who gives a fierce and very funny performance as a recovering alcoholic schoolteacher who dates Cal for awhile after his divorce. Kevin Bacon also made me laugh as Emily's co worker who was her postdivorce rebound. While these two have brief roles they are very funny and make the most of what they are given.What makes this film memorable for me is that it is realistic. It doesn't paint love out to be this magical thing that will automatically make anyone happy. It knows that love doesn't always work out and occasionally ends in heartbreak andor violence. And while it's somewhat a cautionary tale it ends hopefully and overall kind of happily. It made me cry a little and it made me laugh a lot. And while it could have been a bit longer and given its characters some more room to grow it was a satisfying overall package that I would recommend to someone who's trying to escape the summer of superhero flicks and sequels.".

Brief summary When Emily Weaver Julianne Moore announces to her husband Cal Steve Carell that she wants a divorce his world collapses around him. She had slept with another man David Lindhagen Kevin Bacon and Cal finds that hard to take since they had been together since high school. He takes to going to bars to drown his sorrows and is taken under the wing of Jacob Palmer Ryan Gosling who shows him how to dress behave and most importantly how to pick up women. At this he is quite successful eventually but he feels there is still something missing. Meanwhile there are a couple of other subplots going on. One involves Cal's son Robbie Jonah Bobo who has become infatuated with his babysitter Jessica Analeigh Tipton. She meanwhile is holding a torch for Cal With me so far?... Also there is law student Hannah Emma Stone who Jacob had been unsuccessful in picking up when we first meet him I can't really say any more about her without giving too much away so here I'll stop. All these threads eventually tie together in what at times appears like a French farce but which does ultimately have a very valid point.All the performances were very good with Steve Carell Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore taking centre stage. I thought Kevin Bacon was slightly underused and more could have been made of Emma Stone's character. Over all it's pretty well made but the narrative does tend to wander in places. An endearing film that does have quite a strong message about love and about soul mates. I freely admit this old romantic found it quite relatable.SteelMonster's verdict RECOMMENDEDMy score 7.510You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog Thoughts of a SteelMonster.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film reminded me a lot of Little Miss Sunshine a dysfunctional family comedy I also hated. Things that are actually way creepy andor disturbing are played for laughs for examplea 13yearold boy stalking and harrasing his 17yearold babysitter. He is relentless tells her upfront that he masturbates while thinking about her embarrasses her with public declarations texts her nonstop cycles to her house in the middle of the night to leave a bundle of flowers at her door long after she's begged him to stop... If he's old enough to feel an attraction for someone then he's old enough to understand the concept of backing off when it is made clear that the attraction is not mutual not just that the girl tells him repeatedly that he makes her feel uncomfortable ignoring someone's feelings is a trademark mainly of guys who veer on or actually are abusivea 17yearold girl obsessing over a 44yearold dad Carrell to the extent that she overtly disrespects his wife Moore who employs her as a babysitter. Her obsession reaches new lows when she snaps naked pictures of herself with the intent of seducing Carrell. There was no logic to why this character would cheapen herself so absurdly just to win the affections of a nice but by no means charming or exceptional family man. Not to mention if she hates Moore for breaking up the marriage why is she so keen to further sabotage it by throwing herself at Carrell?a 44yearold dad controlling his 27yearold daughter's love life to the point that he disowns her for having a boyfriend whose past sexual behaviour he disapproves of even though he himself has recently indulged in that exact type of behaviour. What is it with male characters in films being so patronising and protective of female characters? Are women in audience meant to find this manly and flattering? Is this the 1950s where sexual hypocrisy reigns supreme? So it seems in the film.a 40something woman Tomei who goes to bars on her own to get laid is totally upset when a random dude she goes home with Carrell doesn't ever call her. Really? Are we meant to believe the sex was that good? Why must the film depict an older woman seeking sex with a stranger be so pathetically? Oh I know because only a pathetic woman would still be single at that age and go to bars seeking nostringsattached sex. Again are we stuck in Pleasantville or what?Other oldfashioned clichs forced upon the viewer include having an indiscriminate playboy Gosling fall for a nearvirginal girl Stone whose purity of heart and earnest innocence no doubt compel him to abandon his reckless emotionally stunted promiscuous ways. To add insult to injury the nearvirginal girl initially fawns over a douchebag in a suit i.e. the financially secure but boring guy and is heartbroken when he doesn't propose girls just always want a ring on their finger don't ya know.Amidst these pathetic story lines compounded by some really pathetic dialogue the only saving grace were a few welltimed and refreshingly funny jokes plus Gosling's barelyconcealed smirk for having carte blanche to do absolutely no real acting whatsoever. He merely prances around in flashy suits and flaunts his pecs.My final quip for a film about sexual conquests and awakenings where was the chemistry between any of the characters the steamy innuendos the sensual vibes or the actual sex? I would've killed for random scenes between Gosling and any of the two dozen women he picks up throughout the film or between him and Stone's quirky friend also the token ethnic minority who conveniently disappears the minute Stone and Gosling sink into a trite state of happilyeverafterness.Or how about a scene with Moore and Bacon who were far cuter together than Moore and Carrell? There's just not even anything in this film that could be considered a payoff. In this sense it really reminded me of that most disingenuous of romcoms that also has love in the title but completely denigrates the concept yes the perplexingly muchloved turd Love Actually. Well Crazy Stupid Love has joined the ranks congrats!".

The confident all around cool guy is the role you would almost expect him to get type casted into but this is the first time I've seen him play that type of character. Coming from a hedro he's one sexy bitch!!! Emma stone plays her same character which I totally dig... and why not no ones better with the sarcasm then she is. Marisa Tomei is classic in this movie. Hilarious!! For me it's the best role I've ever seen her in. They must have been dying on the set when she was busting her stuff out. The movie is well written the story line is nothing new but never done this well. It's basically just a love triangle that comes to a head. The message that the movie leaves us with is kind of lame and borderline stalker. Anyways This is a great movie in any setting. Highly recommended!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "There had been a lot of good words about this comedy called Crazy Stupid Love. Although I am not really a guy who would go and watch a romantic comedy I watched this one for Steve Carrell whom I believe is one of the funniest guys in Hollywood now. This movie starts with Emily Julianne Moore telling her husband of 25 years Cal Steve Carrell that she wants a divorce while they were dining in a restaurant. OK so now I know that I have a black comedy ahead of me. The movie follows Cal who was helped by playboy Jacob Ryan Gosling to get him ready to meet other women. One of the women he hooks up with is Kate the hilarious Marisa Tomei. Emily on the other hand takes up with David the ever smarmy Kevin Bacon. Side stories include Jacob hooking up with young lawyer Hannah Emma Stone who in turn was hoping her colleague Josh Groban would propose to her. Meanwhile Cal and Emily's 13year old son Robbie is sure that his 17year old babysitter Jessica America's Next Top Model finalist Analeigh Tipton is his soul mate. But she is in love with a much older married man. Such is the complicated web that this movie weaves.Steve Carrell again does very well with this sadsack character that he seems to know so well. His deadpan delivery in some pretty funny situations that Cal gets himself into was spot on. The character of Ryan Gosling though I find preposterous. I agree with Cal's belated realization that this guy is one big creep. The women basically play straight men to the male characters with Marisa Tomei shining in the laughs department despite her short role.While I liked the surprises in the climax and the touching scene at Robbie's graduation the rest of the film did not really appeal to me too much. Yes there were funny parts but a lot fall flat for me. I must say that for conservatives there can be a lot of uncomfortable situations that may be hard to watch in this film. I know women may disagree with me about Ryan Gosling's part though.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this upon reading the cast members...Marisa Tomei Julianne Moore Kevin Bacon wow. But what a waste of talent for these people and a waste of time for me as well. The story felt very sloppy and the characters were bland as a result. Steve Carell's role reminded me of his role in 40yrold virgin nerdy middleage guy with little sexual experience. Sure he managed to be funny at parts but talk about typecast! Ryan Gosling's role meant to be a muscular dandy but came off as borderline homosexual. His upper body seemed to occupy an unhealthy amount of screen time. And one scene they put Steve Carell's face right on Ryan Gosling's groin areawhat the hell was that all about? Oh and the whole thing about the 17yrold babysitter taking naked photos of herself for CalSteve Carellwhat?? How's that funny? It's rather disturbing! Julianne Moore's performance was kind of generic and I couldn't take one more shot of her teary blank stare. And I also thought their kid Jonah Bobo was horrid! His character was the most painful to watch following by Emma Stone. My! What a terrible actress. The total lack of depth of the film was astounding. Please can someone tell me what's the point of the story? I mean really. I think it was made for people that are grown up on the outside but still 8yrolds on the inside. For the real grownups it might leave a bad taste in your mouth so be warned.".

	schema:headline " Crazy Stupid Love a simple story ruined";
	schema:reviewBody "I've come to the conclusion that Hollywood is incapable of producing a fully engrossing delightfully simple romantic comedy. Crazy Stupid Love makes the unfortunate mistake of presenting three touchingly believable stories along with three completely superfluous wacky bad sitcom ones.Steve Carrell plays Cal the emasculated depressed husband of his restlessly bored wife Emily played by the amazing Julianne Moore Emily who admits she has been cheating on Cal within the first few minutes of the movie and the couple spend the next 118 minutes trying to get back together. There are several genuinely charming unaffected moments that allow us to see the chemistry Cal  Emily once had as a happily married couple.Ryan Gosling tries his superb chameleonlike acting chops out on romantic comedy deeply involved in two of the three believable relationship with convincing ease. With a chiseled body perfectly coiffed hair milliondollar wardrobe and extraordinary good looks Gosling Jake falls easily into the role of a disarmingly handsome irresistibly charming cad. His confident playfulness reassures us that Jake is no mere shallow misogynist he's simply a guy doing what he apparently does best.               With a great deal of the action set in a chic cosmopolitan glassandchrome bar Gosling as the king of this castle has yet to meet the woman who can say no to Jake's ultrasmooth closing line of Wanna get outta here? Witnessing Cal's self pitying ineptitude Jake decides to take him under his wing. Surrendering his credit card Cal puts himself in Jake's hands for a confidencebuilding makeover. Gosling and Carrell's ensuing friendship is genuinely endearing as Cal progresses as Jake's protg.       The unthinkable happens when Jake becomes instantly smitten by the one woman who refuses his offer for casual sex. But to Jake's surprise and delight the same woman Hannah played by the incandescent Emma Stone returns several days later plants a big drunken kiss on Jake and insists that he take her home.In one of the movie's most charming scenes Hannah giggles her way throughJake's mask of perfection followed by both of them laughing at his admittedly canned and rehearsed seduction lines with Jake finally admitting What can I say? They work. Hannah and Jake don't have sex their first night together allowing Jake the opportunity to begin to open up about himself for the first time marking the beginning of their light and breezy everdeepening courtship.                   The problem with Crazy Stupid Love is that the writer Dan Fogelman and director Glenn Ficara didn't feel that these three stories in the hands of these four exceptional actors were sufficient to hold our attention. For some inexplicable reason they felt the need to throw in Maris Tomei as the sexstarved schoolmarm Kate with whom Cal has his first successful onenight stand. She of course becomes the onenight stand from hell and OMG! turns out to be Cal's son's English teacher. In a disturbingly poorly written and poorly acted role Ms.Tomei is so needlessly over thetop as Cal's sexpartner turned woman scorned that she threatens to single handedly destroys the credibility of the entire movie. Not quite finished Mr. Fogelman and Mr. Ficarra felt the need to introduce John Carroll Lynch as the Cal  Emily's wacky neighbor who appears for the sole purpose of engaging Cal in a cringeworthy backyard brawl. The fight is so absurdly contrived because the audience is well aware that Cal is the innocent victim rather than the perpetrator of his neighbor's wrath. But worst of all it wasn't funny.                            And as the coup de gras they felt the need to throw Kevin Bacon into the mix as Emily's new boyfriend David Lindhagen. His presence is so insignificant that Ficarra and Fogelman must have been under laboring under the misconception that Mr. Bacon needed to add Carrell Moore Gosling and Stone to his famous six degrees.             The simple advice I would give to the movie makers of Crazy Stupid Love is less is more. What could have been a delightful romcom ends up as a convoluted mess. By editing out these pointless clichridden characters the four principals might have given us the streamlined surprise hit of the summer rather than yet another tepid halfbaked attempt at romantic comedy. Please refer to Larry Crowne Friends With Benefits and No Strings Attached.".

Bad script bad acting bad closeups but most of all  bad directing.Staring off with the most annoying actress to ever by on screen  ANALEIGH Tipton. Oh please you can barely look at her she is so awful. Every shot of her and everyone else is so tight it makes you uncomfortable. There is so much wrong with this film I really don't know where to start so I'll just say the big twist is just plain stupid  who cares? It doesn't add anything to the story. The child porn thing is just creepy. The main story element of the failing marriage is never really fleshed out. The other main story point  of Steve Carrell's character becoming a horn dog  is odd and offputting. The whole movie is just plain weird. That's as best as I can sum it up. The casting is especially odd. Marissa Tomei and Kevin bacon are thrown in for  oh I don't know. The 13year old son is bad. The little girl has no lines at all. Julianna Moore is just not good here  comes off as a harpy. The only saving grace is  Emma Stone. She is kind of radiant if that makes any sense. But the story line she has really doesn't make sense because Ryan Gosling also plays a horn dog with no sense of goodness who only goes after really hot chicks so no  he would NOT seek her out from a crowded bar.Not worth your money. Skip this one.".

The idea is that a woman Julian Moore has sex with a coworker Kevin Bacon. Then on their way home after dinner she tells her loving husband of 25 years Steve Carrella dinner where he thinks everything went great by the waythat she screwed her coworker and she wants a divorce. Let's just review this the guy after 25 years still loves his wife and still takes her out to dinner along with the fact that he's a loving husband hard worker and all the trimmingsand she screws around behind his back and SHE wants a divorce. Let's go one more step the guy is lost after that he just literally jumps out of the car and is so sick to his stomach because let's face it mister perfect man loved his wife and loved his life and he finds out within seconds that his wife is screwing another man and wants a divorce. Fast forward a bit. Now he's drinking a lot he's lonely he has to go out and live in an apartment of course she gets the house and all that and then after meeting the town hunk Ryan Gossling he is mentored into the ways of the world and women. So after some months go by he finally starts to have sex with other womendid I mention that he never had sex with another woman other than his wife before she kicked him out and he'd had no desire to cheat? And this is the killerafter he has sex with other women his soontobe exwife flips out! Did I miss something here? She screwed someone else she's divorcing him but she flips out when he seeks out other female companionship. Wait it gets better! All along he's still trying to do the right thing. He waters the lawn at his separated wife's house he continues to be a good dad and he continues under the influence of his son to attempt to get his wife back. This is the message I get a spouse cheats wants a divorce and then the other spousewho never did anything wronghas to do all the work to try to fix things. That doesn't sit right with me. Maybe in some twisted fantasy a woman or man wants to think they can cheat demand a divorce and have their mate pursue them endlessly but that's not reality...nor does it make for good entertainment.".

Because you see as long as YOU are convinced that the target is your soulmate it can't be considered stalking.Hello Mr. Screenwriter! Have we forgotten that John Hinckley was fully convinced that Jodie Foster was his soulmate? We know how that turned out correct? Ah well I guess we don't. So keep on pursuing your romantic thesis and thanks for the details on 13yearold boys masturbating and 17yearold girls taking nude pictures of themselves. You are keeping it real and contemporary! By the way the answer to the burning question What kind of dad hangs out at the same singles bars as his offspring? is CreepyasHell Dad! Apart from pointing out the descent into the moral pit that this movie represents I must also ruefully report that there is nothing of any aesthetic interest or pleasure here. No sprightliness no style no charm not even such as might show up in the service of an entirely misguided plot. Not a single shot worth looking at not a single line worth listening to. The characters are utterly boring contourless screenwriter creations  no interests no hobbies no thoughts worth sharing nada. No actors no matter how good could do anything with this material.Steve Carell certainly cannot convince us that he could suddenly become a swingin' SoCal ladies' man effortlessly picking up women half his age  and again given the third act revelation here it's a big yuck that he would want to.Have fun.".

More often then not the facts have been 'adjusted' to make a more enjoyable filmregardless if it strays pretty far from the truth. So as I watched Young Tom Edison I naturally assumed it was once again a very highly fictionalized account. This seemed even more obvious when Tom jumps onto the train tracks to save a little boy's life. However imagine my surprise when I did some reading and found this film was actually pretty close to the truth! Sure they took a few liberties here and there but for the most part it was real. Sometimes the truth really is stranger than fiction!

	schema:headline " Edison The Early Years";
	schema:reviewBody "YOUNG TOM EDISON MetroGoldwynMayer 1940 directed by Norman Taurog is an factbased screen retelling of the boyhood years of one of the true greats in American history Thomas Edison. As suggested by its opening passage This is a story of courage the courage and triumph of a typical American boy. In all its essential facts it is a true story. The boy actually did experience the adventures  the joys and sorrows portrayed here. His name might have been John Jones or Bill Smith. It happens to be Thomas Alva Edison. Rather than relying on sources covering Edison's entire life from birth in Milan Ohio 1847 to death 1931 the screenplay consisting of material by Harlan Dowry which often plays like segments listed from Mark Twain's beloved character Tom Sawyer the story as scripted deals mostly with Tom Edison of Port Huron Michigan a boy genius and the early life as he lived it.While the screenplay does toy a bit about the facts overlooking the Edisons having seven children with Tom being the youngest the narrative introduces Samuel Edison George Bancroft a hardworking husband Nancy Fay Bainter his wife and former schoolteacher in Canada Bill John Kellogg his elder son whose character is least interesting and under developed Tannie Virginia Weidler the youngest daughter while young Tom Edison Mickey Rooney is portrayed as the middle child While Tom is portrayed as a misunderstood 16yearold who's irresponsible and accident prone it's his love for science that actually stands in the way him having a normal childhood. Tom may be different from the other children but is very special in the eyes of both his mother and sister. Then there's Mr. Edison who not only constantly tells Tom Take your hands out of your pockets but fails to find time and patience to accept him for what he is. Classified as slow and stupid by his spinster schoolteacher Eily Malyon Tom's also the laughing stock by most especially his classmates namely Joe Dingle Bobby Jordan a school bully and son of a local hardware store owner Victor Kilian. Portions of the story depict Tom's heroism by saving the life of a station master's J.M. Kerrigan little boy Richard Nichols from an oncoming train Tom earning a living by selling candy and newspapers on a train under Mr. Nelson Eugene Palette the conductor Tom having to carefully dispose of nitroglycerin on a train full of people and his expert knowledge sending messages through Morse Code. Because of situations beyond his control Tom loses both job and respect from those around him causing him to believe those accusations made against him.As much as these episodic situations take place during the course of a few years it gives every indication of it set during the course of a few weeks. Whether the screenplay is true or not whether Rooney physically resembles Tom Edison or not really doesn't matter much for that YOUNG TOM EDISON is a great film. Once seen its hard to forget these standout scenes the development of Tom's inventive mind brought forth by some clever devises tender moments of family togetherness as the Edison's gather around the piano singing to the much underscored Sweet Genevieve Tom finger rolling his right eyebrow while coming up with a positive solution Mrs. Edison's motherly advice to her son as any mother could Tom's despair while walking aimlessly through the rain as he hears in his mind voices of laughter and ridicule following his pleading with local business owners to give him a job plus the climactic race against time segment as Tom makes every effort to save an oncoming train from danger through some ingenious plan.

	onyx:emotionText "YOUNG TOM EDISON MetroGoldwynMayer 1940 directed by Norman Taurog is an factbased screen retelling of the boyhood years of one of the true greats in American history Thomas Edison. As suggested by its opening passage This is a story of courage the courage and triumph of a typical American boy. In all its essential facts it is a true story. The boy actually did experience the adventures  the joys and sorrows portrayed here. His name might have been John Jones or Bill Smith. It happens to be Thomas Alva Edison. Rather than relying on sources covering Edison's entire life from birth in Milan Ohio 1847 to death 1931 the screenplay consisting of material by Harlan Dowry which often plays like segments listed from Mark Twain's beloved character Tom Sawyer the story as scripted deals mostly with Tom Edison of Port Huron Michigan a boy genius and the early life as he lived it.While the screenplay does toy a bit about the facts overlooking the Edisons having seven children with Tom being the youngest the narrative introduces Samuel Edison George Bancroft a hardworking husband Nancy Fay Bainter his wife and former schoolteacher in Canada Bill John Kellogg his elder son whose character is least interesting and under developed Tannie Virginia Weidler the youngest daughter while young Tom Edison Mickey Rooney is portrayed as the middle child While Tom is portrayed as a misunderstood 16yearold who's irresponsible and accident prone it's his love for science that actually stands in the way him having a normal childhood. Tom may be different from the other children but is very special in the eyes of both his mother and sister. Then there's Mr. Edison who not only constantly tells Tom Take your hands out of your pockets but fails to find time and patience to accept him for what he is. Classified as slow and stupid by his spinster schoolteacher Eily Malyon Tom's also the laughing stock by most especially his classmates namely Joe Dingle Bobby Jordan a school bully and son of a local hardware store owner Victor Kilian. Portions of the story depict Tom's heroism by saving the life of a station master's J.M. Kerrigan little boy Richard Nichols from an oncoming train Tom earning a living by selling candy and newspapers on a train under Mr. Nelson Eugene Palette the conductor Tom having to carefully dispose of nitroglycerin on a train full of people and his expert knowledge sending messages through Morse Code. Because of situations beyond his control Tom loses both job and respect from those around him causing him to believe those accusations made against him.As much as these episodic situations take place during the course of a few years it gives every indication of it set during the course of a few weeks. Whether the screenplay is true or not whether Rooney physically resembles Tom Edison or not really doesn't matter much for that YOUNG TOM EDISON is a great film. Once seen its hard to forget these standout scenes the development of Tom's inventive mind brought forth by some clever devises tender moments of family togetherness as the Edison's gather around the piano singing to the much underscored Sweet Genevieve Tom finger rolling his right eyebrow while coming up with a positive solution Mrs. Edison's motherly advice to her son as any mother could Tom's despair while walking aimlessly through the rain as he hears in his mind voices of laughter and ridicule following his pleading with local business owners to give him a job plus the climactic race against time segment as Tom makes every effort to save an oncoming train from danger through some ingenious plan. Aside from Rooney's excellent portrayal Fay Bainter stands out most as the understanding mother while Virginia Weidler gives an unforgettable performance playing Tom's younger sister who repeatedly tells him with amazement Gosh you're smart. George Bancroft with mustache and sideburns should not go without mention playing the stern father. Humor sentiment and moral lessons in the tradition of Tom Sawyer are thrown in on few occasions the best being where Tom Edison tricks his way from taking his overshoes and muffler on to his next ventures.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a biopic about the young years of famous inventor and moviemaking pioneer Thomas Alva Edison but above all this movie is an entertaining one to watch.The movie could had also be easily named The Adventures of Young Tom Edison since the movie itself is quite adventurous with young Tom Edison embarking on some adventurous dealings in the normal world and in his own world of inventing and experimenting.It above all is a movie that at all times entertains with also some comical characters in it and some fun typical comedy dealings. Guess its also insightful about the early years of Thomas Edison's life though its hard to tell how much in this movie actually also occurred in real life. Some things are certainly hard to believe and obviously fabricated for the movie to also make it more fun and tense. This is really not a bad things since it definitely improves the movie so much. I'm sure the movie would had been really boring and simplistic if it was done in a completely serious dramatic kind of biopic style. It's entertainment value is mostly what makes this movie such a great watch.It's a typical '40's movie made in typical '40's movie style with typical '40's way of storytelling typical '40's kind of characters typical '40's kind of humor and a typical '40's musical score. Needless to say fans of '40's movie shall probably enjoy the most watching this movie.Mickey Rooney fits the role really well even though he at the time was already much older than the character in the movie was supposed to be. He carries the movie mostly and handles everything in it very well. He especially seems at ease with the comical aspects in the movie. Other childstar Virginia Weidler also plays a good role. The parents of Tom Edison are also portrayed nicely by Fay Bainter and George Bancroft. The movie provides a good view of the home situation which also definitely helps to make the more dramatic and serious aspects of the movie work out.The movie is followed by Edison the Man starring Spencer Tracy in the role of Thomas Edison who also makes a cameo at the end of this movie to prepare and get viewers to the theater for its sequel. An inmovie teaser trailer!A really greatly made and entertaining movie to watch! Very recommendable.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " From Andy and Huck to Young Tom EdisionMickey Rooney shines.";
	schema:reviewBody "As much a fan I am of the MGM musicals I must admit that I enjoy Mickey Rooney more as a dramatic actor in his younger days than I did as a musical star. Playing a variety of characters during the heyday of his youth 19371943 he showed a great versatility although a little bit of him goes a long way. However one of his best is Young Tom Edision the growing up adventures of one of the greatest Americans in history. From the moment you meet Mickey's Tom waking up his younger sister Virginia Weidler with a clever communication invention to his saving of a train in danger all thanks to the signals he makes from another train's whistle to get his sister's attention Rooney is outstanding. Ms. Weidler isn't bad either and almost steals the show. There's a very amusing sequence in school where Mickey is punished by his spinster teacher Eily Maylon and ends up almost setting the school on fire. This leads to an exchange between Maylon and Ma Edison Fay Bainter that equals the exchange between Auntie Em and Miss Gulch in The Wizard of Oz.Bainter and George Bancroft are outstanding as the parents and a spanking scene between Bainter and Rooney will definitely provide some laughs. 50 years later the scene would be reused to great adult comic affect in Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion. Great character players like Eugene Palette Victor Kilian now the father of Rooney's rival after being his dead beat dad in Huckleberry Finn and Clem Bevans. Every aspect of this film seems just right and rightly sets the ending up for a sequel featuring Spencer Tracy.".

He did save a boy from being killed but that happened halfway to Detroit and his reward was Morse code lessons not a coil of wire. He never mentioned that he helped save his mother's life by using a mirror and may kerosene lamps. Given his love and admiration for his mother that he did write about it seems odd he never discussed this. A very fun movie but enjoy it knowing many of the scenes are pure Hollywood fiction.

I have always considered myself fortunate that I lived during an era when you could watch a movie about Don Ameche playing Alexander Graham Bell. I remember him inventing the telephone while subsisting off apples and cheese. I also fondly recall this gem of an adventure. Nowadays kids look up to Rap and Hip Hop stars and pine to matriculate into the NBA. Justifiable ambitions to be sure but man that young Tom Edison. He could make anything work better! This is actually the first time I don't want to say too much about the film as I really don't want to spoil it for you. This is a great genre for young people that has never been fully exploited. The drama of the young inventor.Earlier you read my review about ZORBA THE Greek and his inspiration or epiphany if you will about building a contraption that would transport logs safely out of a forest and down a steep hill into an awaiting bin. Now it didn't work and we left our hero and his ward dancing Greek in the ruins of their failure. Well here is an example where truth is stranger than fiction and comes out to a lot happier result for all concerned. You could easily imagine what Tom Edison would have said were he standing in the wake of such a disaster. I haven't failed I've simply found a thousand and one ways this won't work. Just another example of the spirit of American ingenuity and enterprise at work folks.Mickey Rooney is great in this role. I could not imagine anyone besides Michael J. Fox bringing that kind of energy and enthusiasm to this acting assignment. This film has everything a young boy always getting into something with his new ideas and developing a reputation around town as the 'addlepated' or 'addlebrained' son of Thomas and Nancy Edison. Who knows but today he might be diagnosed as having asperger syndrome and put on medication. But one thing is for certain he has a genius for understanding mechanical advantage and sure can work wonders with mirrors and lights when the chips are down and you need to improvise an operating room on the spot.It is sheer fun watching Rooney as young Edison operating his own press and putting out a newspaper and hawking a cureall with the rest of his wares that happens to have more kick than expected. It is thrilling and inspiring to see him reading and collecting a library chronicling the present state of scientific discovery in his time as he studies the work of such luminaries as Michael Faraday James Clerk Maxwell Isaac Newton and others. We see this young boy preparing for his future as a great inventor and to be the man he has yet to become.The ending of this film is a cliffhanger straight out of a silent movie. We see the young Tom adroitly apply a body of knowledge that saves lives instead of imperiling them and before we know it he is on his way into the future as the lights fade to black.Already I have said too much but take my word for it this is a film that gives you a warm feeling about troubled youth family and the positive force that learning and ideas can have on the world.".

	schema:reviewBody "This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun La Monja. Seriously I think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles even though the story's about the character as described in the title. Who knows soon we'll have spinoffs like The Monk The Priest and others belonging to various religious sects.The basic premise goes very simply that a ghoul dressed up in a Nun garb so that it can lay claim to the title goes around killing exconvent girls. There seemed to be some sort of conspiracy involved as the daughter of one of the victims Eva played by an eye candy Icelandic Anita Briem goes on to discover with the help of a few good friends like a rip off of I Know What You Did Last Summer mentioned also by the way.So as the body count increases it's a race against time for our emotionally scarred aren't they always? heroine to uncover the truth and save the day. Delving into the sins of the mothers the movie did the unthinkable that with a dream sequence as the introduction. I hate dream sequences as it's a pretty cheap technique if not done correctly and there are a couple of them in the movie.In part the movie played at times like JuOn gone wrong with the plenty of Dark Water references and they could have retitled this Unholy Water for the circumstances and plot points in the movie. However there are plot holes abound so don't be looking into the storyline too deeply. You'd come to expect the standard textbook twists towards the end about the sadistic nun and sets which look like they can rival recent Thai horror movie Dorm.The acting's pretty forgettable with the cast speaking in perfect heavily accented English. And since most of them are pleasing to the eye the story must weave in a love scene in the middle of a witchhunt. What gives? Hello got hantu still got mood ah? Then again the ghoul is a pretty cheap animatedSFX which has a built in AI of popping up every now and then in various fashion just to elicit screams from timid audiences. The characters also break every unwritten rule in the DoNots in horror lore so you know and expect their just desserts.Can you possibly enjoy this movie? Sure you can. Just ensure that you're watching it in a full house should be easy since local folks are suckers for anything remotely horrific and laugh at those who are so jumpy they scream at every frightening scene. It's pretty fun and adds to the atmosphere besides what's going on the screen. Surround sound doesn't even come close.Think of it as watching an episode of Scooby Doo without the wisecracks and it's a pity that the gory moments in the movie had to be censored for a PG rating. Those could possibly have been the best bits now left rotting on the censor's floor board.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the finest initiatives in the world of horror movies since the beginning of this new millennium must be the collaboration between Brian Yuzna and Julio Fernandez when they founded the Spannish production company Fantastic Factory. With great enthusiasm I've been following the movies they've produced since 2001. They might not be masterpieces but for the moment I've enjoyed every single one of them. Even the socalled bad ones.To my surprise I enjoyed THE NUN much more than I thought I would. It really does rise above the level of ordinary supernatural teenslasher movies. Actually calling this a teenslasher movie would rather be an insult. Because in THE NUN the teenagers are doing the investigating and it are in fact adult women who find their gory death. 17 years ago a group of young girls in a sinister Catholic school were being tyrannized by a nun called Ursula. After a serious incident which was kept secret from the public for many years the nun disappeared and the school was closed down. Now 17 years later the girls are all adult women and start dying one by one. That's right Ursula is back... in an unholy way.The movie moves at a decent pace and there are quite a lot of things to be discovered. Whether they are plausiblepredictable or not didn't matter to me because it kept me going. And this is still a horror movie by the way so a little suspension of disbelief always makes them work a little better. The cast consists mostly out of unknown Spannish actors  actresses but the acting was pretty good and their English even better. Needless to say that the girls in this flick are nice to look at. The production values were rather excellent for this type of movie. It looked good was pretty stylish and a lot of care went into the setdesign especially the old rundown Catholic school. And what about our Unholy Nun? Well she truly was a scary and terrifying creation. She's able to manifest herself through water and the effects were pretty darn effective using a perfect mixture of CGI and a real actress with creepy makeup. The way she moved in certain scenes was wellchoreographed and sometimes even send a shiver down my spine. And the way she kills is pretty damn gory and the pattern in her killings which is discovered later in the movie is even refreshingly original. And then there are a few other things to be discovered... The ending itself comes rather abrupt and isn't exactly a big climax. But still even though my first feelings were sort of mixed I did like the ending.The only thing I didn't really like were those two little verbal insidejokes about THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. They should have just left those remarks out of the movie. And mind you besides those two witty references THE NUN thankfully has absolutely nothing else to do with those two movies. For one thing the plot has more to offer.I was a bit surprised when I saw the  at the time of writing this  4.210 rating for THE NUN. And on the other hand I sort of expected it. It's easy to bash this movie especially for nonhorror lovers because the plot maybe is a little too ambitious making it seem ridiculous to socalled intellectuals or it has a bunch of unknown Spannish actors so they can't relate to the characters. But I gave it a solid 710 because the filmmakers really made an effort to produce a goodlooking and effective scarybloody movie and at least attempted to tell a decent story with it. Personally I think this Spannish production is better and certainly more enjoyable than a lot of other more recent American theatrical horrorreleases like for example DARKNESS FALLS BOOGEYMAN and THE AMITYVILLE HORROR to name only a few and include a remake.On a final note THE NUN has absolutely nothing to do with the nunsploitationgenre like one other commentator here mentioned even though some remotely familiar aspects of that notorious genre can be found in it. And no it has nothing to do with nudity.".

There is something about the European sensibility that gives this kind of film a moody realism. It was a little odd that everyone had Spanish accents I thought the acting was pretty natural. The special water effects were pure trailer material. However I felt let down by the end of the movie. It seemed rushed. And I'm sure it wasn't. This was also the work of a first time director. I thought he did a great job.That said I have seen far worse films.I'm also dieing to see Yuzna's What Lies Beneath. I enjoyed to book and was sorry to see his film isn't available on DVD.".

	onyx:emotionText "Wow are you guys tough on this film. Granted it was I know What You Did Last Summer with a Nun. But the Nun was pretty scary and the film maintained a disturbingly eerie feel. There is something about the European sensibility that gives this kind of film a moody realism. It was a little odd that everyone had Spanish accents I thought the acting was pretty natural. The special water effects were pure trailer material. However I felt let down by the end of the movie. It seemed rushed. And I'm sure it wasn't. This was also the work of a first time director. I thought he did a great job.That said I have seen far worse films.I'm also dieing to see Yuzna's What Lies Beneath. I enjoyed to book and was sorry to see his film isn't available on DVD.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1988 the abusive and deranged Nun Ursula is the principal of a Catholic boarding school in Barcelona. When she finds that the teenage student Mary is pregnant she decides to purify the girl with water almost killing her. Her class and dorm mates Joanna Christine Eulalia Zoe and Susan fight with the nun and drown her in a bathtub. The six teenagers dump her body in a lake with holy water and make a pact of silence. Eighteen years later the spirit of the nun is released from the lake and possesses the daughter of Mary Eve seeking revenge against the former students and killing each one of them like their saint patrons did to achieve the forgiveness of God through punishment and penitence pain and sacrifice.The Nun is a promising horror movie with a good beginning but with a flawed and confused conclusion. In accordance with the brilliant deduction of the most stupid character of the story Joel Eve was the responsible for the deaths of her mother and her friends through the effects of a psychological trauma in her childhood or possessed by the evil spirit of the nun released when the lake with holy water was drained. However the first friend to die in the story was Joanna who lived in London. Once Eve lived in New Jersey she could not have killed Joanna. Therefore there is no reasonable explanation for the deaths and the end of this flick does not make any sense. My vote is six.Title Brazil Maldio Curse".

	schema:headline " Crappy Nunsploitation flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Review Nunsploitation films. They've been around since forever. A few that pop to mind are the Mexican devil worshiping movie Alucarda Night of the Demons 2 The Convent and of course Dante Tomasellis Desecration. Cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religiousholy image and twisting it around to make it scary. If done right it works. Here comes the most recent addition to the nunsploitation subgenre simply titled The Nun.The story is about this group of girls that live in a Catholic school. In this school there's a Nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls. The girls acting in self defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and tell no one. Fast forward 18 years later and the nun is back searching for revenge from those who killed her.This movie was produced by Brian Yuznas Fantastic Factory. You know the company that makes horror movies in Spain. Need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company churns out? Well heres a small reminder Arachnid Darkness Romasanta The Werewolf Hunt Rottweiler. You get the picture. About the only really good movie that this company has produced in my opinion was Stuart Gordons Dagon. Thats it. Oh no wait I believe they also produced the excellent Christian Bale vehicle The Machinist. But thats it. So when I consciously rented this movie I knew I wasn't going to watch anything that was mind blowingly good. Still with all that mental preparation I was disappointed.One of the only good things this movie has going for it is its slick look. The movie has some nice cinematography. It doesn't look like a cheap horror film. The movies special effects were alright with The Nun being able to travel through water. Well that was an image that lended it self for some cool fx moments that sometimes scratched into cheesy territory but sometimes were cool enough to watch. I dug that scene with the Nun hurling herself at people like a bucket of water. Its not a particularly deadly move but it made for a cool visual. There's some gore here but not a lot of it. One particular scene involving an elevator death was cool but sadly the movie hit its peak with that scene. And it was only half way through. After that nothing really cool happens and the movie deludes into an incredible borefest.The movie just turns into The Nun popping up every now and then to give us a boo scare she would kill someone and then CUT! We get back to the characters talking crap going through rooms opening doors you get the drill. And I just personally hate it when a horror movie turns into that. People opening doors and going into rooms. Boring! And when the characters do talk its terrible dialog. In one particularly stupid scene a character decides right out of the blue that the nun turns into flesh and blood whenever she is in the water so thats they way to go to try and kill her. And everyone just says OK! And they all elaborate this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. Now who gave that guy this info and why did the others just take it for granted? Who the hell knows but its scenes like that that make the movie look stupid.And yet another thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this film was the fact that they used Spanish actors who have a very thick accent. When they try to speak English its very hard to make out what the hell they are trying to say. Id prefer to have them be dubbed then try and figure out what they are saying and become frustrated. The fact that this DVD has no English subtitles didn't help matters either.So in conclusion this is a movie that has some slick visuals nice sound effects but a terrible terrible script. I guess this just goes to show that you might have the biggest budget or the best special effects but if your movie has a bad script with terrible characters and situations that your audience cant connect with then you've still got a bad movie. Such was the case with The NUN.If you want to have some real fun with evil nuns rent any of the films I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now as for the makers of this film they should go say ten hail maries and light fifty candles to their saint of choice to see if they'll be forgiven for making this sinfully terrible film.Rating 2 out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "The major flaw in this Spanish slashershocker is within it's script. For the first half hour it's an okay effort building some suspense and an atmosphere of fear and dread. We even get some nice killings too! Then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole catalog of your basic slasher clichs. I must admit that I was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much more. The final thirty minutes consists of some killings and a lot of running around in an abandoned convent. It should have been so much better although the final scenes in the flooded room is quite okay!First of all we have the dialog. It's awful most of the time there was quite a few giggles in the audience here and there when I saw it and merely adequate elsewhere. It is also barely audible during a lot of scenes drowning under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack however that might not be such a bad thing after all considering the stupid lines we have to listen to!. There is one line in the whole movie that makes a reference to the I know what you did last summermovies indicating that the film makers wrote it all as one big joke but I doubt it.And the ending...well some will hate it others will dig it. For me it was mostly a question of the former because the final twist comes from out of nowhere! If the audience had been given some clues to the girls mental status I might have thought otherwise. It also throws all logic out of the window because the murderer could never had been in place for some of the kills! But as an avid horror fan I have learned to live with these inconsistencies in Spanish and Italian movies.But all is not bad. The movie has a big budget appearance mainly due to the excellent cinematography the scenes from past times really shines here tight editing and an atmospheric soundtrack. Even though most of the actors are pretty bad Anita Briem is an exception making the most of what she has to work with. Real screen presence!And like I mentioned before the killings are gory enough for the fans of such stuff and they are usually accompanied by very good special effects involving images of water but the water theme tends to get tiresome in the end though.So to end this review it's a movie that is quite fun in a sobadit'sgood kind of way and it's also pleasing to the eye. But don't expect too much because it doesn't deliver as you probably think it will judging from trailer and plot descriptions.".

The main premise in this nice little horror flick is obviously not a very realistic one and leaving aside the socalled ridiculousness of the story this is definitely a mustsee to all slasher fans. It seems however that this film was not exactly acclaimed and my wild guess is that the disappointment comes from grindhouse lovers who expected a good'ol nunsplotaition flick and they got a Hollywoodlike Spanish slasher instead. The other possibility is that some of the angry reviewers are the ones who assumed that this film was going to be by some means similar to Darkness which was written and also directed by Jaume Balaguer who was in charge of the story here as well. Considering that Darkness was far more respected when it came out for being among other things so atmospheric and artsy I wouldn't be surprised if some people expected something mildly similar or at least a few connections with this movie. However La Monja was not directed by Mr. Balaguer so I really don't see why there should be any connection whatsoever. So my little advice to anyone who is expecting anything remotely similar to Darkness is to discard this slasher because it will turn out to be a major let down.In La Monja six young ladies in a Catholic boarding school are tormented by a cruel nun called rsula who is also the headmistress of the establishment. One day during a sadistic purification ritual Sister rsula goes a little bit too far with her medieval methods and tries to drown Mary one of the students as a way to purify her sinful soul. However her cruel ritual is interrupted by the other girls who rise up against Sister rsula and kill her. After that they decide to make a pact of silence and throw her body inside a pool of holy water. Eighteen years later Eve Mary's daughter begins to have strange hallucinations about a vicious nun who appears out of nowhere. Several people start to die around her including her own mother and some of her class mates. Right after her mother's mysterious death Eve takes a trip to Spain with her friends only to find out that she's merely doomed to confront a terrible fate and discover an awful truth about herself.The plot clearly promises a nice slasher... and a nice slasher we get!. With a nice variety of well done murders and moderated use of CGI this bizarre horror gem manages to entertain and mock slasher films for their similarities and lack of originality. La Monja is a good exponent of what contemporary slasher films are all about and even though the film is a Spanish production it does a good work emulating some of the finest American films out there. The supernatural villain reinforces the evidence that the director clearly wasn't aiming to a dark or profound film and instead he basically wanted to achieve a highly entertaining and unpretentious horror gem to enjoy with some popcorn and a large soda. If you're in the mood for some genuine and simple fun give this evil nun and chance and she won't disappoint you with her cruel punishments against the sinners who dare to stand in her way.".

The acting wasn't so bad well at least not as bad as some that I have experienced before. The starting was well it put most of us viewers into a lot of thinking on what will happen next. Anticipation is the key to horror flicks and also to a successful one. We didn't really get a lot of jumps in this movie. Some may agree with me on this while some may disagree as there were no kick at all in this movie. The only probable kick in the movie was counteracted by loud music to make it look scary. Few fell for that.The story starts with the introduction to the boarding school and part and parcel of the story slits in between. Often we get confused too with the characters at play. There are just too many and it is hard to differentiate as the cue was not as clear. Sometimes we mistook the daughter and her friends for the 6 girls in the convent. It took us quite some time to clear the confusion and by that time the movie has already taken us aback to another scene. The killing is gory and bloody enough so I'm not going to complain much on that.The only thing that it loses out is the ending part when the major twist of the story was really a surprise which also brings the movie down as it yet again confuses all of us. If in the beginning they were trying to make something clear to us about the main character it must have been rather vague. Unlike the twist in Sixth Sense Two Sisters and Scream sequels this has totally no suspense and meaning. The audio cues were too soft most of the times and I don't think I really get the interconnection between the nun and the girl. Perhaps she is on a mission to seek revenge for her mother's suicide after being compelled not to report to the police about what the group has done in the convent.Oh well I recommend this movie if you just want to have fun for the weekends.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure somewhere in She Hate Me lies a good story that would make for an entertaining movie. What we have however is a convoluted mess that tries too hard to be a social satire. The premise Jack Armstrong Anthony Mackie a hotshot VP at a pharmaceutical company suddenly finds himself unemployed and in need of money. When his exfianceturnedlesbian Fatima Goodrich Kerry Washington offers him 10000 to impregnate her and her lover Alex the sexy Dania Ramirez Jack realizes he could be a sexual cash cow. Next thing he knows he's in high demand from wealthy lesbians who want children. The problem is that Lee doesn't know what he wants his film to be. Or what the story should be. He tackles way too many issues and never tackles any of them very well.The film opens with a novel title sequence that ends with a broadside against President George W. Bush. Fair enough. Lee's bit actually works. The story then turns into some sort of diatribe against corporate greed against the blatant excesses of the Enrons and WorldComs of corporate America. OK. Then there's also all this stuff about lesbians and impregnating them. And Jack's conscience about whether he's doing the right thing.But the film then suddenly turns into a defense of Frank Wills the black security guard who uncovered the Watergate burglary. Lee makes a valid point that while all the players involved in the burglary and subsequent coverup went on to have lucrative careers as statesmen authors speakers and radio personalities Wills died in obscurity. A tribute to Wills is long overdue. The man was a hero. But what the heck's his story doing in this film? And in a moment that seems completely arbitrary Lee also throws in Oliver North into the mix of Watergate figures.For a satire to work it needs to satirize something. Frankly I didn't know what exactly Lee was trying to send up. And after a while I didn't care. His movie's neither a sex comedy nor stinging social commentary. In fact at times She Hates Me plays more like some sort of unbridled male fantasy. Not only are all the lesbians attractive but also they want to get impregnated the oldfashioned way. The one lesbian who chooses artificial insemination fails and so has to plead with Jack to have sex with her.Subtlety has never been Lee's forte. But in films such as Do the Right Thing 1989 and Jungle Fever 1991 he somehow found a good balance between satire and social comment. Here he does no such thing. In She Hate Me Lee's about as subtle as a sledgehammer.What's ultimately disappointing about She Hate Me is the ofteninane writing. When Fatima tells Jack she always was a lesbian even when she was dating him and was merely in denial she adds And I don't mean a river in Egypt. That's how lame the dialogue is. It gets even worse when Lee and cowriter Michael Genet give Brian Dennehy positively laughable dialogue later.The corrupt business practices of Enron and its ties to the Bush administration deserve to be told. As does a satire if you must of white collar crooks who get off relatively easy and wind up having hugely successful lives as a result of their crimes. But this isn't the film that does it.Lee's clever talented and certainly socially conscious but just seems to be tossing in every idea he had into She Hate Me. Instead of being bitingly satirical about society's lopsided values this is a mishmash of a film that is never as funny as it wants to be or as provocative as it should be.".

It is easy to just dismiss him but to do so misses so much of what he does that is good and worth seeing. I certainly cannot defend this film on the grounds of narrative because it is all over the place  Enron sexual ethics the failures of the corporate world and political system to ordinary people all this while still having sex scenes and animated sperm and eggs. If you let it the fragmentation of the narrative will annoy you  it bothered me a little bit and I wished that the film had been shorter with a tighter focus. However it is still interesting and it engaged my brain you can imagine the man gets lesbians pregnant concept being the next cheap and nasty comedy at number one in the box office charts and although he seems to enjoy the sexual humour of the material Lee deserves credit for not forgetting that I and many audiences like to have my brain stimulated before anything else.If the opening credits 3 bill doesn't give you a clue what it is about then the film helps with the corporate world setting. The themes are business money and ethics and the film preaches a lot at points but generally is interesting. There is a lot of slack in the film that should have been removed and for some of it the point was totally lost on me but I was thinking all the time and that is a good thing. Lee's direction is as good as ever and the cinematography is slick. With so much focus on theme instead of story it is no surprise that the actors aren't that great but they do all do enough to keep the film working. Mackie is not a great actor but he is effective enough here and it isn't his fault if his character isn't developed that well. Likewise Washington Barkin Bellucci Harrelson etc are all OK but they are more parts within a point rather than characters. QTip is a noncharacter but is a nice presence in the sort of role that Lee would often play. Although it didn't bother me too much I did wonder how much damage the portrayal of lesbians did the film  or how fair it was? To my eye they seemed to be either lipstick lesbians that were very sexy or larger women played for comic effect  only one or two seemed like normal people but with so many other things to niggle me this was right at the bottom of my list.Overall the negative reviews are partly correct because this is a messy film with a narrative that is all over the place. Happily Spike Lee is always worth watching because the film has interesting themes through it and Lee's anger may be overdone at times but mainly it has the desired effect of being very watchable. Worth seeing for what it does well even if it does a lot wrong.".

	schema:headline " Will the real Spike Lee please stand up...";
	schema:reviewBody "So the antiBush campaign that makes up the first 45 minutes or so of the movie are pretty clear. Even the attack on Bush's antigay tendencies are pretty clear. What's not clear is what the movie's trying to do. Jack is a corporate employee with serious potential who finds himself unemployed because of his refusal to ignore the massive corporate corruption with which he suddenly finds himself surrounded. So then he goes home to his fancy apartment which he can no longer afford to maintain and then has to deal with the torturous proposal of impregnating lesbians at 10000 a piece.The most difficult endeavor that the movie takes on is in trying to make us believe that Jack was actually conflicted about all of this and it fails miserably. There a nonsensical subplot about him still being upset about his exgirlfriend the lesbian who is bringing all of her lesbian friends to be impregnated by Jack but only after her. Keep in mind that their breakup happened FOUR YEARS EARLIER and not only was he belligerently furious to come home and find his sexy girlfriend having sex with another sexy woman but he hasn't gotten over it four years later. They actually get into screaming arguments in the movie about this ancient history between themselves. I'm reminded of one of Julia Roberts' many great lines from Closer  What are you 12?So while he's not busy acting like a junior high school kid who's heartbroken about some girl who cheated on him he's having sex with whole lines of lesbians and trying to act like it's just hell to him. Please. At the risk of sounding like some typical jerk for such a thing to be torturous to a man we need to have a real real good reason for him to hate doing it and still being upset about a relationship that ended nearly half a decade earlier isn't even close to reason enough.I can accept that the movie wants to suggest that this guy genuinely loved his girlfriend and truly feels like he has lost the love of his life but let me tell you one thing. Showing a guy suffer through Every Man's Fantasy is not the way to do it. At all. Unless of course you have some ulterior political motive but that's just not Spike Lee's style right? Right? I won't spend much time talking about the ludicrous premise about the lesbians. Whether you've seen the movie or not you probably already know all about it. The problem is that you also come into the movie already knowing what a socially and politically conscious filmmaker Spike Lee is. We know that he is going to be making political statements in the film and some of them are clear while others are not unless Spike has completely lost all sense of balance. There are scenes where it is increasingly obvious what social ills are being dealt with such as the terrible scene where Jack has some wooden and massively unrealistic conversation with his friend who is trying to make money donating sperm. It's a godawful scene but it's relatively clear what is being said. I could of course come up with some pretty solid theories about what is being said about the homosexual content of the film how Jack the black man is forced to descend to that level but it is such a gigantic portion of the film that it even overshadows that picture of Bush on the 3 bill at the end of the opening credits and that's a difficult image to overshadow. Lee puts so much stock into the lesbians in this movie that it borders on low grade soft porn. At one point in the movie while bike riding together Jack's brother gives him a bright sparkling gem of advice  get a vasectomy and call it a day. Now there are two things that could lead a man to give such advice to his brother. First it could be because he's been having too much sex or second it could be because he's making ten thousand dollars at a time doing it. Either way it's a good reason never to take advice from your brother again. Jack of course reacts by throwing a temper tantrum like an 8 year old kid resulting in one of the great many scenes that made me want to put a pot over my head and start beating on it with a serving ladle. One of the biggest problems with the movie is that not only does it bore and irritate but it deliberately insults the audience. Granted I didn't know a lot of the details about some of the homages that are made in the film such as the XFL player that inspired the title of the film and the security guard who exposed the Watergate breakin and ruined his own life in the process. I can understand if Lee wants us to be aware of what he's talking about but he literally stops his movie to put these stories up on billboards and then hits us over the head with them. By the end of the movie I was literally standing up pacing back and forth I was so irritated and desperate for it to end. There are times when I wish I didn't have this determination to finish watching movies even the abysmally terrible ones. The really sad thing about She Hate Me is that it isn't even not very good for a Spike Lee film this is just a bad movie overall. It's almost weird to think that it was directed by the same man that directed true classics like Do The Right Thing one of my all time favorite films. She Hate Me is Spike Lee's version of Spielberg's 1941 but worse.Much worse.".

	onyx:emotionText "So the antiBush campaign that makes up the first 45 minutes or so of the movie are pretty clear. Even the attack on Bush's antigay tendencies are pretty clear. What's not clear is what the movie's trying to do. Jack is a corporate employee with serious potential who finds himself unemployed because of his refusal to ignore the massive corporate corruption with which he suddenly finds himself surrounded. So then he goes home to his fancy apartment which he can no longer afford to maintain and then has to deal with the torturous proposal of impregnating lesbians at 10000 a piece.The most difficult endeavor that the movie takes on is in trying to make us believe that Jack was actually conflicted about all of this and it fails miserably. There a nonsensical subplot about him still being upset about his exgirlfriend the lesbian who is bringing all of her lesbian friends to be impregnated by Jack but only after her. Keep in mind that their breakup happened FOUR YEARS EARLIER and not only was he belligerently furious to come home and find his sexy girlfriend having sex with another sexy woman but he hasn't gotten over it four years later. They actually get into screaming arguments in the movie about this ancient history between themselves. I'm reminded of one of Julia Roberts' many great lines from Closer  What are you 12?So while he's not busy acting like a junior high school kid who's heartbroken about some girl who cheated on him he's having sex with whole lines of lesbians and trying to act like it's just hell to him. Please. At the risk of sounding like some typical jerk for such a thing to be torturous to a man we need to have a real real good reason for him to hate doing it and still being upset about a relationship that ended nearly half a decade earlier isn't even close to reason enough.I can accept that the movie wants to suggest that this guy genuinely loved his girlfriend and truly feels like he has lost the love of his life but let me tell you one thing. Showing a guy suffer through Every Man's Fantasy is not the way to do it. At all. Unless of course you have some ulterior political motive but that's just not Spike Lee's style right? Right? I won't spend much time talking about the ludicrous premise about the lesbians. Whether you've seen the movie or not you probably already know all about it. The problem is that you also come into the movie already knowing what a socially and politically conscious filmmaker Spike Lee is. We know that he is going to be making political statements in the film and some of them are clear while others are not unless Spike has completely lost all sense of balance. There are scenes where it is increasingly obvious what social ills are being dealt with such as the terrible scene where Jack has some wooden and massively unrealistic conversation with his friend who is trying to make money donating sperm. It's a godawful scene but it's relatively clear what is being said. I could of course come up with some pretty solid theories about what is being said about the homosexual content of the film how Jack the black man is forced to descend to that level but it is such a gigantic portion of the film that it even overshadows that picture of Bush on the 3 bill at the end of the opening credits and that's a difficult image to overshadow. Lee puts so much stock into the lesbians in this movie that it borders on low grade soft porn. At one point in the movie while bike riding together Jack's brother gives him a bright sparkling gem of advice  get a vasectomy and call it a day. Now there are two things that could lead a man to give such advice to his brother. First it could be because he's been having too much sex or second it could be because he's making ten thousand dollars at a time doing it. Either way it's a good reason never to take advice from your brother again. Jack of course reacts by throwing a temper tantrum like an 8 year old kid resulting in one of the great many scenes that made me want to put a pot over my head and start beating on it with a serving ladle. One of the biggest problems with the movie is that not only does it bore and irritate but it deliberately insults the audience. Granted I didn't know a lot of the details about some of the homages that are made in the film such as the XFL player that inspired the title of the film and the security guard who exposed the Watergate breakin and ruined his own life in the process. I can understand if Lee wants us to be aware of what he's talking about but he literally stops his movie to put these stories up on billboards and then hits us over the head with them. By the end of the movie I was literally standing up pacing back and forth I was so irritated and desperate for it to end. There are times when I wish I didn't have this determination to finish watching movies even the abysmally terrible ones. The really sad thing about She Hate Me is that it isn't even not very good for a Spike Lee film this is just a bad movie overall. It's almost weird to think that it was directed by the same man that directed true classics like Do The Right Thing one of my all time favorite films.

	schema:reviewBody "There's an old premise that the best storytelling is shown not told. In terms of the latest Spike Lee Joint 'She Hate Me' no truer words have ever been uttered.Jack Armstrong Anthony Mackie is a young vicepresident of a pharmaceutical company on the verge of unveiling a vaccine for HIV pending FDA approval. Through the nefarious actions of greedy senior executives Jack finds himself pegged as the scapegoat for this drug that ultimately will not be approved and the subsequent tumble in company stock. Think Enron Worldcom et al. but Spike won't let you think for yourself as he keeps their specific names prominently displayed throughout the movie with overt and pointed references. Margo Ellen Barkin who looked eerily like Martha Stewart only further illustrates this point.In a scenario reminiscent of 'Enemy of the State' Jack loses access to all of his finances and is 'forced' to consider alternative means of generating income. After an unexpected visit by his former fiance he accepts her offer to become father of her childher child and her lesbian lover's child.10000 for 2 successful impregnations is the deal and Jack 'reluctantly' accepts. The next thing you know he has lesbian women knocking at his door daily five at a time offering 10000 each per impregnation.If you've ever seen a 'Spike Lee Joint' you're aware of the common threads woven into all of his movies. You come to expect certain elements and even certain actors. The fact that the supporting cast included such venerable thespians as Ossie Davis Judge Buchanon John Turturro Don Angelo Lonette McKee Lottie and Joie Lee Gloria while featuring a fabulous soundtrack by Terence Blanchard should be a surprise to no one. The fact that those actors combined with Monica Belucci Simona Brian Dennehy Chairman Church and Woody Harrelson Powell didn't amount to a great movie should be tremendously surprisingand disappointing. From the opening credits Spike Lee's signature is everywhere. From the rich combination of jazz and orchestral sensibilities in the underlying music bed that set the tone and timbre of the movie you know Spike Lee is here. From the blatant opening reference and disdain of President George Bush you knew the direction this vehicle headed and who was at the wheel.According to Lee 'The story of 'She Hate Me' is very simple. It's about sex greed money and politics.'Yes and no. It's about all of those things but it's far from being simple.The message to be delivered was loud and clear. Unfortunately this message was one of at least 75 different and varied lessons 'She Hate Me' would offer to its viewers. Even more unfortunately Spike chose oration for each and every 'message' in sermonizing character dialogue. Either Spike no longer respects his viewers enough to allow them to 'figure it out on their own' or that verbally bludgeoning them with his viewpoints all 75 of them is now considered a more viable storytelling alternative.The story of 'She Hate Me' is ostensibly about Jack Armstrong and his attempt at getting out of one sticky situation by entering another. In fact it's not. This movie is more about the relationships and realities of women in love with oneanother. This movie is at its best when Spike demonstrates that regardless of gender or orientation insecurity and jealousy are universal. The desires of family and fidelity are also universal irrespective of familial unit structure. Most importantly the need to be accepted unconditionally is a definitive trait in all of us. Those arguably were the most important messages in this movie and Lee is right on the mark.Where 'She Hate Me' specifically missteps is that the story is from the point of view of an unsympathetic character. When Jack first started his new 'business' he supposedly needed money for the moment to counterbalance his frozen assets and continuing financial responsibilities. Yet 18 women 19 children and some 180000 later neither Spike Lee cowriter Michael Genet nor character Jack himself offers a reason as to why he continued such dangerous and fruitless indiscretions for so long.The characters and relationships most enjoyable in this movie were fleeting in nature components remarkably and conspicuously absent after introduction for most of the film. Jack's relationship with his father Geronimo played by Jim Brown was engaging. The sight of football HallofFamer Jim Brown playing a character fighting diabetes and to save his marriage simultaneously was moving. The newly evolving relationship of Geronimo with his son in the midst of the chaos around him was another meaningful subplot one of many that Lee didn't revisit until nearly the end of the movie.A monologue by Don Angelo John Turturro gave us another glimpse of Turturro's acting brilliance. John Turturro is a future Academy Award winner it's just a shame this won't be the role that does it for him.If there is an explanation as to why some substories and subplots were not covered as deeply as others it would be the fact that there are so many characters all of which feel compelled to tell their life story. In fact there are just too many people to keep up with too many to care about in the end. It's like juggling fiery bowling pins where too much concentration on one leads to really bad consequences.Visually 'She Hate Me' pays homage to films of the 1970's with its simplistic camera angles devoid of lighting tricks or steadycams. The knowing use of varying hues and blurred frames was quite appealing stylistically even cool. This combined with great musical cues featuring tenor saxophone melodies was a nice tip of the fedora to the Film Noir genre.'She Hate Me' is raw and gritty in its imagery remarkable in its musicality and at times sensual in its deliverybut ultimately not a good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spike Lee's latest effort She Hate Me has been a debate for moviegoers. Some like it some don't. I love Spike's work but that doesn't mean I am biased. I went into She Hate Me expecting the worst. But like most of Spike's films I liked it. Some parts did make me cringe a bit but overall it is a clever film. You all know who the story goes Jack Armstrong Anthony Mackie witnesses the suicide of his coworker and finds a CD with his coworker confessing of the company's Progeia wrong doings. Jack gets fired from his VP position and his bank accounts are frozen. His exfiance Fatima Kerry Washington and her lesbian lover Alex the stunningly beautiful Dania Ramirez gives Jack an offer he can't refuse. He gets to impregnate the old fashion way 18 lesbians for the price of 10 grand each. He does what he has to do until his exboss Leland Powell Woody Harrelson finds out about it and get him on charges. Also in the storyline is Monica Bellucci's character get impregnated with her mob family knowing about it. I heard that this film is confusing and a big mess but if you follow Spike's films you know that he has done this his whole career. All of his film's go off the storyline and gives the audience a chance to know the character. By the end of the film you feel connected with Jack Fatima Alex and all the other characters surrounding them. Another thing that Spike did a good job on was the portrayal of lesbians. Unlike other films She Hate Me doesn't portray them as sex vixens who have nothing on their mind but sex. But as smart intelligent and funny women that are concerned about family values and the society surrounding them and maybe a little bit of sex. I really think that Spike redeemed himself with She Hate Me. Nothing was wrong with 25th Hourit's a great film but it just didn't feel too much like a Spike Lee joint. She Hate Me is a sassy comedy and very entertaining. Watch out for the Bush bashing scenes.She Hate Me rated R  out of ".

He gets to impregnate the old fashion way 18 lesbians for the price of 10 grand each. He does what he has to do until his exboss Leland Powell Woody Harrelson finds out about it and get him on charges. Also in the storyline is Monica Bellucci's character get impregnated with her mob family knowing about it. I heard that this film is confusing and a big mess but if you follow Spike's films you know that he has done this his whole career. All of his film's go off the storyline and gives the audience a chance to know the character. By the end of the film you feel connected with Jack Fatima Alex and all the other characters surrounding them. Another thing that Spike did a good job on was the portrayal of lesbians. Unlike other films She Hate Me doesn't portray them as sex vixens who have nothing on their mind but sex. But as smart intelligent and funny women that are concerned about family values and the society surrounding them and maybe a little bit of sex. I really think that Spike redeemed himself with She Hate Me. Nothing was wrong with 25th Hourit's a great film but it just didn't feel too much like a Spike Lee joint. She Hate Me is a sassy comedy and very entertaining. Watch out for the Bush bashing scenes.She Hate Me rated R  out of ";

	schema:reviewBody "It's safe to say that most people don't like Spike Lee. He's a radical he's racist and a lot of people don't like his movies. That would explain the 3.310 rating for She Hate Me on IMDb considering most of them haven't seen the film. Either that or they couldn't handle everything that Lee and coscreenwriter Michael Genet put onto the plate. However Lee could barely handle all of it and it shows. There's so much for Lee to rant on and make fun of that the movie occasionally lags and feels too heavy for having way too much to talk about. At 138 minutes it does go on for a little too long but that's the only way Lee can fit everything he wants to talk about into his movie. Surprisingly it all has a place and for the most part works pretty well.John Henry Armstrong Anthony Mackie aka Jack works for a prestigious drug company whose drug for curing AIDS has just been rejected by the FDA. However CEO Leland Powell Woody Harrelson performs some illegal transactions causing Jack to blow the whistle and subsequently get fired. Not being able to get a job anywhere else Jack's broke until his exfiance Fatima Kerry Washington comes to him with a plan. For 10000 he will impregnate her and her partner Alex Dania Ramirez. He's initially reluctant but he decides to go ahead. Soon Fatima brings a bunch of lesbians to his place all for 10000 each. Jack has morality issues to deal with but also his former company frame him for the corrupt business practices. From the opening credits where dollar bills float ending with a 3 with George W. Bush on it you know that this movie isn't going to be easy. Lee throws in another attack on Bush later and he tackles the subjects of corporate corruption homosexuality the stereotypes of black men and women and the importance of whistleblowing. That definitely is too much material to work with and it shows. In the film there's about 45 minutes with no talk of the framing of Jack that's being planned. And there's some funny comedy thrown in that is quite funny but makes the film disjointed. One serious scene connects directly to a funny one. It wasn't very balanced. And I could have done without the subplot of Jack's parents. It didn't really lead anywhere. And then everything boils down to a courtroom climax.However the film is always fascinating when Lee exposes these things. It's too much for him to handle as I've said but what he can throw in coherently is interesting and entertaining. The movie is one of the most entertaining of the year and during the aforementioned courtroom climax you're rooting for Jack because you've been through what he's been through. You recognized the cruelty of the company so you feel with Jack and because he's such a normal character you can go along with what he's feeling and everything unfair that happens to him which is a lot. Although it's comedic you understand what he's going through when you see animated sperm with Jack's face on it when he's too tired to continue with the impregnation.Mackie does a great job. He does some emotional work and although in one place or two it seemed like he was going by the book he puts in a sympathetic acting job. Washington does a more realistic acting performance but both are great. They both add to She Hate Me a somewhat muddled but entertaining funny if in the wrong places and criticizing drama. You'll either love it or be offended by it. I think the chance is worth taking. By the way that flashback with Nixon et al. might be the funniest moment of the year.My rating 710Rated R for strong graphic sexualitynudity language and a scene of violence.".

This latest masterful release by Director Spike Lee should not merely be viewed as a comedy although it does has some outrageous laughs based upon a social commentary about morality corruption and ultimately personal salvation. What makes this film challenging and perhaps disappointing to some is that it is so original that it does not easily fit into categories or expectations. However Mr. Lee has indeed succeeded on many levels. In the finest traditions of breaking new ground in art social commentary satire and caricature with the likes of James Joyce Marxist philosophers Marshall McLuhan Herbert Marcuse and others from the Frankfurt school and pop culture icons from Tom Lehrer Bob Dylan and Madonna this film is right or left on target. It is not about donating sperm to lesbians as some might think or corruption in business and government. It uses lesbians and blacks as representations of anyone who is subject to being marginalized. The real message of this movie in my view is that our salvation and rescue lies within and that personal morality i.e. truth is the tool we can use to uncover and destroy government and business deceits from Watergate to Enron and beyond. If you are looking just for laughs and not to be challenged to think beyond the superficial then this movie isn't for you. But for anyone who isn't brain dead brain washed or brainless this just might be the best movie you've ever seen.".

BUT the fact that the man DID make Do the Right Thing makes this all the more of a quagmire of a shmorgesbord. I wanted to give it a chance despite all of the lambasting from critics but they are not really that unwarranted. There are a few small things involving the sex scenes no pun intended I think that are noteworthy but for the most part this is a fiasco that only someone with the temerity skill and daring to go as far as this can pull off. There's a flipside to the coin of ultra talent with auteurs Lee and De Palma and Herzog and Coppola and others which is that the same life that goes all through an original work can sometimes be crippling if wielded the wrong way. This film just simply tackles way too many ideas into one way too long package and it's all the more frustrating for the bits that could in a whole other context maybe be pulled off with a little more insight and skewering.The two major sides aside from the sidebars involving familial ties with John Armstrong Anthony Mackie and his friend who has one of the worst plotstrands involving a bad sperm test are the corporate drudgery and the lesbian impregnations. Guess which one is less credible? Not that Lee and his collaborator really tackle the former side with a lot of gusto or much of anything Armstrong the vice president at a pharmaceutical company who doesn't seem to know that there is corruption involving stocks and prices involving a vaccine for AIDS that by the way has a 75 success rate as if that's a bad thing! sees a former scientist friend jump to his suicide and has on a disc all of the juicy details thus leading to whistle blowing and being fired from his job. This is when Lee and his collaborator get into the biggest pickle that they can never squirm out of as up to now they have material that isn't terrific but has some promise to be developed. But then comes the latter plotline involving Armstrong's ex girlfriend Kerri Washington who between her character and Dania Ramirez's character are the most infuriatingly simplistic lesbians I've seen depicted recently on film who will pay to get impregnated by John.This is where the fun begins. By fun I mean just pure illogical hijinks meant to be exaggerations but Lee never makes it really believable about what kind of exaggeration not once. It might be one thing if only a few of the nearly twenty lesbians Mackie knocks up enjoyed the sex but ALL of them do. Furthermore the character is having sex over and over and over again time and time again on each night. The biggest problem of all encompassing this big chunk of the picture aside from it being there to give Armstrong more 'dimension' and to add the whole aspect of the title to it all is that Lee doesn't know how to balance the satire with the more dramatic points and worst of all for a satirist the material falls flat and isn't funny. They do try the women do to rake up the laughs with their cheesy bed exploits but it's meshed together into a premise that is so ridiculous to accept that it loses its energy very very quick. If not for the awesomely bad cartoon sequences involving Armstrong sperm and lesbian eggs it would be even more excruciating. At the least for a few moments there is pure absurdity in the midst of chaos.Throwing into the pot are the usual bits of blackwhite commentary the mother of Armstrong being mixed which wouldn't be an issue except that it is Spike Lee making it one the Turturro scenes was this just a favor to put him in another movie? and a comparison of Armstrong to the man who blew the whistle on the Watergate breakin not to mention montages involving births and more undercooked slices of Enronstyle semantics. And alongside the thematic sloppiness Lee falters stylistically as well if not as frequently and befuddling as with the substance some of this looks like it was shot for CBS primetime mixed with a few touches of the usual color schemes that are Lee trademarks as well as the oddly upbeat and muzaklike musical score. By the time She Hate Me finishes up one is privy to so many questions about what just happened that it could fill a small notepad.Maybe it's best to think of it as something the director had to get out of his system like a misbegotten Viagra fueled ejaculation ala Armstrong and could move on to greener creative pastures. All I can say is that if you do proceed do so with caution as it's the biggest blunder I've come across so far from his career.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie really surprised me. I mean I was raised watching Spike Lee movies simply because he was doing things other young directors weren't doing. He was the voice for voiceless masses of us blacks folks. He gave a platform to situations in the hood that most other people could case less about. However as I aged and developed an eye for critiquing Spike's movies I realized that he has this same formula for his movies which he rarely veered from and he always had to beat you over the head with the message. She Hate Me breaks that mold just a pinch because he still follows his model but this movie was surprisingly good. While I do feel he did bit off way more than he could have possibly chewed in 2 hours he did address most of the issues he brought up quite well in the time alloted. Okay from the previews you know there's his guy whose lesbian friend approaches him to impregnate him which in and of itself is a bit weird but the movie is so much more deeper than that simply plot. Spike tackled tons of issues mostly current issues that we all deal with now but ultimately the movie tackles what would you do and how far would you go for money? This is a good movie worth spending 2 hours of time dissecting. I'm always recommending buying it so you can watch time and time again and discuss.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is no doubt that Spike Lee is one of the best movie directors working these days. He is an original. Mr. Lee ought to be seen more often. His films are always well crafted he evidently enjoys working with the same team and it's obvious the actors love Mr. Lee. In his hands they all turn great appearances.This film is a curious thing. As written for the screen by Michael Genet the film tries to touch too many themes. It's a political look at something that went wrong in our past history as well as an expose of corruption in high levels and a funny comedy about a man that is in the center of helping women get fulfillment.Mr. Lee is perhaps telling us in a subtle way that we cannot ignore deceit and corruption in higher places. Corruption comes Jack Armstrong's way without he asking for it. He happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Jack was the epitome of a Buppie and his fall is caused by the system where he was a successful executive.The performances are fabulous. Anthony Mackie as Jack is one of the best male roles in any Spike Lee's films. It helps that Mr. Mackie is an incredible actor who will go to bigger and better things and it's sad at the same time because Mr. Lee will probably will not be able to afford his salary in future films the same way he can't afford Denzel Washington or Samuel L. Jackson.John Turturro keeps coming back to work with Mr. Lee and they both have a certain bond and they work well together. The mafioso played by Mr. Turturro is something not to be believed as is his dialog. Ellen Barkin makes a rare appearance. She is an actress that projects sex appeal and mystery at the same time. Monica Belluci has a small role. Woody Harrelson also appears briefly. Lonnette McKey and Jim Brown are Jack's parents and they are good in their roles.Kerry Washington as Fatima the entrepreneurial young woman who comes to the rescue is a fresh face that is a welcome addition to the film. She is a talented actress who can hold her own against Mr. Mackie all the time.As usual music plays a great deal in the film. Terence Blanchard's score is never intrusive but it balances the action well. The great cinematographer Matthew Libatique has given the film a patina that is rich and sensuous at the same time.Spike Lee is an acquired taste. Yes we like him more every time we see one of his films!".

'Just a flick containing scattered thoughts of a man confused about life all together it seems. I am especially disappointed in Kerry Washington. She does Ray and then she does this crap? I would think that film would've opened up doors for her. What had me the most upset was the fact that you had these Lesbians who want to have sex with this man because they want to get pregnant but then you also see these Lesbians lusting after his body and enjoying sex with him being affectionate orgasms ??? The last time I checked Lesbians were women who were into women and did not lust after men. There are Lesbian women in my family I know the drill. It is every pig's fantasy to break a Lesbian and be the one to turn her back to men and this film depicts that. And then at the end Kerry Washington decided that she is Bisexual and not Lesbian after all and then she and her girlfriend decide to have a threeway relationship with this guy who has a child with each of them along with having children with umpteen other women that they set him up to have sex with? And the worst thing of all is the fact that after all the corporate scandal that this guy is wrapped up in the only thing that gets him off is the fact that the judge feels a father of 17 children should be out working and not in prison. What's the message here? The solution for a Black man to beat a Surpreme Court case in which he is being racially targeted is for him to have babies everywhere? I find this film sickening. I can only wonder how Lesbians feel how Black men feel how heterosexual Black women like me feel how anybody feels after watching this crap.

	schema:reviewBody "The reviews of the new Spike Lee joint went from bad to worse Entertainment Weekly gave it an F for whatever that's worth so I purchased my ticket to She Hate Me with more than a little bit of trepidation. Admittedly what allowed my curiosity to get the better of me and coerce me in to shelling out the AMC 25 Times Square's ridiculous 10.50 ticket price was an inner desire to witness the gruesome end to the train wreck that has ravaged Spike Lee for the past five year or so before you stop me I didn't see 25th Hour which I heard from credible sources was pretty decent leave me alone.And for the first half hour of She Hate Me that's exactly what I got. The overwhelming hubris the transparent messaging the muddled almost blunted inside joke that leaves you on the outside. The underdeveloped crack baby conceived in a one night stand between 1 halfbaked racial politics and 2 a convoluted cultural agenda that manages to reinforce the same norms that it calls into question.But somehow Lee saves this one making it provocative rather than tired. In this mess of a film campy vignettes sprout up as tangential arguments surrounding a main thesis. Structuring the movie as such derails the thesis transforming it from a coordinate plane to a topographic map with very queer landmarks. And while at first glance it might seem that Lee is playing the same role he does courtside at a Knicks game  shouting his arse off at action of which he has marginal influence at best  Lee's multiple divergent jeremiads are far less prescriptive than they are descriptive. The description furthermore is characterized by omission. We learn a lot more by what Lee chooses not to include than from what he includes. Case in point In a film that is so mired in presentday political discourse and broaches the subject homosexuality for a great deal of its duration not once is the issues of gay marriage touched upon. The choice not to mention this subject which has unnecessarily? asserted hegemony over a queer rights agenda leaves way for Lee to touch on topics that receive far less mainstream attention such as alternative understandings of the family or how the literal commodification of the black male body resonates across a number of frameworks. Anthony Mackie is somewhat of an acquired taste in the lead role. His acting is tight enough to be convincing but imperfect enough to purvey the affected sense that runs rampant throughout the film. His character Jack Armstrong works at a pharmaceutical development company whose aim is to develop an AIDS vaccine. Once this is established a sequence of scenes reveal to us that the vaccine has been rejected by the FDA that one of the main scientists has committed suicide and that higherups in his company are guilty of blatant insider trading.When Jack blows the whistle to the SEC the shit deflects off of the fan and hits him in the face. He is fired and his bank account is frozen. In order to maintain the upperclass Manhattanite lifestyle he's been living he grudgingly agrees to impregnate his ex girlfriend Fatima Kerry Washington and her new girlfriend Alex Dania Ramirez. Receiving 10000 for impregnating the two of them Fatima convinces Jack to pony up his one trick to eighteen of her thirtysomething lesbian friends at 10G's a nut. Aronofskyesque drug ingestion shots abound as Jack pops Viagra and Redbull to maintain stamina at these pregnancy parties where five women each get a turn with Jack.A few critics have taken issue with the film's portrait of lesbianism claiming that it suggests that lesbianism is essentially heterosexualitywithoutthedudes. Reinforcing this viewpoint are She Hate Me's leading ladies two bougie lipstick lesbians of color  a lightskinned black woman and a Dominican mami  with totally hellacious bodies dude. But the lesbian representation isn't homogenous rather it runs the gamut and transcends racial borders. It's concurrently totally Hollywood and antiHollywood.She Hate Me wraps itself up in so many questions that it's completely unable to resolve and that's part of what makes it succeed. It diagnoses a politics that is weighted down by its anfractuous periphery and conflicted center. But in its articulation of these questions it forces us to laugh at what makes us uncomfortable. It belies an almost tangible confusion in any attempt at reconciling its own identity and unexpectedly brings us to a denouement that's ordo ab chao phrased through a deus ex machina. And like the XFL player from whom the film takes its name what reads like a grammatical disaster conceals witty commentary on problematics that compromise identity.".

His character Jack Armstrong works at a pharmaceutical development company whose aim is to develop an AIDS vaccine. Once this is established a sequence of scenes reveal to us that the vaccine has been rejected by the FDA that one of the main scientists has committed suicide and that higherups in his company are guilty of blatant insider trading.When Jack blows the whistle to the SEC the shit deflects off of the fan and hits him in the face. He is fired and his bank account is frozen. In order to maintain the upperclass Manhattanite lifestyle he's been living he grudgingly agrees to impregnate his ex girlfriend Fatima Kerry Washington and her new girlfriend Alex Dania Ramirez. Receiving 10000 for impregnating the two of them Fatima convinces Jack to pony up his one trick to eighteen of her thirtysomething lesbian friends at 10G's a nut. Aronofskyesque drug ingestion shots abound as Jack pops Viagra and Redbull to maintain stamina at these pregnancy parties where five women each get a turn with Jack.A few critics have taken issue with the film's portrait of lesbianism claiming that it suggests that lesbianism is essentially heterosexualitywithoutthedudes. Reinforcing this viewpoint are She Hate Me's leading ladies two bougie lipstick lesbians of color  a lightskinned black woman and a Dominican mami  with totally hellacious bodies dude. But the lesbian representation isn't homogenous rather it runs the gamut and transcends racial borders. It's concurrently totally Hollywood and antiHollywood.She Hate Me wraps itself up in so many questions that it's completely unable to resolve and that's part of what makes it succeed. It diagnoses a politics that is weighted down by its anfractuous periphery and conflicted center. But in its articulation of these questions it forces us to laugh at what makes us uncomfortable. It belies an almost tangible confusion in any attempt at reconciling its own identity and unexpectedly brings us to a denouement that's ordo ab chao phrased through a deus ex machina. And like the XFL player from whom the film takes its name what reads like a grammatical disaster conceals witty commentary on problematics that compromise identity.";

This latest masterful release by Director Spike Lee should not merely be viewed as a comedy although it does has some outrageous laughs based upon a social commentary about morality corruption and ultimately personal salvation. What makes this film challenging and perhaps disappointing to some is that it is so original that it does not easily fit into categories or expectations. However Mr. Lee has indeed succeeded on many levels. In the finest traditions of breaking new ground in art social commentary satire and caricature with the likes of James Joyce Marxist philosophers Marshall McLuhan Herbert Marcuse and others from the Frankfurt school and pop culture icons from Tom Lehrer Bob Dylan and Madonna this film is right or left on target. It is not about donating sperm to lesbians as some might think or corruption in business and government. It uses lesbians and blacks as representations of anyone who is subject to being marginalized. The real message of this movie in my view is that our salvation and rescue lies within and that personal morality i.e. truth is the tool we can use to uncover and destroy government and business deceits from Watergate to Enron and beyond. If you are looking just for laughs and not to be challenged to think beyond the superficial then this movie isn't for you. But for anyone who isn't brain dead brain washed or brainless this just might be the best movie you've ever seen. I give it a 10 must see rating.".

The film capitalizes on the mythic and mystic nature of the landscape and the landThe Land of the Midnight Sun. What a perfect setting for a film about love loneliness fears of abandonment and of course vampires. The horror is a subtle one and even now barely verges on the campy thanks to the uniqueness of its setting.

Further enhanced by an evocative chanted score outstanding use of the wintry desolate godforsaken Finnish countryside and frequently striking visuals the burial ground ridden with scattered animal bones is memorably creepy The White Reindeer deservedly won awards at both the Cannes and Karlovy Vary Film Festivals.

	schema:reviewBody "The Finnish film 'White Reindeer' is marketed in the USA and Britain as a horror movie but that's not precisely accurate. This is a stark moody film but not a scary one. It purports to be an authentic Lapp folktale about a woman named Pirita who turns into a white reindeer in order to feed upon men.This story has elements of both the vampire and the werewolf legend as well as the succubus. Apart from reindeer being native to Lapland I can't imagine why the reindeer was chosen as the species for this folktale's version of the shapechanger legend. Bats and wolves are predators and therefore scary. The reindeer is a domesticated herbivore that serves humans ... not very spooky is it? In one sequence the werereindeer woman sprouts fangs. Actual reindeer don't have fangs so why should these be part of her transformation? Female reindeer have antlers so why doesn't Pirita sprout antlers?Speaking of superstitions and myths early in this film a black cat scurries across the path of an approaching sledge but the director gives this so little emphasis that it appears to have no significance. In Cornwall it's considered good luck to have a black cat cross one's path and this same thing is considered bad luck in America. Do Lapps have any superstitions concerning black cats?Mirjami Kuosmanen the actress who plays the central role in this film is quite pretty ... but her performance as a native of northern Lapland is weakened by the fact that she is clearly wearing makeup. Due to the low production budget we never actually see Pirita changing into the reindeer ... but the director cleverly gets round this by having his leading lady lunge towards the camera then cutting to a shot of a reindeer in the same position. Still I was hoping we would see a shot of a woman's shadow changing shape ... or a series of human footprints in the snow abruptly becoming hoofmarks.The Lapp landscape in this movie is starkly beautiful and awesome but never frightening. The photography is excellent. There are two impressive dissolve shots involving flames and a splendid montage sequence. I was extremely impressed by a night sequence over a bonfire. During the Midnight Sun sequences there are two shots featuring a weird colonnade of white pillars these appear to be artefacts of the Lapp culture but we never learn what they are. A sequence in which a carved vertrebra dances magically across a shaman's drum has an eerie pagan power that made me think of Nijinsky's staging of 'The Rites of Spring'.My one complaint about this film  a minor grievance  is that we never learn the time period in which the main action occurs. These Laplanders possess milled coins a rifle and loomed curtains. One sequence takes place at a prayer service that is clearly Christian featuring a minister in Geneva bands. Are we watching scenes in the twentieth century or some earlier time? I'll rate this moody compelling but not frightening film 8 out of 10. Oh my deer! I Lapped this up!".

Those who are completely ignorant of Rand's work and are seeing the film and judging it in a relative vacuum these negative reviews do in my opinion have a certain merit inasmuch as the film doesn't really stand on its own as something that would appeal to the general moviegoing audience.That said I enjoyed the movie. I agree with Rand's philosophy not the allaboutme world view that her dissenters accuse her of espousing so seeing it on the big screen is refreshing for me. The main faults I find with it are no doubt due to condensing roughly 350400 pages of book into about 90 minutes of film without butchering it beyond recognition films adapted from Stephen King's works generally have the same faults compounded by a woefully inadequate budget.

The movie jumps in right at the point where the Taggert Transcontinental crashes after derailing. There's no background on the peoples' lives. You don't understand the relationships between Dagney James her brother Francisco her friend and first love and Eddie her friend and employee. You don't understand how much Dagney loves the railroad and how she took any job at the railroad when she was younger. It doesn't show how much the employees respect her versus James. You don't understand how intelligent and creative Francisco is and how he respects his ancestor who sacrificed everything for his love and his future generations so you're not confused like you should be why he's acting like he is.I didn't get the feel of how desperate the general public deals with everyday life. Yes there were a lot of street people but the viewer doesn't understand why or that not everyone is lazy andor greedy. You don't feel the disintegration of everyone's life and the country. You see superficial greedy politicians but you miss the fear in most everybody's eyes. Also it doesn't show how hard Dagney works to save the railroad by building the John Galt Line. It doesn't show her frustrations or the long hours she puts in and how weary she becomes but doesn't give up. Also her office in the basement of the Taggert Building is sparse and cramped in the book which adds to her strength but in the movie it looks just like her regular office.The one scene that I think is important to the story is when Dagney is working very late one night and she sees a shadowy figure walk up to the door of her office and she thinks it might be Hank Reardon. The figure paces back and forth and then walks away. I think it's important to the story because later you find out it was John Galt and how he knew that it wasn't the right time to talk to her. The movie ends just like the book part 1 with Dagney screaming no! at Wyatt's Torch. The movie is only 97 minutes long so they could have added more depth to the movie without tiring out the audience. I don't think the movie will recoup the expenses of making the movie. If not it doesn't seem they will truly continue with part 2 or 3.".

The acting is superb particularly Taylor Schilling as Dagny Taggart and Grant Bowler as Hank Rearden. Bowler manages to cram more meaning into a halfcocked eyebrow than most actors in a dozen lines of dialogue and Shilling captures the sleek cold elegance of Dagny while giving just a hint of the passion simmering beneath the surface. Indeed all the performances are impeccable. This is a beautiful movie to watch with sets locations and costumes that are both gorgeous and convincing. The run of the John Galt Line is thrilling and when it crossed the bridge made of Rearden Metal I wanted to stand up and cheer.Director Paul Johansson who also plays John Galt obviously knew exactly what he wanted to put on the screen and manged to do it. He is faithful to Rand's story and in particular to the philosophical message that is at the heart of the work while maintaining the excitement of the plot. During her lifetime Rand did not allow the novel to be made into a film perhaps for fear that the movie would not be faithful to the book. It's too bad that she didn't live to see this movie because I believe she would be surprised and pleased by how well it captures the essence of her work. This is clearly a labor of love that will help make Rand's ideas accessible to many who have not yet read her work. And it's exciting and rewarding for those of us who have been Rand fans for many years. Can't wait for Parts 2 and 3.".

	schema:headline " Atlas Sucks";
	schema:reviewBody "I went into this film as a blank slate  someone completely unfamiliar with Ayn Rand and her philosophy. I am aware that there are a number of people who cite her novel Atlas Shrugged as a lifechanging blue print for living and society and others who dismiss it as complete bilge with incredibly destructive properties.I cannot attest to how faithful this film remains to the source novel but I can attest to the fact that it is an utterly deadening mindnumbing and thoroughly unenjoyable viewing experience. If I understand the gist of the Rand philosophy embodied in Atlas Shrugged it seems to be that personal selfaggrandizement selfishness and greed are the most important aspects of society and should be encouraged while the average working man is so much forgettable dross to be dismissed and trod over. I believe Michael Douglas encapsulated this in a memorable speech back in 1987s Wall Street. It only took him a moment to convey it whereas it takes Atlas Shrugged the entire film plus a projected two more to convey the exact same message. If I am incorrect about the Rand philosophy then blame the film as those I went with came away with the same impression. I find it deeply disturbing that anyone finds this lunacy a blue print for society.The story is pretty much a bunch of nonsense about uncompromising glacial blond Dagny Taggart teaming with Hank Reardon to build a new high speed rail system in the US against the obstacles placed there by the villainous government regulations. Anyone who disagrees with Dagny and Hank are depicted as either weaklings villains or preferably both.The story is purportedly set in the near future but it is utterly laughable because it seems to exist in a hermetic bubble that has no relation to the world we actually live in. The fact that so much of the story depends on the success of high speed rail transit is ironic considering that conservatives libertarians and Randians alike are currently trying to throw assorted obstacles into the path of such a plan currently being developed. The lunacy the film spouts about regulation and Big Government is pure hilarity considering that regulation has become progressively extinct in the US since the 1980s and it has proved to be to the detriment of the country not to its success. The film fails to mention anything about such modern conveniences as the internet and mentions nothing about the progress of other industrialized nations. Whereas we are currently looking at a corrupt government weakened by corporate brownnosers answering to the highest business bidder Atlas Shrugged seems to present such a thing as a utopia.The film looks suspiciously like a made for TV movie but made on the cheap. The cast is a washout with an array of unknowns and barely familiar faces trying to invest some degree of passion or emotion into the proceedings to little success. Taylor Schilling is hopelessly out of her element in the central role and she is illsupported by the remainder of the cast. Director Paul Johansson casts himself as the elusive John Galt an enigmatic mystery man behind the disappearance of the supposed cream of the crop in business but this plot thread is so uncompelling as to be rendered comatose.Laughably despite the reported nadir of the country in the film everyone we meet is wealthy welltodo dressed to the nines and impressed with themselves to the nth degree. The action is basically a series of business meetings set in different random places. If you think your average staff meeting is provocative and sexy then this is definitely the film for you. Imagine an episode of Dallas or Dynasty with lower production values an absence of the campy characters that make the shows a guilty pleasure and completely set in boardroomsmeeting areas and you have Atlas Shrugged down pat. Considering one must imagine the producers had some degree of passion to bring this to the screen it is woefully absent on screen. The film lumbers to an exhilarating crescendo wherein we see people ride a train...quickly.

	onyx:emotionText "I went into this film as a blank slate  someone completely unfamiliar with Ayn Rand and her philosophy. I am aware that there are a number of people who cite her novel Atlas Shrugged as a lifechanging blue print for living and society and others who dismiss it as complete bilge with incredibly destructive properties.I cannot attest to how faithful this film remains to the source novel but I can attest to the fact that it is an utterly deadening mindnumbing and thoroughly unenjoyable viewing experience. If I understand the gist of the Rand philosophy embodied in Atlas Shrugged it seems to be that personal selfaggrandizement selfishness and greed are the most important aspects of society and should be encouraged while the average working man is so much forgettable dross to be dismissed and trod over. I believe Michael Douglas encapsulated this in a memorable speech back in 1987s Wall Street. It only took him a moment to convey it whereas it takes Atlas Shrugged the entire film plus a projected two more to convey the exact same message. If I am incorrect about the Rand philosophy then blame the film as those I went with came away with the same impression. I find it deeply disturbing that anyone finds this lunacy a blue print for society.The story is pretty much a bunch of nonsense about uncompromising glacial blond Dagny Taggart teaming with Hank Reardon to build a new high speed rail system in the US against the obstacles placed there by the villainous government regulations. Anyone who disagrees with Dagny and Hank are depicted as either weaklings villains or preferably both.The story is purportedly set in the near future but it is utterly laughable because it seems to exist in a hermetic bubble that has no relation to the world we actually live in. The fact that so much of the story depends on the success of high speed rail transit is ironic considering that conservatives libertarians and Randians alike are currently trying to throw assorted obstacles into the path of such a plan currently being developed. The lunacy the film spouts about regulation and Big Government is pure hilarity considering that regulation has become progressively extinct in the US since the 1980s and it has proved to be to the detriment of the country not to its success. The film fails to mention anything about such modern conveniences as the internet and mentions nothing about the progress of other industrialized nations. Whereas we are currently looking at a corrupt government weakened by corporate brownnosers answering to the highest business bidder Atlas Shrugged seems to present such a thing as a utopia.The film looks suspiciously like a made for TV movie but made on the cheap. The cast is a washout with an array of unknowns and barely familiar faces trying to invest some degree of passion or emotion into the proceedings to little success. Taylor Schilling is hopelessly out of her element in the central role and she is illsupported by the remainder of the cast. Director Paul Johansson casts himself as the elusive John Galt an enigmatic mystery man behind the disappearance of the supposed cream of the crop in business but this plot thread is so uncompelling as to be rendered comatose.Laughably despite the reported nadir of the country in the film everyone we meet is wealthy welltodo dressed to the nines and impressed with themselves to the nth degree. The action is basically a series of business meetings set in different random places. If you think your average staff meeting is provocative and sexy then this is definitely the film for you. Imagine an episode of Dallas or Dynasty with lower production values an absence of the campy characters that make the shows a guilty pleasure and completely set in boardroomsmeeting areas and you have Atlas Shrugged down pat. Considering one must imagine the producers had some degree of passion to bring this to the screen it is woefully absent on screen. The film lumbers to an exhilarating crescendo wherein we see people ride a train...quickly. This realization of this dream is so much for Dagny and the married Hank that they must consummate their romantic ardor in a scene with all of the erotic splendor of a memorandum. The complete ennui which dogs this film leaves the viewer soporific by the time it grinds to a halt.Based on this initial effort one can only wish that the world will not be victimized by Parts 2 and 3.

	schema:reviewBody "I have little to no knowledge of Ayn Rand or her philosophy but if this odious cheaplooking stool sample is an accurate depiction of her feverishly acclaimed novel then there are a lot of delusional psychotic people in the world.The plot and action has all the momentum of winter sludge. Selfimpressed icy blonde Dagny Taggart struts and preens all over the place in some daft effort to convince us that she is uncompromising and bold as she attempts to pursue high speed rail with an amazing new supersteel against the wicked machinations of the almighty government regulation and evil unions. The film is so laughably black and white in its depictions of everything that it fails to attain even the depth of a Dick and Jane preschool book. In short Dagny and her married semilovercompatriot Hank Rearden are pinnacles of brilliance while the rest of the world is comprised of either villains trying to stop them or an offensively simplistic depiction of the average working American as slovenly unimaginative ingrates whose fates are of no concern so long as Dagny gets her way. Given that Dagny and Hank are supposed to be such largerthanlife legends it comes as a real shame that neither has a distinct personality.Incomprehensibly the film is set in the future yet the action centers on the importance of rail transport. It would be hilarious if the film obviously did not regard itself with such outlandish relevance and undeserved reverence. Minimal effort is made to update the story with little to no acknowledgments of such issues as air travel the internet and the technical advancements made since Rand wrote her tome. The material would have fared far better if it was set in the past but then again that would only have exacerbated the idiocy that nothing predicted in the novel has come to pass and in fact many of the policies the bookfilm seems to advocate so strongly for have led to very real disasters out in the real world. Of course that doesn't stop this myopic piece of fiction from steadfastly advocating them anyway.The country presented in Atlas Shrugged is supposed to be a notch above a wasteland yet nearly every character that promenades across the screen seems to be a billboard for wealth and privilege. Admittedly the film has little interest in the unwashed masses that it hold beneath contempt because it reasons they have no valuable contributions to make in the grand scheme of things. The events that do not unfold on the rails do so in ritzy clubs and swanky boardrooms with the characters freely imbibing and trading such banter that sounds like it came from a particularly dry article of Money Magazine. A lot of what they spout is suitably incomprehensible gobbledygook but then we average folk are not supposed to comprehend this level of brilliance. Given that this is only Part 1 of a planned trilogy one can only hope that the action speeds up to a crawl by Part 2.The look and feel of the film definitely smacks of cheapness and Paul Johansson's stagnant direction is a further detraction. The only cast members I vaguely recognized were Michael O'Keefe and Michael Lerner both of whom have fallen a long way from their forgotten glory days as Oscarnominated actors. Taylor Schilling and Grant Bowler are the ostensible leads of the piece  both are undemonstrative and forgettable. It is admittedly difficult to portray largerthanlife ideologues but neither Schilling nor Bowler have the charisma to bridge the mammoth personality black holes that pass for characters. If you think they lack as singular characters as a couple they have all the charm of inanimate titanium rods. Their love scene is not only one of the most chastely filmed in the history of cinema but has all of the heat and passion one associates with clenching a block of ice between one's butt cheeks. The film does not so much build to a conclusion or a cliffhanger so much as it resembles a comatose patient that expires on the operating table in front of us with no warning or fanfare.For all of the film's bloated selfimportance it comes off a lot like that old relative that everyone dreads showing up at family events who talks too loud and has a ragingly unpopular opinion on everything and whose grip on reality is tenuous at the best of times. Yes much like that relative Atlas Shrugged is in dire need of being put in mothballs or consigned to the old age home of broken philosophies where it can mercifully fade away into the oblivion it so deserves. In the meantime for those who similarly endured the torment of this film you have my sympathy. And for fans of the film you have my pity and I sincerely hope your therapist is a good one.".

	schema:headline " Atlas Shrugged Part 1 Opening Dy Review";
	schema:reviewBody "How is Atlas Shrugged different from any other movie? Why has is taken 54 years to bring Ayn Rand's epic 1100 page novel to the big screen? Why is it lacking participation from the Alist Hollywood names once attached to it Anjelina Jolie Charlize Theron Robert Redford Clint Eastwood Maggie Gyllenhaal and Faye Dunaway? Why did it open on only 300 screens nationwide and why was that opening on April 15 2011 coincident with the third annual Tax Day Tea Party? Why are the founders and top executives of the nation's most successful industrial empires disappearing without a trace one by one? Why ask useless questions? Who is John Galt? Because they have answers that's why. Those who have read Rand's 1957 magnum opus know the answer to the last of those questions. This posting will suggest an answer to the first which may in turn offer clues to the others.So what makes Atlas Shrugged different? It takes place in the nearterm future 2016 a departure from the book. That's not it we have seen thousands of movies about an imagined future. The nation is in the worst economic recession in history. Nothing new there. People of former means are living in the streets homeless and destitute while the captains of industry and owners of large corporations grow rich. No departure from the Hollywood norm there. The story is told from the points of view of those ultrarich tycoons and moguls the movie's sympathetic characters. There it is. Never before has a major Hollywood movie departed from its pet formula in which the bad guys are the evil rich. Not until now has a movie examined the question why do we hate the founders of corporations and why do we blame them for unemployment when they are the ones who create jobs not destroy them?Atlas Shrugged asks the viewer to think and understand similar to other business themed files like Wall Street and Rollover. Readers may be disappointed that the monumental size of the novel does not afford time for the screenplay to take the user into certain folds of the full story since many characters must be introduced and much of the politicalbusiness climate must be laid down as foundation. As a result much of the screenplay consists of dry dialog and much of the action from the novel is absent presented in exposition such as newspaper headlines. The train wreck with which the book introduces us to heroine Dagny Taggart's heroic cando character is shown only on a television news screen and mentioned only once much later in dialog. The story of the Twentieth Century Motor Company's failure is given in brief narration by Hank Rearden. The backstory relationship between Dagny and Francisco D'Anconia is not explored at all. Eddie Willers is reduced to little more than an office messenger periodically updating the principles on the latest story developments.Dagny and Rearden themselves are played with dry professionalism by Taylor Schilling and Paul Johansson owing to their characters' purelybusiness attitudes toward life. Only in the final cliffhanging scene does Schilling display the real passion of Dagny in a single exclamation reminiscent of Scarlett O'Hara's anguished cry which closes the first half of Gone with the Wind. Some familiar character actors are present Graham Beckel gives a compelling performance as oil magnate Ellis Wyatt as do John Polito as steel competitor Orren Boyle and Michael Lerner as Washington lobbyist Wesley Mouch conspicuously not pronounced mooch. Rebecca Wisocky is delightfully unlikeable Rearden's ungrateful wife of 10 years Lillian inducing chuckles among viewers as she delivers snide condescending comments directed at her successful husband from whom she is nonetheless not too proud to freeload.The cinematography is extraordinary particularly during a montage in which the inaugural run of the new Rio Norte train crosses breathtaking views of Colorado. This movie gives us heavy industrial shots such as rail yards and steel mills not as hideous rusted eyesores but as the industrialists see them glorious grand machinery producing goods and pumping wealth into the nation's economy. That is another way in which this movie is different  its view that industry is not evil enemy to all that is good and healthy but rather the foundation upon which modern society is built.The biggest disappointment is the sudden ending to those who have not read the book and were expecting more than half a movie. In reality it is onethird as the filmmakers have divided the story in same manner Ayn Rand divided the novel into three parts. Atlas Shrugged then is a trilogy in which Part 1 only begins to hint at the answer to the pervasive question Who is John Galt? The closing credits veritably beg for Part 2.".

	schema:reviewBody "warning very mild spoilersIt is difficult to believe Atlas Shrugged could be made into a movie at all. To imagine it could be made into a movie for 10 million dollars in only several months is mind boggling. Yet there it was on the screen. To be fair the movie being released April 15th 2011 is only the first third of the book with parts 2 and 3 scheduled for the same date in 2012 and 2013. Also to be fair if I didn't realize how difficult this novel would be to convert to film and if I didn't know how tiny was its production budget I might subtract a star or two.Many characters locations and events had to be eliminated to squeeze the first third of this 1150 page book into a 110 minute movie. They chose well what to retain and how to present it. While the novel was set in the 1950s the movie is set about 5 years in the future. This was a stunningly risky decision but to my great surprise they pulled it off quite well. This surely saved them millions in budget.None of the actors are well known to me though I thought a few of them looked vaguely familiar. The only actor I could place was Quark from Star Trek Deep Space 9 which is rather humorous since he was buried deep in plastic rubber and makeup in that series. However the acting was almost uniformly good and sometimes excellent. In particular Grant Bowler was a spoton perfect Hank Rearden as was Rebecca Wisocky as his crafty and vile wife. But other actors also impressed during their limited screen time.One incredibly difficult aspect of making this movie is the inability for a movie to do what novelists regularly do... explain extensively what their characters are thinking and feeling. So by necessity this film implies what the characters are thinking and feeling with subtle cues and by placing the characters in difficult situations and letting the audience watch how they react. This makes it impossible to include the kind of explicit exposition of philosophy that exists in the novel but... this is a movie after all and no plausible alternative existed. Besides anyone who finds the movie compelling can read the novel and read plenty of explicit philosophy. Furthermore fans of the novel already know what the actors are thinking and feeling so this audiovisual presentation is the perfect complement to the book they already consumed.Though the movie was excellent I would have made a few changes. And indeed it is possible some of the more trivial of these might be changed before formal release. First I would not state in the movie that the current date is 2016 or any other specific date. The novel is timeless and should remain that way on film as much as practical.As I recall the novel John Galt is not seen until quite late in the book except anonymously in informal lunches with Eddie Willers. In fact one interesting mystery for the reader was guessing whether John Galt was a real human or just an accidental name plugged into the popular saying Who is John Galt? which was a popular synonym for futility resignation hopelessness and who knows. However they chose to make John Galt a very clearly real character in the movie albeit never clearly seen. I don't understand why they did this and unless I'm missing something I wish they hadn't.I can't ding the movie for this but probably the worst part of the movie was... it ended after only 13 of the story is told. But that's true of many long stories from the Star Wars saga to the Lord Of The Rings trilogy and so forth. But damn was it annoying to think we must wait another year for part 2 and an additional year for part 3. Perhaps adding to the bummer was the fact that part 1 ended on a very downer note kind of like Empire Strikes Back did. Poor Dagny has to endure her pain for a whole year before she can move forward again. Oh well that's life in the movies.I hope this film works as well for people who never read the epic Atlas Shrugged novel but I'm not sure I can answer that. I suspect it is compelling enough to get many to read the book and learn why so many consider why this work even more crucially important today than it was 54 years ago when the novel was published.Definitely go see Atlas Shrugged at the theater on April 15 2011 if it is released on a screen near you. If it isn't call your local theaters and demand they bring it to your town. If all else fails presumably a DVD will be released in a few months.".

Poor Dagny has to endure her pain for a whole year before she can move forward again. Oh well that's life in the movies.I hope this film works as well for people who never read the epic Atlas Shrugged novel but I'm not sure I can answer that. I suspect it is compelling enough to get many to read the book and learn why so many consider why this work even more crucially important today than it was 54 years ago when the novel was published.Definitely go see Atlas Shrugged at the theater on April 15 2011 if it is released on a screen near you. If it isn't call your local theaters and demand they bring it to your town. If all else fails presumably a DVD will be released in a few months.";

However as a big fan of the book and given the current US and global political climate and turmoil I would rather see this movie made now under the conditions described above than have to wait another 50 years to see it hit the silver screen.The filmmakers plausibly weaved the original Ayn Rand novel into the present without sacrificing much in the process. Combine that with solid acting and the overall feel of the movie and they have delivered an enjoyable movie that I will see more than once in the theater which is rare for me. Not once did I feel that I was watching a movie that was thrown together as some have suggested or that sacrificed quality or story. Instead this had nearly all of the look feel and polish that you would expect to see in a bigbudget Hollywood movie with the sole exception of the Alist actors.My fear though is that many people will skip this movie either because they have not read the novel or because they just don't hear about it. My wife is a perfect example as she does not plan to see it with me because the premise of the novel which she has not read did not interest her when I described it.My biggest criticism is that this movie is too short 90 minutes long and ended fairly abruptly. Given the amount of material involved and that it is being split into 3 movies the first movie could haveshould have been at least two hours long.".

My eyes are tearing as I report that while retaining the book's name the movie shrugs its intricate underlying story and moral teachings.Published in 1957 the opus largely transpires in a not too distant future. Describing the ruination of the '50's culture of hope and prosperity due to the welfare state forcing people making a living to pay for those too lazy to work John Galt leads the best minds to cease contributing their time and talents thereby causing the country's collapse.The author was prophetic. Although Galt was fictitious the railroads the mills the family farms have since disappeared joining other productive jobs now overseas. Doctors no longer make house calls the true cause of our health care crisis. Atlas Shrugged years ago the novel standing as a history lesson needing to be understood if humankind is to recover.The movie ignores that history commencing five years from the stagnant present day the railroad and mills incomprehensibly restored. We're fed merely flashes of newspaper reports on the bad economy with no comparison to America's glorious days.In contrast the novel opens with Eddie observing specifics of decay as he walks New York City streets. The scene shifts to his railroad boss Dagny experiencing first hand the circumstances ordinary folks endure as she rides a train stopping from negligence. Later we're presented the essential backstory of Eddie and Dagny growing up together how their past shaped their present. Context focus and drama so frustratingly absent from the motion picture.In this feature hero Hank looks Hollywood handsome and initially seems more upright than today's crooked businessman in bed with politicians. Except noble Hank literally beds rival Dagny who displays a mindless grin after their tepid sex. Dagny's earlier relationship with Francisco in the novel is richly complex although in the film he's a nitwit so I guess it doesn't take much from Hank to satisfy her. Oh by the way Hank's cheating on his faithful wife Lillian. Missing is novel Hank's guilt and struggle over his affair with Dagny. You see back in the book's time it was wrong to violate one's marriage. Today it's common behavior so the movie yes I'll say it shrugs this immorality and its consequences. I'm a Hitchcock fan and had he been director I imagine he'd have had Hank take a shower. . .In the novel Dagny's brother James is a villain who drives his wife Cherryl to suicide. The film does not reference her. Indeed James is portrayed as a nice guy over his head as chief he's bullied by his powerful sister his subordinate. Ergo Dagny and Hank are painted hedonistically their suffering victims being James and Lillian.John Galt in the novel is a man of mystery and integrity. On screen he becomes a shady figure in a ponzi scheme luring people with promises of higher profits derived from later investors.The film abruptly halts. Parts two and three depend upon ticket sales. On opening weekend I attended a nice theatre in a nice suburb with a tiny audience most of whom fell asleep. The online rave reviews came from book admirers desperately reading into the movie the countless pieces lacking. In the tome Dagny and Hank wouldn't hurry a project to finish on time they'd do it right or not at all. Whereas the movie makers failed to practice what they ineptly preached as they apparently rushed through this mess to meet a completion deadline.The novel's concluding chapter is entitled In The Name Of The Best Within Us. An authentic version of Atlas Shrugged could be filmed by someone who hasn't shrugged. Perchance kind reader how about you?".

The baddies are equally terrific Rand fans will find Lillian Rearden Rebecca Wisocky shockingly evil and same for Wesley Mouch Michael Lerner and Oren Boyle Jon Polito. Paul Larkin Patrick Fischler and Dr. Potter Armin Shimerman are even creepier than I imagined when reading the book. Matthew Marsden is the perfect James Taggart  and I expect he will really begin to show Taggart't true colors in the later parts when more is demanded of his character.The music is transporting. Given the complexity and scope of the novel and the fact that they only go up to Wyatt's Torch it is still tremendous. Anyone familiar with the book should enjoy it even if some scenes are rearranged shortened etc. I'm hoping that anyone not familiar with the book is inspired to read it.By the way just so you know that I'm serious we're seeing it again on the official opening April 15th.".

	schema:headline " Horrible Crap Movie Regardless of your Political Beliefs";
	schema:reviewBody "My wife and I couldn't get through 25 minutes of this movie. It was just a horrible and dull movie. If we wanted to be assaulted with political propaganda we would watch a documentary or the news. Unfortunately we wanted to be entertained and the bottom line is that this movie was not built to entertain it was built for propaganda just like the book that started the movement in the 50's. First off if you don't know the beliefs of Ayn Rand then you may want to read about it a bit and see for yourself if it makes sense to you. It's not my cup of tea but to each their own. Antireligion anti charity and progreed just seems like a polarizing and sad world to me.Secondly the movie is hard to watch because they haven't adapted it to film by updating the premise. It is about railroad companies in the future who are creating new types of metal that will change the industry and the government that wants to stop them. If you are going to create a scifi movie set in the near future at least come up with a reason their technology is inferior to today's technology and not just well that was how Ayn Rand depicted it in the 50's. Thirdly the acting was horrible. Perhaps it was just their dialog that was long and drawn out but it was so bad at a times that I thought a porn star was going to come out and turn the whole thing in to a cheesy porno. Lastly the movie isn't getting bad reviews because it is a good movie that just happens to have political views that differ from Hollywood's. It is getting horrible reviews because it is a poorly constructed movie that is almost unwatchable unless you go into watching the movie with one thing in mind Watching political propaganda that agrees with your vision of America.".

If we wanted to be assaulted with political propaganda we would watch a documentary or the news. Unfortunately we wanted to be entertained and the bottom line is that this movie was not built to entertain it was built for propaganda just like the book that started the movement in the 50's. First off if you don't know the beliefs of Ayn Rand then you may want to read about it a bit and see for yourself if it makes sense to you. It's not my cup of tea but to each their own. Antireligion anti charity and progreed just seems like a polarizing and sad world to me.Secondly the movie is hard to watch because they haven't adapted it to film by updating the premise. It is about railroad companies in the future who are creating new types of metal that will change the industry and the government that wants to stop them. If you are going to create a scifi movie set in the near future at least come up with a reason their technology is inferior to today's technology and not just well that was how Ayn Rand depicted it in the 50's. Thirdly the acting was horrible. Perhaps it was just their dialog that was long and drawn out but it was so bad at a times that I thought a porn star was going to come out and turn the whole thing in to a cheesy porno. Lastly the movie isn't getting bad reviews because it is a good movie that just happens to have political views that differ from Hollywood's. It is getting horrible reviews because it is a poorly constructed movie that is almost unwatchable unless you go into watching the movie with one thing in mind Watching political propaganda that agrees with your vision of America.";

It's not nice to tease the mentally challenged. Apparently the company that made the movie had less than 10 weeks because their rights to the novel were about to expire.

If you haven't read the book I recommend you read at least the first 500 pages or so and then watch the movie  it will mean a lot more.I would be interesting to see if Part 2 will be chapter 2 or if perhaps Part 1 was chapter 2 and parts 2 and 3 will be chapters 1 and 3. I say this because as has been said the movie covers roughly the middle third of the book and makes it very interesting.The actors and actresses played their parts very well especially Taylor Schilling as Dagny. The movie is fastpaced and it ended quicker than we expected sort of as Kill Bill 1  both movies leave you knowing that there is a lot more to the story. BTW I am not suggesting that there are any similarities between KB1 and AS1 at all other than there was more to follow.The story in the book appears to take place sometime through the 1940's through 60's  perhaps. The movie sets the time around 2016 so it implies that this could still happen. Unfortunately there are many parallels between the events in the story and today's events too many for my comfort. But that's just me.Also for railroad fans there are spectacular views of Taggart Transcontinental actually John Galt Line railroad at this pointpassenger train traveling at 250 mph through beautiful Colorado country side and over breathtaking bridges.".

The action moves at a brisk pace no long winded speeches or philosophizing. The SFX are pretty good for the time. As a side issue I got a chuckle when I saw Star Wars in 1977 I recognized the futuristic weapons as being models of British Lee Enfields German MG42 machine guns Heckler  Koch submachine guns.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film in 1960 playing with The Time Machine as a double feature. Though not as rich in story line as The Mysterians this film really takes off when the two Speep earthships go to the moon to battle a base set up by the planet Matal who also fly Mysterian style flying saucers.  On the moon the action really starts with marvelous raygun battles between the enemy and earth forces.  The earth forces possess a marvelous heat ray cannon as well as smaller but potent raygun rifles.  Later in the film the earth forces battle invading flying saucers and a mother ship with X15 styled fighter craft equipped with heat ray guns.  The finale with the mother ship's ray gun destroying Toyko is done quite well.For the time this film was made the special effects are quite good. Considering my nickname is raygun 3 this is a ten star IMDb vote scale film in that department.  I think the best scene in the film is on the moon where one of the crew stays behind with his ray rifle destroying flying saucers so the earth force can get away in their Speep spaceship.  This scene is one of the best piece of special effects I have scene in this type of movie.  A thought to remember is the film was made 17 to 18 years before Star Wars.  An outstanding accomplishment by Toho studios.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pintsize aliens from the planet Natal are bent on conquering the Earth in this colorful space opera from the heyday of Toho Studios. Second in a trilogy of spacethemed movies directed by the inimitable Ishiro Honda the other two being The Mysterians and Gorath this is pure mindless fun.The special effects may seem dated now but for the time they were firstrate much better than your average scifi and far superior to any of the monster films Toho cranked out from the mid60s onward. This was definitely not done on the cheap The sets are well thoughtout the astronomical backgrounds detailed and quite convincing.Eiji Tsuburaya's intricate miniature work is amazing as always. The voyage to the Moon the fight on the lunar surface and the final showdown with soupedup X15s squaring off against alien saucers and a huge mother ship are elaborately staged and exciting.Which is why it's easy to forgive the occasional cheesy bits. For instance when the beautiful SPIP rockets are taking off for the Moon Honda illustrates the effects of highG by having one of the crewmen put his hands on either side of his face and pull the flesh back. I also suspect they were running out of funds the film's only 74 minutes long when it came time to shoot the scene where the alien mother ship tears up downtown Tokyo with a gravityreversing ray. Although it's a clever effect apparently achieved by building the models on top of compressed air jets the sequence feels too short. Plus the miniatures just don't look quite as detailed or realistic when compared to other Toho films of the era.My biggest complaint In the one scene where you actually meet the aliens in the flesh sort of they're in spacesuits which make them look like midget Michelin Men and they sound like a bunch of squeaky dog toys. When a crowd of them menaces the heroine there's not a ray gun in the bunch all they can can do is shuffle wave their arms and squeak. Not very intimidating to say the least. If anything they're hilariously reminiscent of that roomful of sexcrazed Cub Scouts in Woody Allen's Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex. But the good far outweighs the notsogood in this romp. In a theater in its original Tohoscope Toho Studios' equivalent of Cinemascope it must have been something to see.Update In 2007 an outfit called Monsters in Motion released Uchu Daisenso on DVD  in letterbox in the original Japanese with English subtitles  as part of their Toho Masters series. With its companion piece Gorath available from MiM and Tokyo Shock's gorgeous edition of The Mysterians Honda's entire space trilogy is now obtainable in the original unedited widescreen versions.".

And in terms of the fantastic cinema of Japan this is one of the more serious science fiction creations of the period although containing many inaccuracies that would be glaring to anyone with the slightest familiarity to the work of George Pal. This film features creative and interesting FX that vastly outshine most of what the US was producing at this time and might even have the most complex miniature sets and sequences of anything produced by Toho during the classic period. There are large scale space ship dogfight sequences that anticipate Star Wars which was done 17 years later. The plot while not profound is sufficiently interesting and entertaining and the actors are good enough to make this an enjoyable escapist film. Thematically this is classic Invasion Literature with few new wrinkles thrown in...definitely straightforward Honda doesn't give us anything ambiguous or subversive to chew over.Any fan of oldschool scifi and Kaiju films is liable to enjoy this one very much it's just an impressive spectacle.".

	schema:headline " An enjoyable Japanese scifi alien invasion outing";
	schema:reviewBody "A race of nocount aliens plan on invading earth. They make their base of operations on the moon. An expedition of folks made up of people from all over the world embark on a mission to the moon in order to thwart the dastardly extraterrestrials. Director Ishiro Honda relates the absorbing story at a reasonably snappy pace maintains a serious tone throughout and stages the stirring action with riproaring gusto. While the opening third is a bit slow and dull the narrative fortunately picks up considerable steam and momentum once the mission is underway. The sequences on the moon are quite gripping and suspenseful. The spaceship dogfights are likewise very lively and exciting. Another memorable highlight occurs when the aliens destroy Tokyo. The cast give admirably sincere performances with an especially standout turn by Yoshiro Tsuchiya as a scientist who falls prey to the aliens' ability to control human minds. Akira Ifukube contributes a robust and rousing score. Hajime Koizuma's bright color cinematography makes breathtaking use of the widescreen format. The squeakyvoiced aliens are a total hoot. Best of all Eiji Tsuburaya's nifty and impressive special effects are truly something to behold with striking matte paintings and nice miniatures the opening scene with a train being wrecked rates as a particularly memorable moment. Moreover there's even a positive and uplifting central message about how the human race can be a mighty and unbeatable force by banding together against a common foe. A solid and satisfying item.".

	schema:headline " Pretty Good Effort From Honda";
	schema:reviewBody "This is Ishiro Hondas take on the classic space opera featuring alien invaders who have designs on Earth and will do anything to enslave mankind. This is a good but not great film. The only problem I have with it is that it tends to slow down during the scenes on Earth especially the conference scenes. However it picks up during the scenes on the moon and especially during the dogfight scenes featuring the rocket fighters battling the flying saucers. Also in terms of acting the best performance in this film definitely belongs to the great Yoshiyo Tsuchiya. Tsuchiya is excellent as the scientist who becomes possessed by the aliens but becomes a hero who sacrifices himself after he is released from the alien control. He definitely makes this film more watchable.Usually one Ishiro Honda's science fiction films use two distinct themes. The first one is using his films as thinly veiled commentaries on sociopolitical issues nuclear war greed or commercialism and the second is the world getting together for a common purpose. This film definitely follows the latter to a tee. This is definitely one where Honda uses his skill as a director to convey his wish that man would pull together for a common good instead of waiting until a major crisis to come together.All in all this was a good film but not a great one but I still recommend it.".

	schema:headline " In context this is actually a very good scifi film.";
	schema:reviewBody "In the 1950s and 60s quite a few Japanese scifi and horror films were sold to the US. Then the studios chopped the films apart and inserted American actors into some of the scenes to supposedly make them more acceptable to the public. Perhaps this was true but in all these cases you wish today that you could also see the original nonbastardized version as well. One of the most famous examples of this sort of film is the original Godzillawhere they added lots of footage of Raymond Burr saying and doing practically nothing of value! In fact his pointless performance was parodied very cleverly on Pinky  the Brain...with Burr's character saying ...yes....yes...I see... every time the camera cut to him! Battle in Outer Space was originally Uch Daisens but was sold to Columbia Pictures for American distribution and I assume too that changes were once again made for domestic distribution. Unlike many of these films it has been unavailable for viewing due to the film's decomposition the print turned red. Somehow they've either restored it or found a decent copy as recently it has finally been rereleased on DVD as well as on local On Demand viewingand I must say the glorious 1950s color is outstanding.The film begins with a UFO attack on an Earth space station orbiting our planet. Soon UFOs are seen all over the planet and naturally the governments of the Earth led by the Japanese are organizing to combat this. But the scourge is much worsealiens have also been kidnapping humans and implanting them with devices to control them! And when you think it can't get any worse the aliens set up a base on the Moonpresumptively to use for an eventual attack on the planet. All this occurs just in the first 20 minutes! Can the human race survive in an eventual battle in outer space?! If you compare this to other space films of the era Battle in Outer Space is actually quite exceptionaland is probably among the best. However with huge advances in technology since this film was made today it all comes off as very quaint. But don't dismiss it so quicklyas I said for its time it's very good. The action sequences especially those in space where you can't see all the wires! and effects are Japanese 1950s robot cool. The biggest weakness in the film is in its narrative and characterswhich are a tad bland.Thank goodness the Earth they had their flying weinermobiles! See the film and you'll know what I mean.".

And that particular movie didn't come to theaters in another 18 years! Though the special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya are good the plot in this movie was not inspiring and even boring at times especially the beginning scenes where the people blabber with one another on the planet invasion case and on the weapon inspections. The human characters weren't very remarkable. Jojiro Okami and Shinichi Sekizawa's story is interesting but the plot just wasn't intriguing.

We send a crew of astronauts to their planet to stop them and then get ready for the battle royal back here on Earth. Although early on in the film their is to much talking and discussing on how to stop them once the two ships leave for the planet then the film never ceases the action. But one thing that I think hurts the film is that the martians just don't leave a mark. We see them in one scene and they seem somewhat harmless. They are short with orange plastics suits and big helmets with lights on they're foreheads and have long noses! Not scary at all! So the rest of the film is just UFO's flying around.

	schema:headline " Imaginative space opera";
	schema:reviewBody "Decades before Star Wars 1977 or Independence Day 1996 Toho Studios brought a full blown space war to life in Battle in Outer Space. Scheming aliens from the planet Natal have set up a base on the moon from which they are attacking Earth. Their principal weapon is a freezing ray that lowers the temperature to absolute zero at which point the target is no longer subject to gravity a law of physics unique to the film. Several landmarks are destroyed by this device before Earth realises the danger and sends ships to the moon to attack the alien base leading to a climactic battle as the Natal mother ship attacks Earth cities with 'space torpedoes' and is attacked in turn by squadrons of our space fighters and land based atomic heat cannons. Fantastic stuff! By modern standards the models are quaint and the special effects primitive but overall the film is effective imaginative and entertaining. Similar to Toho's other space operas Gorath 1962 and The Mysterians 1957 the take home message is clear in the face of existential threats put aside political differences and cooperate or die. The miniatures especially the space hardware are great. The moon ships are very typical of the era's popular vision of future rocketry graceful and aerodynamic Earth's space fighters are modeled after NASA's X15 then the fastest plane in the skies and the alien saucers are sleek and menacing. The moon cars seem to be from a previous era and look a lot like something Frank Paul would design for the cover of a 1940's Amazing Stories. The scenes on the moon are very well done with stark and somber moonscapes that bring to mind the classic images of Chesley Bonestell. The film has some weak points such as the laboured 'humour' concerning one of the astronauts forgetting about reduced gravity in space and on the moon the usual disregard for the realities of motion and vacuums in space and in the English version I watched poor dubbing and some awkward insertion of 'western' characters presumably for the American market. Directed by Ishiro Honda with music by Akira Ifukube and special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya Battle in Outer Space is a great example of an early 1960's space adventure and showcases the talent behind the Toho Studio's classic Kaiju and tokusatsu films.".

	onyx:emotionText "Decades before Star Wars 1977 or Independence Day 1996 Toho Studios brought a full blown space war to life in Battle in Outer Space. Scheming aliens from the planet Natal have set up a base on the moon from which they are attacking Earth. Their principal weapon is a freezing ray that lowers the temperature to absolute zero at which point the target is no longer subject to gravity a law of physics unique to the film. Several landmarks are destroyed by this device before Earth realises the danger and sends ships to the moon to attack the alien base leading to a climactic battle as the Natal mother ship attacks Earth cities with 'space torpedoes' and is attacked in turn by squadrons of our space fighters and land based atomic heat cannons. Fantastic stuff! By modern standards the models are quaint and the special effects primitive but overall the film is effective imaginative and entertaining. Similar to Toho's other space operas Gorath 1962 and The Mysterians 1957 the take home message is clear in the face of existential threats put aside political differences and cooperate or die. The miniatures especially the space hardware are great.

As for me I find I like more the idea of enjoying these movies than I actually do. That's because I find a lot of them to be somewhat stiff and slow. But I admit that I found Battle in Outer Space somewhat more enjoyable than I expected. Most of the special effects aren't that bad for this period of science fiction motion picture cinema with some impressive model work sets and other futuristic depictions of the far off future of 1965  Even the shabbier special effects have a charm that you don't usually get with modern special effects. Also some of the action sequences are directed with a little punch to them generating some excitement.However most of this action takes place in the last third or so of the movie. Up to that point the movie suffers from that aforementioned problem of being stiff and slow though I admit it isn't as severe as some other examples of the genre. There are also a few plot points that are either very unclear or not clear at all. Though I see that the movie was slightly cut for American viewers which might explain these murky details. As I said if you are a fan of these movies you'll probably find Battle in Outer Space to be fun. If you are not a fan of the genre or are still dipping your toe in the genre to see if you'd like it you'd probably be better off watching something else.".

I have nothing to add to what Thompson has said other than to note that critics today would likely be even more favorable in retrospect  the film holds up well and displays a sense of fun and imagination rarely seen today.".

One fine moment occurs when one of our human characters risks their own life to ensure that the other heroes can make a clean getaway.The extremely prolific Japanese genre director Ishiro Honda gives the proceedings a decent amount of style.

	schema:reviewBody "In his debut feature film director Kike Maillo went out on a limb when he chose to make a film set in Spain in the notsodistant future about the moral dilemmas of artificial intelligence. Spanish scifi? Sounds risky but why not? We're getting a new robotthemed film each month now Chappie Big Hero 6 ExMachina Age of Ultron Elysium to name a few of the most recent. So why not a Spanish robot film for a change? The world Eva is set in is indeed intriguing. It is set in an idyllic alpine village so perfect it looks like we're peering inside a souvenir snow globe. People drive around in 1970's SAABs wear wool sweaters unwind in pubs with cozy fireplaces and go ice skating every afternoon. The only signs that you are in the future is that there are robots everywhere politely and discretely doing secretarial and house cleaning jobs. There are no drones no self driving cars and no robocops Spain should be optimistic of its future apparently. Robots are either doing menial labor or apparently have been geared towards emotional gratification and the companionship of their creators. Our protagonist Alex Daniel Brhl is a robotics software developer who is hired to go after the holy grail of robotics building a prototype of a robot child that is both realistic that is spontaneous as well as safe that is predictable. The strength of this film is to show reconciling these two is impossible and that the essence of being human is precisely that we cannot be both. The secret sauce that makes us human capable of spontaneity and charm turns out to be also what makes us irrational impetuous and dangerous. After masterfully setting up the premise of the film the actual execution of the plot starts to falter. The protagonist is supposed to be a genius cybernetic engineer but his character is mostly a drag and a bore to watch. You start wishing that his robot cat had more screen time. The story also hinges on a love triangle that feels contrived and inane. The robot butler is considerably more entertaining and I ended up wishing he somehow played a bigger part in the plot. The core of the story revolves around how Alex tries to model the emotional life of the android child on his niece fantastically played by Claudia Vega and it is these interactions that anchor the film and give it substance. The best scenes deal with the Turing tests that Bruno develops trying to tell apart real child from robot child. The last half hour of the film has some twists which ultimately make the entire film seem better than it felt it was while watching. Still it is not easy to forgive the director for wasting so much time on love triangle subplots and creating hollow characters. The film gets seven stars for its elegant cinematography and its smartly framed premise but doesn't break much new ground.".

Eva fascinates him and he soon begins research so that a robot can take on her personality but will her characteristics translate well into the robot world? Eva is a film that remains quiet. It knows its ideas and themes are fascinating and so it underplays them and lets your imagination run away with your own ideas. This is expressed best of all when we are first introduced to the world. There is no huge fanfare or showing off. The robots merely exist in the world with the humans. We first get a glimpse of this when Daniel Bruhl returns home and is followed by a robotic cat. The emotions that are present throughout are truly moving as it asks in typical robotman fashion what it is to be human and can science go too far? Bruhl is a wonderful lead who clearly gets across his fascination with robots but also his frustration with them. He really does fail to make the most of his gift but maybe that is for the best. The cinematography is gorgeous with Eva's red coat constantly standing out from the snow swept landscapes. An enjoyable and thought provoking drama.".

	schema:headline " Little Girl Lost....";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS WARNING! MANY SPOILERSI only have few complaints about EVA which was very good but could have been great.1 Unless I missed it all you have to say is What do you see when you close your eyes? and the robots soul is destroyed? Since there is a GODCREATORFRANKENSTEIN theme maybe only the creators could kill their own creation rather than anyone on a whim saying the magic words... I didn't see this explained in the film?2 The relationship between Alex and Eva is crucial to the film..and very complex. At first it seemed like a innocent romantic infatuation similar to Pierre and FranoiseCyble in Sundays and Cybele 1962 but EVA the movie is way too short to develop the budding relationship and give it true life. The depth of Alex and Eva's bond is what makes the movie or could have.However rather than 10 year old Eva being a muse to an older man we find out spoilers that being a combination of Alex and Lana Eva is more a daughter than niece to a distant uncle.3 I don't think despite her guilt that Eva meant to hurtkill Lana. It was totally unlike the robot prototype in the lab which had a murderous meltdown and needed to be terminated. Eva was just acting human and it was precisely the FREE WILL given to her by Alex and Lana that caused her to react to the mind shattering implications that SHE was not human. Eva was just pushing her mother away in anger but not with murderous intent. Her inaction on the mountain top was more of shock and impotence being a little girl. She could not have pulled her mother up even if she wanted to. This was not an evil deed that need her death More frustrating is the father's Alex's inability to ask Eva what actually happened and realize that she was not an out of control machine needing termination.This leads into the more profound themes of the film.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS WARNING! MANY SPOILERSI only have few complaints about EVA which was very good but could have been great.1 Unless I missed it all you have to say is What do you see when you close your eyes? and the robots soul is destroyed? Since there is a GODCREATORFRANKENSTEIN theme maybe only the creators could kill their own creation rather than anyone on a whim saying the magic words... I didn't see this explained in the film?2 The relationship between Alex and Eva is crucial to the film..and very complex. At first it seemed like a innocent romantic infatuation similar to Pierre and FranoiseCyble in Sundays and Cybele 1962 but EVA the movie is way too short to develop the budding relationship and give it true life. The depth of Alex and Eva's bond is what makes the movie or could have.However rather than 10 year old Eva being a muse to an older man we find out spoilers that being a combination of Alex and Lana Eva is more a daughter than niece to a distant uncle.3 I don't think despite her guilt that Eva meant to hurtkill Lana. It was totally unlike the robot prototype in the lab which had a murderous meltdown and needed to be terminated. Eva was just acting human and it was precisely the FREE WILL given to her by Alex and Lana that caused her to react to the mind shattering implications that SHE was not human. Eva was just pushing her mother away in anger but not with murderous intent. Her inaction on the mountain top was more of shock and impotence being a little girl. She could not have pulled her mother up even if she wanted to. This was not an evil deed that need her death More frustrating is the father's Alex's inability to ask Eva what actually happened and realize that she was not an out of control machine needing termination.This leads into the more profound themes of the film. As robots evolve to where they are indistinguishable from humans shouldn't the protections of human justice prevail? Shouldn't Eva have had atrial or some therapy like a real child?

It seemed like the first few minutes of the movie told too much of what's coming ahead but maybe the filmmaker met to do that cause the whole expression of a man of science being so emotionally connected was very strong.The movie spent a lot of time inventing and programming the robot which I loved. It's the good thing the special effects were decent cause that could have ruin this part of the film. Another fantastic Scifi movie from Spain backing up the Antonio Banderas movie on robots Automata and another great robot movie this year which includes Chappie among them.Eva is a beautiful story well told through cinema.

Set in the future when robots are fairly common filmed mostly in the mountains of Switzerland in the winter a snowy village in a valley surrounded by mountains. The language is Spanish with English subtitles.I really like this movie it is about family and friends more than about robots. But the lead billing goes to Daniel Brhl as Alex Garel a very creative robot designer who left a project unfinished some 10 years earlier. Now he has returned to the town and to the institute finding his former girlfriend married to his brother but he has not lost his feelings for her.The couple has a child young Spanish actress Claudia Vega as Eva. The title of the movie is Eva so we know it will be about her. Alex first encounters her when he is looking for a bright curious child to model his new project after to give this new robot a mind that is interesting. So he asks Eva to help him even before he finds out whose child she is.Yes the robots are fun to watch even the robotic cat that follows Alex everywhere. But the story is really about relationships and Alex coming to grips with some issues left undone.SPOILERS FOLLOW As the story moves forward I began to suspect that Eva was really Alex's child she looked more like him and had his curiosity. But the bigger surprise is about 20 minutes from the end when Eva falls nonresponsive in the snow as her mother is looking for her. She is actually a robot the project his girlfriend finished after Alex left. Mom revives her with a new power cell but when Eva discovers she really is a robot she pushes her mom who then slides down and falls maybe 100 feet into the snow below. She dies in the hospital Alex is left to care for Eva and decides she cannot continue on so he says the code for all robots What do you see when you close your eyes? and she falls nonresponsive.".

Set in the future when robots are fairly common filmed mostly in the mountains of Switzerland in the winter a snowy village in a valley surrounded by mountains. The language is Spanish with English subtitles.I really like this movie it is about family and friends more than about robots. But the lead billing goes to Daniel Brhl as Alex Garel a very creative robot designer who left a project unfinished some 10 years earlier. Now he has returned to the town and to the institute finding his former girlfriend married to his brother but he has not lost his feelings for her.The couple has a child young Spanish actress Claudia Vega as Eva.

Yet I liked the visual and I wanted to see a nonHollywood film so I gave it a try. Boy was this a painful experience.First of all we learn nothing about the characters from the beginning or even in what year the film's taking place. If I don't know who the characters are and there are not even hints about their relations why should I be invested? Why should I care? Imagine you walk into a store and a cashier looks at you for 20 seconds. Is that supposed to mean something? Should I care? No because it's not someone you met before. The moment you turn around that cashier will be forgotten. And that's just what is going on in this film. From the very beginning there's nothing but long shots of people looking at each other. It might mean something to the characters and it probably does but that means nothing to the viewers watching the film. There is a scene where the main character is looking at a woman for 20 or 30 seconds. We don't know who she is what their history is and their relationship. We don't even know whether there is one. By the time I learnt anything about the characters I was not interested anymore.Then there are long exterior shots. Do we really need to see someone drive a long way on an icy road parking their car turning off the engine getting out of the car locking the door and walking to a building? All that in about 3 minutes of time? What is it supposed to accomplish? Or long shots of the town the film is taking place in? OK it's nice and covered in snow. What else did you need to say about it that you repeated the shot several times? I won't spoil the big twist but if you've ever seen a film regarding creation of androids you'll know it by the time the trailer finishes.The acting is OK but the main male lead is just dull and irritatingly boring. I couldn't stand him. The rest of the cast do their jobs well but they are basically forgettable. And yes that includes the character of Eva.I couldn't wait for the film to end. It's tedious painfully slow and unoriginal. It's got pretty visuals but that's about it.I respect independent filmmakers for their efforts and not so rarely they succeed. But this film just felt like a Hollywood production that's trying to pretend it's artsy by having long slow camera movements. A bit faster pace would have helped this time.".

Unfortunately it's only a 12 minute long film however so don't get your hopes set too high.This is one of director Eric Rohmer's first filmsa short that appears more like an experiment than a commercial product. And as a New Wave film it's allowed to defy typical conventions like a plot. When the film begins the narrator Godard explains what is happening and what has happenedas if he's explaining what had occurred on the first reel as if it was lost. It's odd...but again it's New Wave.Much of the film consists of Godard and a lady standing around her apartment. She cooks for him he wants to kiss and she just sits down to eat. Exciting stuff huh? Well no...it's notit's exceptionally talky and dull. But it did help Rohmer and Godard to perfect their craft so it's a film that their fans would adoredespite being very low energy. As I am not a huge fan of either however I found it all pretty mundanelike watching a student film would normally be or like watching paint dry.As this is an experimental and noncommercial film I am declining to give this one a numerical rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "A little credit is due I guess Dennis Hopper made it huge with Easy Rider took his momentary carte blanche and made for all intents and purposes a movie he wanted to make. No holds barred is putting it lightly. It's like Hopper stumbled over the bars while on acid and just let the natives come around and stomp on it till the term 'hold' was soaked in alcohol and set on fire. It's cinematic anarchy that reigns with a sword of originality and hubris and it's always coming right from Hopper's soul. The Last Movie this said is not a very 'good' movie. I'm not even sure it's anything of value. But it's surely one of those mustsee personal movies all the same. For any film buff it's simply stunning  and I don't mean that fully as a compliment.In a way I feel sorry for this production. Hopper did have a script somewhere and even had a writer with him as well Stewart Stern and the opening 25 minutes of the film is fractured but feels contained in its metamovieness. It seems actually clear enough to follow a film crew is in Peru filming a movie a western directed by none other than Samuel Fuller and there's lots of intensity on the set and at other times weird vibrations in the offhours. Hopper is a stuntman who works on the production but once it ends he sticks around and sees the Peruvians reenacting the film that has just been made only with equipment made of sticks and stones and other things. So far so good more or less and again Samuel Fuller directing a movie in a movie! It can't get much cooler than this can it? As it turns out there is even more story and scenes that make sense such as the romance or lack thereof between Hopper's Kansas cowboy and a Peruvian woman Maria. These scenes along with the rough seduction of Kansas to another woman who happens to wear a mink coat rang true past the weird intentions of the filmmaking and into the personal for sure. Hopper in real life shouldn't matter in the course of the movie itself but it is so selfreflexive on the end of making the metamovie that it spills over into his real life with women when you see it you'll understand. That plus an allegorical storyline involving a foolish and failed attempt to go gold mining seem to at least add emotional grounding for chunks of the picture.And then other times... it's just drivel repetitive movements and rhythms and sudden things like Scene Missing cards. The problem that Hopper didn't see while editing not while hopped up no pun intended on enough drugs to run a megapharmacy on the moon is that the metamovie qualities and his flourishes and mad jump cuts and time reversals and nonlinearness don't always serve in favor of the actual story. There are certain moments and scenes that stand out wonderfully and are even filmed and edited with scary precision and capturing the beauty of Peru oh and the opening gunfight as part of the movieinmovie is amazing. Other times it's just tricks and things devices and obstacles that just add dead weight to the running time. It's non denying it's art but is it always interesting? No. Sometimes it just sticks out way too much as being important art forced when at other times it could be natural and fitting for the already strange premise.It's basically this a very talented filmmaker and for all of his ups and downs in his career more downs than ups not least of which the stigma that followed Hopper after he made this movie and didn't direct another for nine years and an unlikely and electrifying actor got loaded with all of the praise that someone like him didn't need already cooking with loads of freeloader friends sticking too many hands in the creative pot and in the end got in the way of himself. A lot of The Last Movie burns with raw energy and crude dramatic thrills. And the rest of the time it just looks like it needed an editor ONE editor that was sober to go along with the one other sober cadet on the production the lategreat Laszlo Kovacs as DoP. Alejandro Jodorowsky might be a kind of genius but an editor for someone else's project he definitely isn't.So should you see it? If it's available it's hard to find and you're willing maybe do a coin toss and you aren't expecting a John Ford movie please don't give it a shot. It's not an easy movie to defend and I probably can't on a reasonable level. But as a personal statement of an artist on the edge you could do worse i.e. Southland Tales the only thing that comes closest in ambition and faulty technique.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely does an opportunity come like this. I would like to encourage you to share it.First you should know that I am not representing this as a good movie. At the same time I am putting it on my list of films you must see.How can this be?This thing fails to engage emotionally. It is unlike say Blue Velvet which had both a visceral connection and an ephemerally complex narrative. Each reinforces the other way past the horizons we can see and understand and you end up with a life altering experience. Most of the films on my must see list are like this.But this is different and the missing factor is The Other Side of the Wind. That movie is Orson Welles' last project what he considered his greatest reach and most perfectly conceived.

At the same time I am putting it on my list of films you must see.How can this be?This thing fails to engage emotionally. It is unlike say Blue Velvet which had both a visceral connection and an ephemerally complex narrative. Each reinforces the other way past the horizons we can see and understand and you end up with a life altering experience. Most of the films on my must see list are like this.But this is different and the missing factor is The Other Side of the Wind.

This is one title that begs to be recut. I would suggest a DVD with the original cut on one side and a new directors cut on the other. It would be fascinating to hear Hopper's audio commentary for further insights into where his mind was at the time if he is capable of remembering that is.

SPOILERS AHEADWe are led to believe that Kansas will be literally crucified by the villagers as a literal Christ figure and then that plot line disappears completely. There are a couple of sequences that indicate Hopper might want viewers to see Kansas as the bad guy rather than the hero but these are so underdeveloped as once again to go nowhere. The actual ending of the movie is so vague to put it mildly we're not even sure if Kansas is supposed to have been killed. The next to last scene shows Hopper arguing with a couple of actors as all three pass a bottle of booze back and forth between them. The two drunken actors laugh at Hopper when he tries to get them to finish the movie. Then follows the anticlimactic ending in which Kansas is seen staggering down a road and falls presumably dead presumably having been shot by some unseen assassin. Then the words  the end appear looking like they've been written on the film with a felt tip pen. And that's it. How Hopper persuaded the studio to release this thing I'll never know but the sheer gall of a filmmaker to expect an audience to pay cash to see a movie with numerous intertitles stating  scene missing is beyond belief. My biggest criticism is that potentially there's an interesting story here that could have been made by competent filmmakers into a small but worthwhile film. There's the germ of a real movie lurking somewhere amongst all the wasted celluloid and ludicrous noncharacters and pointless dialogue. The fact that Hopper overcame his drug and alcohol problems and is now acclaimed as a genuine filmmaker with some real movies to his credit as well as some good acting in other people's movies is something for him to be proud of but this movie is not.

	schema:headline " An incoherent mess....";
	schema:reviewBody "The Last movie appears to be rough footage strung togetherpossibly from several different incomplete films. The first portion just starts on the set of a Sam Fuller film and is very rough. Then abruptly this ends and one of the film crew Dennis Hopper stays behind in Peru and the rest of the film are his VERY random adventures. Some of the lovely things that occur to him or around him include the locals making a 'movie' using fake equipment and real violence some rich Americans showing up and acting like obnoxious capitalist swine as they pay local women to have sex with each other as they watch Hopper's prostitute girlfriend demanding a refrigerator and many other things even though they have no electricity Hopper beating up this prostitute for no apparent reason Hopper's friend Don Gordon talking on and on and on about his gold mine and several other irrelevant plot elementsnone of which make up a coherent whole.The only reason I saw this film is that I have a crazy quest to see all of the films from the Harry Medved book The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time and this is one of the last five I have yet to see. In some cases the films in the book were laughably badsuch as Robot Monster or Santa Claus Versus the Martians. And others such as this film are just plain badand not in a fun or enjoyable way. And yet like some of these truly terrible films some people find great significance and meaning in the film. I read through the reviews for The Last Movie and it sounded like a Fellini or Truffaut filmfull of brilliance and insight. All I saw was a lot of very rough and poorly filmed footage strung together rather incoherently because the people making the film were reported very stoned throughout the productionwhich is very very easy to believe. Instead of a film this is more like bits and pieces of many films thrown together rather randomlyand in the process some actors embarrassed themselvessuch as Gordon and Julia Adams of The Creature From the Black Lagoon fame.The film is an incoherent messrandomly edited with long and pointless musical interludes that were intended as deep and meaningful completely amateur acting throughout and no discernible script.

	onyx:emotionText "The Last movie appears to be rough footage strung togetherpossibly from several different incomplete films. The first portion just starts on the set of a Sam Fuller film and is very rough. Then abruptly this ends and one of the film crew Dennis Hopper stays behind in Peru and the rest of the film are his VERY random adventures. Some of the lovely things that occur to him or around him include the locals making a 'movie' using fake equipment and real violence some rich Americans showing up and acting like obnoxious capitalist swine as they pay local women to have sex with each other as they watch Hopper's prostitute girlfriend demanding a refrigerator and many other things even though they have no electricity Hopper beating up this prostitute for no apparent reason Hopper's friend Don Gordon talking on and on and on about his gold mine and several other irrelevant plot elementsnone of which make up a coherent whole.The only reason I saw this film is that I have a crazy quest to see all of the films from the Harry Medved book The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time and this is one of the last five I have yet to see. In some cases the films in the book were laughably badsuch as Robot Monster or Santa Claus Versus the Martians. And others such as this film are just plain badand not in a fun or enjoyable way. And yet like some of these truly terrible films some people find great significance and meaning in the film. I read through the reviews for The Last Movie and it sounded like a Fellini or Truffaut filmfull of brilliance and insight. All I saw was a lot of very rough and poorly filmed footage strung together rather incoherently because the people making the film were reported very stoned throughout the productionwhich is very very easy to believe. Instead of a film this is more like bits and pieces of many films thrown together rather randomlyand in the process some actors embarrassed themselvessuch as Gordon and Julia Adams of The Creature From the Black Lagoon fame.The film is an incoherent messrandomly edited with long and pointless musical interludes that were intended as deep and meaningful completely amateur acting throughout and no discernible script. A few of the many plot elements COULD have been the basis for a good moviesuch as the idea of Hollywood or American consumerism destroying a native culture.

This is a challenging film to a viewer of any sort but is a fascinating piece of art nonetheless.The only thing I have to add is a reaction to some other commenters. Anyone suggesting that this film should have been edited into chronological order or not have jump cuts or the Scene Missing title cards is clearly missing the point. One of the major themes of the film is the artifice of Hollywood filmmaking and having those illusions disrupted is key to the film's impact.

Hopper plays Kansas a stuntman working on a western in Peru who decides to stay on after the movies crew departs. He hooks up with local whore Stella Garcia meets up with crusading priest Tomas Milian and attempts to help his friend find a gold mine. There's no real narrative but plenty of beautiful imagery thanks to cinematographer Lszl Kovcs and some early 70s ballads on the soundtrack.

	schema:reviewBody "I was originally attracted to The Last Movie as Easy Rider is one of my favorite films. Since I saw that director Dennis Hopper after Easy Rider collaborated again with Laszlo Kovacs and other cast and crew members I had wanted to see The Last Movie for a long time.Well it is certainly very different from Easy Rider in many respect though the cinematography and editing are very similar. Personally I love all the experimental edits the switches between an almost documentary look and stylized beautifully composed shots. Scenes are edited precisely to sound effects and music and the cinematography has a beautiful playful and unconventional feel to it. One example that stuck in my head is the moment that Kansas is first introduced riding on his horse. We start in a closeup then the camera zooms out and pans to reveal him riding away into the distance  but unlike most films it does not stay in that framing. Instead without cutting it suddenly pans down across some flowers until we cut to the next shot.The story and narrative style are entirely different from Easy Rider and the film needs multiple viewings to be fully grasped. To be honest after the first viewing I did not really like The Last Movie but it stuck with me because I kept thinking about it and eventually watched it two additional times within a few weeks. Each time I noticed sometimes important details that can not be understood at the first viewing. And after each successive viewing I liked it more. In a way The Last Movie reminds me rather of a piece of almost abstract art than of a classic film which would be about a storyline that can be summarized easily The Last Movie is constructed like a puzzle revealing many thoughts and ideas only after the audience is thinking about them for a while. I suspect that might be one of the reason for some of the bad reviews it got People judging it expecting a regular film with a more or less classic storyline and emotional attachments to characters instead of a rather abstract work. In an interview shortly after the NY premiere Dennis Hopper himself suggested it might be best to watch the film 23 times to fully grasp it. When I first heard the interview I had thought it might be a pretentious thing to say but after watching the film I do agree.The structure of The Last Movie deconstructs classic cinematic narrative approaches. A lot of details are presented almost in passing easy to miss during the first viewing. For example when a stuntman falls from a horse in the Western being shot we can see an extra being worried that he is really dying seemingly not understanding that it is acted. Upon second viewing I noticed that the extra later in the storyline actually becomes the director of the Peruvian villagers. But even during my first viewing I found the opening 20 minutes brilliantly executed. I feel it is best to enter the film without knowing the storyline first because then the opening is especially innovative and enigmatic. We start with Kansas Dennis Hopper with the Peruvian villagers in the movie sets then cut to a Western in the 1860s which might appear like a flashback into the past when one first watches without knowing the storyline  then to Kansas on a horse and during a party and after a while suddenly in a magnificent shot it is revealed that the Western is actually a film that is filmed in the storyline and all is tied up.I do find the film's strength in its opening and ending  particularly the ending brilliantly deconstructs any sort of narrative structure. It starts once Kansas suddenly  almost embarrassed  reveals in a dramatic moment that he has no wound make up covering a spot where he had been shot earlier that now features no traces. From then on it becomes an almost abstract work showing outtakes people getting in and out of character which I found beautifully executed. My favorite moment is actually right towards the ending when we suddenly see the camera filming the burning villagers' camera. There we can see how Laszlo Kovacs adjusts the framing looks for a good spot  all the material between good shots that would normally end up on the cutting room floor is suddenly inserted giving us a subtle but unexpected glimpse into the filmmaking process. As I myself often edit film it was very interesting to suddenly see such a moment included. The middle part of the film is where I feel it loses focus partially. The film appears to be not about relating or emotionally connecting with characters but about the more abstract ideas behind its construction appealing almost entirely to the audiences' intellect rather than emotions. Therefore hardly any characters are explored in depth and even emotional scenes like Kansas running with his girlfriend to a beautiful soundtrack after the Western wrapped do not really allow any lasting emotional impact. When Kansas decides to stay back in Peru the viewer at first can sympathize with him and his love story with a local prostitute appears touching in a few beautiful moments. But in the course of the film him and the people around him appear more and more flawed and unlikable which culminates in him beating his girlfriend and trying to make up by getting an expensive coat for her. The way the characters in the middle of the film are constructed I felt might be a deliberate attempt to distance the viewers emotionally from the them thus preventing viewers from getting lost in the storyline which would be a kind of almost Brechtian approach that is also supported by the fragmented narrative though the middle has a more conventional narrative flow than beginning and end. I personally prefer the approach of Easy Rider which mixed more thoughtful abstract moments with more emotionally relatable ones the farmer the commune George Hansen etc.. There were no parts in The Last Movie that gave me the sort of emotional positive relief that the mentioned scenescharacters gave me in Easy Rider. The closest equivalent to a likable character in The Last Movie were intially Kansas until the middle and maybe the priest who  in the beginning  appeared to be a voice of reason in chaos and tries to prevent violence. But  as all characters  he is also not really explored and during the ending his character too becomes very different as slowly the narrative structure is deliberately eroded creating an emotional distance between viewer and that character too.All in all I find that The Last Movie is a film with many subtexts and thoughts. Putting its focus on a rather intellectual approach makes it less accessible than Easy Rider but very interesting nontheless. Its very experimental approach certainly was unexpected to many viewers and I personally also prefer Easy Rider  but respect Dennis Hopper's work in The Last Movie as the work of an artist with a strong unconventional vision for this particular film making it more of an abstract arthouse film with a European vibe. I am quite sad that Dennis Hopper didn't do more films right afterwards with the same crew  I like his visual style of the period and believe him to be a very talented director  the competence with which he handles scenes of many styles like the incredibly staged and filmed Western shootouts demonstrate his abilities to direct scenes of various genres and it would have been interesting had he done more emotionally relatable mainstream compatible films right afterwards. I watched a murky VHS copy and really hope that the film will be reissued soon on BluRay or DVD  I would certainly buy it as I feel there might be more things hidden in the images that are necessary to decode more of the storyline.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was originally attracted to The Last Movie as Easy Rider is one of my favorite films. Since I saw that director Dennis Hopper after Easy Rider collaborated again with Laszlo Kovacs and other cast and crew members I had wanted to see The Last Movie for a long time.Well it is certainly very different from Easy Rider in many respect though the cinematography and editing are very similar. Personally I love all the experimental edits the switches between an almost documentary look and stylized beautifully composed shots. Scenes are edited precisely to sound effects and music and the cinematography has a beautiful playful and unconventional feel to it. One example that stuck in my head is the moment that Kansas is first introduced riding on his horse. We start in a closeup then the camera zooms out and pans to reveal him riding away into the distance  but unlike most films it does not stay in that framing. Instead without cutting it suddenly pans down across some flowers until we cut to the next shot.The story and narrative style are entirely different from Easy Rider and the film needs multiple viewings to be fully grasped. To be honest after the first viewing I did not really like The Last Movie but it stuck with me because I kept thinking about it and eventually watched it two additional times within a few weeks. Each time I noticed sometimes important details that can not be understood at the first viewing. And after each successive viewing I liked it more.

Like Berlin Vienna was divided into fourths American French Russian and British. The picture captures the tension between the four powers as well as the desperation of the Viennese trying to get on with their lives and serve four masters at the same time.There are some heartbreaking scenes at the train station as relatives wait for their returning sons and husbands recently released POWs  some are waiting in vain but don't know it until the train arrives. There are also stark scenes of wrecked and ruined buildings that were bombed during the war but are nevertheless occupied by hardup tenants.In the midst of this destruction Viveca Lindfors waits for her husband uncertain whether he will be released. American MP Ralph Meeker takes an interest in her predicament but mostly in her. Meeker is the nominal star but the acting honors go to Ms. Lindfors who acts circles around Meeker who was in only his second picture. All other actors are very competent but are nonames.This is an excellent movie and holds interest throughout. Like Decision Before Dawn which came out the same year there is an aura of realism about it which war pictures made during the war did not duplicate and gives it a little more bite. My copy was poorly done with uneven clarity and a sometimes garbled soundtrack. The website says it is coming out on DVD in Oct.'10. It is worth whatever it costs as it is a cut above many pictures war or otherwise.".

	schema:headline " Overblown and Boring";
	schema:reviewBody "This Yugoslav epic is loud boisterous but surprisingly incredibly boring and flat. Even a few great actors can't make this story rise above average.In 1914 Serbian terrorists head to Sarajevo. Their goal intercept Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand Christopher Plummer and assassinate him hopefully provoking a national uprising against the longtime Austrian menace.Christopher Plummer The Royal Hunt of the Sun and Maximilian Schell The Young Lions are both fine actors  Schell is almost always brilliant in offthewall performances and Plummer has carried a number of excellent dramas. Here the two men seem to be sleepwalking through their roles. As Ferdinand Plummer is both uninteresting and unengaging. There is nothing particularly bad about his performance he is just weak and shallow.Schell fares only slightly better in a more limited role as a Serb who provides training and arms to the terrorists. His interrogation is especially good until the rather hammy conclusion. The young Yugoslav actors try very hard this was the first big international film for all of them. Unfortunately the script doesn't allow them to dig very deep into their hearts for any real emotion. They're committed to their cause but the audience doesn't really know why  therefore we can never really relate and end up feeling completely detached from the on screen action.Veteran director Bulajic handles the production very well. His camera is always on the move and the fastpaced editing during the climax is excellent. The last 10 minutes or so of the film are particularly nailbiting and engaging ending with a bittersweet climax and rather mournful score. Again though the dramatic effect of these scenes is seriously hampered by a lack of character development.This is a historically accurate film make no mistake about that. In trying to recreate the details so faithfully however the producers did not take any creative liberty with the story. There wasn't anything particularly interesting or suspenseful about the events leading up to Ferdinand's assassination and there is not much suspense or engagement in the film either. A few encounters with the police or military authorities are resolved quickly with expected results. Plummer's stronger moments  including a great opening scene and later a discussion of an invasion of Serbia  fade into the background because they are never developed. Every scene in this film stands alone while there is a continuous narrative there is no strong uniting theme or ideal behind the storyline. This is simply a noholdsbarred look at history and the result is a tedious sequence of flat scenes.The Day that Shook the World is a wellmeaning movie that gets so caught up in selfimportance that it fails to engage the audience in its story.

	onyx:emotionText "This Yugoslav epic is loud boisterous but surprisingly incredibly boring and flat. Even a few great actors can't make this story rise above average.In 1914 Serbian terrorists head to Sarajevo. Their goal intercept Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand Christopher Plummer and assassinate him hopefully provoking a national uprising against the longtime Austrian menace.Christopher Plummer The Royal Hunt of the Sun and Maximilian Schell The Young Lions are both fine actors  Schell is almost always brilliant in offthewall performances and Plummer has carried a number of excellent dramas. Here the two men seem to be sleepwalking through their roles. As Ferdinand Plummer is both uninteresting and unengaging. There is nothing particularly bad about his performance he is just weak and shallow.Schell fares only slightly better in a more limited role as a Serb who provides training and arms to the terrorists. His interrogation is especially good until the rather hammy conclusion. The young Yugoslav actors try very hard this was the first big international film for all of them. Unfortunately the script doesn't allow them to dig very deep into their hearts for any real emotion. They're committed to their cause but the audience doesn't really know why  therefore we can never really relate and end up feeling completely detached from the on screen action.Veteran director Bulajic handles the production very well. His camera is always on the move and the fastpaced editing during the climax is excellent. The last 10 minutes or so of the film are particularly nailbiting and engaging ending with a bittersweet climax and rather mournful score. Again though the dramatic effect of these scenes is seriously hampered by a lack of character development.This is a historically accurate film make no mistake about that. In trying to recreate the details so faithfully however the producers did not take any creative liberty with the story. There wasn't anything particularly interesting or suspenseful about the events leading up to Ferdinand's assassination and there is not much suspense or engagement in the film either. A few encounters with the police or military authorities are resolved quickly with expected results. Plummer's stronger moments  including a great opening scene and later a discussion of an invasion of Serbia  fade into the background because they are never developed. Every scene in this film stands alone while there is a continuous narrative there is no strong uniting theme or ideal behind the storyline. This is simply a noholdsbarred look at history and the result is a tedious sequence of flat scenes.The Day that Shook the World is a wellmeaning movie that gets so caught up in selfimportance that it fails to engage the audience in its story. High production values and a cast of stars do not guarantee success if the script is a weak failure. This is enjoyable only for history buffs or perhaps for an audience with a connection to the events. I can understand why foreign audiences may not enjoy patriotic American films I cannot enjoy a patriotic foreign film if the themes do not apply to me in some way and that is what this movie is  and inapplicable piece of nostalgia.";

Honestly it's hysterically funny how hammy the acting is.And the dubbing is really bad even though it looks like it was shot in English to begin with.The only scenes of merit are the limited battle sequences. The rest is stupid and obvious with overwrought faces and an annoying supporting conspirator in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand who bounces from playboy to patriot at the drop of a hat. It takes him three minutes to make the obvious pun that he has a date with destiny. Whatever watch this film some time if you want a good laugh.".

The story of Susana Rosita Quintana  a sexy fame fatal a walking temptation is known as a lesser Bunuel and the film critics and the viewers often seem to apologize for liking the film motivating that it lacks Bunuel's trademark surrealism. Bunuel was good in everything he ever done even in perfectly routine pictures and Susana has his touches all over. First of all the music fits the story very well with its sensual creepiness. Bunuel's cinematography is masterful. The opening scene in the solitary reformatory cell is appropriately dark devastating but in general  ironic when Susana is able to escape after praying to God and asking Him for help. One of the night scenes shot from three angles when three men watch the object of their desire thru the window is a work of art. The eponymous heroine of the film is a bad girl a sensuous troublemaker who ruins the established order of one family's life simply by being there but pay attention how much in love is the camera with her. She is a walking temptation which is hard to resist. Susana has no regrets no scruples regarding her goals and the ways to reach them but the truth of the matter is that she is young beautiful and irresistibly desirable for every male she simply passes by. The final sequence of the movie is a pure Bunuel and it is sarcastic in his best traditions. The storm has passed everyone seems happy in Don Guadalupe's household after Susana was returned to prison by force even Don Guadalupe's favorite Arabian mare recovered after serious illness . Everyone praises the Lord and ready to forget that Susana ever happened in their lives and to move on.

	schema:reviewBody "Susana is a fallen girl. At the beginning we see her in a reformatory but the reasons that brought her there remain in the dark. We just find out that she has learned nothing new in the two years she has spent there and that she behaves in the same unruly and rebellious way like when she was first admitted to the place.She is brought into a dark and sinister cave which is teeming with rats and spiders. We know nothing about the reasons for this punishment and we can't avoid feeling sorry for her Whatever she might have done it does not justify an inhuman treatment such as this.Susana is religious and the god she calls on is kind and generous. So the miracle happens the bars of the prison cell at which she is rattling suddenly give way and she succeeds in escaping into a night full of darkness and relentless rain.She even can make it into paradise A landowner's family takes her in after she has told them a pack of lies. She is allowed to work as a maid and gains the confidence and the affection of the mother while the father at first has a disapproving attitude towards her.But the family's son and the steward live on the estate too and they don't fail to notice Susana's outstanding physical attraction. As the girl also knows how to place her charms they both fall victim to her.Susana however does not seem capable of developing any true feelings. Life is just a villainous game for her in which the rules are set by herself. The aim is to destroy the well established order. When finally even the landowner succumbs to the lure of love the initial situation becomes reversed and nothing stays the same the mother turns into an enraged enemy while father and son become rivals and the steward is dismissed.It is then the latter who sets the decisive ball rolling which leads once more to a reversal of the circumstances He finally makes use of his knowledge of Susana's escape from the reformatory which up to now he kept to himself in order to increase his chances of winning Susana's favor and Susana however fiercely she may be defending herself cannot avoid being arrested.The game is lost and as it often happens in a melodrama it is the refused lover who makes it break down. In the end the episode with Susana means nothing more than the memory of a nightmare for the landowner's family. And after the reestablishment of the initial situation the characters cannot help asking themselves if everything has really happened.The attentive spectator will come to a different conclusion. He will notice the fundamental fragility of an order that is well established only in appearance. And he will not be able to avoid drawing a frightful parallel to his own life in which nothing is secure and reliable either.".

So the miracle happens the bars of the prison cell at which she is rattling suddenly give way and she succeeds in escaping into a night full of darkness and relentless rain.She even can make it into paradise A landowner's family takes her in after she has told them a pack of lies. She is allowed to work as a maid and gains the confidence and the affection of the mother while the father at first has a disapproving attitude towards her.But the family's son and the steward live on the estate too and they don't fail to notice Susana's outstanding physical attraction. As the girl also knows how to place her charms they both fall victim to her.Susana however does not seem capable of developing any true feelings. Life is just a villainous game for her in which the rules are set by herself. The aim is to destroy the well established order. When finally even the landowner succumbs to the lure of love the initial situation becomes reversed and nothing stays the same the mother turns into an enraged enemy while father and son become rivals and the steward is dismissed.It is then the latter who sets the decisive ball rolling which leads once more to a reversal of the circumstances He finally makes use of his knowledge of Susana's escape from the reformatory which up to now he kept to himself in order to increase his chances of winning Susana's favor and Susana however fiercely she may be defending herself cannot avoid being arrested.The game is lost and as it often happens in a melodrama it is the refused lover who makes it break down. In the end the episode with Susana means nothing more than the memory of a nightmare for the landowner's family. And after the reestablishment of the initial situation the characters cannot help asking themselves if everything has really happened.The attentive spectator will come to a different conclusion. He will notice the fundamental fragility of an order that is well established only in appearance. And he will not be able to avoid drawing a frightful parallel to his own life in which nothing is secure and reliable either.";

	schema:reviewBody "Even as a minor work I was a little surprised to find out that Luis Bunuel didn't care very much for the experience or final product of Susana aka Devil in the Flesh. It is I'll admit not something I would rush out to tell my fellow Bunuel friends to see part of that is practical since it's only available on a VHS from the mid80s and isn't in great condition even if found but the other part is that it takes a real fan to appreciate it as a Bunuel film. Like Robinson Crusoe to an extent though I think here moreso it relies a bit for the audience member to understand what it is that attracted the great surrealist to the project. Temptation pure and simple this is at its best a story that allowed for the filmmaker to bask in a longfavored pastime which was ticking off the uptight religious fanatics and purists who couldn't stand to see any kind of sensuality on the screen.Sure it definitely pales in comparison to the desire and temptation on parade and blasting at 11 in Un Chien Andalou or Viridiana. That's because Bunuel is keeping it on the downlow which has its advantages and sort of disadvantages. On its own Susana is simply a melodrama a story of this girl Susana beautiful and talented if twonote Rosita Quintana who escapes in one of those fun Bunuelian twists from a mental asylum to wind up on a rainy night in the care of a pretty religious farmhouse. She fits in with the chores and such but also does her best to tempt the prudish on the farm when she's asked to cover up she does until no one's looking relatively but winds up in a real pickle when tempting the wrong man.And on its own terms it's a pretty decent melodrama. Some good performances a few very good scenes of dialog and tension but also on the scale of a very good soap opera all the same. I can see where Bunuel might have had some tension during the making it feels and is a studio production and as such he had to stay well within the limitations of the subject matter and lowbudget. But it is worth seeing because it is still a Bunuel picture with moments like that scene at night where the two men look on tongues practically dangling out of their mouths watching as Susana simply brushes her hair in silhouette or a few moments where the twisted humor ratchets up a notch or too it's rare but worth it if only in the unintended or just dated scandalous nature of the content. It's safe stuff coming from the director of the Phantom of Liberty but it's not at all a bad movie either.".

Every now and then I gave cursory glances at the TV which I kept on but had the audio turned off and couldn't help feeling that it seemed to me that SUSANA would be a very minor work from my favorite filmmaker.Indeed a minor film it undeniably turned out to be when I finally watched it yesterday  which I didn't do earlier simply because my 28 TV was bust all this week!  but then despite its lowly position in Bunuel's canon check out my personal ranking in The Great Director's Checklist Series 39 I couldn't help agreeing with what Vincent Canby wrote about it either SUSANA is full of the sort of Bunuelian touches that forever separate all of Bunuel's films the potboilers as well as the classics from those of everyone else!Anyway here's my take on the film though it never reaches the heights of the director's best work from his Mexican period let alone his greatest which runs from 1961 through 1977 it's so focused in following through the deceptively simple plot line  which was allegedly inspired by Alexander Korda's THE SQUALL 1929 costarring Loretta Young and Myrna Loy and which also reminded me of Jean Renoir's even more anarchic BOUDU SAVED FROM DROWNING 1932 and PierPaolo Pasolini's obviously more pretentious THEOREM 1968  that it becomes a compelling viewing experience even if in a lowkey manner. Bunuel brings to the inherent melodrama his typical preoccupation with the rules and regulations which govern bourgeois lifestyle as well as the religious hypocrisy so crucial to maintaining its respectable faade  but never for a moment does he forsake the technique which is required to put across all his points. In fact SUSANA features effective shadowy lighting throughout thus ensuring any number of striking compositions and scenes 1 the very opening sequence with the rebellious Susana being dragged into solitary confinement hissing and spitting at the prison guards2 the shadow made on the ground by the crosslike bars in Susana's prison cell which she shares with an assortment of bats rats and spiders she casually prays to God for deliverance since she cannot help being who she is after which Susana is able to effortlessly remove the bars and escape!3 Susana's face suddenly appearing at the window of the hacienda during a stormy night4 the pan across the courtyard of the hacienda showing Susana's room being watched by all her three admirers at the same time without them knowing of one another5 Susana being violently flogged by Dona Carmen when she realizes that the girl she has taken in out of kindness has disrupted the harmony of Don Guadalupe's home with her uninhibited behavior6 Susana being literally dragged out of the hacienda back to prison by the police officials Besides Susana's constant dressingdown provocatively and purposefully exposing herself before appearing in front of the males of the household is very amusing  as is the putdown at every opportunity by them but also Dona Carmen of the biblethumping servantwoman who warns of Susana's deceptiveness from the getgo. The love scenes are pretty discreet but those involving the studious young son of the family take place in unconventional settings such as the library of the hacienda where the couple could be discovered at any moment by his Godfearing mother and inside a well in which Susana purposely throws herself in order to be 'saved' the rugged but equally enamored foreman then appears and sensing their presence throws in a rock after them.While the cast doesn't feature any stars as some of Bunuel's later international films would the three main roles are admirably filled  Rosina Quintana as Susana at once sultry and captivating Fernando Soler as the authoritative yet gullible Don Guadalupe and Matilde Palou as his longsuffering but indomitable wife. I would also like to say something about the assertion made by Ed Gonzalez in his review of the film  which appears in Slant Magazine's section on the director entitled The Savage Poetry Of Luis Bunuel  that there is an overt connection between Susana's voracious sexuality and Don Guadalupe's prize mare which is apparently sick and unable to breed during Susana's tenure at the hacienda I wasn't aware of it at the time so it didn't bother me as much though I obviously wouldn't put it past the filmmaker to have intended just such a link. Finally the socalled copout ending  wherein everything goes back to normal the mare miraculously recovers and the dismissed foreman who leads the police on the girl's trail is reinstated once the threatening presence of Susana has been vanquished is nothing more than one last jibe by the director at our inherent complacency and the mistrust we show in the face of anything that would in any way alter our status quo. In fact I tend to agree with Tom Vick who in the AllMovie Guide database wrote SUSANA's pointedly insincere 'happy' ending is one of Bunuel's funniest.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who do not want to see a Surrealist film by Luis Buuel  this one is a very good example of his normal work that followed his very early and totally bizarre shorts UN CHIENE ANDALOU and THE GOLDEN AGE but well before his famous AbsurdistSurrealist films of the 1960s and 70s. During this long period in between he cowrote and directed some films that seem pretty odd just because they aren't really odd at allsomething most Buuel fans might miss. Now I've gotta admit that his weird films aren't among my favorite types of movies so I actually welcomed a more conventional type of film from him.The film is about an evil wretch name 'Susana' and she is an incredibly selfcentered and conniving woman. At the beginning of the film she is in a women's prison why we never know but she soon escapes and wanders through a rain storm to the unlucky home of Don Guadalupe and his household. At first they take pity on the muddy lost girl and take her into their home but over time the girl turns out to be a vixen who uses her body to divide and conquerpitting the men against each other and getting the women to absolutely despise her. It was as if she just enjoyed making everyone dance for her enjoyment. Again and again I thought that one of the family members or their servants would kill this awful woman but the writers chose to instead end the film on a less satisfying but more realistic note I REALLY REALLY wanted to see her killedthe bloodier the better!.Considering just how awful she was and how much the film got me to utterly hate her the film was a success. It was very evocative and kept me riveted throughout.

	onyx:emotionText "For those who do not want to see a Surrealist film by Luis Buuel  this one is a very good example of his normal work that followed his very early and totally bizarre shorts UN CHIENE ANDALOU and THE GOLDEN AGE but well before his famous AbsurdistSurrealist films of the 1960s and 70s. During this long period in between he cowrote and directed some films that seem pretty odd just because they aren't really odd at allsomething most Buuel fans might miss. Now I've gotta admit that his weird films aren't among my favorite types of movies so I actually welcomed a more conventional type of film from him.The film is about an evil wretch name 'Susana' and she is an incredibly selfcentered and conniving woman. At the beginning of the film she is in a women's prison why we never know but she soon escapes and wanders through a rain storm to the unlucky home of Don Guadalupe and his household. At first they take pity on the muddy lost girl and take her into their home but over time the girl turns out to be a vixen who uses her body to divide and conquerpitting the men against each other and getting the women to absolutely despise her. It was as if she just enjoyed making everyone dance for her enjoyment. Again and again I thought that one of the family members or their servants would kill this awful woman but the writers chose to instead end the film on a less satisfying but more realistic note I REALLY REALLY wanted to see her killedthe bloodier the better!.Considering just how awful she was and how much the film got me to utterly hate her the film was a success. It was very evocative and kept me riveted throughout. While not one of the best films I have seen it was very very good and HIGHLY reminiscent of one of Buuel's last films Cet obscur objet du dsira weird but terrific little film about an evil maid and her odd boss' infatuation with this twisted ladyexcept of course Susana is played pretty straight and the weirdness of the other film just isn't apparent.";

	schema:reviewBody "Quite frankly most people ignore Luis Bunuel's midcentury Mexican films and those who don't go to lengths to find those particular surrealist themes that we know and love from him in them. I'm pretty sure the man was just taking a break and trying to get a paycheck. Susana like Woman without Love and Gran Casino is more noteworthy in how it's not typical Bunuel than how it is. Sure the themes of sexual exploration by a woman foreshadows his later work like Belle du Jour but in this case the argument is strictly made that she's insane and really a force of the Devil on innocent folk. This strict Christian theme is precisely something that Bunuel doesn't believe in but minus a few hints to the contrary he just sits back and tells the tale without too much embellishment.There's some very good shooting here especially in the beginning the opening scene isn't too far removed from the horror genre. Rosita Quintana is a good choice for the devious seductress as she is both physically stunning helps you believe the men would actually fall for that and is able to change mood or expression in a heartbeat depending on which other character is currently confronting her. Never will I argue lack of craftsmanship as far as Bunuel is concernedeven in his Mexican cinema or the notquiteso impressive Milky Way there's a firm control of narrative devices that make his movies always a pleasure to watch.Worth viewing for the interested but nothing near as interesting as Early Bunuel or Late Bunuel.PolarisDiB".

Pretty soon Susana is turning on the sexuality and starts to make the family turn against one another. The original movie is perhaps the worst Hollywood film I've seen from that era so it didn't take too much for this movie to pace it up. With that said I think overall this is a pretty disappointing film from the director but I'm really not sure if he could have done anything different to make it better. To me this story just doesn't work because it's just so over dramatic that you can't help but role you eyes at all the tragedy that befalls the people around Susana. The only thing this movie tells you that men are dumb and can be changed due to a woman's sexuality. This really isn't too dramatic and in the end the movie begins to drag. Another problem I had with the film is that the characters were all pretty annoying and that includes the old aunt who is constantly screaming religious sayings. I'm not sure if Bunuel made her so over the top for laughs or if this was just his way to go against Christians. Even with all that said this is still a beautiful film to look at with some great cinematography. The performances are also good but I was expecting better considering the director. Quintana is great and really steals the film as she plays the innocent virgin to trick the family very well and on the blink of a dime she can turn into the slut. Fernando Soler is also very good as the head man of the home.".

	schema:headline " John Gilbert shines in his last silent film";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is a little bit different from Gilbert's other silent films. Usually Gilbert was cast in films in which there was a tremendous amount of action andor romance. This time much of the film is just Gilbert in a somewhat psychological battle against two thieves and the elements.Gilbert plays Hugh Rand manager of a South African diamond mine. He gets news that two visitors are due  Lord Stonehill and his daughter Diana. They arrive ahead of schedule and against Rand's own predictions Lady Diana turns out to be a beautiful woman. However it soon turns out that the two are imposters but are found out by Rand before he can notify anyone else. The pair of thieves take off into the desert with their stolen diamond and their company of coconspirators with Rand as hostage.Things begin to go wrong for the thieves and pretty soon it is just Rand and the two imposters on foot in search of water before the sun of the desert does them in. Throughout their journey Rand is laughing off the situation as well as laughing at the two thieves now suddenly penitent and afraid of death. Rand has a right to laugh  he has control of the last canteen of water.Gilbert often reminds me  in this and his other silent films  of Errol Flynn showing temper and passion when it is called for but usually laughing in the face of danger having a genuinely good time in whatever situation he is put and inviting us to join in the adventure with him. I've often wondered what would have become of his career had he been ten years younger and started out in talking pictures instead of silent film. Would he have been MGM's answer to Flynn in the age of the swashbuckling picture? This film is highly recommended for the silent film enthusiast.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is a little bit different from Gilbert's other silent films. Usually Gilbert was cast in films in which there was a tremendous amount of action andor romance. This time much of the film is just Gilbert in a somewhat psychological battle against two thieves and the elements.Gilbert plays Hugh Rand manager of a South African diamond mine. He gets news that two visitors are due  Lord Stonehill and his daughter Diana. They arrive ahead of schedule and against Rand's own predictions Lady Diana turns out to be a beautiful woman. However it soon turns out that the two are imposters but are found out by Rand before he can notify anyone else. The pair of thieves take off into the desert with their stolen diamond and their company of coconspirators with Rand as hostage.Things begin to go wrong for the thieves and pretty soon it is just Rand and the two imposters on foot in search of water before the sun of the desert does them in. Throughout their journey Rand is laughing off the situation as well as laughing at the two thieves now suddenly penitent and afraid of death. Rand has a right to laugh  he has control of the last canteen of water.Gilbert often reminds me  in this and his other silent films  of Errol Flynn showing temper and passion when it is called for but usually laughing in the face of danger having a genuinely good time in whatever situation he is put and inviting us to join in the adventure with him. I've often wondered what would have become of his career had he been ten years younger and started out in talking pictures instead of silent film. Would he have been MGM's answer to Flynn in the age of the swashbuckling picture? This film is highly recommended for the silent film enthusiast.";

John Gilbert could have been a professional dancer he was that good.The story is about a bunch of jewel thieves caught in the desert but you really won't care.

I was surprised to find despite the obviously missing reel a star at his top in a gritty action drama.Jack Gilbert is very good as the kidnapped manager of a diamond mine as he schemes and bluffs his way from being tied up and about to be killed to capturing his capturers. His Rand is a gritty ruthless equal to a murderer and a dubious moll.A key scene is when he is tied up and being threatened by the murderer. Gilbert laughs as he is threatened. What is interesting is his laugh. It is not an Errol Flynn laugh. Nor is it hysterical. Rather it is edged with black and nervy tension and is surprisingly scary. Gilbert's Rand is not a nice guy. He plays their game with equal viciousness and deceit.Another scene occurs early on when the 'Lady Diana' mockingly aims a rifle at Rand. For a second his eyes go gritty. No proper English woman would or should aim even an unloaded rifle at someone. How does Gilbert do it? A split second look as his Rand registers that there is more to this pair than appearances say? The film is gritty and clearly entering PreCode in it's sweat torn clothes undone blouses semi nudity and ungallant threats by all three players toward each other. Everyone threatens everyone and the sexual tension between all three is very PreCode risqu. Rand kisses the moll in one scene by force and unwanted  and teases her lover by entering her tent in the night in another scene  and closing the tent flap! The title cards are gritty and it is interesting to speculate if Gilbert's wish for this to be his first talkie had happened. Would this have launched him into sound better? It is more modern and gritty and just might have saved him. As it was it is an interesting and teasing addition to the mystery of John Gilbert and why he fell from superstar to failure in only six years.J E F Rose".

	schema:reviewBody "Desert Nights 1929  out of 4John Gilbert's final silent picture is a pretty interesting one even if its reputation isn't that high. In the film he plays Hugh Rand a diamond mine owner in South Africa. One day a father Ernest Torrence and daughter Mary Nolan show up on invitation for some good hunting but it turns out they're a pair of thieves who take Hugh hostage as well as steal 500000 in diamonds. The three head off into the desert for their escape but soon they're out of water and not sure which way to go so the thieves must depend on Hugh to save their lives. Watching this film there's no doubt that it was rushed together just to save time before MGM had to put Gilbert into a sound feature. I'm really not sure why they selected this one to remain silent as the material could have made for an interesting early talkie but I must say it's a good thing that they kept it silent. The movie runs an extremely quick 62minutes and for the most part is very entertaining. The reason I say it works best as a silent is because of the hot sexuality throughout the film between Gilbert and Nolan. The two of them certainly heat up the screen and this is apparent early on in a simple dinner sequence where the two begin to get to know one another. Just the way they look at one another just tells you all the sexual undertones you'll need to know. Once the film moves out to the desert it picks up the entertainment as it's clear Gilbert's character is just having fun tormenting the two thieves by constantly reminding them that death is near. I really loved the way Gilbert played the role in a sort of madness that his character finally breaks through and decides to have some fun with the people who kidnapped him. The way he torments the Father by coming onto the girl was a lot of fun and just added to the sexual tension running through the film. Gilbert is a lot of fun in the role as he gets to play that tough guy everyone loved him as and I'm sure the women really ate up seeing him burning in that hot sun. Torrence is a real blast as the bad guy as he eats up every scene he's in and you can't help but love to hate him. He's such a arrogant jerk at the start of the film so it's fun seeing him tortured by Gilbert. Nolan is incredibly beautiful in her role and this includes a great sequence with her bathing naked. We don't actually see anything but the implications of the scene are easy to see. Her and Gilbert really burn up the screen and make it worth sitting through. In many ways this film reminds me of a silly serial that has just about everything happening. This film offers up some nice tension but there's also plenty of sexuality comedy and even camp value especially the scene with the machine gun tied on the side of a car. Fans of silent cinema will really eat this thing up but even those who aren't fans will probably find themselves having fun.".

	schema:headline " John Gilbert going down.";
	schema:reviewBody "The standard foci in John Gilbert studies have always been the early talkies and the great successes of the twenties. Everything has been directed to the great John Gilbert question his precipitous fall from grace  did he fall or was he pushed? Seeing Desert Nights raises more questions than it answers. It certainly to paraphrase Defence Secretary Rumsfeldt lets us know that there are more secrets that we didn't know that we didn't know.There is this last John Gilbert silent film for example. Very late. So there was something of a reluctance to commit to sound films for John Gilbert. Was this the reasoning of Louis B. Mayer or John Gilbert? This late silent film could only have added to the general high tension surrounding Gilbert's transition to sound. Was this a deliberate psychological ploy by Mayer who knew both how to make stars and unmake them or were other reasons such as changing tastes a high pitched voice either in fact or because of a sabotaged sound recording or the fact that Gilbert was now obliged to vocalize the romantic swill which had previously been expressed with his face and body.Was Gilbert merely not as clever as he thought he was or were his weaknesses noted by Mayer and used to drive Gilbert off the cliff? Who was the driving force behind making this last silent film might go a good way to sorting these this questions out.Certainly Gilbert gets to do a lot of the Gilbert schticks that made him a star. He waltzes the same way he did in the Merry Widow his shoulder and his arm are as stiff as if set in plaster his body gilding ever so smoothly across the floor the lady inseparable from his force field. He appeared with his usual super macho devilmaycare persona hands on hips bending backwards and laughing loudly signature move literally laughing at danger.Still however good or bad he was and no matter how good or bad the film was it's being released as a silent in 1929 doomed it to obscurity the moment it was first threaded into a projector. In the world where you're only as good as your last picture a total and absolute flop like this made Gilbert's transition to sound just that much more problematical.As it is Desert Nights isn't very good what there is of it. Someone has written that it's copyright length is listed as 80 minutes and the version available on Turner Classic Movies which I presume is the MGM library copy is only 63 minutes. In the film as shown there are vast problems in continuity. Transitions from the automobile escape to a safari are strangely incomplete giving it something of the routine illogic which drove French Intellectuals wild for a time in the late 20s and early 30s as surrealism was the desired aesthetic. This of course wasn't a deliberate artistic decision. Later in the film even stranger things happen. Does he escape or doesn't he? Who has the drop on whom? Does he love her does she love him or are they both playing a game which turns into love? With so many missing scenes even with a bit more information who would possibly care? Apparently in one scene John Gilbert gives Ernest Torrence as the heavy directions which cause him to wander along a lush river for days until he arrives back at mine where he is promptly put in chains but the scene has been dropped though referred to in the denouement. Time passing isn't expressed at all at any point in this picture. It all seems to just be happening then and now on the screen. Very surrealistic.Even if it had been complete even if it had been a talkie it would have been a bad picture. Maybe something epic could have been wrung out of the desert sequences but this was shot on an intimate yet superficial manner.Fantastic photography from James Wong Howe. Everything is pretty perfunctory and Gilbert can't pull this one out with his famous charm alone. These were perhaps the last fleeting shots of the old self confident Jack Gilbert as the utter failure of Desert Nights and the changeover to sound seems to have sapped the Gilbert screen persona and cast him o'er with the pale cast of doubt forever.So was this film actually released this way or did it play a week full length and then go out to the nabes cut perhaps as part of a double bill? Was it cut and dumped or did it fail and then cut and dumped? The Variety review might be the thing to see. So was this a disaster that Gilbert had been talked into or pressured to make or did he do it willingly and even enthusiastically and if he did was it something that Mayer use to his advantage in his plan to destroy Gilbert? Gilbert's next appearance was a cameo as himself in William Haines' A Man's Man a dangerous title considering Haines was perhaps the most widely known homosexual leading man in the movies.Gilbert would go on to make his first Talkie in a Romeo and Juliet sequence in The Hollywood Review of 1929 where he delivered the role of Romeo in the balcony scene in something less than dulcet tones but perhaps most damagingly wearing tights and rouged up in early color. Its the conceit of the sequence that Gilbert and Norma Schearer are being directed by Lionel Barrymore.Barrymore would direct Gilbert in the famous disaster of His Glorious Night of the famous I love you I love you I love you... which with Redemption dug Gilbert a hole from which he could never get out. By this time he was a marked man with everyone referring to him in the past tense and leaving the foot note about his high voice to explain his fall.".

	onyx:emotionText "The standard foci in John Gilbert studies have always been the early talkies and the great successes of the twenties. Everything has been directed to the great John Gilbert question his precipitous fall from grace  did he fall or was he pushed? Seeing Desert Nights raises more questions than it answers. It certainly to paraphrase Defence Secretary Rumsfeldt lets us know that there are more secrets that we didn't know that we didn't know.There is this last John Gilbert silent film for example. Very late. So there was something of a reluctance to commit to sound films for John Gilbert. Was this the reasoning of Louis B. Mayer or John Gilbert? This late silent film could only have added to the general high tension surrounding Gilbert's transition to sound. Was this a deliberate psychological ploy by Mayer who knew both how to make stars and unmake them or were other reasons such as changing tastes a high pitched voice either in fact or because of a sabotaged sound recording or the fact that Gilbert was now obliged to vocalize the romantic swill which had previously been expressed with his face and body.Was Gilbert merely not as clever as he thought he was or were his weaknesses noted by Mayer and used to drive Gilbert off the cliff? Who was the driving force behind making this last silent film might go a good way to sorting these this questions out.Certainly Gilbert gets to do a lot of the Gilbert schticks that made him a star. He waltzes the same way he did in the Merry Widow his shoulder and his arm are as stiff as if set in plaster his body gilding ever so smoothly across the floor the lady inseparable from his force field. He appeared with his usual super macho devilmaycare persona hands on hips bending backwards and laughing loudly signature move literally laughing at danger.Still however good or bad he was and no matter how good or bad the film was it's being released as a silent in 1929 doomed it to obscurity the moment it was first threaded into a projector. In the world where you're only as good as your last picture a total and absolute flop like this made Gilbert's transition to sound just that much more problematical.As it is Desert Nights isn't very good what there is of it. Someone has written that it's copyright length is listed as 80 minutes and the version available on Turner Classic Movies which I presume is the MGM library copy is only 63 minutes. In the film as shown there are vast problems in continuity. Transitions from the automobile escape to a safari are strangely incomplete giving it something of the routine illogic which drove French Intellectuals wild for a time in the late 20s and early 30s as surrealism was the desired aesthetic. This of course wasn't a deliberate artistic decision. Later in the film even stranger things happen. Does he escape or doesn't he? Who has the drop on whom? Does he love her does she love him or are they both playing a game which turns into love? With so many missing scenes even with a bit more information who would possibly care? Apparently in one scene John Gilbert gives Ernest Torrence as the heavy directions which cause him to wander along a lush river for days until he arrives back at mine where he is promptly put in chains but the scene has been dropped though referred to in the denouement. Time passing isn't expressed at all at any point in this picture. It all seems to just be happening then and now on the screen. Very surrealistic.Even if it had been complete even if it had been a talkie it would have been a bad picture. Maybe something epic could have been wrung out of the desert sequences but this was shot on an intimate yet superficial manner.Fantastic photography from James Wong Howe. Everything is pretty perfunctory and Gilbert can't pull this one out with his famous charm alone.

	schema:headline " Old fashioned melodrama for 1929";
	schema:reviewBody "There's not much distinctive about William Nigh's direction of Desert Nights unless you consider anachronisms distinctive. This being a late silent film you might expect fluid camera work tracking shots and other editing techniques that by this time so beautifully conveyed the eloquence of the silent cinema aesthetic. But with the fast approaching obsolescence of the medium it's clear from this film that MGM was only interested in turning out a filler product and Nigh was willing to oblige. The result is a film that were it not for the 1929 fashions and automobiles has the look and feel of early 1920s desert melodrama. In fact the film's one truly memorable scene featuring a waltz depends on the synchronized score for its notabilitya sign of the movies' obsession with sound over visual storytelling. John Gilbert his career by this time quickly slipping through his fingers plays the hero who is not given the chance to act very heroically. His metaphoric emasculation is evident from the amount of time he spends either tied up at the mercy of his captors or dying of thirst. He is denied almost every opportunity to display his physical prowess or to come to anyone's dramatic rescuepartly because there's no one around worth saving. The plot is full of holes why didn't the crooks just shoot Hugh Rand instead of taking him with them? and the unfortunate and abrupt loss of footage at the dramatic confrontation with Ernest Torrence spoils what should have been the climax of all that has come before it. We're left with a rather limp and silly conclusion back where it all started with Torrence uttering the kind of line that surely inspired every Scooby Doo villain and Gilbert safely back behind a desk.On a more positive note mention should be made of Mary Nolan who brings a certain presence to an underdeveloped role. She and Gilbert do display chemistry in their scenes together especially the waltz and Ernest Torrence delivers a characteristically accessible and natural performance. He is truly one of the most engaging character actors of the silent screen. The print shown on TCM while truncated is beautifully preserved and the synchronized score is generally quite good again notably in the waltz scene. Finally the film is worth viewing for John Gilbert. Though this film is ultimately beneath him and can't bear comparison to such greats as The Big Parade The Merry Widow The Show and his appearances with Garbo he still conveys the wordless charisma that so defined him but ultimately confined him to the silent screen.".

In my opinion again she was a first rate actress who was being given yet another chance to make good. She had been sacked from the Ziegfeld Follies a few years earlier for disorderly conduct she fled to the continent where under another name she became a popular film star. Fleeing bad debts she slunk back to America where under yet another name she was given a Universal contract. Her two biggest successes were West of Zanzibar and Desert Nights both at MGM the cream of the studios. If she had knuckled down to work I feel sure she would have been offered an MGM contract as her talkie films show she had nothing to fear from the mike. But Universal was already tired of her shenanigans and by 1930 had let her go.Lord Stonehill and his daughter Diana Ernest Torrence and Mary Nolan are due to arrive at the Crown Diamond Mine but as Hugh Rand John Gilbert jokes she must be cross eyed bow legged and an old maid as no beauty would come to this God forsaken place. Being Mary Nolan of course she is a raving beauty and Hugh falls for her hard.In reality they are diamond thieves as Hugh finds out when he receives a wire from the real Lord Stonehill saying they have been delayed. This movie is lots of fun as Hugh is taken hostage on a safari. Hugh manages to untie his bonds and proposes to Diana that they both flee and leave the old Lord to take his chances  Diamonds and youth the world is ours  he doesn't fall for the line that Steve is her father. Ernest Torrence adds another impressive evil villain to his rogue's gallery. Just when you think his Steve is a bit of a buffoon one of his gang who has opted to split the diamonds and head of on their own to Cape Town staggers back to camp to die revealing that the rest of the gang are dead because of a poisoned water hole. Steve then admits he did it and a stunned Hugh cries that he is a murderer and a fiend!!!Hugh promises to lead them out of the desert as long as Baby is part of the deal. There seems to be a bit of missing footage I'm thinking a fight scene because one moment Diana is pleading to Steve that they should give themselves up seeing Hugh has the gun and the diamonds the next scene Steve has the gun and has accidentally walked right back to the diamond mine. As for Diana  she has been back long enough to have a shower and to look very cool and inviting and as Hugh says I will give you your freedom but you will have to report to me every day  for the rest of your life.This was an excellent film and it had something for everybody. Adventures in the desert Mary Nolan looking very easy on the eyes as she battled thirst mirages and fending off the amorous advances of John Gilbert who looked very handsome in his safari gear. There is even a partial nude scene involving Nolan who else when they finally found an oasis that wasn't a mirage. And also Ernest Torrence who boosted any movie he happened to appear in.".

It's a story of the foreign manager of a diamond mine in Africa who finds himself conned and kidnapped by two jewel thieves. Ernest Torrance and his daughter Mary Nolan get their hands on recovered jewels and take Gilbert along with them as an insurance package. Keeping him out in the hot desert sun they believe might drain him of the desire to rebel but he's clever and uses earlier flirtations with Nolan to break her down. It's a fun jaunt to watch him get the better of the two particularly the nasty Torrance. There's not much to the story corny and overloaded with clichs a suave performance by Gilbert and a few surprises along the way. What's fun is watching how Torrance comes to depend on Gilbert for his survival having earlier tried to get Nolan to prevent Gilbert from getting water. Later on when they find a sudden desert oasis filled with clear water and waterfalls the joy on Torrance's face explodes as he splashes around after seemingly days without water or a bath of any kind and this increases the romantic entanglement between Gilbert and Nolan. Torrance goes from an extremely nasty villain to a childlike joy literally within seconds and that makes his performance a standout. Nolan has several moments where she's romantic then ruthless and all of a sudden like a star struck young girl finding love where she didn't expect it. Gilbert is more of a reactor but several scenes show a glint in his eyes as his plans for his own survival come together. Technically it's excellent but overly silly and unbelievable although the ending is one of those that gives you a sudden gasp of shock and humongous laughter to follow.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Gilbert is an elegant and aplomb man in this movie he leaves little of that screen presence to great longevity. It's decent in parts like how the woman's father plays the piano and it actually does manifest in the score but really this movie is terribly old fashioned even for that time and it leaves little revolution. Is it entertaining? Well yeah sometimes it can put you into the tracking field of what its intent is.William Nigh tries to intertwine avarice in the stages of love which is contrived. It's not like in Michael Curtiz' Casablanca where Rick actually is spiteful to Ingmar but there is a deep and rather oozing love that is poured into it in this John Gilbert is enamored scoffing about how it's going to be a crooked old woman and having this completely changed feels to me as if his character is sort of a pessimistic which could bring an interesting dichotomy if it wasn't embedded into this movie with this type of old age romance.Though to be fair the themes are already there from the getgo it is supposed to be escapist. The problem is that in the Calihari you see no reason for the attachment between Mr Randy and Nolan's character he is a derisive character of course only used for their greedy and rapacious thirst for the diamonds using him as part of the experience. He so delightfully embraces Nolan the only hiccup being her Dad's disapproval of the whole affair. Oxen must not go loose or it will kill  I don't actually recall seeing one but that's kind of irrelevant. The dehydration and murky desert atmosphere give it a real sense of the desert though still pretty old fashioned theater for that point.William Nigh must have perspired as well as the whole cast while not a lot of this film that also makes it feel genuine.The ending is actually rather bittersweet still John Gilbert's performance did give this movie a certain weight. I don't think I have ever seen a movie with this type of cast and it made it feel a bit different of course onwards there have been movies like this but I mean where the desert felt so small yet feel like the sphere of it in such a short movie.Anyway I do think it's a shame for Gilbert subsequent from this that line Your lips told me so your eyes told me so... and so on is the greatest travesty in the devolution of sound cinema and it's a shame to see an actor under the wing of the producer Irving Thalberg to die so young and be panned like that... So while it's all in all all right I'll give this movie a 5 for the effort and toil that was most likely put into this movie. However The Jazz Singer would have most likely snobbed its box office revenue at that point seeing that it was a pretty big movie and got raved about for most of that year I do understand that MGM's reluctance with Sound may have been the reason they showcased this movie at ease and so I don't really blame them for it as we know the vitaphone was the failure to John Gilbert's career.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warner Archive market an excellent print of Gilbert's Desert Nights 1929. There is one proviso however. A small amount of footage is obviously missing in a confrontation scene between Gilbert and Ernest Torrence. How much footage is missing from the film is a matter of speculation. The American Film Institute Catalog offers a total footage count of 7177 feet on 7 reels. This doesn't make sense. There's no way in the world you could wind 7177 feet on to 7 reels. A standard reel holds 8 or 9 minutes of film. You could squeeze 10 minutes on a reel but certainly no more. So the original release ran no more than 70 minutes  and most probably 2 to 5 minutes less. As the Warner DVDTV print runs 62 minutes at 25 frames a second that means it would unroll in more than 64 minutes in a cinema. At the most therefore no more than 5 minutes is missing. This small break doesn't mar my enjoyment of the movie which is certainly one of William Nigh's best. Mr Nigh is definitely not a director with any sort of a cult following. To put it plainly he's a hack. Most connoisseurs do their darndest to avoid watching any of his 120 movies. Yet towards the end of the silent period he was highly regarded and managed to land some prestige assignments including this movie plus Across to Singapore 1928  not a bad picture at all very well produced starring Ramon Novarro and Joan Crawford  and Mr Wu 1927 with Lon Chaney at the height of his popularity. In 1930 Nigh directed Lord Byron of Broadway. This total disaster put an end to his flirtation with A movie studios. For the rest of his career he dwelt exclusively on Poverty Row. On Desert Nights however Nigh who also produced was not only working with a superior cameraman James Wong Howe noted both for his artistry and his ability to light scenes quickly but had the services of a brilliant cast in our John Gilbert Ernest Torrence Mary Nolan trio. Any movie with any one of these three would qualify as a mustsee item. Put them together and the sparks really fly. The desert locations are also striking. William Axt has contributed a most effective music score. In all I think MGM made the right decision to produce this movie as a silent with music and sound effects. Spoken dialogue would have undermined the mood and drawn attention to plot implausibilities.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though both Walter Huston and James Stewart were billed above her Of Human Hearts is really about Beulah Bondi and what she does for her small family. It's probably her best performance on screen.The setting is antebellum Ohio and the Wilkins family has just arrived. Walter Huston is to be the new minister for the town. It's a poor place he's been sent and the family lives on hand me downs castaways and the charity of the community. In the pious tradition of his profession Walter Huston accepts this as part of the price for his calling to the ministry. Son Gene Reynolds who grows up to be James Stewart cannot accept this. He's a bright kid and gravitates towards Charles Coburn the town doctor. His mind turns towards medicine and he makes up his mind to become a doctor.That puts him in conflict with Huston and poor Beulah is caught in the middle between them.Walter Huston played three preachers on screen the uptight Reverend Davidson in Rain the satirical Sin Killer Jubal Crabby in Duel in the Sun and Reverend Ethan Wilkins here. Of the three of them Ethan Wilkins is the best man and the best performance.The conflict is generational and what gets the audience involved is that they can absolutely see both points of view. Huston is not some bible thumping clown he feels his call very deeply and he's not stupid. One of my favorite scenes is Huston outsmarting Guy Kibbee and Charley Grapewin when try to sell him a defective horse. James Stewart gives voice and interpretation to every young man who wants to go out in the world see something more and accomplish more than he would in staying in a backwater town. Very similar to his performance in It's A Wonderful Life. Come to think of it Beulah Bondi was his mother there too.Beulah is the star. In How Green Was My Valley the adult Hugh Morgan says that while Dad was the head of the house Mother was it's heart. It could be applied here even better. After Huston dies Bondi sacrifices everything and lives as a pauper for her son to go to medical school and become a doctor. Stewart graduates but the Civil War begins and he enlists. Bondi doesn't hear from him for almost three years and she writes to President Lincoln to find out about him. For what happens and how Lincoln deals with the situation you'll have to see the film. But her performance will tug at you if you are made of stone.John Carradine plays a very good Lincoln. He certainly has the leantall body angular features and deep voice to be a convincing one. I'm surprised he was never again cast as Lincoln.The other performance of note I would single out is Guy Kibbee. He's the town Babbitt a part he was certainly familiar with. It's a pleasure to see how Huston deals with him.A really fine and poignant tale that I can't recommend too highly.".

It's a film that tells a story rather than just a bunch of stuff that happens  a story about austere Reverend Ethan Wilkins played perfectly by Walter Huston Rain Dodsworth The Devil and Daniel Webster who takes a position as the new preacher in Pine Hill Ohio bringing his wife Mary played by Beulah Bondi On Borrowed Time So Dear To My Heart and young son Jason portrayed as a boy by Gene Reynolds who appeared in many movies as a boy including In Old Chicago Boys Town and Love Finds Andy Hardy and went on to direct many TV episodes including Leave It To Beaver MASH Lois and Clark  The New Adventures of Superman and Touched By An Angel. Ethan is humble but strict emphasizing courtesy and generosity while denouncing pride and selfishness with stern discipline. Jason is practical and wants to become a doctor. His curiosity provokes his fathers wrath and as he grows into a young man later portrayed by James Stewart It's A Wonderful Life Mr. Smith Goes to Washington etc. he continues to defy him at one point declaring I'd rather save bodies than souls any day! He runs away to medical school often sending for money from his mother who gradually sells her personal possessions to fund him though he never returns to visit.Civil War ensues and Jason is one of the Union's best doctors trying to save limbs rather than amputate whenever possible though still neglecting his own parents. He's finally shamed by the President himself Abraham Lincoln played excellently by John Carradine The Grapes of Wrath House of Frankenstein Bluebeard Peggy Sue Got Married etc. etc. etc..This is still a great movie for the whole family probably even more to the point in modern times with relevant demonstrations of selfishness pride humility courtesy and transient material values. It's one of the first and best of those poignant family classics like A Tree Grows In Brooklyn I Remember Mama Friendly Persuasion etc. and a bit of a tearjerker.The terrific cast include a number of great character actors including Guy Kibbee Little Lord Fauntleroy Captain January Charles Coburn The Devil and Miss Jones Kings Row Ann Rutherford Annie Laurie Gone With The Wind Andy Hardy series Gene Lockhart A Christmas Carol That's The Spirit Miracle On 34th Street Going My Way etc. etc. Charley Grapwin The Wizard of Oz Grapes of Wrath Ellery Queen series Clem Beven Sterling Holloway Remember the Night Meet John Doe Dumbo Bambi Peter and the Wolf Winnie The Pooh etc. etc. Minor Watson Ward Bond and others.This one is not to be missed and should be on DVD.".

He's finally shamed by the President himself Abraham Lincoln played excellently by John Carradine The Grapes of Wrath House of Frankenstein Bluebeard Peggy Sue Got Married etc. etc. etc..This is still a great movie for the whole family probably even more to the point in modern times with relevant demonstrations of selfishness pride humility courtesy and transient material values. It's one of the first and best of those poignant family classics like A Tree Grows In Brooklyn I Remember Mama Friendly Persuasion etc. and a bit of a tearjerker.The terrific cast include a number of great character actors including Guy Kibbee Little Lord Fauntleroy Captain January Charles Coburn The Devil and Miss Jones Kings Row Ann Rutherford Annie Laurie Gone With The Wind Andy Hardy series Gene Lockhart A Christmas Carol That's The Spirit Miracle On 34th Street Going My Way etc. etc. Charley Grapwin The Wizard of Oz Grapes of Wrath Ellery Queen series Clem Beven Sterling Holloway Remember the Night Meet John Doe Dumbo Bambi Peter and the Wolf Winnie The Pooh etc. etc. Minor Watson Ward Bond and others.This one is not to be missed and should be on DVD.";

He get more than he bargained for after the guns fire on Fort Sumter and the film traces his life from uneasy boyhood to uncomfortable manhood. James Stewart excels in an early lead role and as his father Walter Huston is suitably starchy and forbidding.

There are some splendid supporting performances by among other Beulah Bondi Charlie Grapewin and especially Charles Coburn as the village doctor who likes to drink and who becomes Stewart's mentor. As an historical footnote it's worth mentioning that the film was produced by MetroGoldwynMayer in the late thirties and is an atypical product for them as they were poaching as it were on movie territory that one associates with the more folsky Fox studios of the time and did a rather good job at it too.".

Ethan's selfsacrificing wife Mary Beulah Bondi tries to balance his hardness by being as kind and gentle to their son as she can. When Jason is older he leaves home to go study to become a doctor. He's supported through this by money his parents send him from things they sell. After Ethan's father dies Jason begins to neglect his mother more writing home less and less except to ask for money. Eventually he stops writing altogether.This is an interesting one. I expected after reading some of the lukewarm reviews that it would be a stinker but I actually liked it. It's flawed for sure but it's also unique. There is a somewhat muddled message I suppose. The first half of the movie where Jason is a child excellently played by Gene Reynolds creates a sympathetic portrait of him and an unsympathetic one of his father. But after Jason has grown up he's a selfish ingrate who needs to be slapped around. His father while still a hardass is shown to have a kinder side and a genuine concern for his fellow man. The two halves do not necessarily have to be out of sync with one another. It's perfectly reasonable to assume that Jason's harsh upbringing has led him to being bitter and selfish. The problem is that the film doesn't seem to take this point of view. Once Jason is an adult the focus is on his faults only and there's never a hint that his father was ever wrong at all. Add to that the shameful treatment of his saintly mother and Jason becomes downright villainous.Still it's an interesting drama with a homespun folksy charm and healthy doses of humor sprinkled throughout. The leads are all good. Guy Kibbee Charles Coburn Gene Lockhart Charley Grapewin and Sterling Holloway are among the wonderful character actors who brighten things up. Adorable Ann Rutherford is always nice to see even though she gets little to do here but look pretty. The most famous scene from the movie is where Abraham Lincoln John Carradine lays the verbal smack down on Jason. This scene is mocked by many but I loved it. Was it hokey? Sure but it was also fun and added a nice twist to the movie's climax. A better movie than I think its given credit for being. Stewart and Huston fans should enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a gloriously oldfashioned and sentimental film. The type that went out of style right around the time of World War II when the country quickly grew up. But this film gives one quite a good idea of what rural life may have been like in preCivil War era America.To me the real star of this film is one of the greatest female character actresses of all time  Beulah Bondi. Here she plays a minister's wife who endures poverty and hardship while living in a dinkwater town along the Ohio River.Her son is brilliantly played as a boy by Gene Reynolds and as an adult by Jimmy Stewart.Another star of this film would have to be the horse Pilgrim. What a beautiful animal and so key to the plot.Walter Huston is excellent as the ministerfather who is all too strict with his young son to be as likable as he typically is in most of his film roles.Another welcome feature of this film is rather stunning scenery with outdoor scenes actually filmed outdoors and in beautiful settings.The pivotal point in the film comes when the father beats the son one more time even though he is  at that point  a young adult. This leads the son to leave home much to his mother's distress and head for medical school. While it's easy to criticize the son for his selfishness in not realizing his mother's sacrifices a 21st century interpretation of the story would be more sympathetic toward the son whose mother did nothing to stop the physical abuse by the father. Clearly mores have changed a great deal since this film was made in 1938. However once he graduates from medical school his selfishness toward his now widowed mother becomes more unforgivable.Then comes the Civil War and his mother even sells Pilgrim to pay for the son's uniform as he becomes a surgeon. This leads to the climactic and famous scene where the son is called to Washington to meet President Lincoln who severely chides him for neglecting his mother. Corny? For sure. But a dramatic tear jerker for anyone with a heart.And there are a number of supporting roles here that are well done  Charles Coburn not his usual crusty self Guy Kibbee John Carradine as Lincoln and others.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was directed by Clarence Brown and stars Walter Huston and Jimmy Stewart. The movie starts out with Huston arriving in a small Ohio town before The Civil War with his wife and son. The people agreed to pay Huston 400 dollars a year but Guy Kibbee talks them down to 250 but Huston doesn't seem to mind and his son does. Kibbee tries to take advantage of Huston but he knows how to take care of himself and he is pretty tough with his son. His son becomes friends with Charles Coburn who is the town doctor but is a drunk and his father doesn't like it. The son then grows up to become James Stewart and he is interested in becoming a doctor but his family is poor and can't afford to send him. Stewart eventually becomes a doctor during the Civil War and John Carradine has a cameo as Abraham Lincoln even though you can't recognize him.".

But alas the filmmakers really did want us to believe the President would pull a doctor off the front lines to scold him for neglecting his mother.Overall I liked it. I'll have to watch five more times just to enjoy the old man who leads the choir by striking the tuning fork on his shoe apparently unable to hear it because he hums in another key and begins singing in still another.".

	schema:headline " A forgotten Civil War melodrama...and it should probably STAY forgotten";
	schema:reviewBody "Of Human Hearts is a schmaltzy historical melodrama that starts out okay but gradually becomes ridiculous.It begins in the 1840's when the Reverend Ethan Wilkins Walter Huston arrives at a small town on the Ohio River with his wife Mary Beulah Bondi and young son Jason Gene Reynolds. The townspeople are a parsimonious group led by George Ames Guy Kibbee the skinflint owner of the general store. At a meeting to welcome the new minister to their church they trick the minister into accepting less salary than was agreed upon. But Rev. Wilkins accepts this even though he knows he is being cheated.Also the town is not exactly big on education. After the schoolhouse burned down the townspeople decided not to rebuild it figuring it wasn't good to bother the kids with too much book larnin'. The Rev. Wilkins is very strict and forbids his son Jason to read magazines even after Jason's mother buys her son a subscription to the news magazine Harper's Weekly. It's never stated exactly why the Reverend hates magazines. But Jason befriends the town's drunken doctor Charles Coburn and develops an interest in medicine.When Jason grows up now played by James Stewart he rebels against his father with the usual fatherson fistfight and leaves home to attend medical school. Rev. Wilkins dies and Mary Wilkins must occasionally sell items i.e. silverware furniture inherited from her family. She sends the money to Jason to keep him in medical school.When the Civil War comes Jason distinguishes himself as a Union Army surgeon treating wounded soldiers on the battlefield. But he neglects to write his mother for three years and she fears him dead.Then comes the movie's most ridiculous scene. President Lincoln John Carradine receives a letter from Mary Wilkins asking him to find her son. He summons Jason Wilkins to the Oval Office  calling him right out of a major battle where Wilkins is tending the wounded  and demands to know why Wilkins hasn't written to his mother! You ungrateful young man! Lincoln rails. How could you forget to write to your own mother? But...but Mr. President I've been fighting the war for the past few years! Wilkins stammers. I've been saving wounded soldiers on the battlefield! Sit down at my desk there and write your mother immediately! says the President. And if you don't write her once a week from now on I'll have you courtmartialed!Unfortunately I'm not making that last line up. Seems to me that Abe didn't have to call Jason in off the battlefield. He could've just sent a presidential order Write your mother or else!Anyway the movie is a silly historical melodrama and is probably best forgotten. Beulah Bondi does give a good performance but it's not enough to save this picture for posterity.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's ironic that Beulah Bondi was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for performances in films from 1936 and 1938 when her shining hour could be found in a 1937 film that was completely ignored. Of Human Hearts is a movie with a very large target audience mothers. Beulah Bondi plays James Stewart's mother and her long suffering sacrificing role will tug at the heartstrings of every mother in the audience.The beginning of the film shows Beulah and young Jimmy played by a wonderful Gene Reynolds being brought to a poor small town because the patriarch of the family has a new position as the minister. Take a guess as to who plays the pious stern father and if you guess Walter Huston give yourself three points. No one plays a pious stern father like Walter Huston and even though you'll want to cringe when he takes Gene out to the barn for a whipping he makes himself sympathetic. He puts the leather strop down and instead uses his hand both because it will be gentler on his son and because he'll feel pain as well. Director Clarence Brown pans the camera away so the audience doesn't see the violence and the horse's reaction is very effective in the scene.Once Gene grows up and becomes James Stewart the movie goes downhill fast. Jimmy plays such an ungrateful scoundrel it's impossible to like him. And while you really want to like Beulah she doesn't put enough into her performance to make you cry. Charles Coburn in a supporting role gives the audience the only lump in their throats in a scene when Beulah sells her wedding ring to merchant Guy Kibbee. The rest of the movie just isn't good enough to make it another Stella Dallas even though most mothers will enjoy watching it.".

Now Huston's son Jason Wilkes as a child is a true brat always complaining and acting snooty. As an adult though where James Stewart takes over the role he is more selfcentered too taken up with his education and then career as a doctor to do more than write his parents when he needs money. Now this requires his parents selling off family heirlooms and even the family horse which is more a pet than beast of burden but Jason never seems to give their hardship a thought.Then Jason's father dies Jason joins the Union army as a surgeon when the Civil War breaks out and is able to save many lives and limbs at a time when most doctors just amputated. But then an executive order comes from Abraham Lincoln demanding a meeting with Jason. This is where my title comes from. I had no idea presidents issued executive orders 150 years ago. Jason thinks it is perhaps to recognize his performance as a military surgeon but it turns out this audience is because Jason hasn't written home in two years his mother thought he was dead and wrote Lincoln to find out where he was buried! Honest Abe gives Jason the tongue lashing he has long deserved. Will he see the light? Watch and find out.At first I thought this looked and felt like a 20th Century Fox film since it is so picturesque and unpretentious. With the mid 19th century rural setting and John Carradine as Abraham Lincoln he's very effective even with that masklike makeup it was easy to get confused. Bondi is very convincing as the long suffering impoverished widow. Guy Kibbee believably hard nosed as general store proprietor. Charles Coburn is wonderful and mischievous as the alcoholic warm hearted doctor. And it's wonderful seeing James Stewart on the brink of stardom here all earnest and sensitive with a lot of his boyish mannerisms coming to the fore. The movie always threatens to turn mawkish but never does.The two children who played Jason as a child and Jason's childhood sweetheart also had interesting stories. They were Gene Reynolds and Leatrice Joy Gilbert respectively. Reynolds would be a successful TV director and producer working on shows such as Lou Grant M.A.S.H Room 222 Hogan's Heroes and My Three Sons. Leatrice Joy Gilbert was John Gilbert's daughter and played a big part in championing her dad's work and having him being better remembered than just the guy whose squeaky voice got him thrown out of talkies.Are there some over the top melodramatic moments? Of course there are. But this is the kind of small family film that MGM excelled at making at the time. I'd therefore recommend it.".

Jason always resents it and has an uneasy relationship with his strict father. When he grows older he realizes he can't stay there and desiring to be a doctor he leaves.Jason with the help of money his mother sends him and working his way through school succeeds in becoming a doctor. While he is in school his father dies and he returns home losing time at school.Once he gets back to school he constantly writes to his mother asking for money and little by little over the years she sells everything she has. After not hearing from him for several years and the Civil War going on she is afraid that he might be dead.This is the story of a family told with honest emotion that at times is almost painful to watch. Huston plays his role with great dignity and a nononsense Puritan spirit. Bondi as the warm sympathetic mother devoted to her husband is fantastic.James Stewart gives a multilayered performance  though he plays an ingrate he is likable and sincere. The character's ingratitude is not from lack of love  it comes from being selfinvolved and also unaware of the sacrifices his mother is making.Guy Kibbee John Carradine Gene Reynolds and Ann Rutherford are all wonderful. And might I mention Pilgrim the horse is a real standout.Gene Reynolds who plays the young Jason became the producer of shows such as MASH and is also a director.

	schema:headline " Fine Performances But Pretty Bad Story";
	schema:reviewBody "Of Human Hearts 1938 12 out of 4 This MGM film starts off as melodrama then moves to soap opera before eventually crashing as something completely cornball. Thankfully we have a terrific cast delivering fine performances or else this thing wouldn't work at all. It tells the story of a preacher Walter Huston who is constantly battling his son James Stewart as adult Gene Reynolds as child who eventually wants to go in a different direction and become a doctor. The son goes off to medical school and constantly has to write home asking his poor mother Beulah Bondi for money and never really giving her the time or credit she deserves for her sacrifice. OF HUMAN HEARTS offers up a terrific cast but the story turns so incredibly cornball during the final fifteenminutes that you can't help but throw your hands up in the air and wonder what the studio writer and director were thinking. This is certainly far from a bad movie but this is due to the terrific cast including Huston who turns in another strong performance. He plays the part in the typical Huston fashion which means integrity and stern. Stewart is also very good in his part as he manages to really make you believe how naive and rather stupid his character is when it comes to what his mother is doing for him. Reynolds plays the part as a child and he too is wonderful and works extremely well with Huston as the two are constantly going against one another. Bondi deserved her Oscarnomination as her role doesn't feature too many lines but we get to know everything we should by her simple body movements and some extremely strong work with her eyes which tells so much. The supporting cast includes good bits by Guy Kibbee as a cheap store owner Gene Lockhart as a janitor Ann Rutherford as Stewart's girlfriend and Charles Coburn as the town doctordrunk. One of the best performances in the film comes from John Carradine who is only here for about fourminutes as he plays President Lincoln. The performance by Carradine is very striking because of how he plays the part. The actor comes off incredibly strong and you can't help but feel as if you're watching a real president. I was really shocked at how close Carradine looked like Lincoln so you have to give the makeup department a lot of credit. However this scene is extremely bad as Lincoln calls Stewart in from the Civil War to jump on him for not writing to his mother!! This scene is so incredibly bad and it leads to an even worse conclusion that you can't help but wish Carradine had gotten a separate movie where he could have played this part. It also doesn't help that the screenplay doesn't make the preacher or the son characters you really care about because both of them seem way too selfcentered. With that said if you're a fan of any of the cast members then you might want to check this out but sadly it's yet another MGM that contains way too much sugar for its own good.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Devil's Own is one of Hollywood's periodical ventures into the murky world of Irish politics. Harrison Ford who stars here had five years earlier starred in another such film Patriot Games. There is however a difference between the two films. Patriot Games is an action thriller which simply uses the Northern Ireland situation to provide a motivation for the bad guys they happen to be Irish Republican terrorists but they could equally well have been Islamic militants or Russian spies or Mafia hitmen and it would have made little difference to the film. The Devil's Own by contrast aims for something more ambitious. The two main characters are Frankie McGuire a member of the Provisional IRA on a mission to New York to purchase weapons and his landlord Tom O'Meara an IrishAmerican police officer. For about two thirds of the film Tom does not know that his lodger is an IRA man indeed he does not even know the young man's real name as Frankie is using the alias Rory Devaney. Tom is only enlightened towards the end of the film when he discovers in Rory's bedroom a bag containing millions of dollars. Are the IRA so amateurish that they would entrust the money for their arms deals to a man who then leaves it under the bed in someone else's house? His discovery of the truth puts Tom in a difficult position. On the on e hand he disapproves of violence so cannot allow Frankie to go ahead with his plan to buy missiles for the IRA. On the other hand he does not want any harm to come to the young man so tries to protect him from the FBI and MI5 agents who are on his tail. It is quite possible that the British security forces might set up hit squads to hunt down IRA men but it seems highly unlikely that such squads would be permitted to operate on American soil with the full knowledge and cooperation of the US authorities. There is also a subplot involving Tom's attempts to cover up for his partner Eddie who has shot dead a criminal who was running from him. Tom tells his superiors that the man was armed although he had already thrown away his gun before being shot. I felt however that this subplot was never properly integrated into the main film. I was not surprised to discover that the film went through several rewrites after the original script was discarded as it had the feel of a film written by a committee. Each member of the committee moreover appears to have had his or her own agenda. One member wanted to make an action thriller a second wanted to make a political commentary on the Northern Ireland situation and a third wanted to make a characterdriven psychological drama exploring Tom's ethical dilemma in having to choose between the demands of friendship and his obligation as a police officer to uphold the law. Eventually the chairman who had the casting vote ruled that the film would be a mixture of all three approaches.There is of course nothing wrong with a film which attempts to work on several different levels. The trouble with The Devil's Own is that it doesn't really work on any of them. As an action thriller it is too slow moving with most of the action crammed into the opening and the ending. As political commentary it is too obviously slanted towards a proIRA position with a misguided attempt to make Frankie a sympathetic figure. That is perhaps only to be expected from Hollywood particularly in its pre911 period. Americans who approve of this should ask themselves how they would react to a British film which tried to glamorise Timothy McVeigh or the Unabomber. As a psychological drama it is dull and the Eddie subplot is never successfully integrated with the main action. The film was turning out so badly that one of its main stars Brad Pitt wanted to leave the set and was only restrained from doing so by the threat of an injunction. Rather surprisingly therefore Pitt's performance is one of the better things about this movie. His Irish accent too is quite convincing. He is certainly better than his costar Harrison Ford who actually described this film as one of his favourites. Although Tom O'Meara is a role of the sort in which Ford normally excels a decent solid family man confronted with a crisis his performance here is a dull stodgy one and not one of his best. Overall the film is a disappointment despite its two majorleague stars and its majorleague director. This was the last film to be made by Alan J. Pakula before his tragic death a year later in a road accident. Pakula was responsible for some excellent films notably Sophie's Choice so it is a shame that his career did not end on a higher note. 410".

The Devil's Own by contrast aims for something more ambitious. The two main characters are Frankie McGuire a member of the Provisional IRA on a mission to New York to purchase weapons and his landlord Tom O'Meara an IrishAmerican police officer. For about two thirds of the film Tom does not know that his lodger is an IRA man indeed he does not even know the young man's real name as Frankie is using the alias Rory Devaney. Tom is only enlightened towards the end of the film when he discovers in Rory's bedroom a bag containing millions of dollars. Are the IRA so amateurish that they would entrust the money for their arms deals to a man who then leaves it under the bed in someone else's house? His discovery of the truth puts Tom in a difficult position. On the on e hand he disapproves of violence so cannot allow Frankie to go ahead with his plan to buy missiles for the IRA. On the other hand he does not want any harm to come to the young man so tries to protect him from the FBI and MI5 agents who are on his tail. It is quite possible that the British security forces might set up hit squads to hunt down IRA men but it seems highly unlikely that such squads would be permitted to operate on American soil with the full knowledge and cooperation of the US authorities. There is also a subplot involving Tom's attempts to cover up for his partner Eddie who has shot dead a criminal who was running from him. Tom tells his superiors that the man was armed although he had already thrown away his gun before being shot. I felt however that this subplot was never properly integrated into the main film. I was not surprised to discover that the film went through several rewrites after the original script was discarded as it had the feel of a film written by a committee. Each member of the committee moreover appears to have had his or her own agenda. One member wanted to make an action thriller a second wanted to make a political commentary on the Northern Ireland situation and a third wanted to make a characterdriven psychological drama exploring Tom's ethical dilemma in having to choose between the demands of friendship and his obligation as a police officer to uphold the law. Eventually the chairman who had the casting vote ruled that the film would be a mixture of all three approaches.There is of course nothing wrong with a film which attempts to work on several different levels. The trouble with The Devil's Own is that it doesn't really work on any of them. As an action thriller it is too slow moving with most of the action crammed into the opening and the ending. As political commentary it is too obviously slanted towards a proIRA position with a misguided attempt to make Frankie a sympathetic figure. That is perhaps only to be expected from Hollywood particularly in its pre911 period. Americans who approve of this should ask themselves how they would react to a British film which tried to glamorise Timothy McVeigh or the Unabomber. As a psychological drama it is dull and the Eddie subplot is never successfully integrated with the main action. The film was turning out so badly that one of its main stars Brad Pitt wanted to leave the set and was only restrained from doing so by the threat of an injunction. Rather surprisingly therefore Pitt's performance is one of the better things about this movie. His Irish accent too is quite convincing. He is certainly better than his costar Harrison Ford who actually described this film as one of his favourites. Although Tom O'Meara is a role of the sort in which Ford normally excels a decent solid family man confronted with a crisis his performance here is a dull stodgy one and not one of his best. Overall the film is a disappointment despite its two majorleague stars and its majorleague director. This was the last film to be made by Alan J. Pakula before his tragic death a year later in a road accident. Pakula was responsible for some excellent films notably Sophie's Choice so it is a shame that his career did not end on a higher note. 410";

	schema:reviewBody "With two such stars as Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt attached to the project and a political hitch to the storyline involving the Ireland terrorism subplot The Devil's Own seemed poised to be the year's most powerful and thought provoking as well as probably very entertaining and income churning action film. Strangely enough despite all of these advantages aiding the movie and it still turned out to be just a step above what one could generously call terrible. The Devil's Own sports every possible modern storytelling clich the worst being the families shown at home in domestic life which might as well have been cut out of a magazine they are so clean cut and utterly devoid of any sort of believability or imagination. the scene with Brad Pitt's character's family as a child is painfully awful the most unbelievable portrait of an on screen family I have seen to date It goes without saying that the horribly americanized perception of Ireland and Irish customs is downright insulting as is often the case but it seems so much more defined and offensive here. Director Alan J. Pakula seems to be trying to make three different movies in one and have absolutely no idea as to how to tie them together or maintain any sort of continuity or plot flow. The Ireland subplot is likely meant to provide motivation for Brad Pitt's IRA terrorist character but seems completely at odds with the story of Harrison Ford's painfully stereotypical troubled world weary cop character back in the States. The concept of the terrorist just by chance happening to go and stay at the house of the police officer who is hunting him down is just plain unbelievable and doesn't come off as at all clever and ironic as the screenwriters intended it to be. Instead it is groan worthy as are most of the incredibly contrived plot twists and goings on in the story.Even on the acting front the shoddy storytelling comes across. Despite the two major action stars being lined up both give completely unremarkable and even downright bad performances and there is the constant storytelling conflict as to which of them is the main character as if the writers themselves could not decide as to which character was meant to be the protagonist. The rumour that Pitt had serious conflicts of interest with the director and script and in fact tried to dissociate himself with the film shines clear as he seems to put next to no effort into his performance his Irish accent is cringe worthy one of the worst attempted accents in film history to date which is ironic considering his hilarious performance as an Irish Gypsy in Snatch 3 years later as if he just wanted to film his scenes and leave. One can't blame him as it seems he was the only one in the whole film who seemed to understand how badly the film was turning out to be.But Ford the other bankable action star seems to at least be putting some effort into a believable character but his policeman character seems so dull and uninspired that we as an audience find it completely impossible to empathize with him in any way. The supporting characters seem to be extras rented off the street for all the acting experience they seem to have at all and most supporting characters seem barely necessary for the progression of the horribly weak storyline at all. one still wonders at the end what was the point of including Natascha McElhone's character  a potential love interest for Brad Pitt left half written perhaps? It's just another front on which the movie demonstrates how little substance there is to it at all and how weak and clichd it really is. Overall it seems fair to say that you should not consider The Devil's Own exactly recommended  not to those who would rather enjoy themselves watching a movie anyway. For those who have a preference for weak extremely poorly and disjointedly written scripts with completely archetypal characters lazy and absent minded directing and even some good old fashioned bad acting you have found your movie. But there are so many other suspense thrillers out there superior in almost every aspect so when looking for an enjoyable movie to rent it would not seem at all presumptuous to pass on The Devil's Own leaving it to fall back into the domain of poor movie hell in which it belongs.310".

Pakula borrows a heavy political theme simplifies all and everyone and makes out of it a 2 hour show including a bag pipe score and all the other cliches you can possibly think of My father was a fisherman. At this level the film deserves 7 out of 10. In some comments the heroism in this film is convicted. There I agree. We now come to the second level. This is not a serious movie about the IRA and its politics simply because it's naive and CONSCIOUSLY simplifies complex matters. More over the whole matter is brought over to the US where it looses all sharp edges. What we actually see is an action movie with a nice good looking guy who for the sake of us all kills an illegal weapon deliverer. We forget that he i.e. we don't forget it's Pakulas way of portraying his main character actually is a real IRAterrorist  a brain washed brutal soldier murderer thinking this is a way of serving justice and truth. Hollywood in the end makes them all look bad. Pakula is no exception.".

Quite a number of commentators seem to take the view that hey it's not a documentary but I wonder whether their reactions would have been the same if the freedom fighter had been Palestinian his father has been killed by the Israelis and now he's out to buy Stinger missiles to fight back against the occupation of his home land or Iraqi ... I dare say that the reception wouldn't have been quite so sympathetic.  As it is the movie stands for a time before 911 when the US position on terrorism was slightly less well defined if not totally different altogether.But even taken as mere entertainment this flick fails miserably.  Starting with the preposterous title  then there is only one bloodgunsandexplosions action scene at the very beginning noble freedom fighters vs. the Forces Of Evil.  Next both the good guy and his opponent are ahem good guys which necessitates the introduction of some more bad guys to keep the plot moving  namely the weapons dealer boy didn't they ever try hard to make him look sinister  I was already expecting a scene where he serves beer to some college kids without asking to see their licenses first and Harrison's cop colleague  actually when he first showed up I thought that he looked somewhat sinister for a good guy pock marks greasy hair Hispanic  until a bit further in the movie it miraculously turns out that naturally he IS a baddie after all!  Director Alan Pakula masterfully rounded this off with some of the most nauseating cinematographic stereotypes in the book  especially the use of quaint Irishy flutes full blast whenever the subject comes to Ireland but I also found the scene where the two terrorists play war with water hoses quite memorable.  In a way I'd wager that because the film tries so hard to cover up its sympathies for the militant Irish Republican cause it derails so badly in the entertainment department.But like I said this movie is quite interesting if only for historical and political reasons.  Nowadays you it would be impossible to produce a movie which so blatantly justifies terrorism now that the US have become the victim or that portrays the British so badly now that they have become allies 1.

	schema:reviewBody "...The Devil's Own from 1997 isn't a great film.Starring Harrison Ford Brad Pitt Treat Williams Ruben Blades and Margaret Colin the story concerns a Northern Ireland IRA terrorist Frankie McGuire who comes to New York to buy weapons. Using the name of Rory Delaney a judge Peter Fitzsimmons puts him up at the home of an Irish cop Tom O'Meara. O'Meara has no idea of Frankie's identity.Rory has brought a ton of money with him and is supposed to make a deal with one Billy Burke Williams. When he is told by his superiors in Ireland to hold off Burke gets tough and wants the money. When Tom's house is robbed his wife held at gunpoint but nothing taken Tom begins to wonder about his houseguest. With good reason.Tom himself is having a crisis of conscience when he supports his partner Eddie Blades by lying about a shooting.This could have been an excellent film as it's about two men with completely different moral codes both believing they're right. Frankie saw his father killed in front of him when he was eight years old and this started him on the road to killings. Tom has drawn his gun only a few times in all the years he's been a police officer. The problem is that this is muddied by the script being somewhat proterrorism.In today's climate proterrorist films with sympathetic killers don't go over well. As someone pointed out if this had been about someone from the Middle East partly responsible for 911 portrayed this way it probably wouldn't be made.Brad Pitt does a good job despite some of his accent problems. Harrison Ford is solid but a little boring. The ending was the best part.We don't hear much about the Irish conflict anymore but years ago many charities purportedly for Irish children were fronts for collecting money to support the IRA. My sister pointed this out to an Irish friend once who was about to give such a charity some money and she said So what? So what? Terrorism isn't right no matter which side resorts to it. It's understandable that FrankieRory had strong feelings but there are other ways to deal with them.Kind of annoying.".

	schema:headline " A Hollywood Movie about the IRA";
	schema:reviewBody "When looking at this movie through the advertisements it sounds like an action movie where a cop Harrison Ford is chasing some murderous psychopath Brad Pitt that was the impression that I got and the title doesn't really help that much either for it makes Pitt's character sound like some really evil and sadistic man. He is not.This movie is based around the IRA activities in Ireland and the main character is Brad Pitt. The entire movie is centered around him. The basic plot is that the British are gaining the upper hand because they have helicopters so Pitt must go over to the United States and smuggle some stinger missiles back into Northern Ireland to deal with it.The movie opens with Pitt's father being murdered and then moves to the present day where his character is being hunted down by the British. This quickly dissolves into a huge gun battle in the middle of Belfast where the British are basically using force of numbers to suppress the situation and even then they fail to achieve their goal.The bulk of the movie takes place in the United States and has very little action. It revolves around Pitt arranging the deal. Unfortunately things go slightly wrong and the deal has to be postponed which upsets the crime lord who is arranging it no end.There is very little in the way of constant pursuit between Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt. In most cases they are friends though Ford is ignorant of the true nature of Pitt's character. It is only when the crime lord starts putting pressure onto Pitt that things start happening. When they do the viewer or at least myself starts to have sympathy for Pitt. He is not an evil man he is just a soldier fighting a war. There is a struggle between him and Ford for we like both but we know that they cannot help each other. The real enemy and even Ford sees this is the British. Even Harrison Ford has sympathy for Pitt's character by the end of the movie.The Devil's Own is neither a fast movie nor is it an action movie. The video labels it as a thriller but even then I didn't think much of that. It is hard to put it into a category. If you are looking for a fast action movie then look for something else. Even though I still liked this movie and thought that the character development was in itself quite good.".

More than twenty years after the release of these movies and at the screening of the devil's own this director seems to have lost his talent and inspiration.First the devil's own features two Hollywood monsters Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford but Pakula badly manages them. You are under the impression that he wanted to balance their respective sequences so that each of them has his own equal part on the screen. A particular moment clearly shows it. The day after Pitt's arrival in the USA he comes into contact with the arms dealer Billy Burke to purchase missiles. Pakula alternated this moment with a sequence aiming at showing Ford in his role of bold cop. This demonstrative side is useless for the plot. On another hand Pakula steeped his movie with sentimental romance for Pitt and Ford. Even if this latter point is only a detail it makes the movie uninteresting by endowing it with a somewhat Hollywood character. It goes to show that counting exclusively on two famous actors to save a movie is not sufficient. It can even hinder its success.The disappointment of the devil's own also comes from the fact that not only is Pakula powerless to try something new but he is also unable to renew the detective movie. He exploits without any major surprise a few themes with overrated reputation. You can also detect in it a lack of relief the IRA subject is barely sketched out. Then the relationships between the characters often boil down to a series of looks that speak volume of pistol shots of weak dialogs. Let's add that the movie accumulates the stereotyped characters the predictable sequences. All these shortcomings reveal Pakula's lack of investment in his film.The devil's own is the final movie of a weary filmmaker.

	schema:headline " A shamelessly simplistic film that is offensive in its depiction of the Northern Ireland situation and also a flat and boring piece of entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "Having become public enemy number one thanks to his murders of RUC Army and Loyalists alike Francis McGuire is being hunted by the British Army. With his freedomfighting brothers being executed by the cruel and ruthless British Francis has NO CHOICE but to illegally travel to America in order to purchase Stinger missiles from Afghanistan to use them to bring about a United Ireland by blowing up British helicopters. Being put up by family man and cop Tom O'Meara Francis makes his connections but they are closing in on him while Tom also starts to suspect something is up.In America many seem to have an idealised view of Northern Ireland and perhaps do lots of things in their minds to justify or just ignore the terrorism that occurs there but even Pitt saw this film as a mess and the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking  if you can even call it that  that I've ever seen and trust me when I say that he isn't wrong at all. From the very start those with any sort of knowledge or understanding of the NI situation will recognise some perversion of facts in the running gun battle that occurs and the way that senior British officers simply execute a prisoner. You could be mistaken for hoping that this was a oneoff but the entire film is sympathetic to terrorism and never misses a chance to twist reality justify it or simplify when it can. In case I'm accused of being a typical Prod and antiIRA I would like to point out that terrorism on both sides of the divide is unacceptable and is nothing about fighting for independence or any other such wonderful ideals  in fact in the past few years the victims are mostly within the groups' own community and the action is more about crime such as drugs etc.It is only slightly interesting to view in this the light of events since 11th September and the recent murder of a catholic man by the IRA over a minor barroom squabble. Can you imagine this film being made about a man from the Middle East who turns to terrorism against the West due to events he witnesses  can you imagine such an idea ever being OK'd? Hopefully the recent murders punishment crimes and the massive bank robbery will have served to show the US that Northern Ireland terrorist groups are no different regardless of what this film tries to show. The bias and care taken to win the extremist support is even shown in how the film has an entire subplot with Tom's partner and a bad shooting to show how Tom will turn his back on people when it is the right thing to do  thus in part excusing him for eventually having to take a stand against Francis and by default the IRA.Maybe it is unfair to rip at this film for being totally irresponsible insulting and truly offensive to me personally and the thousands who have died and the countless who continue to suffer under the selfproclaimed authority of these groups no maybe it is unfair to watch this as anything other than the piece of entertainment that it is. However even on this level the film is rubbish it drags has no sense of realism nothing to emotionally involve you in the characters and a total lack of pace. The action is overblown stupid and lacking excitement meanwhile the narrative is plodding in both development and delivery.With all this going on and the rumours of massive onset fights one could perhaps forgive the cast for being awful but what can't be forgiven is Brad Pitts' accent. It is about the worst I've heard and those who defend it have simply not talked to enough people from Northern Ireland. It's only one of his problems though and he can't make a character that works out of the mess he has been handed. Ford is sturdy and seems to be off in his own little movie for part of the film  in fairness he is probably the strongest bit of the film but that isn't saying a lot. Support from Blades Williams McElhone and others all comes to nothing and they certainly can do nothing to stop the rot.Overall this is a terrible film that is not only a poor piece of entertainment but an offensive treatment of a complex situation that involves politics and terrorists. I won't harp on about it but I hope that those who think I'm over the top will stick with me for one more moment. During September 1992 when the film shows a raging gun battle between the evil army and a band of freedom fightersIRA the following people lost their lives in the struggles ages in brackets Peter McBride 18 Samuel Rice 30 Charlie Fox 63 Tess Fox 53 Michael Macklin 31 Leonard Fox 50 Gerard O'Hara 18 and Harry Black 27. All of these 8 people were civilians. One of them was a suspected member of a terrorist group and one was a former member of the UVF but the other six had little or no connections Charlie  Tess Fox were shot because their son was in the IRA. Only one of the 8 was killed by the British Army and to counter the depiction of the British officer coldly killing the terrorist without any comeback it should be noted that the shooting of McBride by a UK soldier ended with the two soldiers involved being sentenced to life in prison. Be careful of what Hollywood feeds you  have your own mindthese are real people not an action movie.".

It's only one of his problems though and he can't make a character that works out of the mess he has been handed. Ford is sturdy and seems to be off in his own little movie for part of the film  in fairness he is probably the strongest bit of the film but that isn't saying a lot. Support from Blades Williams McElhone and others all comes to nothing and they certainly can do nothing to stop the rot.Overall this is a terrible film that is not only a poor piece of entertainment but an offensive treatment of a complex situation that involves politics and terrorists. I won't harp on about it but I hope that those who think I'm over the top will stick with me for one more moment. During September 1992 when the film shows a raging gun battle between the evil army and a band of freedom fightersIRA the following people lost their lives in the struggles ages in brackets Peter McBride 18 Samuel Rice 30 Charlie Fox 63 Tess Fox 53 Michael Macklin 31 Leonard Fox 50 Gerard O'Hara 18 and Harry Black 27. All of these 8 people were civilians. One of them was a suspected member of a terrorist group and one was a former member of the UVF but the other six had little or no connections Charlie  Tess Fox were shot because their son was in the IRA. Only one of the 8 was killed by the British Army and to counter the depiction of the British officer coldly killing the terrorist without any comeback it should be noted that the shooting of McBride by a UK soldier ended with the two soldiers involved being sentenced to life in prison. Be careful of what Hollywood feeds you  have your own mindthese are real people not an action movie.";

For someone who refers to herself as just a jester as Ms. Guzzanti does in a bout of understatement she does pull together a serious and impartial picture of the dismal state of freedom of speech in Italy how downtrodden it has been by few who hold the power and how too many never felt obliged to stand up and denounce the sorry state of things. She is one of the few who did and paid by being ostracized from possibly all main TV channels making a row of enemies for herself even among those whose political stance should be closer to hers or those who should have the moral integrity to stand by her.Since those enemies are very well aware of the potential of this Italian Farenheit 911 as some movie critic has aptly labelled the movie it is no surprise that there are only 55 screens showing it in Italy  as per the information on the official movie site  and definitely not the ones in the mainstream distribution mainly owned or influenced by those people and companies whose interests are exposed  as was to be demonstrated. Trailers are also conspicuously absent from all usual TV spots for movies and I am yet to see a single interview to people involved in Viva Zapatero  a further confirmation.There is a strong autobiographical streak in the movie recounting the sometimes grotesque events that led to her defenestration from RAI public Italian television and the clumsy embarrassed and unfortunately ignorant justifications brought forward by the individuals involved. This storytelling choice could not have been avoided though I would have preferred a wider series of cases which would have underlined the systematic quenching of any dissenting voices both satirical and from independent media at large which is taking place in Italy and the equally systematic lack of response from the opposition which seems to willingly favour a less free system that they may have the fortune to be handed control over after elections next year.This movie is a funny stimulating and valiant attempt at bringing a fundamental change in a country's basic political debate open up eyes and provide people with a further tool to analyse the causes of the paralysis of its political system. However I am afraid it will not be seen by all those in Italy who would most greatly benefit from watching neither in theaters nor in its further incarnations nor very much understood in its deep societal impact abroad.Maybe Ms. Guzzanti would be best served by distributing it on the net for free and by having her producers  distributors follow Michael Moore's lead by not charging fees for public free viewings. Low circulation of this satirical documentary would serve best only the interests of those Ms. Guzzanti is fighting against.Final note on the morning after I saw Viva Zapatero Time Magazine named Beppe Grillo one of the people whose story is very similar to Ms. Guzzanti's who also appears in the movie one of the European Heroes 2005. Guzzanti is a strong candidate for 2006.That was my comment safely composed from Munich under pseudonym...".

So if there was censorship for a satirical show it is quite obvious she couldn't have broadcast a documentary ON censorship on TV. Which is why the only means she had available to make her resentment public were theatres. In cinema in fact not everything is yet Berlusconi's.Freedom of speech in Italy is an endangered species  few may notice that especially if they do not live in Italy or if they are not familiar with its current situation or haven't been for long enough. Having one and the same TV show on every single channel at any time of day has a very specific goal. Meaning that broadcasting mindnumbing TV series even more mindnumbing reality shows talk shows basically scream shows avoiding serious issues not only at various TV panels but even during primetime TV news ... All of that sends out messages to the public. Television is perhaps the most powerful among the mass media as opposed to books which have become the least powerful and if only there were a way to have them banned forever... and manipulating people certainly is not something new.Surely documentary's such as Guzzanti's though less than Moore's can be seen as manipulative. But knowing the background of her story one can CHOOSE to disagree or take their distance. Knowing there's a satirical show on TV at 9 PM still gives you a choice to watch something else instead. On the other hand cancelling a show about political satire because the leadership of the network i.e. the leadership of the country feels threatened gives those who would be interested in watching the show absolutely NO CHOICE whatsoever. So their freedom is pretty much thrown out of the window. Which is the reason for the wide response Guzzanti had with her live performance as well as with this documentary.Furthermore I must point out that this film does not suggest that everything left is good in the least. On the contrary relevant blunders made by opposition left officials former coalition members make Italy's Left look pretty much the way it should be seen spineless submissive disjointed incoherent. They had the chance to pass an act on the conflict of interests when they were in power but since rumour had it Berlusconi was going down anyway they thought it was unnecessary to give him that extra blow. What IS that? So what are laws made for or against single persons no matter who's in power? Is an act on i.e. against conflict of interests something to apply only in case Berlusconi should win? Can they spell bull...?Guzzanti's film certainly does not imply that Berlusconi is always bad though I can't think of one single thing he did good except for shunning his legal problems. It only deals with his abuse of power in relation to public television. That IS a wide subject but the film does not go any further. And why should it? Eminent people lost their jobs because they criticized Berlusconi's political moves. In no other civilized country such criticism can be seen as a good reason to fire a good and reputable journalist. It's just unacceptable and scandalous. Yet it happened and went practically unnoticed. And this is how freedom of speech is censored and with it goes freedom of thought.Mustafa Kemal Atatrk once said He is a weak ruler who needs religion to uphold his government it is as if he would catch his people in a trap. I do believe money and greed are today's true religion.".

I am happy I have been able to see this after all. Through her eyes I have seen very clearly how the whole press campaign against her has worked. And I have been able to realize how much influence it had had even on myself at that time. I realize I have actually given up to the thought well she probably exaggerated at that time. Shame on me! What is satire if not exaggeration? What is art if not offering your own point of view? Sabina's fault she has been too good at doing it! It might have been too honest too open too convincing. Why the press campaign against her mostly worked? Because good part of the Italian middle class is scared of failure. They feel uncomfortable thinking that tomorrow morning Silvio Berlusconi their good severe daddy will grin at them again from the TV as usual and say as usual that all what they feel is actually wrong. What they saw yesterday night was not as they thought a funny liberating show. No. It was bad quality political propaganda. And they failed. They failed because they laughed. They should be grown ups they should be capable of containing their excessive joy. They should not aim for liberation they should aim for money and career like him. Look at this what they are seeing now his grinning face this is good quality TV. This is something to be proud of. Forget fun. Forget freedom. Take a fake smile from a fake daddy and carry on. That's the most you can hope for in life.".

This movie describes what to many of us seem impossible that in a regular democracy it is fully possible to start stripping off what we regard as fundamental rights.

I've been living out of Italy for about 15 years now and my first reaction while watching this film was a certain guilt and shame to be part of a country where the term freedom of speech was so loose! Yet the ending of the film could not have been more optimistic Seeing all those mainly young people at the end of the film standing in line to watch Guzzanti's second part of her satirical show made me realise that the future for Italy is not as dark as you might think and after all. I really should be proud of being part of a Country where actually just a few people at the top are corrupted but most of the others have a real will to change things and hopefully things will change soon! But I'm digressing back to the film! Stilistically the film is a bit all over the place spilt screens happen completely arbitrarily jump cuts bad rostrum shots of newspapers and so on the whole thing seems to be cut on Final Cut Pro or some cheap editing system by somebody who wants to try to new FX here and there for no apparent reason but luckily all this doesn't matter since the subject itself and the argument for the film are so strong that you hardly notice anything else but the real content. And that's the way it should be. The film sadly is very Italian and assumes everybody knows most of the people who are being interviewed. And it's a shame because it would not have needed a lot more to make it a little bit more appealing to the rest of the world. Surely it could have done with some more background information and some more archive clips from some of the other comedian who have been censured just to get an idea of what kind of stuff they stand for I.e. Grillo Paolo Rossi etc . I'm sure a lot of foreigners will get lost in the hundreds of names that are mentioned. But sorry I'm just picking needles I guess I just want this film to be seen by as many people as possible because I know that this is the only way to make a change! But as long as Italians watch it I'll be happy! Well done Guzzanti but please don't stop now!!".

My favorite one isn't it everyone's? is the fantasy sequence with husband Robert Mitchum which shows off a spectacular Edith Head fashion show.

	schema:reviewBody "To describe WHAT A WAY TO GO as an ultralight 1960s confection would be an understatement frothy foolish and seeking no more than to be mildly entertaining it is a classic of its kind and of its era.The plot is episodic. When multimillionaire Louisa May Foster tries to give away her money she finds herself slapped onto a psychiatrist's couchwhere she details the story of a little girl from the wrong side of the tracks who was only interested in marrying for love. But as fate would have it every husband she touched turned to gold and their successes spelled finish to the marriage in no uncertain terms with each widowhood leaving Louisa even more fabulously wealthy than before. What's a poor little rich girl to do? The charm here is in the cast and the production values. Although she offered considerably more in her most celebrated films Shirley MacLaine had a remarkable way with light comedy and she pulls out all the stops as the eternal widow at times sassy at times silly but never less than completely watchable. Her unlikely costarsDean Martin Dick Van Dyke Paul Newman Robert Mitchum Gene Kelly Robert Cummings and in her final film the amazing Margaret Dumontare also up to the task.The humor is both obvious and sly lampooning various ragstoriches or in one case richestoriches stereotypes with a wink a nod and now and then an unexpectedly sophisticated bit of wit. The film works best when it gently mocks both itself and the more obvious cinematic conventions of its day as when Louisa recalls each of her marriages with the words it was like one of those movies where... Everything from silent film to musicals gets a poke and overbudgeted romantic blockbusters suddenly become considerably more comic than you'd ever imagine.The production values are first rate and to say there is always something to look at on the screen would be an understatement they are deliberately and often deliciously over the topand often as amusing as the performances. The Lush Budget sequence in which MacLaine changes gowns every few seconds is particularly witty. True the movie is a nobrainer but it is a fun one. Only a sourpuss could resist! Recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

The scene where he is trampled to death by his fans holds up a hilarious mirror to the similar scene in Singing in the Rain where he has his clothes torn off by them. This film elevated parody to a high art form before anybody had even heard the term post modernism!  And those gowns she wears!  The best one is the one which is just a string of pearls down Shirley's sexy back she faces away from the camera for the shole scene because she is obviously topless.

Shirley Mac Laine is priceless. Adorable. Superb. Paul Newman lovely and very funny. Robert Mitchum plays it hysterically straight. The Gene Kelly episode has a life all of its own. Robert Cummings plays Robert Cummings beautifully as usual. Dean Martin plays himself and a softer version of himself Dick Van Dike plays a sort of Rob Petrie who wants to simplify.

This is a worthy showcase to her talent and hold ups well for the most part.  The movie is very funny in parts and when its not outandout funny you are still smiling.  Its nice to see Paul Newman and Robert Mitchum in a light comedy and Dean Martin and Dick Van Dyke were good also. Margaret Dumont as Shirley's mother was very funny and I was sorry she was not in more scenes.  All those years of sharing a screen with the Marx Brothers certainly rubbed off.I would love to know which men were offered parts but did not appear in the movie  like where is Jack Lemmon and Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford?Edith Head must have billed 20th Century Fox for a million hours of OT.  She creates about six hundred costumes for Shirley and the guys.  I think she got a nomination for this but then again in her case that's not saying anything special.".

	schema:reviewBody "MacLaine gets a huge workout in this episodic comedy about a woman from humble beginnings who is satisfied with the smaller things in life but who keeps marrying men who make a fortune and then die leaving her a wealthy widow four times over! Each one of the marriages sees MacLaine experiencing a new level of frustration and enveloping herself in an increasingly overthetop superglam wardrobe. As she relates the marriages to the rather manipulative psychologist Cummings each relationship is seen as if it were a certain movie genre. Van Dyke lives a simple existence as a smalltime store owner and their sequence contains an old silentmovie vignette. Newman is an expatriate artist living in Paris so theirs is a slightly naughty French art film. Mitchum is a businessman loaded with dough which lends itself to a parody of the furandfashion Ross Hunter women's pictures. Then marriage to small town hoofer Kelly includes a big song and dance number out of a 1940's musical. Also on hand is loutish playboy Martin who plays the man her mother Dumont wanted her to marry in the first place. MacLaine gives a worthy performance with lots of physical comedy and an impressive dance sequence. She's occasionally a little shrill but that's the character. Van Dyke is solid Newman is sexy and shows more skin here  albeit Grated  than in the bulk of his other movies Mitchum is charming Kelly is appropriately selfinvolved and Martin is his usual suave laidback self. All of the actors establish a nice chemistry with MacLaine who lived many a gal's dream when she got to pair up with all the leading men of this film! It's fun to see these actors hamming it up and having fun with their unusual roles. The real star however apart from MacLaine is the eyepopping jawdropping parade of costumes and wigs. Some are breathtakingly glamorous some are atrociously eyeassaulting but they really steal the show especially during the Mitchum sequence. Edith Head clearly had a field day but lost the Oscar to equallygifted Cecil Beaton for his My Fair Lady gowns. There are also some attentiongetting set designs. It's the kind of frothy harmless yet beautiful film that rarely gets made today. Some modern moviegoers will note MacLaine's uncanny resemblance to Renee Zellweger at times in this film. She gave this type of frothy flick a go in Down With Love but no one came of course it wasn't as good so it isn't surprising! The pattern of the movie threatens to become tiresome but the changes in stars and venues and the clever scripting of Comden and Green help keep it afloat.".

Marilyn Monroe was supposed to have followed the ill fated SOMETHINGS GOT TO GIVE with this vehicle. She would have been wonderful although a few scenes would have had to be rewritten in the Gene Kelly episode. But MacClaine is fine as Louisa original title was I LOVE LOUISA. The male support is quite good especially Paul Newman who has never been more relaxed and funny. Real offbeat casting here.

Even Paul Newman participates as a starvingthensuccessful American artist in Paris. While poor he sounds like he's reprising his Rocky Graziano role from Somebody Up There Likes Me and after his success his voice becomes identical to Johnny Carson's Art Fern the smarmy pitchman character from many Tonight Show skits. And as if there weren't enough scenery to chew during the main story there are the inevitable dream sequences which take it to an even higher level.The beautiful young Shirley of course is involved in all aspects with all her prominent leadingman costars contributing one act each. Although this movie is more indicative of the 1950's genre though made in the mid'60's Shirly displays almost as much skin as say Sharon Stone in a lot of her work today  somewhat unusual in its degree for that period. In the early part of the film a flashback to when she was perhaps 12 she's madeup to look like Howdy Doody's pretty little sister.The plot is thin as well as corny  and this type of film should not have a plot to complicate enjoying the proceedings. Shirley only desires the quiet simple life  but every man she meets except Mitchum succeeds beyond his wildest dreams as soon as he links with her but then dies leaving her with brief memories and a load of cash. Mitchum already has the cash and in the film's quest for irony finds his business empire growing even more as he neglects it daytoday for her. His demise occurs after he sellsout to return to his farm roots the opposite of the others who expire from their success.Although we all know movie roles have nothing at all to do with their screen roles a 20mil per film actor or actress can be portraying a smalltime deathrow inmate or a backwoods abused wife  it is still amusing at the end to view the stretch with Shirley and Dean Martin. Her first male friend whom she did not marry and who was ruined by smalltime competitor Dick Van Dyke who of course put him out of business upon marrying Shirley and then died  Dean had become a janitor. Now he and Shirley are happily ensconced on a hardscrabble farm with her attending the kids in their Little House on the Prairie dwelling while he plows with an ancient tractor. Although we know it's acting the picture of Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in this setting provides the perfect absurdly humorous touch to end this picture.".

U.S. release 14 May 1964. U.K. release 13 July 1964. Sydney opening at the Regent. 9968 feet. 110 minutes.SYNOPSIS From a little pink palace in the rich green hills of Beverly heralded by a butler in pink livery flanked by a staff uniformed in pink bearing a mass of pink luggage emerges a lovely lady clad in widow's weeds who after bidding farewell to a pair of Afghans is conducted to a pink Rolls Royce and driven off. The Rolls fades into a pink plane flying fast as the credits conclude.The lady is Louisa Shirley MacLaine. She proceeds to the Department of Internal Revenue where she attempts to give the United States Government her not inconsiderable worldly wealth a check for 211568000.79. When startled officials refuse this donation the distressed lady consults a psychiatrist Dr. Victor Stephanson Bob Cummings and tells him the strange story of her life. She is distressed because every man whose life she touches... and there have been a few... withers! She was born Louisa May Foster in Crawleyville Ohio... She never wanted money all she ever yearned for was the simple life with one man to love and to love her... This idea did not coincide with those of her mother a moneyhungry gorgon who bullied Louisa's father unmercifully. Mrs. Foster is bent on Louisa marrying the town's richest man Leonard Crawley Dean Martin. On a date with Crawley Louisa meets the indolent storekeeper Edgar Hopper Dick Van Dyke admirer of Thoreau. After an idyllic courtship conducted by Louisa they are married much to the chagrin of Ma Foster and Leonard Crawley. They live happily the simple life in Edgar's shack beside the lake... until Leonard visits them and so stings Edgar that he goes to work much to Louisa's distress. Edgar repairs to his hardware store and by use of every modern sales gimmick and dint of unremitting hard work becomes a merchant prince ruining Crawley in the process and becoming as far as Louisa is concerned unbecomingly rich.NOTES Nominated for Academy Awards for Color Art Direction losing to My Fair Lady and Color Costume Design also losing to My Fair Lady. Final film appearances of Margaret Dumont and Tom Conway. The movie placed in the final five of the top thirty domestic money makers of the year.COMMENT An ingenious portmanteau story spoofing various film genres compensates for a lot of static dialogue. Hilarious takeoffs include silent slapstick sexy French films LeRoy Prinz production numbers Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy and overbudgeted costume pictures. The overall tone is even brasher and noisier than the average American comedy even though it is directed by an Englishman J. Lee Thompson.With a negative cost of 5 million all the money is right up there crowding every corner of the vast CinemaScope screen. Unfortunately the movie proved too clever for its own good. Despite its rich settings and equally attractive cast it failed to recover its costs at the boxoffice. Moviegoers alas just simply don't like to be made fun of. We don't mind laughing at the tastes of our parents as in Comden and Green's Singin' in the Rain but that our own passions should be mocked and ridiculed  that's something else again!ANOTHER VIEW What a Way to Go is the legendary fairy godmother brought up to date. Shirley MacLaine is a Cinderella who makes poor men rich and rich men poor. Betty Comden and Adolph Green have a good inventive script but unfortunately they lack the ability to write interesting or witty dialogue so that the film sags badly in places. However it is still well worth seeing for its inventive touches. I particularly like the idea of treating each episode as a type of film. This works very well in the first two particularly the silent film takeoff and the French film with its long speeches translated in skimpy subtitles subtitles given for the most obvious ejaculations and to crown it all when they say To your health in English the subtitle appears in French. I thought the Lush Budgett was a little overdone perhaps they were unwilling to take off well known personalities here though. I like the idea of the 20th Century film music. Finally the musical takeoff of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. These are excellent in themselves. The trouble is they are not incorporated into the script in at all the same manner as the first two  particularly the Gene Kelly episode. It is difficult to imagine life on his houseboat as a production extravaganza a la Roy Del Ruth and LeRoy Prinz but I liked the send up of Variety headlines such as BENSON BOFFO BISTRO BALLADER BENSON CLIX STIX IN SLIX PIX.As an American comedy it might be said to be atypical. In fact it's noisier and brasher than usual  probably because J. Lee Thompson didn't want to be criticized for giving it an English flavor. He wanted to show the boys that he could direct an American comedy with the best of them. The cast however does not always seem to be at home perhaps because of some of the poor lines they are required to deliver.".

MacLaine doesn't want to marry for money no matter what the former Mrs. Flagstaff insists.

On Our Little Houseboat Built For Two has MacLaine dancing for the only time with Gene Kelly and even if you can't stand this movie you can't help but adore the cleverness of this number which comes out of nowhere.The other men in her life are Paul Newman as the artist and Robert Mitchum as the retired businessman. This black comedy is of course about death and each of the men die hysterically in ways that must be seen to be believed. Obviously this is not a film for all tastes and some may be offended by it. MacLaine gets to wear the most outrageous of outfits throughout with hairstyles to match giving way to her characters in later artistic flops like Woman Times Seven and The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom but also comparable to the deliciously tacky costumes and wigs for Rosalind Russell in Oh Dad Poor Dad Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feeling So Sad.This is a film which needs to be seen either on the big screen or in the DVD wide screen release. It is not meant to be seen at all in pan and scan as that looses most of the cinematic color of it and makes it a total blur. It is obvious that MacLaine and her many costars which includes Robert Cummings as an amorous psychiatrist had a ball in this.

	schema:reviewBody "If the fans of the various leading men and Shirley MacLaine just attended this film What A Way To Go was certainly guaranteed to be a hit at the box office. It would have to be to justify the salaries of the cast involved.It was that and more. What A Way To Go is a bright comedy showing the talents of Shirley MacLaine to full advantage including her dancing talents in the segment involving Gene Kelly. Shirley relates in flashback to a lecherous psychiatrist Bob Cummings the incredibly rotten luck she's had with her marriages. Widowed four times Shirley is worth over 200000000.00. Her pattern is to marry men who are poor with one exception and they become rich and then meet with bizarre deaths. Her husbands in order were Dick Van Dyke Paul Newman Robert Mitchum and Gene Kelly. Mitchum was already rich but became incredibly much richer while married to Shirley. He also met the most bizarre death in the film which you'll have to see because it's too funny to reveal.Kelly played a song and dance man who played in a clown makeup. Each of the segments involved a dream sequence where Shirley relates to Cummings that in her ideal stage of the marriage it reminded her of some happy movie genre. In the Kelly sequence it involved a musical and we get to see Shirley dance which she didn't do enough of on the big screen. There is another man in her life in Dean Martin but how he figures in you have to see What A Way To Go. This was the farewell film appearance for both Margaret Dumont who played Shirley's mother and for Tom Conway who had a bit role.What A Way To Go still retains a lot of the good humor for today's audiences. I could see a remake of it with someone like Julia Roberts being married to Tom Cruise Brad Pitt etc. They'd have to go some to replace a dancer like Gene Kelly though.".

	onyx:emotionText "If the fans of the various leading men and Shirley MacLaine just attended this film What A Way To Go was certainly guaranteed to be a hit at the box office. It would have to be to justify the salaries of the cast involved.It was that and more. What A Way To Go is a bright comedy showing the talents of Shirley MacLaine to full advantage including her dancing talents in the segment involving Gene Kelly. Shirley relates in flashback to a lecherous psychiatrist Bob Cummings the incredibly rotten luck she's had with her marriages. Widowed four times Shirley is worth over 200000000.00. Her pattern is to marry men who are poor with one exception and they become rich and then meet with bizarre deaths. Her husbands in order were Dick Van Dyke Paul Newman Robert Mitchum and Gene Kelly. Mitchum was already rich but became incredibly much richer while married to Shirley. He also met the most bizarre death in the film which you'll have to see because it's too funny to reveal.Kelly played a song and dance man who played in a clown makeup. Each of the segments involved a dream sequence where Shirley relates to Cummings that in her ideal stage of the marriage it reminded her of some happy movie genre. In the Kelly sequence it involved a musical and we get to see Shirley dance which she didn't do enough of on the big screen. There is another man in her life in Dean Martin but how he figures in you have to see What A Way To Go. This was the farewell film appearance for both Margaret Dumont who played Shirley's mother and for Tom Conway who had a bit role.What A Way To Go still retains a lot of the good humor for today's audiences. I could see a remake of it with someone like Julia Roberts being married to Tom Cruise Brad Pitt etc. They'd have to go some to replace a dancer like Gene Kelly though.";

She's the whole show and that's no small feat considering her leading men. As a toooften married widow MacLaine recounts her marriages to doctor Bob Cummings. There's sensible Dick Van Dyke unsavory would be suitor Dean Martin starving artist Paul Newman wealthy industrialist Robert Mitchum and big time star Pinky Benson played by Gene Kelly. It's all an excuse for MacLaine to get into one wild escapade after another and it's all set against a constantly changing though always colorful background...this is the glossiest of glossy movies. It's strange because although it's not particularly funny it's very watchable. Of the leading men Van Dyke and Martin fare best essentially playing variations of their established personas. Newman is at sea in this type of light farce and Mitchum makes no attempt to be funny. Kelly's segment is dreadfully peppy. He almost manages to upstage MacLaine. The great Margaret Dumont has a cameo as MacLaine's mother. Directed with a surprisingly light touch by J. Lee Thompson who was most famous at the time for directing THE GUNS OF NAVARONE!".

	schema:reviewBody "What a Way to Go! is such an entertaining showcase of vivacious star Shirley MacLaine's talents as a comedienne dancer and singer that it's hard to believe that the original script was far darker and intended for Marilyn Monroe! A tale of an innocent who dreams of a 'simple life' marrying progressively richer men who leave her an even even richer widow is the kind of tongueincheek farce that European filmmakers relish but was unfamiliar to American audiences of the early sixties. Writer Gwen Davis' original story was written to satirically echo Monroe's own marital misadventures and might have provided the star her best vehicle since Bus Stop. But Monroe's career took a tragic nosedive culminating with her death at 36 in 1962 leaving Fox with a script a director J. Lee Thompson and a film in preproduction.Gifted songwriting team Betty Comden and Adolph Green fresh from transferring their B'way hit Bells Are Ringing to the screen saw the script and were invited to rework it as a comic vehicle for MacLaine. The talented actress who had achieved major stardom in The Apartment was being given a major buildup by Fox who wanted to showcase her untapped skills as singerdancer as well as in comedy. Thus a lighter more dazzling What a Way to Go! was born.Fox spared no expense on the production with over 70 Edith Head costumes choreography by Gene Kelly and a new song by Jule Styne...but they balked over Frank Sinatra's salary demands to play one of the husbands he was replaced by Robert Mitchum. For MacLaine it was a joy working with two exlovers Mitchum and Dean Martin dancing with Kelly doing comedy with Dick Van Dyke Bob Cummings and a surprisingly deft Paul Newman and working with legendary Marx Brothers' foil Margaret Dumont in her last film.The end result while a 'mixed bag' has memorable moments Newman's French sequence with a chimp and a murderous painting machine captures the 'essence' of the material very well the spoof of Fox multicostume extravaganzas with Mitchum is dazzling and his death is the funniest best of all the giant musical production number with Kelly and MacLaine is a total joy a homage to both Kelly and Busby Berkeley. While the Van Dyke and Martin sequences lack the same sparkle and Cumming's scenes appear more contrived than funny the overall result is wonderful eye candy with MacLaine never sexier or more energetic. That the film failed to become a big hit when released was certainly not due to it's star. The new DVD edition deserves a commentary and 'making of' documentary neither of which it has but does offer some entertaining newsreel footage from the 1964 World's Fair premiere as well as an amusing newsreel of the casting of the chimp for the Newman sequence.What a Way to Go! may not be 'classic' cinema but it is fun and if you're a MacLaine fan you'll be in for a treat!".

When he passes by the room of Laura Baxter Cherilyn Wilson he becomes fascinated with her angelical beauty and discovers that she has Parasomnia or the Sleeping Beauty syndrome sleeping most of the time and awaking briefly on a few moments only. Billy visits the girl in other occasions falling in love with her when he finds that she will be transferred to serve as experiment in a clinic with bad reputation he decides to abduct Laura and bring her to his apartment. However Byron also loves Laura and controls her nightmares and uses his power to bring her back to him in a trail of blood.First of all the weird Parasomnia definitely has potential of cultmovie. The absurd and odd story begins like a romantic tale I believed it would be an update of Sleeping Beauty introducing the gorgeous and lovely Cherilyn Wilson her breasts are perfect shifts to horror supported by a magnificently bizarre cinematography that recalls in some moments Guillermo Del Toro's El Laberinto del Fauno a cameo of Sean Young and John Landis the cult Jeffrey Combs in the role of Detective Garrett and a creepy and evil villain performed by Patrick Kilpatrick. The overture of Romeo and Juliet is used in one of the most bizarre disturbing and imaginative scenes I have ever seen in a horror movie. Last but not the least there are lots of gore to satisfy the fans. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Sonmbulos Sleepwalkers".

Billy visits the girl in other occasions falling in love with her when he finds that she will be transferred to serve as experiment in a clinic with bad reputation he decides to abduct Laura and bring her to his apartment. However Byron also loves Laura and controls her nightmares and uses his power to bring her back to him in a trail of blood.First of all the weird Parasomnia definitely has potential of cultmovie. The absurd and odd story begins like a romantic tale I believed it would be an update of Sleeping Beauty introducing the gorgeous and lovely Cherilyn Wilson her breasts are perfect shifts to horror supported by a magnificently bizarre cinematography that recalls in some moments Guillermo Del Toro's El Laberinto del Fauno a cameo of Sean Young and John Landis the cult Jeffrey Combs in the role of Detective Garrett and a creepy and evil villain performed by Patrick Kilpatrick. The overture of Romeo and Juliet is used in one of the most bizarre disturbing and imaginative scenes I have ever seen in a horror movie. Last but not the least there are lots of gore to satisfy the fans. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Sonmbulos Sleepwalkers";

Incidentally for even the vilest and most reprehensible of criminals can they be detained chained in a stress position on their feet arms outstretched 24 hours a day week in week out? I suppose in the world that gave us Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay anything's possible.No what's really creepy about this film is the central character Danny. This unappealing young man aided and abetted it's true by some ludicrously lax security arrangements and a doctor entirely careless of any notion of professional ethics or patient confidentiality wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a highly vulnerable and defenceless young woman and on the basis of nothing whatsoever her chronic sleeping precludes from being able to give anything like informed consent imagines himself to have some sort of special relationship with her.Seemingly within days he has arrogated to himself the right to abduct her believing completely falsely as we discover that he is better able to care for her than anyone else and within minutes of getting her back to his apartment is sexually molesting her though she is again due to her sleepiness entirely unable to consent or resist.Our suspicions as to why he would feel this connection are pretty soon confirmed. He is of course more or less unable to form any mature adult friendships let alone sexual relationships so instead falls back on this essentially infantilised woman who because of her permanent sleeping has a mental age corresponding to a lived experience of only a few years. The scene where she discovers ice cream is particularly cringemaking and the coyly knowing look she gives him when he gloatingly says he'll have to clean her up again causes a particular shudder of horror. But again I'm afraid not that shudder of horror the film makers were hoping for but a much more straightforward spasm of revulsion. We can all see clearly what's on the end of our forks here  it's the paedophile's perfect dream of innocence sexual compliance and utter dependence. Horrible horrible horrible.What else have we got in this mish mash? Twisted dreamscapes not quite as good as del Toro. The compulsory You need to go to the police argument where the lead character always has a reason for not doing so even though it's the only sensible course of action. The automaton sequence much praised in the comments here though completely and utterly pointless It serves no function! as Sigourney Weaver memorably protested in Galaxy Quest and looking to me just like the Abominable Doctor Phibes rehashed in one of the Saw derivatives.Jeffrey Combs does his best though so a star for that and a couple more because you have to keep lower rankings for films that are even worse than this and in general this is wellshot and competently performed.".

While visiting with a friend in L. A. I saw this at a special screening in Hollywood at the Egyptian Theater. The director said they were still looking for a distributor. A fact I find unbelievable. I had never heard of this film yet what I saw lit up in the dark was one of the best... I was going to say horror movies... but JUST PLAIN MOVIES that I've seen. Instead Hollywood gives us overblown remakes of remakes. This is one of the most original fun and entertaining films I've ever watched. Are these guys asleep at the switch? This movie is really interesting because it starts out slowly and then begins turning the thumb screws down until you're about to yell. We see this kid Danny through a series of very bad decisions... get himself deeper and deeper into a hole until you wonder how he's ever going to be able to get out of it. What's cool is his actions are completely understandable because of his obsession with this sleeping girl..The chick who plays her is VERY HOT!!!! BTW. This movie does something that you just don't see in movies now. The build to the end gets more and more intense and reveals more layers and convolutions than a Nixon investigation. I'm not going to say more than that 'cause I don't want to give anything away but the last half of this movie is just plain great. This has one of the best endings in a film ever. Judging from the films I've seen in the last few years this must be hard to do. The look and mood of the film is unique. The movie is lush and creepy like a dream that you don't want to wake up from. You just want to go back there and revisit those places and live in that world with those people.OK I'm gong to be kind and imagine that Warner Bros Sony MGM 20th Century Fox and all those guys have never heard of this film either... Yeah.. That's it.".

The creepy and astounding score also lend major points to an otherwise average horror thriller story. The movie was genuinely creepy and somewhat scary at several moments but scary in a suspenseful way and not so much a frightening way. With the slew of horrible horror movies high budgets and low this one definitely stands out as above average and unique in it's own way.

More than her grand exit in the beginning of the movie! If you have Sean Young I think that you should use her a little bit more not just for a few minutes! At least I got to see a lot of Jeffrey Combs who is really great in a role where he doesn't play someone crazy! Patrick Kilpatrick was great too. He gave me the Goosebumps! This movie was really amazing! Like a crazy painting or something an artist would have dreamed! Tick tick and the nightmare begins Tick tick dreams and reality are mixed with one another. Dreams made of crystals and a fragile reality. What would you choose if you could? In the middle of these two worlds is a girl suffering from a sleeping disorder. What will she do? Tick tick time is passing by. A crazy movie which deserves a chance so give it a try. I think that most of you will like this one. It is a really great thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I saw this film at Screamfest in Los Angeles a couple of months ago. I enjoyed the film a lot but I usually do not write reviews so a nice night out was all that was going to come of it. Anyway I came across an article about the real condition of parasomnia and now I can't stop thinking about the movie. When I saw it I just figured it was a re telling of the sleeping beauty story in an updated fashion. What I didn't know at the time was that the real condition of parasomnia has ordinary people doing crazy things in their sleep. The article I read was from the NY Times I believe and it was a whole study on how people do absurd and often violent things while dreaming and can't remember a thing in the morning. Their dreams are so realistic they can't discern reality from fiction. ANYWAY knowing this now I must say the film really takes the images of dreams and turns them into something so much more terrifying. The dream sequences have amazing visuals and images that on their own are quite amazing. It is however a lot more terrifying to know that people with this disorder could actually be going through the same thing as the main character of this film. It would be a living hell!! On its own the film was really fun to watch and had some really tense moments. There is also a sequence at the end that involves some strange props vague I know but I'm trying to spoil it which are really unsettling. Definitely worth a watch if you like horror films that do not rely on lame CGI and like films that have great visuals.".

	schema:headline " PARASOMNIAWritten and Directed by William Malone";
	schema:reviewBody "I was privileged last night to attend a screening of a new film entitled PARASOMNIA written and directed by WILLIAM MALONE House on Haunted Hill1999 FeardotCom2002 Masters of HorrorFair Haired Child. PARASOMNIA is part of Screamfest 2008 the annual horror film festival but this film spans more than just the horror genre. It is somewhat outside the horror box in that it is more of a dark twisted nightmare of a fairy tale almost creating its own visually exciting genre.The story tells of DANNY DYLAN PURCELL a young man who becomes fascinated with a modern Sleeping Beauty in LAURA BAXTER portrayed by the delightful and charming newcomer CHERLIN Wilson who suffers from Parasomnia or the Sleeping Beauty syndrome which causes her to sleep more often than wake. He comes across her in the psyche ward of a hospital while visiting his artist friend BILLY DOV TIEFENBACH incarcerated there on a court forced rehab.Like any good ghost or horror story Billy tells Danny about the girl and the insane serial killer held in the padded cell next to her one BYRON VOLPE wonderfully played by veteran bad guy PATRICK KILPATRICK. Volpe a rare book dealer and mesmerist used his unnerving mental powers to control his victims especially his exwife a much too brief cameo by SEAN YOUNG to commit suicide or murder.Somehow Volpe has the ability to enter Laura's dreams tormenting her in a bizarre dream world A place worthy of Guillermo Del Toro he controls. Danny realizes he met Laura when they were both children and his fascination with her turns to love. Upon learning she is going to be transferred to the custody of DR. EGON BHYLE LOUIS GRAHAM and his questionable sleep disorder clinic for experiments Danny plots to rescue Laura from her labrat fate.Not realizing Volpe considers the helpless girl his possession Danny successfully absconds with Laura taking her to his artist's apartment. Along the way the girl awakes in Danny's car and unaccustomed to finding herself outside the hospital freaks out a little. When Danny pulls over to calm her Laura is out of the car diving head long into the moist grass. Wilson pulls this scene off with an innocent charm without it descending into camp as she falls back asleep face in the grass.Once at Danny's apartment he cleans her up in a scene that in another's hands could have come off as salacious with it's partial nudity. To Malone's and his actor's credit this scene plays with an innocent tenderness and charm. In an ensuing sequence Danny takes Laura out to an ice cream parlor which turns into a comic exploration of strawberry ice cream again charmingly played by Wilson.Then things get dark as Volpe's power over Laura invades her dreams. Danny awakes to find Laura clad in a cheerleader's outfit stolen from his neighbor covered in blood and wielding a butcher knife under Vople's mental control as she tries to kill Danny. He manages to ward off her attack only to discover his neighbor's mutilated body.Enter the police DET. GARRETT Cult fan favorite JEFFERY COMBS and his partner DET. CONROY veteran character actor JEFF DOUCETTE who have already been to the hospital investigating Laura's abduction and getting the low down on Volpe. As Danny frantically tries to hide Laura from Doucette she again under Volpe's control frees herself from Danny's restraints and disembowels Doucette in a very graphic scene that will keep the slasher fans more than happy.Since I won't give away the ending I will say that Volpe escapes the hospital in another graphic blood bath to track down Laura and Danny. The film culminates with one of the most inventive innovative and visually intriguing sequences involving clockwork automatons the art work of Danny's friend Billy and the best use of Serge Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet Ballet Overture.Wonderfully shot by Christian SEABADLT and ENZO GIOBBE and lit in an almost noir style there is enough gore for today's modern hardcore horror fans yet PARASOMNIA is so much more. Malone's script is intelligent and he understands all too well that Cinema is a visual medium. In an era where most film and television scripts are still written like radio scripts where the actors describe the action you are seeing on the screen. Malone lets the image tell the story. The characters speak like real people speak. It is economic in its dialog.And in creating Byron Vople Malone and Kilpatrick have presented one of the most literate and intelligent villains since Hannibal Lector a refreshing twist after a dearth of mindless blood thirsty slasher villains.PARASOMNIA succeeds on many levels cinematically mood characterization and visual style. The dreamscapes are stunningly beautiful and jarring at the same time. The subliminal cuts are spooky. The over all creepiness of the film is balanced with the innocence of Dylan Purcell and Cherilan Wilson's portrayals. And Wilson is quite a find. She shines in the scenes of Laura rediscovering the world then seamlessly transitions into a vicious killer under Volpe's control and back to the somnambulistic Laura. Also look for an amusing cameo by director JOHN LANDIS.PARASOMNIA is such an unusual and entertaining film it stands on its own. Whether it gets a theatrical release or goes straight to DVD don't miss this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Initially when I picked up Parasomnia from Amazon it was simply because Jeffrey Combs is in the movie. But I must admit that I didn't particularly have any expectations to it as I had never heard about the movie before and happened to come across it by sheer luck.Having seen it now I must admit that I am positively surprised because the movie turned out to be quite interesting and had some really interesting visuals and some disturbing images and ideas. And that was really something new and fresh to see and it helped the movie quite a lot.The story is about young art student Danny Sloan played by Dylan Purcell who comes across Laura Baxter played by Cherilyn Wilson who is suffering from 'parasomnia'. Laura is in a health facility where the dangerous massmurdering mentalisthypnotist Byron Volpe played by Patrick Kilpatrick. Byron is in love with Laura and Danny's clever plan to help Laura escape from the hospital sets in motion a murderous rage in Byron. With police detective Garrett played by Jeffrey Combs on the case time is slowly ticking out for Danny as the police and the dangerous murderer is closing in on him.Despite the story seeming like it is fairly standard and generic it does offer something unique and interesting to the horror genre. And it is well worth watching if not for anything else then for the visuals alone because there are some rather disturbing images and visuals throughout the movie.The people cast for the movie did good jobs with their given roles and it was nice to see some new faces on the screen and have them do good jobs with their characters.For horror and thriller fans alike then Parasomnia is definitely worth watching and I was thoroughly entertained by it.".

This movie doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight and here is why. First you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are not believable in the way they act and interact. Example  Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here. I mean what is that? he looks like he's on the toilet or something. I loved him in reanimator and the way he was playing the intenseneurotic unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. But not for this he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner it's not natural I'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during filming. The movie is basically on life support it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come.".

That's basically the whole movie.I'll admit the only reason I watch this movie was because Jeffrey Combs was in it. And it's the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars. This movie is bad. The plot makes no since seemingly jumps from one thing to the other. The acting seems forced in places. Events that happen in the movie seem to farfetched to be believable making this movie even harder to watch. And the ending....sigh.....what even was that. It makes no since and again is too unbelievably farfetched.I do not recommend this movie to anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "At first glance the movie might seem like its using clichd motifs  themes like boy meets girl and the intelligent serial killer. In fact it uses these to create something new. But in order to appreciate it one has to to know a little horror and to think a little for oneself  not much no riddles here its just that unless you've seen a lot of horror movies and read horror literature you will probably not see whats new here. So what is new you might ask. Well for instance a serial killer who is in fact a mesmerizer which together with the focus on dolls and automatons puts us back to the early 19th century with stories such as Der Sandmann by Hoffmann.This is not a movie for the viewer whose experience in horror movies only encompasses the new sequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Paranormal Activity etc and feels violated when a movie doesn't explain everything at all time not that there's any riddles here and on top of it if one dislike movies that don't actively grab the viewer by the collar making up for hisher innate lack of engagement then one is bound to be disappointed in this movie. Which is a good thing since mainstream movies that fulfill these criteria will never last especially long.This is an intelligent Gothic movie for the connoisseur. ".

In the room next door sees a young beautiful woman named Laura Baxter Cherilyn Wilson who suffers from parasomnia which is a very rare condition in which she spends most of the time asleep  is only awake for a few minutes at a time Danny becomes fascinated  enchanted with Laura  when he finds out that she is going to be experimented on Danny kidnaps her. Meanwhile serial killer Volpe had a psychic connection with Laura  could manipulate her dreams  thoughts angry that Danny has taken her Volpe escapes  hunts them down as the bodies pile up Danny  Laura find themselves running from a serial killer  the police...Written  directed by William Malone who also apparently financed the whole project himself this part horror part thriller part romantic comedy which could be described as a dark fairy tale is a really good film  just stops short of being an excellent one I personally think there's lots here to admire  like. The romantic side of the plot with Danny falling for Laura who has this rare condition in which she spends most of her time asleep is cute  could have been turned into a neat little Rom Com on it's own the idea is charming  certainly grabs you  the concept manages to create a lot of sympathy for the two character's  as it builds up during the film it makes the rather sad ending quite heartfelt. Parasomnia starts off quite strikingly with a woman receiving a phone call  then jumping off a building to her death as the camera follows her down  there's lots of little touches  moments that stick in the mind the gruesome climax played out to classical music or the dreams that Laura has  Volpe invades to some amusing  sometimes dramatic moments when Laura suddenly falls asleep. The film lasts for 100 odd minutes but it takes time build the story  character's up to really good effect which ultimately makes the film so much more rewarding in the end. An often engrossing film  one that feels refreshing original  different to the mundane slashers  faceless clones that litter the horror genre my only problems are that Danny falls in love with Laura too quickly he only sees her lying in bed for a few minutes  then suddenly he loves her? He'd never even spoken to her  just how easy it was for Danny to simply walk out of a maximum security hospital ward it did have a serial killer there but these are minor complaints to what is otherwise a really good film  one of the best original horror films I've seen in the recent past.Parasomnia is very artistic  stylish too the general look of the film felt to me like a detective noir thriller with not much colour to the picture the overall look just felt a little period. There are plenty of striking images throughout  it's a dark atmospheric  often twisted tale of love between two people which at it's core is what Parasomnia is all about. Maybe not as gory or bloody as some may like there's still a couple of gory bits as someone is stabbed in the stomach  his guts start to fall out someone is stabbed in the eyes with syringes  there's a gory slashed throat. While definitely original there are recognisable influences here from A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 with a sadistic killer entering dreams along with The Silence of the Lambs 1991 with that mask  a serial killer who talks in eloquent quotes  riddles are two that spring to mind.Filmed in Los Angeles this looks great with memorable production design good special effects  great choice  usage of music. There is some good acting here from a good cast including Timothy Bottoms the always watchable Jeffrey Combs  an intense performance from Patrick Kilpatrick as the bad guy.Parasomnia is a great twisted little dark fairy tale about love I will stop just short of calling it excellent as I am not sure if I would want to see it again anytime soon but if your looking for something original  striking then Parasomnia is well worth watching. I was impressed  Parasomnia is one of the better indie horror films I have seen.".

PARASOMNIA is the film that Malone has come close to over the years but he needed the right kind of material to go with his stunning visual style and art direction. He also aligns himself with one hell of a cast with a likable Purcell as the young hero in love with the gorgeous Wilson also providing Kilpatrick with his best part in ages. Combs has also starred in Malone's FEARDOTCOM  HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and he adds the idiosyncratic gum chewing as a trait that distinguishes his nervy detective bummed that he must continue to come across bloody crime scenes.

Timothy Bottoms has a small role as one of Laura's caring doctors who explains her condition to Danny and later at the end to Danny's musicloving rock aficionado pal PhilPhilip Newby. Sean Young has a cameo and does it leave an impact opening the film expressing Volpe's insane abilities to cause humans to do whatever he so wishes including suicide.

Malone should be proud of this movie because it very well could be his finest hour as a director..unlike films of the past PARASOMNIA doesn't wallow in unpleasantness although it certainly has a nasty psychopath probably Malone's most effective human monstereven though Stephen Rea wasn't no boy scout.".

Much to my surprise Alain RobbeGrillet's TransEuropExpress is one of the most entertaining and involving films I've ever seen managing to be cerebral and clever as can be while never giving into being impenetrable for the sake of being impenetrable.Robert McKee classifies TransEuropExpress as a 'nonplot' film and even though the film has two separate 'plots' I suppose it would be accurate enough to say that it doesn't really focus on telling a story set in stone. Classifying the film by genre is equally difficult it is a somewhat comical filmwithinafilm a mystery an erotic thriller and even an espionage film for a bit. Let's just say the fourth wall has never been used so well in a film.TransEuropExpress is a playful adventurous film which seems to want nothing more than to toy with as many genre conventions as it can and RobbeGrillet does that so very well here. What's most amazing about the film is that it works on all the levels it's supposed to work on. Furthermore the acting is superb the cinematography gorgeous and RobbeGrillet's direction captivating and always interesting. I found the use of music here excellent but the sound mixing even more interesting. The attention to detail is wonderful.As many 'intimidating' films as I've seen and as many of them that I have loved I have to be in the right mood to see them. Perhaps the element of surprise with TransEuropExpress gave it an advantage but this really is one of the greatest most purely enjoyable films I've ever seen. Cerebral clever smart and stylish all without being too ambitious for its own good TransEuropExpress is a movie for everyone and for all moods a mustsee inversion and perversion of genre conventions. All film buffs should enjoy this but it might be of particular interest to one who likes the genres being toyed with here and I love them.1010".

JeanLouis Trintignant in the first of four films he made with RobbeGrillet plays a novice drug courier tested by his future employers in carrying a stash of cocaine which is actually sugar by train and depositing it into a train station locker  but this simple task is fraught with any number of unexpected complications including police interrogation and nighttime chases. MarieFrance Pisier is a very beguiling presence here as a whoredouble agent with whom Trintignant has several SM encounters in a hotel room until her double face drives him to murderor does it? Although I was aware that the actress had played Colette in Francois Truffauts Antoine Doinel series and had the leading role in the trashy THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT 1977 looking at her filmography just now I was surprised to learn that she was also in one of my favorite films Luis Bunuels THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY 1974 as well as Jacques Rivettes ambitious fantasy CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING 1974 which Ive just acquired via the BFIs 2Disc edition! What this film has that the other RobbeGrillet titles Ive watched including THE IMMORTAL ONE 1963 dont is a surprisingly substantial dose of humor in fact the writerdirector himself appears as a train passenger who is contemplating a film about drugtrafficking which given that he happens to be on the train himself would be an ideal vehicle for JeanLouis Trintignant! similarly when Trintignant and Pisier go to a caf he tells her that the waiter who had just served them was not a waiter at all but an actor playing a waiter! during one of the various meetings with his shady employers Trintignant is asked to repeat where he is supposed to meet his contact  implying a very complicated route  he simply replies Where at which his employer doesnt even bat an eyelid! etc. At one point RobbeGrillets fellow passengers complain that drugtrafficking is no longer hip and that diamondsmuggling is the current criminal fad therefore Trintignant  Co. exchange costumes and settings accordinglybefore the director decides to stick to his original idea whim? after all! Incidentally this screenplayinthemaking structure reminds one of the contemporaneous Hollywood comedy Paris WHEN IT SIZZLES 1964 which was itself a remake of an earlier French original  Julien Duviviers LA FETE A' HENRIETTE 1952. In fact the whole selfreferential element in the film and its heady spoof on the thriller genre recalls the JeanLuc Godard of BREATHLESS 1960 BAND OF OUTSIDERS 1964 ALPHAVILLE 1965 and PIERROT LE FOU 1965 more than anything else...Unfortunately what I said about the poor video quality of EDEN AND AFTER 1970 applies to an even greater extent here  since this one looked distinctly like a tenthgeneration dupe with actors features being quite blurred at times and especially alas during the SM striptease act towards the end. That said the film itself is let down somewhat by sluggish pacing  even if the version I watched ran for a mere 88 minutes when all sources I know of give its runningtime as 105! As it is Id welcome a legitimate DVD release of TRANSEUROPEXPRESS and one hopes that the recent passing of its creator will inspire adventurous labels to pursue its rights.".

The biggest surprise for me here was not the much heralded though undeniably effective SM sequences but the extent to which humour plays a part here.

	schema:reviewBody "Why should I change hotels? asks the protagonist. For the sake of changing comes the reply.That pretty much sums up Alain RobbeGrillet's audacious followup to his debut. Even though this is my first ARG film I can't say I'm very surprised as his reputation certainly precedes him. He is after all the man who wrote Marienbad for Resnais as well as his own romans that burrowed holes within metanarrative.Two men and a woman apparently filmmakers of some kind board a coupet of the TransEuropExpress train to Paris. While on board they decide to kill time by improvising a script for a movie  a crime thriller about a man working for a drug trafficking ring and heading to Antwerp on board the TransEuropExpress with a bag full of cocaine. Playing on multiple narrative levels with the filmmakers serving as omniscient narrators and creators who create the universe of the story and improvise its details as they go along even going back and erasing things we've witnessed to accommodate for plot holes and inconsistencies sketching them again on the spot and presenting us with a pulply crime story torn that constantly shapeshifts before our eyes even as it progresses. TransEuropExpress is then in a flux of constant retroactive continuity expanding simultaneously forwards and backwards from a central albeit moving point in time  from the coupet of the train where the three filmmakers brainstorm.ARG takes inspiration from surrealist ideas of synchronicity reveries the 'passages' of Louis Aragon the Flauners of Baudelaire and the psychic automatism of Andr Breton.

	onyx:emotionText "Why should I change hotels? asks the protagonist. For the sake of changing comes the reply.That pretty much sums up Alain RobbeGrillet's audacious followup to his debut. Even though this is my first ARG film I can't say I'm very surprised as his reputation certainly precedes him. He is after all the man who wrote Marienbad for Resnais as well as his own romans that burrowed holes within metanarrative.Two men and a woman apparently filmmakers of some kind board a coupet of the TransEuropExpress train to Paris. While on board they decide to kill time by improvising a script for a movie  a crime thriller about a man working for a drug trafficking ring and heading to Antwerp on board the TransEuropExpress with a bag full of cocaine. Playing on multiple narrative levels with the filmmakers serving as omniscient narrators and creators who create the universe of the story and improvise its details as they go along even going back and erasing things we've witnessed to accommodate for plot holes and inconsistencies sketching them again on the spot and presenting us with a pulply crime story torn that constantly shapeshifts before our eyes even as it progresses. TransEuropExpress is then in a flux of constant retroactive continuity expanding simultaneously forwards and backwards from a central albeit moving point in time  from the coupet of the train where the three filmmakers brainstorm.ARG takes inspiration from surrealist ideas of synchronicity reveries the 'passages' of Louis Aragon the Flauners of Baudelaire and the psychic automatism of Andr Breton. Or as Tristan Tzara one of the main theoreticians of Dadaism wrote in a letter to Breton Whatever we see is false. So with the story of TransEuropExpress. JeanLouis Trintignant is shot only to reappear in the final scene hugging the girl he strangled a couple of scenes earlier and which he subsequently saw performing in a BDSM club.

The result in this case is a parallel universe on one hand Elias trying to act like a drug dealer and on the other proceeding according to the whims of his creators.

And then there's the beautiful MarieFrance Pisier with her large inquisitive eyes. She makes an unlikely hooker but is she?

	schema:reviewBody "Alain RobbeGrillet's TransEuropExpress 1967 is a film about making a film. As such it is thematically related to Ingmar Bergman's Persona 1966and Vilgot Sjoman's I Am Curious Yellow1967 and I Am Curious Blue1968. That these European films were made almost simultaneously seems more than a mere coincidence here and suggests some cross fertilization of filmmaking ideas.In any case all these films center upon the same theme Where does the movie end and reality begin? The idea of course is hardly new for in 1599 it was Shakespeare who penned in his play As You Like It All the world's a stage And all the men and women merely players. The point is that stage plays and theatrical films are merely a refinement and an objectification of what everyday people do everyday. We all assume the roles that society assigns to us and read the lines off the script appropriate to a specific role all the while wearing the theater mask for that socially assigned role.But it is Bergman in his Persona who most clearly articulates the main issue here that while we are wearing various social masks assuming our various social selfs we are to some extent cutting ourselves off from our true inner self. This is where the inauthenticity the emptiness and the lack of real meaning in life that the Existentialists love to talk about emanates.This is significant to the character of the protagonist Elias in TransEuropExpress because he comes across as a man without a real self a genuine self. In fact the viewer never learns the protagonist's real name for Elias is an alias thusly making our protagonist somewhat anonymous somewhat lacking in a real self in the storyline itself. Add to that the fact that his mission in the film as a drug courier is a role that was recently assigned to him a role then that his is just rehearsing and thus distant from his real self and we have a perfect model of a seemingly everyday man who has donned a social mask and is merely playing a contrived social role . Elias' proclivity toward prostitutes and sadomasochism is particularly interesting in this regard too because his brutal sadomasochistic persona which emerges when he is alone with a prostitute seems alien to his personality in all other scenes in the film. So the sadomasochistic Elias is prominently portrayed as an assumed social role an assumed social mask as well somehow divorced from his real genuineinner self.In short Elias as a role in a contrived screenplay is little more real than the actual Elias portrayed in the reality of the drug smuggling operation itself. Elias as both portrayed in the film as a figment of a screenwriter's imagination as a real person using an alias in a drug smuggling scheme are equally unreal equally inauthentic as the Existentialists like to say.As such the character Elias is somewhat reminiscent of the Beatles song Nowhere Man which was coincidentally or not released in 1966. All the way around Elias in this film is a Nowhere Man just as we all are to a certain extent as we offer ourselves as the willing pawns of the social institutions and the social influences all around us in our everyday lives.".

Ellen is totally convincing in her role of a woman disappointed by and still searching for love. The casting was brilliant. Hope Davis Bill Pullman Joan Plowright Dean Stockwell and Joan Cusack are an awesome ensemble. The premise of the movie is simple and straightforward enough to be believable but broad enough to allow for any number of crazy things to happen. Her character's job as a talk show producer is brilliant because it allows for cameos of all of Ellen's comic colleagues. It is also an oldfashion comedy in the tradition of It's A Mad Mad Mad World and all of the other 60's comedies showcasing standup acts like Martin  Lewis Bob Hope etc. This movie was a lot of fun and I've seen it quite a few times.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS THROUGH I watched this movie never having heard anything about it so I was able to decide for myself without knowing anything about what it was going to be about. I'm not going to say there wasn't any comedy in this movie because there was. There were moments of total hilarity due to an hysterical Bill Pullman who was really in top comedic form. The problem is when those moments were NOT happening the movie just wasn't very good. It was a great premise but there were a lot of things about the movie overall that I did not enjoy.This movie was strongest in the beginning where I thought it was going to be a movie similar to Bridget Jones Diary. But I felt the movie went downhill fairly quickly. I guess this is what one would call a black comedy but as with many of this genre I felt the movie was to focused on the meanness and not so much on the comedy. When Pullman's character first starts unraveling it's OK but after awhile it becomes a bit of overkill. The movie just becomes way to cruel as more and more bad things happen to Ellen's character. That's the focus of the movie really not the comedy. It's almost like the movie's seeing how many awful things can happen to Ellen'c character and how much of her life can be destroyed etc etc. It didn't make me laugh it made me a bit dazed and frankly I just wanted the movie to end. Throwing ants and gum on someone and that person losing their job etc etc is not what I consider to be funny. The truly funny moments existed when Pullman was on screen because as utterly annoying as his character came to be he was hilarious. So yes there were a few moments where I laughed out loud.But those moments did not make the movie for me a great one. Another thing I didn't like was that the movie became way to over the top a Virtual cornucopia of melodrama. Inga  Bobrather then being funny were a bit obnoxious. The whole wedding storyline was way to much. And the movie felt so LONG. I mean I know it wasn't but it FELT like it was.Ellen was very good as the lead though and Pullman as mentioned was REALLY good and should probably have his own comedy television show. In a way I think I would have liked this better as a straight on comedy without the mean element or as a romance where Pullman's character did NOT change but stayed Normal. Or maybe even as a thriller or a film Noir. Basically I just felt this movie didn't work as a black comedy. I wouldn't consider this one of the worst movies ever made however. I would not recommend it either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Wrong is a little different as far as comedies go but hey so is Ellen. That's why we love her! So it may take a little openmindedness to get into it at first but my advice is to trust in Ellen and stick with it. Perhaps Ellen is not for everyone and chances are that if you don't like her stand up or other stuff then you will very likely not like this movie. However it is one of my favorite comedies. I have seen it at least 5 times and will definitely see it again. This may be because there is really nothing else like it it is very unique.

So you laugh and groan and generally admire Ellen's brilliance throughout. It is very reflective of Ellen's tendency to incorporate the many ironies of modern culture into her work and I personally wouldn't have it any other way.

So it may take a little openmindedness to get into it at first but my advice is to trust in Ellen and stick with it. Perhaps Ellen is not for everyone and chances are that if you don't like her stand up or other stuff then you will very likely not like this movie. However it is one of my favorite comedies. I have seen it at least 5 times and will definitely see it again. This may be because there is really nothing else like it it is very unique.

So right away you know this is not going to be an ordinary movie.A few months earlier as she explains to the authorities Martha was at her sister Annie's wedding.  Her parents think Martha will be next to get married as do about 30 other people.  But Martha isn't seeing anyone.Martha works for the KSDGTV program 'Daybreak San Diego' cohosted by Dick and Nancy.  Walter one of her coworkers Walter is a possible romantic partner.  But Martha meets Whitman when he selects the same song she wants on a jukebox.  They fall for each other and he meets her normal parents and she meets his quirky mother and her maid Consuela.  Whitman's family appears to have money and he doesn't have to work but can afford all sorts of expensive gifts even though all he does is write poetry. After a while it becomes clear Whitman has a fun side that Martha is too uptight to appreciate.  And things go downhill from there.  Not only that but Whitman's former girlfriend Inga is mentally unbalanced and very jealous.  And she has a very large but friendly sidekick named Bob.  Things get so bad Martha has to hire private detective Jack Tramonte.During the first half I thought this was just going to be a standard romantic comedy.  But the second half turned out to be anything but normal. Let's just say Martha appears to be the only sane person left but not for long.  Everyone else thinks she's crazy.  And what happens would be quite unlikely in real life.I'm not crazy about Ellen DeGeneres but let's face it.  She has this irresistible perky quality about her that works very well here.  Not Olsen twins perky but pleasant.  I can't stand Joan Cusack but I think people might enjoy her demented portrayal of Inga.Most of the music was good.  A lot of it came from the 40s and 50s or at least sounded like it I know Queen recorded 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' around 1980.  And Martha went to the opera.  There was also Mexicanflavored music in some scenes.  And a boys' choir sang 'I Want To Know What Love Is' by Foreigner which sounds much better here than in the original version.  Unfortunately Whitman liked Foreigner Toto Boston and REO Speedwagon.This was a really good movie once it really got going.".

Don't watch this dreck.Also the scene where she is supposedly high on LSD oftnamed by this movie's necessarily idiotic supporters as one of it's funniest is only funny because the filmmakers so clearly have no idea what it is like to be on hallucinogens.If you absolutely must watch this get drunk during it so that at the end it seems funny rather than infuriating that you just wasted two hours of your life.".

Wow! Angela Lansbury creates one of the greatest villains in movie history. She is phenomenal and like it happens she's the kind of monster you can't have enough of. Frank Sinatra is really good here and the creepiness of Laurence Harvey is unsurpassed. So well yes time has confirmed and protected the greatness of this outrageous thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "While many cast members did an outstanding job in this disturbing and often violent political thriller it is Angela Lansbury who stands out in her superb portrayal of a woman who not only dominates her son and husband but who wants to take over the entire country if not the world! In the end this is Angela's triumph and I don't understand why she took second billing behind any of the other actors.As much as I love Janet Leigh she was handed a bizarre and somewhat minor role here which I believe only served as a deliberate distraction in that she never influenced Major Marco Sinatra as an agent working on either side. And don't get sidetracked by the fact that Pinocchio was playing at the Manhattan movie theater that she and Major Marco passed in the cab because that was probably a deliberate red herring too. Granted that Leigh and Tony Curtis including their sensational divorce were quite the rage at the time but Angela deserved top billing here.When I read that Lansbury has only appeared in 54 full length movies to date it seemed like a number too small only because she leaves such a strong impression in so many of her performances dating back to Nancy the maid in Gaslight and Sybil in The Picture of Dorian Grey. To this day I am haunted by the memory of poor Sybil singing Goodbye Little Yellow Bird in the latter. Lansbury masters a wide range of effective acting from the kindly unassuming Miss Marple to the powerful detestable Eleanor Shaw Iselin here. In addition to a towering Lansbury the excellent portrayals by Frank Sinatra Laurence Harvey Janet Leigh John McIver Henry Silva and James Gregory as the annoying buffoon of a stepfather contribute to the success of this political thriller. I think that director John Frankenheimer and screenplay writer George Axelrod should be commended for staying close to Richard Condon's original novel and the stark black and white photography enhanced the gloomy and ominous atmosphere. The filming of the three separate interpretations of the brainwashing sequence alone was a unique and unforgettable cinematic experience.What a dish like Jocelyn Jordan Leslie Parrish ever saw in Raymond Shaw is beyond me and we have surely witnessed Harvey as the dark brooding character before Room at the Top Butterfield Eight etc. but who else could play this morose character more accurately?As to that newspaper headline Violent Hurricane Sweeps Midwest did you folks in the Midwest ever experience a direct hurricane? I know about the tornadoes and the floods but a direct hurricane? Was that another subtle attempt at humor by the director? Anyway I'll never look at another hydrangea without much trepidation and dread.".

When this was released in 1962 the HissChambers spy fiasco was still fresh in the public's mind.Other American political images are not for want of satire either since Lansbury and Gregory seemed to have reminded me in appearance of Mary and honest Abe Lincoln.The pace style and non stop tension rivals Hitchcock it will certainly have you wondering if he had anything to do with this! Truly Frankenhiemer excels here. Because Sinatra was box office magnet most of his other roles seemed 'fitted' for him. Not here! You'll have a chance to see the real Frank Sinatra really working to make the part work and without a doubt he too excels in his role.I don't think I'll bother to see the recent version yet.

	schema:reviewBody "By the dawn of the 60s America had not been through with McCarthyism the Korean War and Communist witch hunts when it was already aiming towards a Cold War situation and ultimately Vietnam. So much plays into this movie which came out at exactly the right time and place that even years later layers of subtext can be garnered from its paranoiac frightening images.Power is a deadly thing to deal with especially when it falls into the hands that should have it the least and the word seems to dominate every angle of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE like a glowing ball of fire. The power to control minds and bend them to darker wills. The power to control the people into believing what the powersthatbe want. The power to demolish anything or anyone considered an even remote obstacle. The power to seize power extend it outward blindly into a waiting globe.And so does this disturbing dark tale of the search for power in the political world takes place with some of the most indelible images ever transferred onto the face of cinema. Frankenheimer amps up the paranoia already oozing from the story and with some truly nightmarish sequences brings forth a Creation that always seems like it will disclose some hideous unseen force playing behind the scene  the deceptive hydrangea scene at the beginning of the movie and the train scene where a shaken Sinatra meets Leigh who seems to be sincere are two very uneasy sequences to follow through for example because both disorient and succeed in sticking needles of doubt into your mind in more ways than one. You know something is completely wrong here and what lies beneath is always unsettling than what is eventually uncovered.This is a character study as well as a political satire while there is plenty of tension throughout deep characterizations come through and needless it is to me to state Angela Lansbury's terrifying performance as Mrs. Iselin or Laurence Harvey's chilling portrait of a nonentity a victim and a puppet who's design is to serve as a killing machine and a false hero. Much can be also said of Janet Leigh's Rosie since her part suggests she also knows and is more than what she reveals but sadly the film drops what might have been an interesting side story from the moment she appears on the train and talks in that coded language. It seems she only serves to be Sinatra's controller. As for Sinatra himself he's an asset and a weakness. He's too old to be Laurence Harvey's equal in combat and his persona often comes through but he does tune in a measured performance as the damaged General Marco.MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is one of those stories that detail the loss of innocence in America with its killing of the more honest Senator Thomas Jordan and his almost pure daughter Josie done without music but in two long takes and its transition to a superpower bent on political domination and it chills to the bone to see it still today 42 years later.".

	schema:headline " Every movie lover will enjoy this masterpiece about masterminds... it's in the cards...";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not the most memorable moment of The Manchurian Candidate but it is too delightfully and subversively goofy to be ignored an inebriated Senator John Iselin James Gregory disguised as Abraham Lincoln is dancing the limbo George Washington would rap in a Simpsons' episode but that was three decades later here we're in 1962 and the film's statement about politics isn't just ahead of its time but also plays like a stinging retort to all the patriotic flagbrandishing and crowdpleasing Capra messes that anaesthetized the masses.To be fair Capra also highlighted the corrupting effect of political ambition but the Iselins would have convinced Mr. Smith to emigrate to Argentina. The Manchurian Candidate doesn't just satirize politics it writes as words of Gospel that power in politics isn't a mean but an end which means that the right and left distinction is rather sterile the whole point is to reach power by denigrating the enemy and brainwashing the masses. Under the armor of apparent cynicism the script brilliantly written by George Axelrod fabricates its own alibi. When you have a demagogue using the Red Scare to intimidate his adversaries and his mastermind wife implicated in a real communist conspiracy say what you want but it's a fair trade.On that political level only the film is a triumph of writing so ahead of its time it was deemed prophetic a day of November 1963. And that's something no one could ever foresee not director George Frankenheimer not the screenwriter George Axelrod not Robert Condon who wrote the original novel and not Frank Sinatra who was rumored to have limited the diffusion of the film in respect to Kennedy's memory. It would be hard to imagine that the film inspired the assassination but it did nourish the wildest theories about Lee Harvey Oswald being an agent of the Soviet if not brainwashed like Raymond Shaw Lawrence Harvey in Manchuria but being manipulated with extreme prejudice.In our world where Internet became a beehive of conspiracy theorists it's not difficult to grasp the appeal of a movie like The Manchurian Candidate it is not just modern by today's standards but it's disconcertingly relevant. And yet this a movie of many many layers on brilliances and the political aspect isn't even the showiest one. In fact I'm only going to quote the tagline If you come in five minutes after this picture begins you won't know what it's all about! When you've seen it all you'll swear there's never been anything like it!. Indeed I can think of a thousand movies like The Manchurian Candidate but none of them preceding it.The statement about missing the five minutes is also true in a subtler way. The first minutes aren't about the operation that get the whole platoon knocked out with the complicity of the interpret Henry Silva the point is to show that Raymond Shaw is the one who doesn't have fun and even in the next scene warmth isn't his strongest suit as he doesn't display it either with his parents. Granted the poor man's McCarthy is only his stepfather as he loves to mention but she's his mother! Yet the perpetually malcontent is awarded the Medal of Honor recommended by Major Bennett Marco Frank Sinatra and is described by everyone as the warmest bravest most charming man they ever met.They all repeat the same expression and all have the same dream involving a mysterious demonstration session lead by Chinese people and showing the bravest and warmest man casually executing two soldiers. It's not much the killing that is disturbing than the fact that it involves the two who didn't make it. If Shaw did kill he didn't let it exude from his attitude and with good reason as he was not only programmed to kill but to never remember that he did. Shaw couldn't pass as a guilty man because he would know it himself. The programming is brilliant and brilliantly displayed through a mix of dream sequences and solitaire games where the Queen of Diamonds play like actionbuttons.The directing and the visual symbolism is so straightforward that we never perceive it as surrealism the film maintains a very straight and legitimate aspect despite a few creative digressions that could have been borrowed from Hitchcock which encompasses an atmosphere of suspicion where every moment of awkwardness can be rightfully or wrongfully suspected. When the interpret wants to be hired as Shaw's cook our suspectradar is engaged but when Sinatra meets Janet Leight on the train the dialogue is so bizarre that we suspect something codified behind. We'll never know but we sure wouldn't have remembered the scene had they exchanged banalities.In the end there's also this constant feeling of an impending doom all through the film anyone can be a spy a mindcontroller an evil force and this is where The Manchurian Candidate gets its ticket to cinematic posterity. Indeed for all the malevolent forces it inhabits forcing a man to commit murders one of them being pretty hardcore for the time of the film or the level of corruption that shows absolutely no regard for the dignity of human beings for all the bad guys who populate it with their sinister smiling face the bigger bad of all comes from one woman. As the evil and domineering Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin not the woman behind the great man but THE great man of the whole scheme Angela Lansbury portrayed one of the most iconic villains of history a woman who knows no bounds when it comes to satisfy her selfish impulses. She's so creepy that it's not just the way she hates that is disturbing but the way she loves too.In a movie that goes so far in terms of originality we're not even shocked by Mrs. Iselin's behavior we're just fascinated. And what I said could apply for the whole film.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's not the most memorable moment of The Manchurian Candidate but it is too delightfully and subversively goofy to be ignored an inebriated Senator John Iselin James Gregory disguised as Abraham Lincoln is dancing the limbo George Washington would rap in a Simpsons' episode but that was three decades later here we're in 1962 and the film's statement about politics isn't just ahead of its time but also plays like a stinging retort to all the patriotic flagbrandishing and crowdpleasing Capra messes that anaesthetized the masses.To be fair Capra also highlighted the corrupting effect of political ambition but the Iselins would have convinced Mr. Smith to emigrate to Argentina. The Manchurian Candidate doesn't just satirize politics it writes as words of Gospel that power in politics isn't a mean but an end which means that the right and left distinction is rather sterile the whole point is to reach power by denigrating the enemy and brainwashing the masses. Under the armor of apparent cynicism the script brilliantly written by George Axelrod fabricates its own alibi. When you have a demagogue using the Red Scare to intimidate his adversaries and his mastermind wife implicated in a real communist conspiracy say what you want but it's a fair trade.On that political level only the film is a triumph of writing so ahead of its time it was deemed prophetic a day of November 1963. And that's something no one could ever foresee not director George Frankenheimer not the screenwriter George Axelrod not Robert Condon who wrote the original novel and not Frank Sinatra who was rumored to have limited the diffusion of the film in respect to Kennedy's memory. It would be hard to imagine that the film inspired the assassination but it did nourish the wildest theories about Lee Harvey Oswald being an agent of the Soviet if not brainwashed like Raymond Shaw Lawrence Harvey in Manchuria but being manipulated with extreme prejudice.In our world where Internet became a beehive of conspiracy theorists it's not difficult to grasp the appeal of a movie like The Manchurian Candidate it is not just modern by today's standards but it's disconcertingly relevant. And yet this a movie of many many layers on brilliances and the political aspect isn't even the showiest one. In fact I'm only going to quote the tagline If you come in five minutes after this picture begins you won't know what it's all about!

At any rate in order to get a message we have to think about the story for ourselves very carefully which makes it the very opposite of propaganda.Here's another bit of advice don't make the mistake as I did of thinking now and then that Frankenheimer is drifting from the point.  He knows exactly what he's doing at all times.  Whenever it seems he's offering some interesting diversion from the main story he's really telling the main story by other means.  How good the story is I cannot convey without saying too much.  Probably the central conceit everyone knows already which was why Frankenheimer was right to spill most of the beans as soon as possible  but he does has one or two in reserve.  One great thing about the story is that it doesn't rely at all on us thinking it likely.Everyone from composer to cameraman did a fine job and the cast does an even finer one.  Angela Lansbury gives the performance of her life.  Frank Sinatra I had never seen in a movie before and I was surprised to discover that he can act  very well too.

	schema:reviewBody "Intense Cold War era masterpiece that seems to grow bolder and more intelligent with age. A group of U.S. soldiers are captured one night during the Korean War in 1952. Next thing the group remembers is arriving home with Laurence Harvey one of the troops being given the Medal of Honor for some unknown reason. He immediately decides to go to New York City to get away from his overprotective mother Oscar nominee Angela Lansbury and her senator husband a solid turn by character actor James Gregory. But nothing is quite what it seems. Harvey obviously with no experience in journalism becomes involved with a publication that is sympathetic with Communist propaganda. Meanwhile several other soldiers from Harvey's battalion commanding officer Frank Sinatra in particular start to have disturbing dreams where the group is in a room during a dull women's meeting where the main topic of discussion is botany. Flashes occur however where the women actually become Korean and Russian delegates that are all listening to a crazed doctor Khigh Dhiegh who is discussing brainwashing techniques and total mind manipulation through various kinds of hypnosis. The dreams are rough and frightening. It seems that Sinatra has a rare form of war fatigue but there is no way to explain how others are having similar nighttime delusions. As he tries to cope he falls in love with the beautiful Janet Leigh and they start to have a relationship. Eventually Sinatra begins to put the jagged pieces together just as Harvey becomes serious with a beautiful young woman Leslie Parrish whose father John McGiver happens to be one of Gregory's main obstacles to a possible vice presidential nomination in the next national election. Who is really controlling everything from the inside and what is Harvey's main purpose for being brainwashed? Richard Condon's paranoid novel comes to life vividly in a truly outstanding motion picture. Screenwriter George Axelrod's adaptation keeps the momentum of the book at a fevered pitch throughout. Director John Frankenheimer only 32 at the time completed the one film that he would always be remembered for. His career honestly had a lot more lows than highs but his full potential as a firstclass filmmaker is easy to recognize here. The performances are topnotch with Lansbury actually only three years older than Harvey doing the best work of her career albeit in a somewhat small role. Laurence Harvey's tortured character is also a sight to behold. It is an immensely interesting role that keeps the whole production glued together. Harvey an actor I really never thought had much talent proves that when everything else is working well that he can be a reputable performer. And of course Sinatra is solid as he always was throughout a film career that hit its peak from about 1950 through 1965. Once again he adds a certain depth and an amazing complexity to an already rich role. Smart stylish at times nasty and always impressive The Manchurian Candidate is one of those pictures that continues to be a fixture in the American cinema as time goes by. 5 stars out of 5.".

Good thing I saw it too because after the Kennedy assassination it was withdrawn from circulation. I then got to see it again in the theater when it got a repremiere back in the late eighties.For those who believe that conspiracies control the world this film is for you. The ultraright has a game plan to take over the international communist conspiracy is given life and credence in this film and there's one character here who's got a conspiracy to beat all.When The Manchurian Candidate first came out the theater owners were instructed not to seat anyone if they came after the first 10 minutes of the film. If you buy the video or DVD fast forward it about 10 minutes and try to pick it up from there. It won't make any sense I guarantee.A platoon led by Captain Frank Sinatra and Sergeant Lawrence Harvey is betrayed by their Korean guide Henry Silva and captured by Chinese Communists. They are flown to Manchuria where Russian scientists from the Pavlov Institute experiment with revolutionary techniques in the newly developed science of brainwashing. Minus two men who are killed the patrol is taken back to Korea where all of them have been implanted with a story about how Harvey saved the rest of them and led them back through enemy lines to UN lines.As for Harvey he's the one who actually killed the two soldiers and he is now a brainwashed assassin ready to do the bidding of his handlers. Harvey is the son of Angela Lansbury who is in a role that's ten galaxies from Jessica Fletcher. She's the rich wife who is the brains and money behind her second husband James Gregory. Gregory is a Joe McCarthy like Senator who is forever yelling about Communists in every nook and cranny. He's a buffoon but he's actually not aware of how right and how organized they are in The Manchurian Candidate.Gregory and director John Frankenheimer caught one aspect of McCarthy's persona in his role. McCarthy never took any of this seriously. There are many stories about him performing for the TV cameras and the press and when they were away offering to buy a round of drinks for the same person he might have been denouncing as a traitor minutes earlier. The difference between McCarthy in real life and Gregory in this film is that McCarthy had no manager and no real ambitions other than to retain his Senate seat. Gregory if anything is managed.Frank Sinatra in having The Manchurian Candidate withdrawn robbed fans of one of his best screen performances. Only in one scene when he refers to someone as a 'cat' does he slip into the hipster Rat Pack image. Sinatra is the one who starts to unravel everyone's plans because of the recurring dreams he's having about what really happened in Korea.On the way to New York to question Harvey about it Sinatra meets Janet Leigh who really doesn't have a role crucial to the story but functions as an Alfred Hitchcock type cool blond. With what little she has to do Leigh does well.Lawrence Harvey is the key here. He's really a weakling and that's the key to the story. He was carefully chosen to be the manipulated assassin because of his inability to break from Mom's iron grip. Of course there have been few screen moms as evil as Angela Lansbury. She and Gregory really own this film and Angela blows everyone else off the screen when she's on. For her mesmerizing performance I recommend The Manchurian Candidate.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into The Manchurian Candidate without knowing too much about the movie itself. I knew about its critical acclaim but I was unfamiliar with the plot. Regardless when I rented and watched the film I had high expectations. I was not disappointed either.The plot revolves around the strange case of Raymond Shaw a sergeant who wins the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery in the cold war. Two of the men in his company however have strange nightmares that suggest Raymond is not as deserving of the award as he seems. One of these men Major Bennet Marco led on by these recurring nightmares unravels a sinister Communist plot. Set against the cold war paranoia of the sixties and McCarthyism The Manchurian Candidate does an excellent job of recreating the intense suspense and tension of the time.The acting in this film is superb. A great script is heightened by excellent acting in this movie. It's hard not to like Frank Sinatra in his role as Marco who is the protagonist. Laurence Harvey as Raymond does a good job showing us a character that is wholly unlikable and snobby yet pathetic and sad at the same time. And of course Angela Lansbury in her role as Raymond's malicious and plotting mother is excellent.Some standout scenes in the film were the nightmare sequences that brilliantly interlaced dream and reality the allqueen solitaire game with Marco and Raymond and the supremely tense climax at the political convention. The cinematography in the movie was very well done as action romance and tension all mixed together smoothly. All the scenes managed to keep my attention and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. As a thriller the film works remarkably well and it is quite easily the best political thriller I've seen to date.Keeping me from giving the movie a perfect ten are one or two little nagging problems. I wasn't a big fan of the music for the movie and it even disrupted the mood for me at one point in the film. It was okay just not great. Also the whole plot is sort of unlikely. I wont go into it here but I don't think that the Communist plan for world domination would fall into the hands of one relatively uncontrolled person no matter how well trained his mind was. That's just my opinion however.The movie is sort of long and isn't exactly action packed but it is very interesting insightful and even chilling. I had a great time watching it and I definitely recommend it if you are interested at all in seeing a gripping Cold War era political thriller. Besides the cultural relevance of the film alone is enough to see it.910".

A great film for me should contain with it some sequence or scene which recurs in your memory maybe years after you last saw it but when you think about the film at all just comes immediately to mind. I'm referring of course to the brainwashing scene which sets up the whole premise of the movie. The film also has an almost literally heartstopping climax and just for good measure the inbetween content is gripping involving and also has shockingly unexpected developments too. The fact that it proved tragically prescient of the JFK assassination the next year only adds a topical edge to proceedings when what seemed at the time fantastical and possibly farfetched on the screen manifested itself into grim reality a year or so later on the streets of Dallas.Said brainwashing scene where we see exactly to what extent the Communist enemy have control over Lawrence Harvey's character is brilliantly written edited and filmed the deaths of the two unsuspecting troop members as devastating to watch as they are seemingly casual to commit. Even more transfixing later on is Raymond's doubleslaying of his new fatherinlaw where a spilling milk carton stands in for the bloodletting of Thomas Jordan and immediately afterwards the unthinking slaughter of the latter's daughter Traci his own wife as he stands over the prostrate father caught in the horrific act of delivering the kill shot to the head.Yes coincidence plays a big part in proceedings like Raymond's love for the daughter of his detested mother's political nemesis Jordan or Traci's wearing of the triggerpoint queen of hearts dress to a fancy dress ball but these are easily excused especially with the back story echoing the rise of the McCarthy communist witchhunt. Incredible to think that such a vulgar loudmouthed buffoon as Johnny Iresden could get so close to the White House or is it...?Of course it helps that the acting is so consistently good by all the cast members. Sinatra as the main starring name holds the film together with a commanding performance and Harvey is brilliant as the distant but disturbed Raymond and of course Angela Lansbury is unforgettably cast against type as the devious and devilish wouldbe power behind the throne as Raymond's mother and Johnny's wife. However even the casting of lesser characters is spoton as are their performances all of which helps keep the film grounded and credible as it progresses. This particular film is one of my dad's favourites and he's rarely wrong is my old dad. It's one of mine too and a film that repays repeat viewings. I don't rule out watching it again sometime in the future so good is it.".

	schema:headline " The Candidate Is Still Strong At 55";
	schema:reviewBody "There are works of fiction whose very name can conjure up images and meaning for people who have never even experienced them. The Manchurian Candidate the 1962 film based on Richard Condon's 1959 novel is one such example. The film's title has entered into the public consciousness a term for brainwashing and seemingly incomprehensible betrayal in common use. Yet how many of those who use the term have seen the film and experienced what is likely to be one of the best thrillers of its era or any other?Part of what makes the film so successful is perhaps paradoxically the fact its based on a novel. Having read Condon's original novel a couple of years ago and then coming back to the film a couple of times subsequently it is amazing to see how much of it makes its way into the film. It's not just brushstrokes that make their way in but entire scenes with large portions of dialogue presented with little edits made to them the much discussed first scene between Marco and Rosie is a prime example. Even some of the costuming choices are drawn straight from Condon's novel. Scriptwriter George Axelrod is able to take the dark comedy of Condon's novel and put it into what is essentially a thriller that satirizes the McCarthyism of the previous decade and makes it all work together. Not everything makes it into the film of course but much of what makes the film memorable the plot and dialogue especially is owed to its source material and the wise decision of Axelrod in keeping as much of it as possible.Axelrod's script is only part of what makes The Manchurian Candidate the film that it is. Part of it is of course the cast. Frank Sinatra was a solid choice for the role of Major Marco who finds himself first facing a potential phantom from his past before realizing that he and the country he serves is facing a much larger threat. Laurence Harvey was likewise a good choice for the always odd and never quiet normal Raymond Shaw whom is at the center of the film's plot. Though given a top credit Janet Leigh's Eugenie Rose Chaney actually doesn't have much to do in the film except perhaps be a romantic foil for Sinatra and a bit of a red herring but Leigh shines in what scenes she does have thanks to her chemistry with Sinatra. The supporting cast is solid as well from James Gregory as the bombastic McCarthy like Senator Iselin to John McGiver as his rival Senator Jordan with Henry Silva Khigh Dheigh and Albert Paulsen in roles of varying villainy. There is one other name that needs to be mentioned though.Because perhaps oddly the real star of the film is credited fourth in the film's title sequence. Angela Lansbury's performance as Raymond's mother has become something legendary and not without good reason. Despite being not much older than Harvey was when the film was made and made to look the part thanks to what must have been some excellent makeup Lansbury was perfect casting for the role. For those who only know her from Murder She Wrote will be in for a shock as they see the same often quiet determination give in to bouts of conniving manipulation across much of the film's running time. Mrs. Iselin is the power behind the throne quietly moving pieces around while those around her namely her senator husband and son Raymond take the credit. Yet few things will prepare the unsuspecting viewer for the revelations that pile up towards the end of the film including a scene that is every bit as recoiling now as it must have been in 1962. It is no surprise that she was nominated for an Oscar for her performance as it still stands as one of cinema's greatest villains.Last but definitely not least are those behind the camera. The stark black and white cinematography of Lionel Lindon serves the film well with its neonoir feel that uses shadows and interesting angles to suggest how 'off' things often are. That is especially true when combined with the editing of Ferris Webster and when the two are combined during the film's lecture scenes or with the climactic sequence at the convention the results are truly stunning. Director John Frankenheimer brought together a fine team to help him bring Condon's novel to the screen and his work on the film stands as among the best of his long career and there is little doubt that it stands up so well as a result of his work.All of this combines to make The Manchurian Candidate both an excellent thriller and a fine film. From Axelrod's adaptation of Condon's idiosyncratic novel right down to its dialogue the performances of the entire cast and the direction of Frankenheimer the film is a masterclass on how to adapt a novel to the screen faithfully and yet tell a tense and utterly enthralling story at the same time. It's no wonder that it has become not just a touchstone for films but in the culture at large for it is simply a well made and enjoyable piece of work ever after fiftyfive years.".

Webster's crowning achievement was the famed 'garden party' sequence in which the malevolent communist agents are transformed into ladies at a garden club and back again the vertigo of the circling camera draws us into the actual mental state of the brainwashed captives. Each camera movement each shot was so exquisitely timed and placed that this is almost equal to the showerbath scene in Psycho as a classic of modern editing. This scene is still studied in film schools by future editors. Also the cutting in the finale scene at the convention expertly creates a Hitchcockian suspense totally dependent on the editing.Another aside Angela Lansbury 'cut her teeth' for this role playing the ruthless newspaper owner in the TracyHepburn film State of the Union.

One of them Raymond Shaw Laurence Harvey is trained to be an assassin once he returns to the U.S. Another Frank Sinatra tries to unravel the mystery of what happened during the war due to his nightmares.The screenplay by George Axelrod based on the book by Richard Condon seems busy at first but it concludes perfectly in three successive scenes at the end  all of them perfectly executed and edgeofyourseat thrilling.The first is between Harvey and Sinatra. It is a perfect wrapup of all that happened during their war imprisonment.The second is between Harvey and Angela Lansbury who portrays his mother an antiCommunist viper whose extreme ambitions are forced onto her husband Raymond's stepfather a dupe of a U.S. Senator. Back in those days politically ambitious women  both good and not so good  could not have their own careers so they had to manipulate and groom a man in their place. As Lansbury uncovers more truth in this scene she is chilling  not just for the information she reveals but the shocking way she delivers it.The final grand conclusion takes place at a presidential nomination convention at Madison Square Garden . The brilliant use of a crowd scene adds further thrill to an event that is even more shocking than the scenes that precede this one. Despite knowing the conclusion my heart was pounding before the grand event. This scene alone shows the true mettle of director John Frankenheimer who has done a great job overall. Another great scene is the brainwashing scene at the beginning.Among the performances Sinatra is great as the hero while Harvey is peerless as someone whose mind doesn't fully belong to him.

	onyx:emotionText "A platoon of U.S. soldiers is kidnapped and brainwashed during the Korean War. One of them Raymond Shaw Laurence Harvey is trained to be an assassin once he returns to the U.S. Another Frank Sinatra tries to unravel the mystery of what happened during the war due to his nightmares.The screenplay by George Axelrod based on the book by Richard Condon seems busy at first but it concludes perfectly in three successive scenes at the end  all of them perfectly executed and edgeofyourseat thrilling.The first is between Harvey and Sinatra. It is a perfect wrapup of all that happened during their war imprisonment.The second is between Harvey and Angela Lansbury who portrays his mother an antiCommunist viper whose extreme ambitions are forced onto her husband Raymond's stepfather a dupe of a U.S. Senator. Back in those days politically ambitious women  both good and not so good  could not have their own careers so they had to manipulate and groom a man in their place. As Lansbury uncovers more truth in this scene she is chilling  not just for the information she reveals but the shocking way she delivers it.The final grand conclusion takes place at a presidential nomination convention at Madison Square Garden . The brilliant use of a crowd scene adds further thrill to an event that is even more shocking than the scenes that precede this one. Despite knowing the conclusion my heart was pounding before the grand event. This scene alone shows the true mettle of director John Frankenheimer who has done a great job overall. Another great scene is the brainwashing scene at the beginning.Among the performances Sinatra is great as the hero while Harvey is peerless as someone whose mind doesn't fully belong to him. Yet even in this great company Lansbury stands out.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTSDirecting by John FrankenheimerActing in a supporting role by Angela Lansbury";

	schema:reviewBody "If you didn't grow up during the height of the Cold War in the 50's and 60's or if you've never taken the time to study it then this movie might be a little bit hard to relate to. It's literally immersed in the atmosphere and paranoia of the Cold War and the best way to relate to this movie if you don't have that background might be to reflect upon the fact that some of the paranoid reactions to Muslims in the current socalled War on Terror is not unlike the reaction to suspected Communists in the era this movie was made in.The performances in this are all topnotch. Totally out of character at least as I've ever known her was Angela Lansbury as the completely evil mother of Raymond Laurence Harvey and wife of the bumbling and incompetent Senator Iselin James Gregory. In a field of great performances Lansbury really does steal the show particularly because this is so unlike the type of character you expect to find her playing. I don't want to downplay the other actors though. From Harvey and Gregory to Frank Sinatra this cast was superb. I had a bit of trouble figuring out Janet Leigh's character of Rosie who ends up marrying Sinatra's Major Marco. She appears all of a sudden they get married all of a sudden. At first I thought she was part of the conspiracy  but I guess I was just getting caught up in the paranoia.The story is wonderfully bizarre  and difficult to follow if you miss too much of it. We know from the start that it's about an American patrol captured during the Korean War and brainwashed but you're never sure where it's going in the end. It's not the type of movie where you can fall asleep for fifteen minutes and pick right back up. Not that you'd be tempted to. It has twists and turns and you can never really be sure who the good guys and bad guys are. It all leads up to an absolutely stunning and shocking ending. It's great entertainment and  if you can make that connection between the Cold War and the War on Terror it still has a message. 810".

Frankenheimer is very interesting with his visions that he wanted to put onto the screen during his career as a director one of them including this masterpiece. For this movie I really thought that the movie deserved more Oscar nominations than the only two it got especially for Sinatra and Harvey for their equally wonderful work which this is Sinatra's best work since his Oscar winning turn for From here to Eternity.

It might have been revolutionary for its time but IMDb users who describe it as timeless seem to have undergone a brainwashing scheme themselves.The plot holes are large and plentiful and some of the acting is diabolical. The story of a soldier transformed by hypnosis into a murderous automaton is interesting enough in a Bmovie kind of way but the sheer volume of narrative leaps would test the patience of any modern viewer.Several key scenes are literally incredible. Frank Sinatra meets Janet Leigh on a train and five minutes later without any warmth on Frank's side she decides that she is going to leave her fianc for him.Leslie Parrish playing the leading character's lover chooses to wear a fancy dress costume that by sheer coincidence is the hypnotic trigger to send him into a trance. The likelihood of her wearing a Queen of Diamonds costume is so low that I assumed she must be in on the hypnotist's conspiracy but it was just a bizarre red herring.Other irritations include the buffoonery of John Yerkes Iselin the main character's stepfather who wins the nomination for the vice presidency despite being a hopeless drunk. What was presumably intended as satire merely undermines the plot.And in the final scene the security at the auditorium where the climactic assassination is due to take place is so lax that any old hitman could have done it. The evil communists' scheme to groom someone who could get near the presidential candidate was unnecessary if not counterproductive. If a presidential candidate were to be killed would the public really support the vicepresidential corunner if they knew his stepson was the assassin?As for the innovative fight scene it is terribly unconvincing by today's standards and can't have been that good even in 1962. Henry Silva Sinatra's kung fu adversary is downright awful but even his acting looks Oscarworthy compared to James Edwards's wooden turn as a spooked GI.The good news however is that Jonathan Demme's remake is excellent. The 1962 version is an interesting historical document but it doesn't work as a thriller.".

Yet importantly the film is not preachy but merely presents life in a matteroffact way.The female performances in the film are particularly affecting especially the young Hafsia Herzi playing Rym the daughter of Slimane's lover and Leila D'Issernio who plays his Russian daughterinlaw.At 148 minutes the film is quite long though this is not apparent until the final scene which seems to be prolonged in realtime for a particular effect.

He was born in Tunisia but was brought to France at the age of six and grew up in Nice.

This new story is a homage to the fathers the generation of Kechicne's parents who immigrated to France forty or fifty years ago.Hence the protagonist is the sad but determined Slimane Beiji Habib Boufares who as the movie begins is told by his boss at the port shipyard workshop that now sixtyone he is no longer rentable profitable his work is too slow he doesn't keep up with the schedule on projects. Threatened with no benefits because earlier in his 35 years at the site he was off the books and now offered only halftime status he quits. He lives in a room in a little hotel run by his lover Latifa Hatika Karaoui whose daughter Rhn Hafsia Herzi considers Slimane her own dad and defends him against his mean sons by his exwife Souad Bouraouia Marzouk. He owes her alimony but brings fish instead. The sons say he ought to go back to the 'bled' the old country they want to be rid of him.Slimane's eldest son Hamid Abdelhamid Aktouche is married to a Russian woman. His family evidently know about his philandering and especially his affair with the deputy mayor's wifethe need to conceal which becomes a plot pivotpoint.While Slimane is alone in his little hotel room Souad has a big fish couscous dinner with their offspring and their French husbands and children. This sequence is irritating at times for its clamorous shifting closeups and its cacophonous talk but at the same time the way this lively tumultuous gathering in close quarters has been shot is a tourdeforce of complex naturalism. When the sons bring Slimane a dish of the fish couscous he gets the idea of enlisting his exwife to be the cook in a restaurant he might establish in an abandoned ship.

	schema:reviewBody "Tunisian born French director Abdellatif Kechiche's third feature Secret of the Grain is dedicated to his father whose silence after a long day of hard work reflects the demeanor of the film's lead protagonist Slimane Beiji Habib Boufares a Tunisian immigrant who has been laid off from his job in the shipyards after thirty five years. Winner of best picture director screen play and actress awards at the 2008 Cesar Awards the film is not a Loachtype work of social consciousness but a rich varied multilayered family drama that is universal in its appeal. Although the English title of the film suggests there is some secret held by the grain the only secret in Secret of the Grain is how Kechiche manages to seamlessly weld together into a cohesive whole such disparate elements as the traditions of great cooking the problems immigrants confront when dealing with white authority and the desire to leave a legacy to your children.Set in the French coastal village of Ste on the Mediterranean the grain in the title refers to couscous a diet staple of Tunisian immigrants and a dish that Slimane hopes to use to turn a dilapidated old boat into a profitable restaurant with his exwife Souad Bouraouia Marzouk doing the cooking. Shot with a handheld camera that bobs and weaves through long takes of eating animated dinner conversations and emotional family disputes the 151minute Secret of the Grain has the authenticity you would expect if you accidentally stumbled into a Greek restaurant where an animated family dinner was taking place. In a scene at one of the two family dinners that take up half of the film the length and variety of facial closeups of people chewing laughing and talking in multicultural accents is staggering.The centerpiece of the film is Slimane and his clan consisting of his two sons five daughters grandchildren his exwife Souad his lover Latifa Hatika Karaoui and her fiery twentyyearold daughter Rym Hafsia Herzi who adores Slimane and whose energy and business acumen is the catalyst for his risky venture. Slimane a man of sixtyone whose periods of silence stand in sharp contrast to the loquaciousness of his family lives in a modest room in a weatherbeaten hotel run by Latifa. A generous man Slimane collects fish from his fisherman friends and delivers them each week to Souad his older daughter Karima Faridah Benkhetache and Latifa.The first hour delves into mundane family matters. When Slimane visits his eldest daughter Karima Farida Benkhetache to deliver some fish Karima's anger at her three yearold daughter who refuses the potty dominates the conversation which continues for almost ten minutes interspersed with comments about the decline of the shipping industry. Other extended domestic scenes revolve around the escapades of Slimane's irresponsible son Majid Sami Zitouni whose extramarital affairs threaten to drive his Russian wife Julia Alice Houri out of the family. The idea of starting a restaurant at age sixtyone raises much skepticism in the community and Slimane's plans are considered too thin and too unsupported by economic reality by the bank he asks for a loan.To prove the worth of his idea however Slimane invites one hundred city officials potential investors friends and family to the boat that he Rym and his son Riadh Mohamed Benabdeslem painstakingly renovated. The opening night turns out to be an astonishing tour de force that combines lifeaffirming exuberance sensual music and belly dancing and an avoidable crisis that leads to heightened family tension and a suspenseful final half hour. Kechiche a former movie and TV actor has assembled an outstanding ensemble cast with first rate performances especially from Boufares and Herzi. Though the film has many discussions about food it is not a feelgood food movie but a complex deeply intense narrative that elevates one family's personal struggles into a drama of epic scope.".

Fantastic acting by pro Hafsia Herzi who is going to be a big big star. Main drawback is the editing.

	schema:reviewBody "Cous Cous is set on the coast of Southern France in a coastal community where traditional industries are dying away. The void opening up with the decline of fishing and boat making industries is considerable and the sprinkling of tourist interest in the area does little to salve these wounds. The malaise and despondency of the community is encapsulated in the person of Slimane a taciturn divorce who is told at the start of this film that he will henceforth receive only parttime employment at the scrapyard where he makes his living.In the early stages of the film we are also introduced to Slimane's large and diverse family. The family  minus Slimane  is first brought together for a meal of fish and couscous at the household of Souad Slimane's former wife. This is the first of several long and engrossing commensal scenes. The rapid witty dialogue and the skillful closeup camerawork filmed around and among the diners create a remarkable intimacy between the actors and the viewer so that very soon we are immersed in the family's intrigues and laughing at their bawdy humour.However the family is more often in disharmony. The children yearn for Slimane and Souad to resolve their differences but Slimane is living in a hotel elsewhere in town. The proprietor of the hotel is his new partner and her daughter Rym is a close friend. Slimane's children disapprove openly of this situation but at the same time they have their own problems to face up to especially the wayward behaviour of Hamid one of Slimane's sons who frequently cheats on his fragile wife.Slimane's despondency intensifies in the wake of his enforced semiretirement from the scrapyard he regrets that his family is divided and wishes that he had used his life to create something to create a legacy for his children. It is in the face of this despair and with the help of Rym the daughter of the hotel proprietor that Slimane resolves to create a restaurant on a derelict boat  a restaurant for which his exwife will cook and which his children will serve in. Rather than turning the rest of the film into a modernday fairytale director Abdel Kechiche remains levelheaded and keeps his camera trained on the complex and often strained web of relationships amongst the family members of Slimane's divided family. It is a slow and difficult struggle for Slimane to realise his goal but Kechiche shows little of the construction of this ship in this long two and a half hours film.In the final stages of the film Slimane is desperate to secure funding for his project and decides to host a grand opening of the restaurant with many eminent local personalities on the guestlist. The dramas and calamities in the protracted finale seem somewhat at odds with the first twothirds of the film which is low on drama and feels unstaged indeed there are many nonprofessional actors in the cast and probably a considerable amount of improvisation. Nevertheless as Slimane struggles to ensure that the dinner reaches the diners and the grand opening morphs awkwardly into a longdrawnout party the film climbs to a thrilling crescendo and a devastatingly abrupt ending.".

I guess Hollywood does not believe viewers are sensitive enough to pay to see domestic drama and that the subject matter must always be bigger than Ben Hurr but our movies as well as many European movies have proved that the examination of quiet aspects of everyday life can provide extremely compelling material for contemporary films.IMDb commentators found it offputting to watch long film sequences about potty training marital squabbles and restaurant scenes however this is the stuff of myriad similar domestic situations that we are all familiar with. The genius being that the director can make these scenes rich enough to watch. Diane and I both believe he did this admirably as well as providing much to discuss and reflect upon later.We both found it different and endearing that we were allowed into the lives of people and their situations that would be closed to us without this delightful film. Yes I used the adjective delightful the scenes of domesticity were enlightening and compellingly endearing because we are inundated with Western examples of the genre but few such as in this film of other ethnic examples.A film that should not be missed!".

I guess Hollywood does not believe viewers are sensitive enough to pay to see domestic drama and that the subject matter must always be bigger than Ben Hurr but our movies as well as many European movies have proved that the examination of quiet aspects of everyday life can provide extremely compelling material for contemporary films.IMDb commentators found it offputting to watch long film sequences about potty training marital squabbles and restaurant scenes however this is the stuff of myriad similar domestic situations that we are all familiar with. The genius being that the director can make these scenes rich enough to watch. Diane and I both believe he did this admirably as well as providing much to discuss and reflect upon later.We both found it different and endearing that we were allowed into the lives of people and their situations that would be closed to us without this delightful film. Yes I used the adjective delightful the scenes of domesticity were enlightening and compellingly endearing because we are inundated with Western examples of the genre but few such as in this film of other ethnic examples.A film that should not be missed!";

	schema:reviewBody "Abdel Kechiche's tragicomedy is a film of contradictions and contrasts. It is both quiet and boisterous with a script that is both understated and energetic and which explores among other things how communities both accept immigrants and yet remain suspicious of them.Couscous follows sixtysomething Slimane Beiji a TunisianFrench shipyard worker in the French port town of Ste played with reserved dignity by Habib Boufares. Despite being divorced Slimane still spends a lot of time with his exwife and their extended family. The rest of his time is spent with his girlfriend and her daughter who own a quayside hotel.When Slimane is laid off it comes as the last straw in a life that has become increasingly redundant. Left with nothing to lose he hits upon the idea of opening a restaurant on an old boat. The project becomes a focal point for Slimane's extended family his sons lend a hand with the boat's renovation his girlfriend's daughter helps acquiring the necessary bank loans and official documents and his exwife will cook the restaurants signature dish  the eponymous couscous.The restaurant works as a symbol of the hopes and dreams of immigrants  how all they want is to integrate and work in their new community whilst still retaining the culture and customs of their homeland. But it also signifies the duality of a community's attitude toward immigrants. During a party thrown to promote Slimane's restaurant the guests all compliment their host and try their hand at a little Arabic and yet when Slimane's back is turned they whisper amongst themselves that he's not from around here. But Couscous really shines in its extended scenes of dialogue. At several points during the film we join Slimane and his family as they sit in kitchens or dining rooms and do nothing but talk. And it is a joy to watch. The script shows an eye for authentic dialogue meandering through topics as diverse as racism in the workplace the extortionate price of nappies and using Arabic in the bedroom. The genuine performances from the supporting cast draw us further into these scenes and the cinematography keeps us there. The camera squeezes between family members getting the kind of intimate closeups that give a real impression of a loud family dinner.This lighthearted attitude present in the early scenes contrasts with a grimmer final third in which situations get progressively worse. And as things get worse family relationships start to break down.This also reveals the film's ultimate irony. Slimane's family is a closeknit unit when the members each live separate lives. But when the restaurant brings them together family unity dissolves and they resort to serious bickering.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to this film with high expectations and came out with them almost wholly dashed. This is a film where there are a few high spots but far too many low ones.There are three major defects with this film. The first is that it is ridiculously overlong and thus ultimately very boring. Scene after scene is extended and extended and extended with the extensions contributing exactly nothing to advancing the plot or developing or even showing the characters. The scene with the girl on the potty just went on too long. So did the scenes with the wronged wife particularly the second one in which the woman wailed and complained and cried for what must have been five straight minutes  it seemed like five hours  repeating word for word the same line again and again and again. So did the belly dance. So did Slimane's run.Second the plot. Unfortunately I have to reveal quite a lot to make this good so if you want to watch it fresh don't read this. But really! First of all a 61 year old man with nothing and no bank loan first of all decides to set up a floating restaurant in which apparently everyone is supposed to work for nothing and then does so. Then on the opening night which is when he's supposed to show everyone how it can work all the cooking is done at his wife's place and transported there in a car. That doesn't sound much like a restaurant to me. Then they forget to unload the car properly. Then the philandering son decides to leave with the car because he finds his mistress is at the restaurant and he fears being exposed  despite the fact that his mistress is with her husband and just as keen on keeping things quiet as he is. And then Slimane leaves his moped unattended just as he always does and it just happens to be this time that it gets pinched. For Heaven's sake.Third the fake documentary style. Frankly I could kill the person who invented the Steadicam. As a way of making the viewer feel sick it has few equals and no superiors. And the endless closeups of people eating and talking with their mouths full may be realistic but the scene at the beginning with the family eating the meal together was no doubt supposed to convey the warmth of the family but it failed in its purpose because it was so repulsive to look at. We don't stare at each other's munching jaws when we eat together it's not necessary for the camera to do so when we're watching a film.There are good bits. For about half and hour while Rym the spunky young girl is helping Slimane set up his venture the film actually moves along and she's a convincing and engaging character. A number of individual scenes work well Slimane getting laid off the old musicians talking together Rym persuading her mother to go to the opening.But all in all it's overlong unbelievable and too often boring.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of Frenchspeaking Arabs somewhere in a port city on France's Mediterranean coast. The main character Slimane an Arab immigrant works as a repairman on boats and his immediate boss is always on his case about how slow he is. When Slimane confronts him the boss simply says the work is no longer profitable and that his hours must be cut. Slimane is in despair. He has missed two alimony payments to his exwife and as he brings large amounts of fresh fish around to her he discovers that the freezer is full of frozen fish the stuff he brought previously that hasn't been eaten. She tells him fish doesn't pay the bills and now he has to think of something.Slimane feels like a failure but thanks to the aggressive nature of Rym his daughter by his girlfriend he succeeds in obtaining a loan from the bank to open a boat restaurant that specializes in the fish couscous that his exwife makes so wonderfully. No one in the local community believes he can pull it off but he schedules an opening night and invites all the local grandees. There is live music and drink is flowing. His exwife cooks a huge quantity of couscous and everything is ready.To say more would be to spoil the film. Suffice to say the big night could not go off smoothly and still qualify as drama. But the star attraction is the young actress who plays Rym Hafsia Herzi. She cannot be past her teens but shows tremendous depth and rangein addition to an extra talent that viewers will have to wait to see. She is easily the funniest character as well since the rest are rather sad types that depict the dysfunction inherent in Muslim immigrant communities in the West.The style of this movie is pure realism. The acting is superb all around so much so that it almost feels like a documentary at times a kind of day in the life where some documentary filmmaker follows these people around for a few days to see how they live. What augments this sense is that the camera is almost always handheld and the image is moving around all the time in a method pioneered by NYPD Blue. I found this slightly irritating actually since it does not give much room for spectacular cinematography. My ideal movie is a visually mesmerizing spectacle and this film is not one  at least in terms of the photographic quality. There are some scenes where the movements of the actorsparticularly Hafsia Herzicompensate for this shortcoming. But on the whole it is unremarkable visually.".

As a kid I was terrified of this chore of taking the chapattis to the stray animals but looking back I see it as a custom which built in compassion for animals in our daily life.The acting which is uniformly superb by the leads Habib Boufares and Hafsia Herzi as well as the supporting cast is a collage of neorealist formalist and melodramatic elements. Rym played the sensational Hefsia Herzi is the real surprise in the film.Her devotion to her mothers old companion whom she treats with love and respect and the lengths to which both her character and Ms Herzi go bring immense joy to the film.Perhaps its her love which provides Slimane with the strength to pursue his dream of opening a restaurant on a boat.In the extraordinarily detailed final sequence we see a performance of very sensuous belly dancing by the nubile Rym as she tries desperately to hold the attention of the irritated restaurant guests who are tired of waiting for the main dish of couscous.As she performs the musicians who are mostly old men who stay at her mothers hotel play for her as they would for a professional. This is also an interesting take on how old men look at young women who are obviously sexually attractive this scene provides a very civilized and dignified answer.The film has many long and fully fleshed out scenes all of which are spectacular in themselves but when they are strung together in a film of this length it begins to wear us down a bit.The film is raw  in content  tone texture performances dialoguelocations and its use of a fluid handheld digital camera format.Inside its rawness it hides pleasures as wholesome and nutritious as the fish couscous that lends the film its title but I am afraid this film will end up dividing the audiences into those who completely immerse themselves in its voluptuousness and those who wish for a more economical and smooth treatment of this fertile material.Surely the director is aware of the perils of his strategy of not holding back of showing us exactly what he wants to and this makes this a very brave film.The film is set in Sete a slightly rundown but beautiful port city in southern France that I used to make business trips to. Watching this film brought back pleasant memories of the Mediterranean sea that provides a constant backdrop to the film.The sea is what both separates and links Europe and Africa historically the oppressor and the oppressed.Does Mr Kechiche want to convey this group of immigrants as being the representative samples of the North African immigrants? We do not know. But as an intimate case study it will serve as an important artistic marker in Frances struggle to come to terms with its colonial past and the needs of a modern French society in a post 911 world to banish symbols of conservative Islamic beliefs such as the headscarf.Cinema cannot offer solutions just mirrors and this film is a finely embellished one.First published on my blog mostlycinema.com".

Always that unadjusted narrative and of course the mysteriouspseudophilosophical ending. Well this one is a French contemporary movie that is not attached formulas. The contemplative look is sure french however the measure is precise. It provides an unbelievable and unexpected intimacy with the characters which is only recognized by the viewer as the movie comes to the end. Offering a particular time frame that values a constant and naturalistic look at the sequences this movie conducts you through the beauty of simple things in life as if it was the greatest conquests of human kind.".

Couscous isn't slow it's the Chinese water torture it's root canal without anesthesia and the film's endless highvolume conversations in which characters talk simultaneously so you can't understand a flipping thing are in themselves beyond enervating.

There's not one single morsel left to suck out of themnot visual appeal not symbolic meaning not plot advancement. Literally nothing. Kechiche sticks his camera on a tripod and goes out for lunch.

While the premise had great promise the great failure of this movie lies with the director and the editor neither of whom could make the decision of what should be kept and what should be discarded. Just because you film 3 hours of footage does not necessitate that you use it all.This movie could have spoken about how difficult it can be to start a business in France or anywhere in the west especially if you're an immigrant or outsider the important bonds of family and their difficulties and how different people integrate with each other. Instead this movie speaks about nothing. The characters are all selfish and cruel or just plain pathetic. The scenes go on ad nauseam and the director doesn't know or simply chooses not to edit scenes for brevity so what should have been a 90 minute movie turns into a 160 minutes exercise in audience torture. Is it really ever necessary to watch a character carry every single pot from a car to a building? No of course not! We're intelligent beings we can make the leap in judgment. Unfortunately the director doesn't think much of his audience and everything is painfully detailed and examined while revealing nothing to the point where it takes 60 minutes to even get to the part of the story where the lead character even decides he wants to open a restaurant  a plot point that is meant to be key to the entire story. Meanwhile were enlisted to sit through 90 minutes worth of unnecessarily long scenes of mothers shouting at and belittling their children a woman dancing to distract drunken patrons and old man running in circles etc.Add to that a script where the overall plot was written out but the dialog was largely improvised and all you have is a disaster.What did I learn from this movie white french people all racist all Arab men cheat on their wives all Arab women are cruel to each other and anyone who's not a member of their family all Arabs are unreliable and incompetent in business and Arabs are probably just as racist as the white people and would love to take advantage of them as they themselves are taken advantage of by the whites but they're just not very good at it. And everyone's a meanspirited gossip.In other words this movie is a compilation of clichs and stereotypes.None of the characters are likable though the lead is by far the most likable if only because he barely speaks so he doesn't make as great a fool of himself as the others do other than literally running in circles to his death.In the end making decisions is an important aspect of any work of art but especially writing and moviemaking. I wish those involved with this movie had actually made a decision.".

Why for god's sake to repeat the word Couscous thousands of times !!! Why to shoot these endless scenes of uncertainty and emptiness !!! If the film was meant to be a satiric movie and ironically telling stories about foreign families in France  I would say the director was genius because he succeeded to make me angry in a way that i can't remember my self getting angry in a cinema like that. But if he meant to shoot a real life image of these families in France  I wish i wouldn't have fell in that nest !! Orientalismpromotingabuse in the sake of making money !! especially when it comes from an oriental director in the west !!! I can imagine the success of this film in France and Europe this is the way they like to see the orient ! and he supplied the best material for that ! endless scenes of shouting belly dancing which made me not wanting to look at the screen anymore full of shame !! The kids of the new generation in Frnace against the old one endlessly teasing the father of the family.The editing was really bad. Long scenes. Interesting story and good actors but the emptiness prevails. Household super clichs and no proper ending after suffering for more than 2 hours ! My rate is 23  the points are for the actors .

Instead of breathtaking establishing shots of the picturesque French countryside and happygolucky dialogue I was confronted with unorthodox cinematography and fresh honest conversation. The extreme closeups aided the film to expose raw human emotion and the dynamics of family love lust legacy and betrayal. Stunning acting especially Hafsia Herzi caused the film to appear more as a documentary than a fictional tale  whilst retaining intimacy. Portraying a design with care and detail the length of each scene fully expresses the human drama occurring within it and despite the film's length the messages it expresses remained poignant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Couscous is enthralling in its simplicity how it deals with its subject matter with a great amount of realism. The subject matter here is Slimane a man getting closer to old age and after being forced out of his long term job in the local ship yard attempts to make a success of himself.As with many protagonists who are working class struggling in life and wanting to succeed Slimane faces problems achieving his dream of a restaurant as well as in his personal life. Slimane is shown to work hard in preparation of his dream by committing himself working on a plan to gain a bank loan with his step daughter and painstakingly decorating the restaurant with his son. These scenes are acted out in a realistic manner no exaggerated gestures or outburst but portrayed as ordinary people in ordinary situations. No exciting drama is needed as the genuine emotions already displayed in the acting are stimulating enough. Even when Couscous becomes heated in action it is never overplayed the realistic tone always remains such as the scene where Rym berates to Slimane about the amoral behaviour of his eldest son. The scene is acted out with Rym cleaning up in a kitchen talking to Slimane sat nearby listening to her about how disgusted she is with his eldest son's adultery. Nothing in this scene is overdone it is conveyed like any conversation in real life. The realistic approach the actors take is only one factor to the naturalism of Couscous.The hand held camerawork and fast paced dialogue is also a great contribution to the realism in Couscous. There are a number of conversations the characters have which serve no purpose to the core of the narrative but they create a connection with the audience with its common manner. Parents discussing the negative aspects of nappies along with dinner conversations about languages and jokes the dialogue contains a domestic vibe in the same manner as the cinematography which at times is like a home movie swaying in different directions to keep up with the flow of the conversation making Couscous seem spontaneous rather than scripted such as life. At the climax of Couscous where you'd hope Slimane will triumphed over the difficulties he has faced as we have dreamed along with him however it does not come to fruition. The main piece of Slimane's opening night is indirectly wrecked by chance and in attempting to resolve the issue Slimane's night is turned upside down and Couscous ends on an ambiguous note leaving us feeling bitter but staying true to life. As one character states that in life lots of illogical things happen. This is the case in Couscous where everyone experiences personal dispositions in a genuine take on life's struggles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Abdel Kechiche's heartfelt attempt to render the difficulties and vicissitudes of the Arab minority experience in contemporary France is an admirable and engaging one at least initially. For the first half of what transpires to be an overlong engagement at two and a half hours he's quite adept at delineating the minute emotional and psychological registers of his characters in a style reminiscent of Cassavettes. There's a strong pull in the way the predominance of closeups and streams of rambling continuous and naturalistic dialogue propel the viewer into an almost claustrophobic intimacy with the lives of Slimane's immediate and extended family members. One very good payoff inherent in this approach are the numerous suggestions of deeper emotional interests barely withheld even while words are ostensibly offered as honest indicators between people which does much to contribute a charged and vibrant texture to their various interactions. Unfortunately this rather heightened naturalism is drastically compromised by Kechiche's shift into unsuccessful melodrama by way of crudely manipulating plot mechanics to forcibly generate suspense and push the emotional temperature convincingly delineated up to now through ample character development in a clichd and much less satisfying direction for the film's remainder. It's a shame as it has the effect of belittling so many of the outstanding performances his wonderful cast contributes to make the film memorable and which not least earn much of our sympathies along the way. The complexities of the relationships which he so carefully orchestrated and which served to move us legitimately get sadly displaced by contrived events which eclipse this previously far richer focus by substituting a suspense thriller gambit will things end in total disaster... or can they be saved? This seems like dishonest filmmaking since throughout the film Kechiche has readily suggested some of the ways which could possibly work against Slimane's plans to successfully operate his restaurant boat and some of these are presented quite clearly as tantalizing possibilities. However and without revealing the ultimate fate of the restaurant's inaugural evening party what appears as impending failure is entirely due not to contingencies of personal social or political elements in conflict with his plans but sadly an unnecessary creative interference imposed by nothing more than a scriptwriter's decree an artificially generated happenstance which derails everything. As if this weren't enough Kechiche additionally forces the pathos needlessly by introducing yet a second incident which not only further dashes Slimane's hopes but unfortunately marks the film's entry into an unsubtle realm of allegory with the action suddenly acquiring a burden of obvious metaphorical meaning an approach that has been heavily and heavyhandedly favored in films by Makhmalbaf and which make his films relentlessly unsatisfying. And so the film quickly devolves even further into one in which the diminishing returns are painfully drawn out for the remaining hour or so with fully predictable results. By forcing a symbolic dimension on his character's plight rather than maintaining his earlier naturalism Kechiche effectively eradicates the conviction previously established in his efforts to raise our consciousness about the human condition through a fair range of many foibles and attributes of character generously displayed. To be fair there is some lastmoment evidence on the part of some of the characters of the lengths which the human spirit willingly contributes whatever efforts possible to salvage an impending disaster but an ability to come across as genuinely moving has already been undone. Considering the personal cost for Slimane in realizing his project Kechiche's illjudged narrative choices aren't just a major disappointment merely because he opted to apply the kind of cheap plot devices all too typical of the dramatic expediency found in Hollywood films. In this light it appears an act of disregard for his earlier humanism and hardwon truths so it's an especially ethical disappointment as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woosh! Man What can I say...?The openingscene maybe? We see a bunch of mongoloidbarbarians with bad makeup jump off the walls of some ruins. They sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily clothed captive girl. The dude runs off the mongoloids follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her. Then the dude still on the run sees a horse and tries to steal it. Suddenly a blond godlike looking hero with a bad wig appears saying That's my horse!. The Mighty Deathstalker just made his appearance. The mongoloids arrive Deathstalker kills all of them including the dude on the tunes of some rather inappropriate Mexicanos western score this is supposed to be a Swords  Sorcery flick so what's with the 'arribatrompettos'? and then goes up to Captive Girl and exposes both her breasts. He starts to rub them and Captive Girl seems to like it. She starts liking her lips and caressing Deathstalker. Just when they are about to get down to it this old dude appears interrupting what could have been the end of a perfect day for Deathstalker and a possible perfect ending for a shortfilm.Now tell me Isn't that the point where either a feminist would angrily switch off the movie or any other male viewer would say This is going to be one hell of a good movie! The plot is as simple as throwing a kitten from the balcony Deathstalker must obtain the Sword of Justice and use it to steal the Amulet of Life and the Chalice of Magic from the evil sorcerer Munkar.Aside from decapitations dismemberment random bloodshed retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights this film also contains a massive amount of t!ts  a shots. I initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked boobies I could count. After 9 points not even halfway into the movie I had to give up counting. It was distracting me from the rest of the movie. And the rest of the movie was worth it. Totally crazy stuff. Check out this mutant catwormlike creature Munkar has as a pet and which he feeds eyeballs and fingers. And here's an interesting question What would you do if a man in a woman's body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife? The answer is simple You slap him around a bit take away the knife and then try to rape him. Then you discover that he's actually not a woman so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room. It works out well I tell you. Deathstalker does it too and the Deathstalkerway is the right way!DEATHSTALKER is a wonderful movie really as pointed out in other comments. The villains are vile. The women are delicious. There's blood sex violence rape and tasty chicken. There's a completely pointless tournament which just features a bunch of barbarians beating slashing and hacking the crap out of each other. My favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer used to beat a poor contender to bloody pulp. And my favorite contender undoubtedly was that one brute with the Warthoghead reminiscent of the Gamorrean Guards from RETURN OF THE JEDI. I won't reveal how the movie ends but just prepare to ravish in delight when I tell you a 4way dismemberment is thrown into the movie's climax.And of course there's a wonderful display of ineptitude throughout the whole movie. See a guy being dragged behind a horse over a dirt road and the next pointofview shot shows him being dragged over grass no road. See that awesome tattoo on the sorcerer's head magically change sides within the same scene on shot has it on the left side of his head the other on the right. Well after all Munkar is a magician. It's that or this movie was shot in an alternate universe where things like continuity simply don't exist.As much as I enjoyed this and as much as I am looking forward to the other 3 installments in this series I do have enough shreds of decency left in me to not let this movie pass. I am prepared though to give it the maximum amount of minimal points just so I could be able to deduct a couple of more points for the possibly inferior sequels to follow. DEATHSTALKER might be a superbly fun trashy  sleazy CONAN ripoff it also is an abominable movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Woosh! Man What can I say...?The openingscene maybe? We see a bunch of mongoloidbarbarians with bad makeup jump off the walls of some ruins. They sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily clothed captive girl. The dude runs off the mongoloids follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her. Then the dude still on the run sees a horse and tries to steal it. Suddenly a blond godlike looking hero with a bad wig appears saying That's my horse!. The Mighty Deathstalker just made his appearance. The mongoloids arrive Deathstalker kills all of them including the dude on the tunes of some rather inappropriate Mexicanos western score this is supposed to be a Swords  Sorcery flick so what's with the 'arribatrompettos'? and then goes up to Captive Girl and exposes both her breasts. He starts to rub them and Captive Girl seems to like it. She starts liking her lips and caressing Deathstalker. Just when they are about to get down to it this old dude appears interrupting what could have been the end of a perfect day for Deathstalker and a possible perfect ending for a shortfilm.Now tell me Isn't that the point where either a feminist would angrily switch off the movie or any other male viewer would say This is going to be one hell of a good movie! The plot is as simple as throwing a kitten from the balcony Deathstalker must obtain the Sword of Justice and use it to steal the Amulet of Life and the Chalice of Magic from the evil sorcerer Munkar.Aside from decapitations dismemberment random bloodshed retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights this film also contains a massive amount of t!ts  a shots. I initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked boobies I could count. After 9 points not even halfway into the movie I had to give up counting. It was distracting me from the rest of the movie. And the rest of the movie was worth it. Totally crazy stuff. Check out this mutant catwormlike creature Munkar has as a pet and which he feeds eyeballs and fingers. And here's an interesting question What would you do if a man in a woman's body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife? The answer is simple You slap him around a bit take away the knife and then try to rape him. Then you discover that he's actually not a woman so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room. It works out well I tell you. Deathstalker does it too and the Deathstalkerway is the right way!DEATHSTALKER is a wonderful movie really as pointed out in other comments. The villains are vile. The women are delicious.

However having said this the heroes do still tend to be basically amiable chaps who adhere to some form of justice and honour. Take Dar from The Beastmaster for instance he seems like a really decent chap in fact as long as you don't get on the wrong side of him  in which case he'd probably slice you in twain! The case of the eponymous Deathstalker is rather different however for here we have a 'hero' who's immoral actions particularly against women give the main villain of the film a good run for his money! Yes it has to be said that in the annals of cinematic good guys Deathstalker at least as portrayed in this entry in the series will hardly be winning any accolades for his chivalry! Aside from the somewhat unlikeable hero the film itself starts off in a decidedly disjointed manner.In fact the first half of the film is filled with a series of scenes that make very little sense whatsoever! For instance one particularly stupid pointless scene set in a cave from which our hero must retrieve a magical sword left my jaw agape at just how ridiculous it was!Thankfully the second half of the movie is much better and features some rather exciting fight scenes as our hero battles it out in a gladiatorial contest. There is also a fair amount of gore on display here to a factor which always ups the enjoyment value in these type of films.Another positive for the movie at least from a red blooded males perspective is the copious amount of nudity displayed by the female cast in this. Hardly a minute seems to go by without a beautiful woman baring her breasts all in the most gratuitous manner of course!Overall then whilst this film isn't likely to be remembered as a milestone in cinematic history it does have a few of it's own Bmovie merits and is certainly not a bad way to spend an hour and a half or so on perhaps a lazy night in.".

He comes upon an evil guy dragging a flaxenhaired but dirtyfaced slave girl through the woods.  He kills the evil guy frees the slave girl and she allows him to pull down her filthy slave blouse and kiss her.  That's the first nude scene and it ain't much.A bit later Rick has teamed up with another warrior and an older gentlemen also on their way to the tournament.  They come upon some soldiers ransacking a farm and in a decent fight scene they manage to kill the soldiers and rescue the family before moving on.  Later that night they realize that they are being followed so Rick's buddy scouts out into the darkness.  He finds Lana Clarkson wearing little else than a mask a robe and a pair of boots. And a very large broadsword. And brother am I glad.When I rented this the only name I recognized was Barbi Benton longtime Playboy bunny Hugh Hefner mansion mistress and somewhatfamous actress she even had a top guest starring role on an episode of the original Love Boat.  The downside is that Barbi doesn't really show us much er talent. The real looker is blondehaired Lana Clarkson who is very pleasing to the eyes and also knows how to swing that broadsword.  Now that's a woman!As you might have guessed in an outfit like that Lana was eventually gonna have a softporn scene with Rick which is actually welldone as far as R movies go.  The scene lasts about as long as it took you to read this paragraph.They arrive at the castle where the evil king is having a great feast the night before the tournament.  As a prelude to the next day's entertainment he brings out Barbi who is wearing a sheer white gown and chains her to a rock at the top of some stairs.  The evil king announces that whomever gets to the top can have his way with Barbi.  Naturally our hero wants in on the action defeats all comers and upon reaching the top of the stairs has a change of heart and releases Barbi.  Such a waste of potential in my opinion.  I think it would've been interesting for Rick to have Barbi to have Lana get jealous about it and have her and Barbi duke it out in the tournament bare fisted and eventually barechested with the winner getting Rick. Oh well.  They didn't ask me to make this film. From there the movie pretty much goes downhill.  It's an ugly downward spiral that continues through the next three movies.  Lana Clarkson fans will enjoy this film because you can fastforward through the dialogue and get to the nude scenes.  Rick Hill fans looking for a good plot will be better off watching him in I The Jury with Armand Assante where he plays a crazed professional killer who has a thing for redheads.As for Barbi Benton get a back issue of Playboy.  She really doesn't contribute much to this film.  And I never really cared for her as a model either.".

The fight scenes in this movie are great particularly during the scenes where Deathstalker is in Munkar's brothel. There's also a great scene where Munkar the evil wizard turns one of his men into a woman another scene has a man turned into a snake and we also get to see a brutal battle between Deathstalker and a boarlike creature.

The early to mid 80s were the pinnacle of fantasy adventure films and there are a lot of them from this time. Most are very poorly done with atrocious dialogue and unimaginative go figure action sequences. I'm not saying that Deathstalker lacked either of these flaws it did not but it made up for it somewhat with ambition and attitude. I must confess that it has been many years since I've seen this film and it may not stand up as well on a second viewing. But I've always known the difference between a good and bad B movie. I actually miss the times that bred Deathstalker a bit. Although most of the fantasy adventure movies were bad they at least tried to take themselves seriously. The neat thing about the movie is that it is not epic in scope. For those used to Lord of the Rings or the like this may actually be a refreshing change. If you haven't seen Conan the Barbarian watch this movie first to save the best for last.".

	schema:reviewBody "...Or more precisely so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it! James Sbardellati's Deathstalker of 1983 is certainly one of the most awful productions the Sword  Sorcery subgenre has brought along but it is highly amusing. The acting is terrible the plot is pure crap and the effects and photography couldn't be more amateurish. But it is the bad acting the cheesy effects and the many errors that makes this movie so hilarious.SPOILERS AHEAD Deathstalker Rick Hill is an extremely strong and skilled warrior. One day a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation a sword an amulet and a chalice in order to free the country from its brutal ruler the evil king and sorcerer Munkar. Obtaining the sword is quite easy but the amulet and the chalice are in Munkar's possession. Fortunately the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county's most skilled warriors fight each other until death. The winner is then to take the king's place. Of course the king doesn't want anybody to take his place an therefore he has planned to kill the winner instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place. Deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation but also to save the old good king's gorgeous daughter Barbi Benton from the claws of evil Munkar. Luckily he doesn't get bored on his way to the tournament since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior Kaira Lana Clarkson in the meantime...The film has many great incredibly stupid and funny scenes. Some of my favorite scenes include Deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword. The head that falls down however is not that guy's head. The falling head has a red goatee while the guy beheaded by Deathstalker had dark hair and no beard.When the character of female warrior Kaira Lana Clarkson is introduced she is first seen in a black robe hiding her face and body. Deathstalker's traveling companion Oghris Richard Brooker fights her and during the sword fight her robe under which she is of course topless opens exposing her breasts. Her breasts are the first thing we see of Lana Clarkson even before her face.The last warrior Deathstalker has to fight in the tournament is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig.Evil Munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest. He feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers.... There are many other unintentionally funny hilarious and great scenes. The acting is terrible but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are eyecandy and although I described this movie as 'unintentionally funny' I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is. There is a fair amount of gore and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained. Deathstalker is an incredibly awful movie but I still highly recommend it. People with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives!".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember watching Deathstalker back in my early teenage years and that I was more than entertained and impressed with it especially since I had just taken up playing Dungeons  Dragons back in that time. So having a movie like this in the sword  sorcery genre was just great.And now having sat down to watch it yet again in 2016 I must say that the movie was not fully as great as I remembered it to be. Sure it is entertaining enough for what it is but it is a rather simplistic movie. And it is a movie that makes too much usage of nudity. Actually if they had opted to leave that aspect out of the movie it would be so much more easy to actually take the movie more seriously.The story is about Deathstalker played by Rick Hill who is given possession of a powerful sword. With the lands being ruled by a vile sorcerer who also seeks the sword Deathstalker is in for a grand adventure as he sets out to free the realm of the looming evil.Right well the story was adequate especially for a sword  sorcery movie right? I mean you have a hero you have a villain you have an overwhelming evil threat to the realm you have women in distress overwhelming odds stacking against the hero and you have triumph in times of darkness. Everything a recipe for a good tale needs.However the movie is suffering from having really bad props especially the stones that are supposed to make up the caves the pillars walls etc. It is just awful to look at. And it doesn't really help that the sword fights are prompted and poorly executed and who can't help but laugh when a sword misses a man widely yet the man still topples over and dies?As I mentioned earlier on there is an excessive amount of nudity in the movie and most of it just makes no sense and seems nothing more than a chance for director James Sbardellati to showcase nude women. I mean why would a woman wear a cloak and then nothing underneath? Especially if she was supposed to be a trained warrior? It just made no sense.But removing the critiques goggles then I will say that Deathstalker is still an adequate sword  sorcery movie especially taking into consideration that it is from 1983. Fans of fantasy roleplaying games and the sword  sorcery genre will definitely find some enjoyment in this movie.".

The plot follows as Deathstalker Hill tries to get something back from the evil lord and he has to travel to the lord's cave. He meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey and the settings are very close to Tolkien and of course Conan the Barbarian. This is a rip off of huge success of Conan and even though this is very stupid film it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkies!There are no many cinematic merits in this film. Couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating but what Deathstalker concentrates to show are nude females and huge muscles of Hill. Females are usually helpless victims and very stupid too so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists! The fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull and the monsters are not either anything special. And all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done but what did you expect from low budget effort like this? This tries to be as great as Conan but fails pretty miserably. As I said this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else. This belongs to the category it's so bad it's great!Deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be and as a turkey film I appreciate this almost as much as other turkeys enjoyable ones of course! If bad films are your cup of tea then try this and have fun but if you don't understand enjoyably bad films then stay away. And if somebody can't stand large amount of nudity then stay away as well. There is more nudity here than violence and due to these scenes the film has an R rating. Otherwise this could be some safe PG family film!410".

	schema:reviewBody "I like a lot of 80s B movie Fantasies and decided to check out the Deathstalker films after I watched The Barbarians on youtube which I LOVED.I picked up the Roger Corman Sword and Sorcery Collection and watched the first film last night and was not impressed. To me what makes a Sword and Sorcery B film so great is when the cast and crew are aware that they are making a sub par film and are in on the joke but with Deathstalker I felt like they were trying to make a decent movie and just gave up when it became clear they were too incompetent to do so. The Barbarians was hilarious because the tongue in cheek tone was present throughout the film but I didn't get that vibe with Deathstalker. I like seeing boobs and ass as much as the next guy but this film was gratuitous in the way they showed it and often not in a funny or sexy way. I like blood and gore but when the sorcerer was feeding that boy's eye and fingers to his pet creature that was just a little too far for me when it comes to a movie I want to laugh at or with.The biggest surprise I had while watching Deathstalker is that some scenes actually look very good when trying to replicate Boris Vallejo's imagery they were held back only by the anemic production budget but the rest of the movie is plain old bad film making. I just found very little charm to the movie which I find essential to enjoy trash cinema. The last 20 or so minutes are genuinely funny with some hilarious moments in the sorcerer's castle and the end is pretty satisfying but getting to that last half hour was a long hard slog.Maybe this can be enjoyed as a bad movie you can laugh at with friends over a few beers but most of the people I know would rather I just shut it off.UPDATEOK so I guess I have to eat my words about improving the first one because they did everything I suggested they do for the first to make the sequel better place tongue in cheek and just have fun but still failed miserably. It just wasn't funny yet they tried so hard. Army of Darkness is funny Flesh  Blood is funny The Barbarians is funny but Deathstalker 2 was full of cringe inducing puns. I think I might prefer the first over the second but the sequel does do a better job at portraying the Deathstalker character by turning him into a swashbuckling scoundrel instead of a thuggish brute like in the first. Aside from a fun sword fight at the end the sequel just didn't do it for me. I like how the first had imagery which tried to capture the magic of Boris Vallejo's art style the sequel attempted none of this. The bloopers for Deathstalker 2 should have been kept in the final cut because they were genuinely funny and the acting was better when they didn't think the cameras were rolling. If you're going for comedy you need some genuinely talented or charismatic people in your film but Deathstalker 2 failed at this. I actually have the urge to watch the first again at least certain scenes so maybe that one might grow on me.".

	schema:headline " Blood Gore Biceps and Boobs Galore!";
	schema:reviewBody "If the Spaghetti spear and sandal movies of the late 1950s and early 1960s were an acquired taste the sword and sorcery movies of the 1980s qualify as an even greater acquired taste. 'Greater' in this instance is used in a pejorative sense. Sword and sorcery movies are lowest denominator adventure epics that fixate on bared breasts bloody swords and beefy biceps. Some infamous tyrant rules a kingdom without right and a hero must challenge his dominance. Many classify these Hercules movies as 'guilty pleasures.' Nobody takes them seriously. After all they are ancient largerthanlife hokum about mesomorphic men and wicked villains pitted against each other in a life or death struggle in fantasy settings. Witches and a plethora of phantasmagoric creatures lurking about in caves fleshed out these movies. John Frankenheimer protg James Sbardellati made his directorial debut with the colorful but cheesy Rrated opus Deathstalker an amusing 81minute spectacle lensed on location in Argentina South America. Like The Sword and The Sorcerer and Ator The Fighting Eagle Deathstalker and its three sequels sought to cash in on the success of John Milius' Conan the Barbarian with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan depicted the exploits of a mighty musclebound troubleshooter who battled wizards demons and witches. The Milius film boasted a big budget thanks to its indulgent producer Dino De Laurentiis. Schlockmeister Roger Corman produced Deathstalker and it looks bargain basement priced. Kentucky native Rick Hill who later appeared in The Devastator and Warrior Queen provides the brawn as the eponymous macho man. Hill brings his sardonic perspective to this relatively thankless onedimensional role. Initially his conduct appears less than heroic. In the first scene Deathstalker rescues a damselindistress from loathsome adversaries. He slays these plugugly opponents who apparently have have incest as well as leprosy in their genes with skill and dexterity. Ironically Deathstalker resumes theire depredations where they had left off only to be distracted by a courier from a deposed monarch. King Tulak George Sorvic pleads for Deathstalker to rescue his comely daughter Princess Codille Playboy Playmate Barbi Benton of Hospital Massacre from the evil sorcerer Munkar Bernard Erhand of Firefox who used his magic to depose Tulak and plans to make her his wife. Deathstalker turns down Tulak's request.Later a crone of a witch Toralva Lillian Ker appeals to Deathstalker. With your strength and courage Deathstalker you can use the power of the sword to get the amulet. He who wears it cannot die. With the sword and the amulet you can get the chalice and reunite the three powers of creation. Moreover he will be able to destroy Munkar the source of all evil in the kingdom. Toralva explains that Munkar possesses the amulet of life and the chalice of magic but lacks the crucial third component the sword of justice. In fact Munkar sought to steal the sword from Toralvabut Deathstalker rode to her rescue. Clearly our protagonist liked her better than Tulak. The witch assures Deathstalker that he is the only man with enough courage and strength to wield the sword and consolidate the powers of life magic and justice. Before Deathstalker can embark on his journey he has to burrow into a cave locate a creature Salmaron Augusto Laretta of The Official Story who Munkar had turned into a monster and confined in the earth for 30 years without a glimpse of sunlight. Deathstalker clashes with a giant that accosted him in the cave and defeats him after Salmaron slings him the magic sword. LaterSalmaron takes advantage of the sword's magical powers to convert him back into a human being.Not long afterward Deathstalker teams up with the two warriors the agile Oghris Richard Brooker and the lovely Kaira Lana Clarkson of Barbarian Queen on their way to Munkar's kingdom. Kaira has no qualms about baring her breasts and responds to Deathstalker's lusty inclinations. The trio ride off to compete in an Enter the Dragon style combat tournament hosted by the nefarious Munkar. The latter wants to determine which warrior will become heir to his kingdom. Never does it occur to these pugnacious combatants that the sorcerer has no plans to die. In fact only Deathstalker seems to realize that Munkar is up to no good. Indeed Munkar only wants these foolish warriors to annihilate each other so he can kill the surviving champion and never fear about anybody deposing him.The saving grace of Deathstalker is that the filmmakers don't take themselves seriously and they have an ample number of scantilyclad nubile babes wandering around the ancient sets. Sbardellati does a good job of crosscutting among the series of fights so that it ends up being an exciting montage of combat. When Deathstalker swings his sword heads fly. What Sbardellati lacks in orchestrating the swordfights he equals with buckets of blood and gore. One combatant smashes his opponent to a pulp with an enormous mallet. The violence is amoral. Our hero shows his amoral side early in the action when he behaves as villainously as his opponents. Later after the witch recruits him to the side of good and honor Deathstalker reforms and behaves like a hero.

The most imaginative scene has Munkar changing one of his warriors into Playboy model Barbi Benton so he can get close enough to stab Deathstalker with a dagger. Of course Deathstalker never meets his match. Sbardellati and Barbarian Queen scenarist Howard Cohen kill off poor Kaira far too early.

	onyx:emotionText "If the Spaghetti spear and sandal movies of the late 1950s and early 1960s were an acquired taste the sword and sorcery movies of the 1980s qualify as an even greater acquired taste. 'Greater' in this instance is used in a pejorative sense. Sword and sorcery movies are lowest denominator adventure epics that fixate on bared breasts bloody swords and beefy biceps. Some infamous tyrant rules a kingdom without right and a hero must challenge his dominance. Many classify these Hercules movies as 'guilty pleasures.' Nobody takes them seriously. After all they are ancient largerthanlife hokum about mesomorphic men and wicked villains pitted against each other in a life or death struggle in fantasy settings. Witches and a plethora of phantasmagoric creatures lurking about in caves fleshed out these movies. John Frankenheimer protg James Sbardellati made his directorial debut with the colorful but cheesy Rrated opus Deathstalker an amusing 81minute spectacle lensed on location in Argentina South America. Like The Sword and The Sorcerer and Ator The Fighting Eagle Deathstalker and its three sequels sought to cash in on the success of John Milius' Conan the Barbarian with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conan depicted the exploits of a mighty musclebound troubleshooter who battled wizards demons and witches. The Milius film boasted a big budget thanks to its indulgent producer Dino De Laurentiis. Schlockmeister Roger Corman produced Deathstalker and it looks bargain basement priced. Kentucky native Rick Hill who later appeared in The Devastator and Warrior Queen provides the brawn as the eponymous macho man. Hill brings his sardonic perspective to this relatively thankless onedimensional role. Initially his conduct appears less than heroic. In the first scene Deathstalker rescues a damselindistress from loathsome adversaries. He slays these plugugly opponents who apparently have have incest as well as leprosy in their genes with skill and dexterity. Ironically Deathstalker resumes theire depredations where they had left off only to be distracted by a courier from a deposed monarch. King Tulak George Sorvic pleads for Deathstalker to rescue his comely daughter Princess Codille Playboy Playmate Barbi Benton of Hospital Massacre from the evil sorcerer Munkar Bernard Erhand of Firefox who used his magic to depose Tulak and plans to make her his wife. Deathstalker turns down Tulak's request.Later a crone of a witch Toralva Lillian Ker appeals to Deathstalker. With your strength and courage Deathstalker you can use the power of the sword to get the amulet. He who wears it cannot die. With the sword and the amulet you can get the chalice and reunite the three powers of creation. Moreover he will be able to destroy Munkar the source of all evil in the kingdom. Toralva explains that Munkar possesses the amulet of life and the chalice of magic but lacks the crucial third component the sword of justice. In fact Munkar sought to steal the sword from Toralvabut Deathstalker rode to her rescue. Clearly our protagonist liked her better than Tulak. The witch assures Deathstalker that he is the only man with enough courage and strength to wield the sword and consolidate the powers of life magic and justice. Before Deathstalker can embark on his journey he has to burrow into a cave locate a creature Salmaron Augusto Laretta of The Official Story who Munkar had turned into a monster and confined in the earth for 30 years without a glimpse of sunlight. Deathstalker clashes with a giant that accosted him in the cave and defeats him after Salmaron slings him the magic sword. LaterSalmaron takes advantage of the sword's magical powers to convert him back into a human being.Not long afterward Deathstalker teams up with the two warriors the agile Oghris Richard Brooker and the lovely Kaira Lana Clarkson of Barbarian Queen on their way to Munkar's kingdom. Kaira has no qualms about baring her breasts and responds to Deathstalker's lusty inclinations. The trio ride off to compete in an Enter the Dragon style combat tournament hosted by the nefarious Munkar. The latter wants to determine which warrior will become heir to his kingdom. Never does it occur to these pugnacious combatants that the sorcerer has no plans to die. In fact only Deathstalker seems to realize that Munkar is up to no good. Indeed Munkar only wants these foolish warriors to annihilate each other so he can kill the surviving champion and never fear about anybody deposing him.The saving grace of Deathstalker is that the filmmakers don't take themselves seriously and they have an ample number of scantilyclad nubile babes wandering around the ancient sets. Sbardellati does a good job of crosscutting among the series of fights so that it ends up being an exciting montage of combat. When Deathstalker swings his sword heads fly. What Sbardellati lacks in orchestrating the swordfights he equals with buckets of blood and gore. One combatant smashes his opponent to a pulp with an enormous mallet. The violence is amoral. Our hero shows his amoral side early in the action when he behaves as villainously as his opponents. Later after the witch recruits him to the side of good and honor Deathstalker reforms and behaves like a hero. My favorite character is Howie a cheesy looking Ghoulies type monster that lives in a treasure box and contents itself with a diet of fingers and eyeballs fed to it by Munkar. The most imaginative scene has Munkar changing one of his warriors into Playboy model Barbi Benton so he can get close enough to stab Deathstalker with a dagger. Of course Deathstalker never meets his match. Sbardellati and Barbarian Queen scenarist Howard Cohen kill off poor Kaira far too early.

	schema:headline " Again the unforgettable Winnetou and Old Shatterhand in a dangerous adventure set on wonderful landscapes";
	schema:reviewBody "Adventures  action  crossfire and gorgeous Yugoslavian exteriors magnificently photographed .This is a thrilling and stirring adventure based on Karl May trilogy with two agreeable characters as Old Shatterhand and Winnitou being stunningly played by Lex Barker and Pierre Brice respectively . It deals with Forester the British Anthony Steel a ruthless oil baron who spreads a reign of terror from the badlands of Oklahoma to the hellhills of the Dakotas and attempts to take Indian lands where there's petroleum . He wants to create a war between the native American tribes and the white men . Then there takes place an emotive meeting between and Winnetou Pierre Brice and Old Shatterhand Lex Barker who married Spanish Carmen Cervera who subsequently wedded Braon Thyssen .Old Shatterhand Winnetou and their sidekick Castlepool Arent try to prevent this . Meanwhile Apache chief Winnetou saves a girl from a bear attack and then he falls in love for the gorgeous Indian Karin Dor who married to director Harald Reinl . They free three US soldiers taken prisoners by the Ponka tribe . They are joined by an army party and an amateur botanist to track down the outlaws .There is also a Lt. named Robert Terence Hill or Mario Girotti previously his successful Trinity from the Army helping the group and he also falls in love with the Indian girl and takes place a particular loving triangle between Pierre Brice  Terence Hill and Karin Dor of Topaz and appeared in other Karl May films as white woman . Old Shatterland and his faithful halfbrother are on the trail to chase the nasty Forester . In spite of troubles caused by bandits led by Luke Klaus Kinski who attack and massacre an Indian village  they get escape . Old Shatterhand set out on pursuit of the bandits and prepares them a trap . But when Shatterhand rides for military help against Forester's gang who captured their companions he finds the tribe's friendly chief succeeded by his hostile Indians who prove to be a dangerous enemy .

	schema:reviewBody "Winnetou  2. Teil is a West German coproduction with several other countries from over 50 years ago. It is directed by Harald Reinl and is based on the Winnetou works of author Karl May. There have been actually several other Winnetou films before this one but still it is among the most known the series has to offer. But hopefully not among the best as this was a fairly disappointing watch for the most part. It began bearable but the longer it went the less interesting it became. I have seen some of these films and I must say the biggest problem here is that in terms of the main characters there is only 100 good or 100 evil. There are absolutely no shades in there and when we finally find people who have shades such as Terence Hill's character's dad then the roles are either too small that it does not make a difference in the grand scheme of things or the characters are just written in a way that has only one intention make the main characters even more shadeless. Apart from Mabuse Barker shows up there too and Edgar Wallace some films with Dor these European westerns were among the most popular the craft had to offer back around that era. So it should be no surprise that this film here also won a Golden Screen. But quantity is no guarantee for quality here I must say and I also personally do not see Pierre Brice as a particularly gifted actor. He lives more through the neverending goodness and understanding of his character that comes with the most pretentious quotes you could imagine. I don't think this film would be received well if it was made today. So yeah it may have been famous back then but it has not aged well at all. Noweher near in terms of quality compared to what Italy and the United States produced at this point and I am writing this as a great Terence Hill and Bud Spencer fan. Thumbs down and I am glad this was not too long of a film only slightly over 90 minutes.".

All this while trying to shake a bloodhound sheriff Smokey played by Jackie Gleason and his bonehead son Junior. Oh and during all of this Bandit falls in love with a hitchhiker named Carrie Sally Field.As much as this is the movie that Burt Reynolds is known for it's Jackie Gleason that makes this movie for me. His are my favorite lines in the movie. Don't get me wrong Burt and his ohhh so 70's mustache do a fabulous job of smiling and laughing but it's Gleason who has me in stitches every time I watch this movie. I received my first copy of this movie somewhere around 1986 Christmas present. At some point I tried to figure out how many times I have viewed this movie. A conservative guess would be somewhere around 300.It's simple fun but there is a little bit of magic in this movie that was absent in Smokey And The Bandit II. Both Burt Reynolds and Sally Field claim that the reason the movie worked so well is that you are watching two people fall in love for real on film.Aside from the love story and Gleason's portrayal of Bufford T. Justice the movie has some fantastic and real not CGI car chases and stunts. This is a must own for anyone who loves a good car chase.".

I remember when my dad got one in his 1972 cherry red Chevy Impala. He had this big ol' whip antennae on the back and his CB handlename was Midnightbecause he worked the night shift at Pan Am airlines. I think part of the reason Smokey was such a huge hit was threefold. First off we were going thru an energy crisis and the age of muscle cars was over and most of us were driving around in small pieces of crap like the Chevette or the VW Rabbit! The thrill of seeing a muscle car like the Pontiac Trans Am tearing across the land was a huge thrill! Secondly the country as a whole was in a malaise of the Me Generation..and all the selfhelp crap! People were listening to softrock like Helen Reddy and John Denver and taking selfhelp courses like est! People wore earthtone colors and sandals. So when we saw these 'realmen like Burt and Jerry Reed in thier plaid shirts and tight jeans taking on the establishment by disregarding the rules of the road and all that we got excited! Finally the sheer delight in seeing people enjoying life was a thrill we all wanted to partake in! I can see why so many people who were bored with life in the predisco late 70's really enjoyed the escapism of this simple but extremely fun flick! We wanted to be a part of it! It was latenight chocolate we never admitted to eating. It was a movie you partly felt dumb to admitting you liked! But the movie itself inspired the hugely popular TV series Dukes of Hazzard right down to the cast. Burt and Jerry became Bo and Luke Duke..Sally turned into a Daisywith better legs! and Sheriff Buford T. Justice became Boss Hogg with his bumbling sidekick Sheriff Roscoe B. Coltrane! And of course the Trans Am was replaced by a true muscle car the 1969 Dodge Charger was thier ever a better muscle car than the 69 Charger? What followed in the aftermath of this movie was the explosion of disco and letting oneself enjoy life again! The whole world got back into living life and having fun! Maybe Smokey had something".

	schema:headline " The Boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer down in Texarkana!";
	schema:reviewBody "I've never been much of a fan of Burt Reynolds fan but he happens to star in many 70's and early 80's movies that are right up my alley. We're talking about movies with charismatic macho man protagonists fast cars trucks so large they seem to be overcompensating for something else infantile comedy and flamboyant action stunts. Movies like White Lightning Hooper The Cannonball Run Sharky's Machine Gator and of course the Smokey and the Bandit trilogy and I can't help the fact they all star Burt Reynolds. Smokey and the Bandit is basically a very simplistic story and approximately three quarters of the film seems improvised at the spot but a premise like this just can't fail. Two Texan big shots hire the notorious trucker Bandit to illegally transport a lorry of Coors Beer from Texarkana to Georgia in barely 28 hours. Bandit develops a nifty plan where his buddy Snowman drives the beer truck and he drives a TransAm in front to divert the attention of the coppers. During the wild and timepressured ride Bandit picks up the hyperactive runaway bride Carrie and becomes involved in a testosterone showdown with the fearsome Texan Sheriff Buford T. Justice. You easily forgive Smokey and the Bandit for its lack of originality and ideas simply because everyone involved in the film seems to be so very enthusiast and cheerful. Former stuntman Hal Needham delivers a fast paced script and taut direction his other film MegaForce on the other hand is a terribly boring turkey whilst all his cast members are having the time of their lives. Jerry Reed is excellent as the lesser cool sidekick Snowman and he also provides the film with a sublimely irresistible hillbilly soundtrack including the fantastically catchy songs East Bound and Down and The Legend.

	onyx:emotionText "I've never been much of a fan of Burt Reynolds fan but he happens to star in many 70's and early 80's movies that are right up my alley. We're talking about movies with charismatic macho man protagonists fast cars trucks so large they seem to be overcompensating for something else infantile comedy and flamboyant action stunts. Movies like White Lightning Hooper The Cannonball Run Sharky's Machine Gator and of course the Smokey and the Bandit trilogy and I can't help the fact they all star Burt Reynolds. Smokey and the Bandit is basically a very simplistic story and approximately three quarters of the film seems improvised at the spot but a premise like this just can't fail. Two Texan big shots hire the notorious trucker Bandit to illegally transport a lorry of Coors Beer from Texarkana to Georgia in barely 28 hours. Bandit develops a nifty plan where his buddy Snowman drives the beer truck and he drives a TransAm in front to divert the attention of the coppers. During the wild and timepressured ride Bandit picks up the hyperactive runaway bride Carrie and becomes involved in a testosterone showdown with the fearsome Texan Sheriff Buford T. Justice. You easily forgive Smokey and the Bandit for its lack of originality and ideas simply because everyone involved in the film seems to be so very enthusiast and cheerful. Former stuntman Hal Needham delivers a fast paced script and taut direction his other film MegaForce on the other hand is a terribly boring turkey whilst all his cast members are having the time of their lives. Jerry Reed is excellent as the lesser cool sidekick Snowman and he also provides the film with a sublimely irresistible hillbilly soundtrack including the fantastically catchy songs East Bound and Down and The Legend. Sally Field and Burt Reynolds definitely have onscreen chemistry but the show is undeniably stolen by Jackie Gleason as the persistent and downright obsessive Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Heck even his character's name alone is awesome to write and pronounce repeatedly! He has the best lines allegedly a large part of them were adlibbed like when he says to his slow and unintelligent son the first thing I'm going to do when we get home is punch your mother in the face referring that the son can't possibly have inherited his stupidity from him.";

	schema:reviewBody "Enormous good fun.. and I am flabbergasted that this film is 33 years old. In 1977 a 1944 film sure did look old but now in 2009 this 1976 production still looks fairly modern albeit superbad 70s. In fact I really enjoyed the timetrip to this free 70s with its good natured roadside and trailerpark American fun times which echo all through SMOKEY. Burt Reynolds perfected his good ol' boy image thru DELIVERANCE in 73 then WW AND THE DIXIE DANCEKINGS in 74 via some lovably clumsy tap dancing in AT LONG LAST LOVE in 75 then rum running with doe eyed Robbie Benson and shrieking Liza Minnelli in LUCKY LADY what a campy film!..no wonder it has never surfaced again ... yet...maybe after Stanley Donen dies... and then into SMOKEY which sets the scene for stunt car comedies for the next 5 years. In 1978 we got HOOPER then in 1979 THE BLUES BROTHERS and CONVOY and then more SMOKEY sequels. It was seemingly endless. SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT must be one of the most profitable films ever made. Seen thu 2009 eyes it seems to be the most simple of productions there is not even ONE set used... every shot is taken on the road in a car or a truck at a raceway funpark in a roadside diner in a car park or in a picnic ground. It is all real .. and with real ordinary people as extras in most scenes..which was a clever way of ensuring incredible expectant word of mouth for the film to open in a big way. And it did.. one of the biggest cinema successes of the late 70s. More good fun than I remembered and evoking a wonderful nostalgia for the 70s and with the most awful fashions imaginable.. brown pants and incredibly tight clothes.. eek! The budget must have been less than 3 million and it brought in over 100m in rentals! SMOKEY shows why everyone loved the 70s and Burt Reynolds at 42 years old hit his stride as a megastar of the time. Sally Field was about 36 when she made this and still looks like a teenager!".

If any of that makes sense to you it means one of two things.  Either you were a young male in the late seventies who dressed in cowboy boots and drove a transam... or you have seen the film Smokey and the Bandit.Smokey sees classically trained thespian Burtrand Reynolds essay the role of the Bandit a mythical almost Quixotesque figure who cuts across the American landscape in a black Pontiac firebird the ultimate phallic representation of male dominance.  The densely layered plot sees Bandit become involved in a quest of Arthurian proportions attempting to do what they say can't be done.  As it goes there's a drought in old Atlanta and the fine townsfolk are gagging for some liquid refreshment for the upcoming monstertruck derby.  Luckily Bandit hears that there's beer in Texarkana and sets out across country to bring it back... no matter what it takes.Director Hal Needham surely an auteur of Hitchcockian proportions keeps the first act moving along at a steady pace and there is always close attention paid to characterisation.  However it is in act two that things really get interesting for no sooner has the Bandit and his everfaithful slave... sorry sidekick Snowman loaded up the truck with the brew... than they are set upon by a runaway bride Sally Field a fleet of southern law enforcers and the formidable Sheriff Bufred T. Justice Jackie Gleason whose catchphrase that sun' bitch proved to be as lastingly funny as a dose of the clap.  From this point on tension is cranked to eleven with more jawdropping moments than the entire Indian Jones series combined. Don't believe me take the scene where Bandit attempts to jump the bridge... if this doesn't have you standing on your seat screaming go bandit go... yeehaw then quite frankly nothing will.Bandit is one nononsense jivetalker an enduring character whose down with the kids and the blacks making him one fine example of a true southern gent.  We never doubt our hero will fail at his mission especially not with the benefit of hindsight since Bandit managed to evade the law and return for the imaginatively titled Smokey and the Bandit II.  Here his bounty was an African elephant that understandably had the hots for the moustachioed one.  Then there was the third instalment which had a script so bad Reynolds himself turned it down.  Here the shtkickers formula was repeated... just without the kick.  Smokey and the Bandit is admittedly not high art.  It's not even low art.  But it does represent some kind of period piece a history lesson or the pinnacle of late seventies cinema.Your enjoyment of the film depends on your first viewing experience.  If like myself you were a young boy growing up in the mideighties you will have no doubt lived for the endless thrills spills car crashes and secondrate jokes that pepper Bandit and its two sequels.   It's easy to laugh at now and a young audience will probably be left scratching their heads at the sight of Burt Reynolds mugging uncontrollably to the camera for ninetyminutes whilst Jerry Reed gets to 'sing' his good ol' boy theme tune 'Eastbound and Down' for the onemillionth time but there is a perverse pleasure in seeing bellbottoms grown men with CB radios and muscles cars the size of small houses the likes of which most people won't have seen since 1982.  35".

However the easy humour of the film makes for a nice little film.This is solely down to the cast rather than any great director or scenes. Reynolds spoofs his good ol' boy' image really well and has an easy charm about him  although it is a sad reflection on his career that this is one of his best roles.  Field does a good job of acting natural and she has an easy charisma with Reynolds.  Reed is OK but his character's dog really makes more of an impression than he does.  The real draw is Gleason's Sheriff who is hilarious has all the best lines and is a wonderful exaggerated character with his son in the car they make the real driving force of the film's humour!Overall this is not a great film  it appeals to basic humour and the plot is about as much of a one sentence summary' as you can get.  However it has an easy lazy humour to it that is appealing in a lazy sort of way.  A few more major stunts would have helped but as it is it is an enjoyable little film as long as you are in the mood.".

A great deal of the movie's charm derives from Burt Reynolds Sally Field Jerry Reed and Jackie Gleeson a hell of a cast for what is actually a Southern Hick comedy. The plot is simple Burt Reynolds is a well recognized bandit with the ability to keep the police from commandeering a truck hauling certain illegal merchandise across state lines. His reputation catches the ear of Big Enos Pat McCormick and Little Enos Paul Williams with matching suits and plenty of cold hard cash to pay for such a venture as they are proposing to the Bandit the proposal to successfully pick up and haul Coors beer across the country from Texarkana to Georgia in a certain time to score 80000. So Bandit drags literally truck driving partner Cledus Jerry Reed who shares scenestealing duties with Gleason out of bed with the two heading on the roadBandit in a sweet Pontiac Trans am Cledus driving the truck which will haul the Coors illegal in certain states for which Bandit and Cletus will be crossing into essentially recognized as bootlegging. Bandit picks up a runaway bride Sally Field once a chorus girl ! fleeing from a dunderhead Junior Mike Henry and his fiery illtempered father Sheriff Buford T. Justice Jackie Gleeson dogged in his pursuit to catch the girl who got away. Meanwhile Bandit has to keep the smokies from pulling over Cledus' truck not to mention avoiding Justice dogged and determined to catch him. The film is basically a drivein treasure full of police cars crashing into lakes and each other the highlight as to be when one cop car lands in the back of a truck and the Bandit masterfully evading an army of law enforcement through his incredible driving skills and a little luck. Plenty of eyeopening stunts including an epic bridge jumping by the Trans am. Reynolds' charisma is on full display Field is a cutie who becomes his romantic interest as the two bond while trying to keep the law at bay Gleason has an onslaught of comedy zingers What we got here is a complete lack of respect for the law. and Jerry Reed as the jovial truck driver with a pet basset hound. For a PGrated film Smokey and the Bandit is loaded with profanity particularly when Buford T Justice gets annoyed at his idiot son or cannot apprehend the Bandit. You can really see how much Reynolds and Field were in love during their scenes together their chemistry is perfect. For a Mississippi hick like me Smokey and the Bandit is the gold standard of Southern car chase movies. The movie has a laidback charm with the kind of cast who provoke smiles from the audience because of the breezy nature of the silly material.".

Other law enforcement officers would ignore this clown and catch the Bandit themselves. I liked the part where Cletuscountry singerJerry Reed ran over the Biker gangs' motorcycles after they rough him up it looks like they'll be hitchhiking for a while. And hauling all the Coors' beer would be interesting. And when Sally Field's character flips the Georgia State trooper the bird I said OOOHH! That was funny! All the semis the CB channels and all the help The Bandit got makes him the South's local hero. He can be USA's hero if he wants to. This movie is great for truckers and travelers alike.

Justice Jackie Gleason isn't going to let her or Bandit get away. Mike Henry Paul Williams and Pat McCormick are also on hand.This is fun good 'ol boy movie with Burt and Sally in their prime. Reynolds is at his smiling wisecracking best and Field is a cutie who looks great in tight pants. It's not great like Eastwood's Every Which Way But Loose 1978 but it's energetic and amusing. Anyone who likes car chases Southern accents trucks CB radios redneck cops and motorhead antics will enjoy this movie. Besides the presence of Reynolds and Field I mainly like it because it's like going back in time to the late 70s.The female eyecandy is pretty much limited to Field although Susie Ewing has a nice cameo as Hot Pants.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot mostly in Georgia but with some driving locations in California you can always tell the difference.GRADE B".

Smokey and the Bandit is a 1977 movie starring Burt Reynolds Sally Field Jackie Gleason Jerry Reed Pat McCormick Paul Williams and Mike Henry. It inspired several other trucking films including two sequels Smokey and the Bandit II originally known as Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again in the U.K. and Smokey and the Bandit Part 3. There were also a series of 1994 television movies Bandit Goes Country Beauty and the Bandit and Bandit's Silver Angel from original directorwriter Hal Needham loosely based on the earlier version with Emmywinning actor Brian Bloom now playing Bandit. The three original movies introduced two generations of the Pontiac Trans Am while the TVmovie version drives the Dodge Stealth. The film was the second highest grossing film of 1977 beaten only by Star Wars..SUMMARY As the movie begins rich Texan Big Enos Burdette Pat McCormick and his son Little Enos Paul Williams are trying to find a truck driver willing to haul Coors beer to Georgia for their refreshment. Unfortunately due to federal liquor laws and state liquor tax regulations of the time selling andor shipping Coors east of the Mississippi River was considered bootlegging and the truck drivers who had taken the bet previously had been discovered and arrested by Smokey truck driver and CB slang for highway patrolmen. At a local truck rodeo the Texans locate legendary truck driver Bo Bandit Darville Burt Reynolds and offer him US80000 US270000 in 2007 dollars the price of a new truck to haul 400 cases of Coors beer from Texarkana Texas to the Southern Classic truck rodeo in Georgia in 28 hours. Bandit accepts the bet and recruits fellow trucker Cletus Snowman Snow Jerry Reed to drive the truck Snow brings along his dog a Basset Hound named Fred for company. Bandit purchases a black Pontiac Trans Am which he will drive himself as a blocker car to deflect attention away from the truck and its cargo. The trio reaches Texas ahead of schedule load their truck with Coors and immediately head back towards Georgia. Shortly thereafter Bandit picks up professional dancer and apparent runaway bride Carrie Sally Field whom he nicknames Frog because she was always hopping around. However by picking up Carrie Bo becomes the target of Sheriff Buford T. Justice Jackie Gleason whose handsome yet very simpleminded son Junior Mike Henry was to have been Carrie's groom. The remainder of the film is essentially one big highspeed chase as Bandit and Frog attract continuous attention from local and state police while Snowman barrels eastward with the Coors beer. Despite leaving his home jurisdiction Sheriff Justice and his son continue to pursue Bandit even as various mishaps cause their squad car to disintegrate around them. Bandit and Snowman are greatly assisted by a number of colorful characters met along the way many of whom they contact through their CB radios these acquaintances allow them to escape police pursuit on numerous occasions.QUESTIONS Neither Justice nor any of the other police officers are ever aware of Snowman's illegal cargo of Coors. Despite all the pursuit Sheriff Buford T Justice how did the Bandit make it? What the bandit and snowman hauling in that truck? Why did the Bandit take a new deal instead of the money? Where did Frog come from and who was she? Why was Frog trying to escape from the sheriff in the first place? MY THOUGHTS I give this picture 8 weasel stars for not only its action but the comedy also.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two things to say about this film.Firstly what an astoundingly rubbish title for a movie. Deception??? Oh come on. Can you think of a more noncommittal less interesting less imaginative title for a movie? I can't. All thrillers are about deception of one kind or another.Deception originally went into production under the title The List. Hmm... Well... OK. I admit it. That title is also pretty bad. Then Deception was going to be called The Tourist. Now I kind of like that. Sounds art house and kind of strange. Conjures up images of an observer an outsider. Somebody not in the loop. In fact pretty much the character that Ewan McGregor plays.Secondly what a completely rubbish movie! OK maybe not completely rubbish. Just mostly rubbish.Deception is a good 20 minutes too long. After a while it just seems to go on and on. The climax is misjudged and mistimed. The sex is typical Movies 24 soft core erotica or maybe a Friday night Channel 5 movie from the early Noughties. You know the kind of thing. Soft focus humping to a soundtrack of screaming saxophone driven jazz. Mind you don't trip over the clich there chief! Also every plot twist in Deception is signposted way in advance. If you don't get at least one of the major plot twists then frankly you really should give up watching movies. Pretty lame pretty dull pretty bad movie.I said 'mostly rubbish' so some of it must have been good. Yes?I did like the film's chilly European ambiance. I liked the idea of powerful people too isolated and too busy to develop human relationships. I liked Hugh Jackman's well dressed and cold instigator Ewan McGregor's lonely accountant and Michelle Williams' bruised vulnerability. I thought all three leads made the most of their underwritten roles but sadly it was not enough.There is plenty of space in this world for a good sexualised thriller see the original Basic Instinct but sadly Deception was nothing like a good sexualised thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into the theater because of the interesting star combination of Hiugh Jackman and Ewan McGregor. I did not have an idea what the story would be about. However the simple and unimaginative title was a giveaway of the plot. Within the first ten minutes you already feel you have seen this movie before. I immediately thought of the Clive OwenJennifer Aniston movie Derailed. The initial chance seduction occurred at a train station as well. John McQuarrie Ewan McGregor is a lonely accountantauditor with zero social life. He gets hooked into a sex list by the magnetic man's man Wyatt Bose Hugh Jackman. There he meets the girl of his dreams simply known to him as S Michelle Williams. Of course since the title gives away the plot you knew this setup was all an elaborate deception and nothing is really what it seemed.As for the plot there were a lot of improbabilities that weaken the story some spoilers follow later for those interested. The suspense was a bit muted because the director was generous with the clues. Or may be we have just watched to many of these variations of this story in movies.The sex list setup which was the main thing of interest that set this movie apart from others like it was most likely inspired by real such social clubs. These lurid circles where busy people just call each other randomly for some anonymous commitmentfree sex I am sure ordinary guys like us will never get mixed up with in real life. This movie does give us a vicarious teasing peek into this alternative lifestyle though.I did like the triumph of good at the end though because there were no strings attached.I could not help but compare this film with Derailed because they were so similar and Derailed was clearly better in all aspects. That said this film Deception is really not that bad as the cheap local posters that resort to sexy photos of girls in lingerie would suggest.SPOILERS FOLLOW These are the questions that the movie requires you to turn a blind eye on How could Bose possibly assume that McQuarrie would do his criminal bidding just because of S? At that time McQuarrie had only met S twice and they did not even have sex yet. And indeed can an auditor actually gain access to perform multimillion dollar money transfers from the company he is auditing? Also is it that easy to create fake passports? Especially in the case of McQuarrie.".

But I saw Deception on Sunday and I think the rating on IMDb is a little harsh to be honest this was such a cool sexy and sleek thriller true it was a little predictable if you've seen every thriller possible but Deception kept me interested and had a good story with an equally strong cast. I was a little disappointed in the ending it seemed like they could've had something a little stronger with Hugh and Ewan like they would've been a great pair of trouble makers for the world to watch out for. But it was also cool to see the female fetal back which we rarely see and Michelle Williams was a great choice she had the looks and the talent to pull this movie together with the two strong male leads.Jonathan is an accountant one of the best but his life is just what you expect of an accountant boring typical and no ladies but he meets Wyatt a handsome strong successful lady's man they become best friends immediately. When Jonathan accidentally grabs Wyatt's cell phone Wyatt is in a different country so Jonathan uses the cell and gets involved with a sex club. He meets S a mysterious girl he just falls for but when she is kidnapped he gets in a lot deeper than he expects and doesn't realize the set up he fell for.Deception is predictable in some ways the ending if you are used to these thrillers yes you're going to be able to see what's coming sad I know but I'm so used to it that I'm just accepting it. I thought this was still a clever thriller I just loved Hugh's performance he was so into his character he made it sexy and creepy. Ewan pulls in a decent performance and stands strong the ending is his peek in the film and Michelle was just great as S. Deception is a cool thriller I highly recommend it's a sexy movie that won't leave you disappointed.710".

How could Wyatt so easily circulate in an office and in a fancy building in Manhattan without having problem with the security guards or the porter?

	schema:reviewBody "The thriller genre has been well explored and perfected over decades of cinema. While some familiar elements and conventions are to be expected in a new release you would expect at the very least that a new entry tops the previous ones.And sadly Deception does not. The movie almost feels like a remake of Curtis Hanson's Bad Influence. A movie that was made almost twenty years ago and features two main characters that are carbon copies of those of McGregor and Jackman only they were played respectively by James Spader and Rob Lowe.Whatever twists are found in Deception you see them coming from a mile and they fall flat. The acting? Everybody seems to be cashing his check. Onedimensional characters and an aimless plot make for a boring two hours. Even the list subplot feels tacked on and doesn't even provide any enjoyment nor does it add anything to the film.The photography is amazing but this is truly a poor Hollywood movie and one that you will be better off passing on unless you are a diehard fan of the genre or one of the main actors featured. All in all a tremendous waste of talent and resources due to a crappy script.".

While some familiar elements and conventions are to be expected in a new release you would expect at the very least that a new entry tops the previous ones.And sadly Deception does not. The movie almost feels like a remake of Curtis Hanson's Bad Influence. A movie that was made almost twenty years ago and features two main characters that are carbon copies of those of McGregor and Jackman only they were played respectively by James Spader and Rob Lowe.Whatever twists are found in Deception you see them coming from a mile and they fall flat. The acting? Everybody seems to be cashing his check. Onedimensional characters and an aimless plot make for a boring two hours. Even the list subplot feels tacked on and doesn't even provide any enjoyment nor does it add anything to the film.The photography is amazing but this is truly a poor Hollywood movie and one that you will be better off passing on unless you are a diehard fan of the genre or one of the main actors featured. All in all a tremendous waste of talent and resources due to a crappy script.";

	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever longed for a bit more excitement in your life? Many of us have. Especially it seems introverted and slightly nerdy Jonathan McQuarry an audit manager played by Ewan McGregor.McGregor is a high flyer checking the books for top Wall Street firms. There's only one problem. He doesn't have a life. Zero social world and near zero sexual escapades to look back with his mates. Assuming he had any. Which he doesn't. Accountants are wary of him for the few weeks when he looks at their figures. And to everyone else he's just a temporary fixture.Until smoothly tailored Wyatt Bose breezes onto the scene. A spliff a game of tennis and an accidental swapping of mobile phone handsets puts McQuarry in line for more sex deception and perilous living than Little Red Riding Hood in heat checking out the bear pit.In the opening scene McQuarry is alone in a majestic Manhattan skyscraper only the cleaners in the background behind glass doors. The camera traverses the splendid skylines. All is framed to perfection both visually and to establish the characters and storyline. So when the plot moves into Basic Instinct territory you are not surprised to see lovers pictured in postcard perfection. Standing in the rain. Or having is sex in those geometrically interesting positions. And lighting that just happens to show off their lovely skin tones and delicately arranged shadows.Director of photography Dante Spinotti The Insider L.A. Confidential Heat uses a hightech Panavision Genesis digital video camera for the night scenes capturing colours and detail in a way where film falls short. The Genesis has a much stronger sensitivity Spinotti explains so it can read in the shadows much more than film does. I spent much time admiring the photography. It was more interesting than the story. Shifting dodgy funds about electronically is hardly visceral viewing. So we have a mysterious sexclub that McQuarry stumbles into. He meets highprofile women whose lives are too busy for relationships.Queue meaningless sex. No names. No work talk. The initiator male or female pays the hotel. The only important words being Are you free tonight? McQuarry is emotionally attracted in one encounter  against the rules. Her name begins with S. She's blonde leggy and played by Michelle Willliams Brokeback Mountain She's Not There. Soon the games begin and you won't be surprised to learn they include blackmail and large amounts of moola.To give Deception its due the intrigue does develop in ways I hadn't expected. I just wish I could have cared enough about the characters to ignore the plot holes and lack of any real depth or substance. As a thriller a piece of soft porn or a character study Deception is room temperature. Luscious visuals are poor compensation for a contrived and unengrossing story. It passes the time well enough and makes a competent debut feature for director Marcel Langenegger but Spinotti needs worthier projects and McGregor and Williams need to show that they are serious about acting.Some of the best lines used the fword  so well suited to McGregor's wellmodulated and slightly posh voice when he can maybe seem almost like a more buff version of the very proper Hugh Grant. He sadly he doesn't get to say them but his costars do.Deception makes for a pleasantly titillating hour and a half but much like a drunken onenight stand it would be silly to take it too seriously.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ahh Jackman what have they done to you. It's a wonder how such talented actors were tempted by such a weak and uninteresting plot. Deception manages to combine a novel premise with one of the lousiest executions in history and in that sense only ever manages to succeed in one area. That's its stellar and often unused cast. Brilliant as they might be even the actors cannot excuse this joke of a movie being as bad as it is especially when I had high hopes for it.Truth is the only thing that is deceiving about this garbage is its sophisticated trailer promising a well crafted and gripping thriller only what we get is completely the opposite. Lacking in potential to make you want to stay until the closing credits and to be perfectly honest I nearly walked out. But surely if it's as poor as I described i would have awarded it a more unwatchable  review. And yet with all of its flaws and mishaps Deception does get something right well for 20 minutes at least it manages to capture a minor bit of interest.A disconnected accountant finds his mundane life injected with a new sense of urgency after striking up a friendship with a charismatic attorney in director Marcel Langenegger's sexually charged action thriller.Jonathan Ewan McGregor is an accountant who has lost his passion in life. When his powerful new lawyer friend Wyatt Hugh Jackman introduces Jonathan to a salacious underground sex club called The List the the dejected accountant soon believes he has found the woman of his dreams Michelle Williams. His newfound happiness takes a turn for the worse however when Jonathan is named the prime suspect in the woman's disappearance as well as the theft of 20 million dollars.Early on there is an element of aspiration lifestyle envy about it all as if fancy clothes and welldesigned surroundings really do make a life if not at least the making of a good watch commercial. Once the twists start twisting the film loses any sense of genuine human behavior and becomes a slave to its own chunky plotting. The movie that took a moment to namecheck the German artist Gerhard Richter and even pause to admire one of his paintings gets left by the wayside.Once it gets up to speed the various tricks and complications of the movie written by Mark Bomback are so baldly cherrypicked from other films that it half seems as if Deception is meant as some kind of Sexy Movie parody to go in line with the recent Epic Date and Scary entries.My Final Verdict? Avoid at all costs. Deception takes its place among the outing of 2008 that were so dull and uninteresting that its almost impossible not to walk out. If you're interested in such erotic thrillers however your best of seeing the massively overrated Original Sin starring Antonio Banderas. As for Deception your best of leaving this one otherwise you'll just be regretting your decision the Moring after.".

	schema:reviewBody "The big joke making its rounds here about this movie was in its promotional poster for this part of the world. Perhaps to the West Maggie Q would be just the chick from MI3 and didn't warrant top billing or a photograph in its poster. Here we have a badly pasted extra face of hers plastered on the poster supposedly banking on her popularity with Asians. Only that as it turned out she only has 5 minutes worth of screen time appearing in black lacy lingerie and doing nothing. If that's the case then Natasha Hendrige should also be included in the poster since she's famous for showing off her body in the Species movies and continues to do so here to remind everyone she hasn't really lost it yet.While Hancock has been proved not guilty of putting everything in the trailer that you can write a review out of it the same cannot be said of Deception no matter how its title sounded like in trying to throw you off track. It is exactly as it is played out in the 2 odd minutes of it so if you were to want and try to enjoy this do not watch any of its trailer nor its stills. It really ruined it outright stripping away all surprises in store. And while Hancock kept important stuff under wraps to bring about heightened pleasure when all get revealed Deception's surprise was like a limp premature ejaculation which didn't make much sense and insults the audience.But that's not to say that it was bad all the way. The premise had potential and if you're going into it blind then there are enough to intrigue you especially when it comes to the turn. Ewan McGregor slicks back his hair and puts on glasses to give himself the stereotypical bookish accountant look in a firm to audit their books. As with all audits keeping lonely late night vigils is a norm as everyone in the firm you're auditing automatically shun you for fear of getting questioned. His Jonathan McQuarry cuts a pitiable figure that most of us in the corporate world will probably understand.In comes a highly sociable humorous and charismatic legal counsel of the firm Wyatt Bose played by Hugh Jackman who also serves as producer and the two hit it off over a late night filled with jokes and the sharing of pot in a conference room before getting so chummy with each other that going to strip clubs to chill out seemed perfectly OK. In a careless accident they switch cell phones and before you know it Jonathan gets all excited over the prospect of milking Wyatt's exclusive high society sex club membership where members call each other up anonymously through the service and asks a seemingly innocent question Are you free tonight?.Sure there are rules to Sex Club such as no names no details no casual chitchats just the caller booking a room at the hotel and the callee turning up as arranged to get their respective rocks off. I'm sure by now plenty of ahpeks would be interested to watch the movie already but its M18 rating ensured that everything put on screen isn't hardcore stuff. I won't be surprised too if something of this nature already exists serving a rich clientle who spend 90 of their waking hours in the office leaving no time for anything else. Think of it as a matchmaking service that goes into that bit of extra.Complicating matters of course is when Jonathan falls genuinely in love with one of the members called S Michelle Williams whom he met outside of the club at a train station. Being totally smitten with her he refuses to do the deed and breaks almost all the rules. Then begin the cat and mouse mind games which of course would have worked but the last act just became convenience after convenience that made it eventually a very lazy piece of storytelling.Deception tried but didn't try hard enough. It had great foreplay adequate skills but no stamina to last the distance. Strictly for fans of McGregor and Jackman only and of course those who still want to check Maggie Q out in lingerie or to admire that Hendsridge still has it in her.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched Deception and again I really wasn't expecting that much from it. In fact I really wasn't expecting anything in particular I had absolutely no expectations for this movie. I didn't think it looked terrible good or average. I just thought it'd be worth a watch. And overall I thought it was worth a watch but not much else. It's a good movie to see if you're bored one night and decide to just see whatever.One reason I was kind of intrigued by it was because I had this weird feeling that it might be an interesting movie kind of like The Prestige even though the only connection these movies have is that they both star Hugh Jackman and they both involve Hugh Jackman and another guy going up against each other. Obviously it's nothing like that but whatever. I figured the movie would at least be really thrilling and I thought it would have some really unpredictable twists and turns along the way. Honestly though there's not really a single thing in this movie thats surprising. Not once did I say to myself as I was watching it Wow I didn't expect that. Because I pretty much did expect everything. That's not to say it's a bad movie. It's pretty entertaining but it's just not as good as it could have been.Ewan McGregor plays kind of a nerdy shy accountant who one night meets Hugh Jackman's character Wyatt Bose a suave kind of wild Wall Streettype guy who's pretty much the complete opposite of McGregor. Through a series of events McGregor's character ends up with Jackman's cellphone and he receives a call from a woman who asks him if he's free for the night. He meets the woman and through another series of events he gets caught up in this sex club where he calls random women in Bose's phone getting together with them to screw them. The rule is that there's not supposed to really be any conversation not gettingtoknoweach other and they're not supposed to know each other's names. They just get together for one reason only To screw each other. Of course Bose is not who he seems to be. There's something about him and you already know that right off the bat. Eventually McGregor's character meets up with a woman her name's never given it just starts with an S that he falls in love with and cares for. Of course things start to unravel and Bose reveals that there's more to him than what he puts out. The sad thing is that you know what every character is going to do. You know what twists the movie is going to take and you pretty much know how it's going to end. You know every step the movie's going to take and because of that it's not exactly thrilling or suspenseful. Bose's motive for doing what he's doing isn't predictable but it just leaves you with a feeling of That's it? You expect there to be much more to the story and to Bose's motives but there really isn't. It's like it's not horrible it's not good it just leaves you thinking That's alright but that's it? Of course the movie's full of sex...which means it's full of nudity. A bunch of gorgeous hot women get naked for the camera and it's pretty damn sexy. Just thought I'd point that out.The movie was entertaining and it was made pretty well but it could've been a lot cooler. It was really well made the actors were good Hugh Jackman's character was the villain but he was really likable they could've made it more suspenseful and they could've put some better twists in there but whatever. I enjoyed it enough. But you're pretty much gonna see every single twist and turn a mile away if you go see it. Regardless of that it's still a nice solid movie. But eh. Go judge for yourself.Score 7 out of 10.".

Through a series of events McGregor's character ends up with Jackman's cellphone and he receives a call from a woman who asks him if he's free for the night. He meets the woman and through another series of events he gets caught up in this sex club where he calls random women in Bose's phone getting together with them to screw them. The rule is that there's not supposed to really be any conversation not gettingtoknoweach other and they're not supposed to know each other's names. They just get together for one reason only To screw each other. Of course Bose is not who he seems to be. There's something about him and you already know that right off the bat. Eventually McGregor's character meets up with a woman her name's never given it just starts with an S that he falls in love with and cares for. Of course things start to unravel and Bose reveals that there's more to him than what he puts out. The sad thing is that you know what every character is going to do. You know what twists the movie is going to take and you pretty much know how it's going to end. You know every step the movie's going to take and because of that it's not exactly thrilling or suspenseful. Bose's motive for doing what he's doing isn't predictable but it just leaves you with a feeling of That's it? You expect there to be much more to the story and to Bose's motives but there really isn't. It's like it's not horrible it's not good it just leaves you thinking That's alright but that's it? Of course the movie's full of sex...which means it's full of nudity. A bunch of gorgeous hot women get naked for the camera and it's pretty damn sexy. Just thought I'd point that out.The movie was entertaining and it was made pretty well but it could've been a lot cooler. It was really well made the actors were good Hugh Jackman's character was the villain but he was really likable they could've made it more suspenseful and they could've put some better twists in there but whatever. I enjoyed it enough. But you're pretty much gonna see every single twist and turn a mile away if you go see it. Regardless of that it's still a nice solid movie. But eh. Go judge for yourself.Score 7 out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sixteen years after having successfully exploited Georges Bernanos' universe for his Journal d'Un Cur De Campagne 1951 Robert Bresson appropriates once again another book by the French writer Mouchette for a very personal stylish rendering and a canonical film about stolen childhood. The filmmaker always supported that he'd prefer a film to be felt rather than to be understood. Needless to say we leave the projection with a big emotion inside us and we also feel helpless about Mouchette' terrible life. According to Bresson Mouchette's tragic fate enabled him to put forward misery cruelty. They're everywhere wars tortures murders.The film starts with Arsne's and the gamekeeper's eyes staring at quails and partridges that desperately try to free themselves from snares. This harrowing introduction sequence sets the scene for what follows after wards. How not to think of a metaphor for Mouchette's life that offers her no horizon and no hope? This teenage girl is all alone and in spite of her young age she has to take care of her sick mother her alcoholic father and her baby brother. She goes to school but feels rejected by her female fellow students notably when school's over they stone her. It's the same thing every day and Mouchette is trapped in her loneliness. That's why the sequence at the fair comes as a sort of relief for her. The scene at the bumper cars provides her momentary solace and joy. Then the key sequence with Arsne will make her open her eyes about what she really wants. In spite of her poverty and solitude Mouchette needs to love but where to find it in a hostile world?Mouchette strongly belongs to the Bressonian world. She's an outcast and she can't integrate herself to her surrounding. Once again Bresson underscores the opposition between a pure subjective person and an objective hostile world in a sparse minimal directing with a supremacy granted to images and sounds and the evident symbols they convey. An eloquent example would be when the little girl is all alone in the country and can hear the sound of guns and can see rabbits running or dying. She hasn't got a friend or even one member of her family to talk to. When she wants to tell her mother what Arsne did to her she dies. Fate dogs her. There's no room for the weak and there's one last exit left... Bresson's austere intensely visual making fits the story and its themes like a glove and if you don't feel anything during the last sequence you have a heart of stone.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a film as inexorable and irrevocable as this it is appropriate that Bresson's masterpiece should begin with an elaborate rite.  The film actually opens with the heroine stating her anguish calmly to the camera and the bizarrely Baroquedup strains of Monteverdi.  But the action begins in a green space of remarkable beauty adjacent to the 'civilisation' of the village.  It is an overgrown profusely sparse space in which one man sets up a wire trap watched by another.  A pigeon is caught in the trap and we watch his terrified bewildered struggle for agonised moments.  The second man follows the bird we assume to finish him off and sets him free.  He looks at the second man who scarpers.These two men are a poacher and a gamekeeper but Bresson doesn't tell us until after this sequence.  Although their roles may be obvious there is a ritual solemnity about the action characters moving and behaving to seemingly preordained rules in an environment that is supposed to be realistic no music natural sounds etc. but seems unworldly stripped bare.  The sequence is loaded with symbolic detail with a cruel foretelling of the plot to come that takes on the power of Greek myth an intriguing starting point for the very Catholic Bresson's film.Although Bresson's austere films are defended by his admirers as being full of suppressed passion it's hard to fully engage with them.  They are fragmentary e.g. in the way he films parts of the body that seem to deconstruct it rather than its familiar wholeness the way the plots are constructed not by conventional flow but the build up of episodes and yet his films are full of contradictory connections patterns rhythms whether real or imaginary that perhaps I'm no theologian approximate the underlying Catholic impact.The reason MOUCHETTE is his most appealing film is that it is in many ways more conventional than most.  It's the story of an adolescent girl living in a grim parched provencal village unloved by her parents mocked by her schoolmates brutally beaten by her teachers.  She clumps around in heavy shoes that make her look disabled and there is unexpected comedy when every day after school she hides behind a hedge and hurls with unerring accuracy mud at the popular girls with their perfumes and motorbikeowning boyfriends.  Parallel to this story is that of the gamekeeper and the poacher both fighting over the same woman.The film initially consists of revelatory vignettes with little apparent plot point revealing the spiritual void of provincial France with its medieval rituals and codes hatreds unloving Churches pinched villagers heavy parched stones.  Mouchette's mother is dying her father and brother involved in smuggling.  One connecting pattern in the film foreshadowing L'ARGENT is that of money a blasphemous matrix that only alienates its practitioners.  There are some brief snatches of relief such as Mouchette playing bumping cars at a fairground but an incipient reaching for companionship is harshly beaten away by her father.This loveless sterile manmade community is seemingly contrasted with the neighbouring countryside.  Mouchette gets lost one night in the forest and the thundering cyclone seems to unleash an almost Romantic expressivity revealing Mouchette's feelings that are usually curtailed in the social realm the fact that this may by pathetic sympathy and subjective is shown in two subsequent denials of the cyclone's power.  Her seeming freedom is linked to losing a burdenous shoe.But 'civilisation' is never far away and the medieval fued of honour is pushed to this natural realm.  Bresson cuts the outcome of the two men's drunken meeting and the characters' own ignorance leads to misinterpretation and misinformation that crucially decide Mouchette's fate. The short elliptical style now gives way to two extended gendered setpieces one with Arsene the poacher and possible murderer one with her dying mother.  This twofold division presumably has religious or Platonic significance the rest of us can watch the dreadful plight of a young girl who so wants to belong that she is prepared to abet a killer get raped and see her mother die in the space of a couple of hours.  Predictably the attempt of this outsider to belong results in her being cast out as a slut leaving seemingly only one heartbreaking option open to her.Mouchette is a classic movie outsider but she is not subversive.  Her presence is marginalised even in her own film  although she serves to expose the fundamental evil and disruption underlying socalled 'tight' communities.  The treatments of rape and the links of the female with death not fertility seem troubling  Bresson's attack on a 'patriarchal' society seems to bemoan the arrogant usurping of the real Patriarch.This is how JEAN DE FLORETTE should have been filmed  shorn of heritage accoutrements provincial France is shown to be an unlovely hell.  With all the discussion of Bresson's philosophical power it shouldn't be forgotten that he has compelling narrative gifts  and even uses the notion of story as the crucial plot motor  Mouchette acts on the erroneous story she's told by Arsene on the creation of a world through mere words  and her lack of either narrative control or critical power results in her downfall.".

Her seeming freedom is linked to losing a burdenous shoe.But 'civilisation' is never far away and the medieval fued of honour is pushed to this natural realm.  Bresson cuts the outcome of the two men's drunken meeting and the characters' own ignorance leads to misinterpretation and misinformation that crucially decide Mouchette's fate. The short elliptical style now gives way to two extended gendered setpieces one with Arsene the poacher and possible murderer one with her dying mother.  This twofold division presumably has religious or Platonic significance the rest of us can watch the dreadful plight of a young girl who so wants to belong that she is prepared to abet a killer get raped and see her mother die in the space of a couple of hours.  Predictably the attempt of this outsider to belong results in her being cast out as a slut leaving seemingly only one heartbreaking option open to her.Mouchette is a classic movie outsider but she is not subversive.  Her presence is marginalised even in her own film  although she serves to expose the fundamental evil and disruption underlying socalled 'tight' communities.  The treatments of rape and the links of the female with death not fertility seem troubling  Bresson's attack on a 'patriarchal' society seems to bemoan the arrogant usurping of the real Patriarch.This is how JEAN DE FLORETTE should have been filmed  shorn of heritage accoutrements provincial France is shown to be an unlovely hell.  With all the discussion of Bresson's philosophical power it shouldn't be forgotten that he has compelling narrative gifts  and even uses the notion of story as the crucial plot motor  Mouchette acts on the erroneous story she's told by Arsene on the creation of a world through mere words  and her lack of either narrative control or critical power results in her downfall.";

Are we really to regard this as an unblinking gaze into the life of an abused outcast girl? If so why is Bresson so intent on excluding even the most fleeting moments of joy or at least humor that enter even the darkest of lives I believe a philosopher once said alas joy too must have its day? It is pretty telling that the one scene involving happiness for Mouchette is the most monotonous and lifeless in the picture the bumper cars. Not only are we not allowed to experience her joy but Bresson is careful to distance us from the real experience of her pain as well. This is done by the use of gestures particularly prominent in Bresson's later films that signify a character's experience rather than giving us the person's individualized emotional and visceral reactions to events. Thus the assault on Mouchette is shown in a distant almost pantomimed manner her relationship with her father is suggested by dropping coins in his hand a disembodied hand slapping her face etc. So are we really to identify with Mouchette to feel her pain seeing how her experience of life intersects with our own in only the most symbolic muted fashion? Is this really compassion and is this really Bresson's purpose?Or is Mouchette a figure that Bresson uses and dehumanizes as literally every character in the movie uses her to achieve other purposes? In this case the selling of a particular view of the world. One which sees the world as a snare both in its joy and its pain that is saved only by the symbolic suffering of the innocent and transcendedtransformed only by death. In other words a viewpoint that that advocates looking beyond or turning away fromlife to find transcendent truths. A view based on judgement rather than acceptance. And if this is the truth why must so much of what we experience as truth such as joy intimacy occasional feelings of oneness with the world be so forcibly excluded? Are these all really illusions the world simply a snare? And without acceptance of ALL of Mouchette's reality can sheor any of us really be redeemed?Yes Bresson is a meticulous incisive and occasionally powerful filmaker. But is he really honest?

I was so eager to see it...Bresson's films Mouchette and Au hasard Balthazar haven't disappointed me to see the least!Mouchette is such a pure film so sublime. So powerful. When I saw this film it really blew me away totally. So overwhelming. But now weeks after that experience I saw that films more than once btw it's still beginning to gain more power and emotion.Mouchette has such overwhelming graceful brilliant images shots and scenes. The opening scene may be the best ever brilliant and pure it tells everything you will see in the next hour and twenty minutes. The use of the music sublime sounds of Monteverdi is unique powerful and brilliant. No more than what is it? ten seconds or so it can be heard. The opening scene is so short...That's the power of Bresson images sounds scenes are presented in such a brilliant way. When we are beginning to be attached to them other images and shots are already presented. As a viewer you can't really be attached totally by them. That's way these images shots scenes will be in your mind long after the film all things all scenes and situations and especially all emotions if they are shown at all are shown in actually too short a time that you as a viewer will be forced to finish them. You are forced to locate the emotions not shown to locate the situations and details which are only suggestively shown. Bresson's editing is just brilliant bt it may take some time before you are aware of that.Some of the most brilliant scenes ever are presented here Mouchette forced to go into church by her father Mouchette's brilliantly and superbly simple introduction to the viewer. Most notable for me besides the ending scene of course is the scene with Mouchette in the dodgem cars having her only small feelings of joy and relieve. The expressions and emotions shown in this really magnificent scene maybe the best and most emotional I've ever witnessed are to diverse to even describe them. Just watch this scene...Nadine Nortier playing Mouchette blew me away with her magnificent acting. So pure sublime graceful and heartfelt. One of the most striking peaces of acting I've ever seen...!This superb film will be in my mind for ever just like Au hasard Balthazar. Nobody not even the best like Dreyer Ozu Bergman and Tarkovsky can present stories images and emotions in such a superbly simple transcendental and pure way as Bresson.Masterpiece!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Mouchette' is a film shot simplistically and delicately which captures the angst and despair of a 14 year old girl.The opening sequence entails the capture of a bird in a poachers trap we witness long length shots and intense closeups of a gamekeeper spying on the poacher. Only natural sounds of footsteps and rustling trees are audible. Instantly we could argue this unpleasant image of the trapped bird parallels the entrapment of Mouchette in her abandoned life. Interestingly the poacher in these scenes Arsene later traps Mouchette in luring her into a false sense of security reinforcing his role as a poacher.From the beginning Bresson's attention to realistic natural diegetic sounds emulates Mouchette's destitute impoverished lifestyle. This technique also enables the audience to focus primarily on the visuals. Dialogue is dispersed through the film and appears in only brief quantities. The raw stark shots of Mouchette's struggle for example tending to her mother sitting alone in the forest and walking home alone after school contrast with the brief moment at the funfair in which she evades the reality of her life. I could not help but differentiate these busy active shots accompanied by an upbeat diegetic soundtrack and closeups of Mouchette's happiness from her solidarity before and after this sequence. This moment the only point where we see her physically and emotionally content is taken from her suddenly and becomes one of our first reflections on our sympathy for her. Added to this are the recurring medium closeups of Mouchette's frown which I found prominent when reflecting on the film.I think many people who have seen 'Mouchette' will note that although the closing sequence is sudden and perhaps bleak you cannot help feeling a sense of catharsis due to the ending of Mouchette's suffering.".

Although the storytelling techniques are similar to the films I didn't care much for what elevates Mouchette is the passionate performances and the crisp photography. While I do regret that it's so brief Mouchette is a brilliant portrayal of a truly tragic figure that faces the hardships and inevitable moral dilemmas of life.

This heaping of indignity upon misery seems to at least one viewer to be no more profound and just as dishonourably manipulative as anything with Robin Williams never mind Bresson's unique and meticulous style and even that has mixed results his amateur actors particularly near the start often look lost.  Every scene finds a new way to thwart the girl's chance of happiness every frame is there to induce a patronizing pity for her.  It's titillation for the tear ducts emotional porn.";

Bresson simply uses the powerful imagery of a gutsy writer Georges Bernanos and makes his film in a rural context of unchanging basic values and prejudices.I have no idea what happened to his lead Nadine Nortier but she seems never to have appeared in another film  that has to be most unusual for an actress showing such talent. Her ravisher JeanClaude Guilbert also seems never to have acted again. So here we have two excellent performances from amateurs who never acted again as far as we can tell working for a brainy French filmmaker who made 16 featurefilms in his 98 yearlong life.The directorial method consists of as little dialogue as possible and plenty of symbolic actions often balancing out in different scenes. Bresson is working in the Euroworld of other heavies such as Ingmar Bergman and money has nothing to do with it. It's a world of ideas and movements.In Mouchette a pubescent girl in a disadvantaged situation is misused by a drunken fellow villager. Her very difficult and complicated night trying both to live up to her idea of womanhood and to fend off her rapist creates great conflict within her that after a couple of days trying to cope she deals with by selfdestruction.An unhappy ending usually spells death for all but very particular films and this one is cited by Criterion as a world classic but can only muster 15 comments on IMDb. So we see that few are interested in the work of big minds.".

She grows up too fast with a string of events in her life and struggles internally to make sense of it all. For some the number of events she encounters seem to lack the subtlety of his previous efforts but it is still a genius of minimalist film making.SPOILERS The film begins by showing us a boy setting up traps to catch birds and we see a bird caught in one of the traps as it tries to set itself free. Is Bresson telling us something about the main character is she a bird trapped unable to taste freedom?Mouchette is a young girl her mother is dying on the bed her father and brother deal in illegal distribution of alcoholic beverages and there is a baby brother that needs to be cared for. Mouchette ends up being the caretaker of her mother and baby brother when she is home. Before she dies the mother tells Mouchette to avoid lazy and drunk men.At school Mouchette shows up unkempt and is socially outcast without friends. She is distracted during school and is ridiculed by the teacher. Mouchette seems to be preoccupied with her home conditions that prevent her from learning and instead of compassion is further humiliated by her teacher. After school Mouchette throws dirt at the other school girls. We don't see the faces of the school girls until the final throw. It is an awkward scene where we wonder about Mouchette's moral character. She remains an ambivalent character but her conditions make us feel a connection to her. She has been unable to emotionally connect with anyone.Her father slaps her at the only time she seemed to be happy flirting in the carnival bumper cars. Her father simply takes his drinks without an inkling of emotion typical of Bresson. After school she loses her way or takes shelter in the woods during a storm. She witnesses the arguments between two men and we wonder whether one of them was killed. The one that befriends her tries to convince her to be his alibi. He ends up raping Mouchette although the scene makes it seem like she embraces the violent act as a final act of desperation when she seems to embrace the man.The next day her mother dies and as she walks to get milk for the family she encounters three women who provide part compassion and part humiliation to Mouchette. The first woman gives her coffee and bread but ends up calling her a slut. The second woman is obsessed with death and gives Mouchette a dress and cover for her mother. The third woman is the wife of the man thought to be dead. She tries to find out what happened to Mouchette but the girl responds that the other man is her lover. Mouchette ends up tearing her new dress by a lake or river and starts rolling down the hill with the dress several times. The last time she rolls down the hill she falls into the water and the movie ends.We do not know whether she lived or died but the scene leaves the viewer rather uneasy. Part of the divisiveness of viewers on the film is that it is such a bleak story with no redeeming features. It is precisely for those reasons that it is a powerful film whether one loves or hates it. Mouchette is a simple film but disquieting and disruptive to all things we hold dear.".

And I know movies aren't obligated to be realistic but this movie certainly has a lot of ingredients on board to make you believe it's trying to be realistic. It's not an absurd or surrealistic film where you won't have to expect to be able to completely understand emotions and social situations. The consequence is  to me at least  that my compassion doesn't know how to handle the situation. First something sad happens and I get moved but then there's weird silences or poetic expressions not necessarily verbal which don't fit the realistic context and interrupt the immersion if you ask me.Another friend of mine with whom I discussed this topic mentioned a good point however perhaps you should let go of the expectation to be moved emotionally. Doesn't the movie just try to display the story possibly telling you to accept life for what it is without necessarily trying to move you? Well observed it's possible. I still believe the movie could benefit strongly if it was more emotionally involving though.I have had this discussion with a lot of people about several movies and it seems nobody either understands or agrees with me on this subject. Therefore I'm even more aware of how subjective this point of view is.

	schema:reviewBody "My Bresson baptism with Mouchette and it underwhelms. I'm sure I picked up Mouchette on strong recommendations but it backfired.Shot in black and white 1967 perhaps to accentuate the despair and and hopelessness of the theme is a tactical mistake. I'm sure there are things you can do with black and white to accentuate particular objects emotions situations as in Hitchcock's movies. Here we are treated to a washed out monotone of colour which does nothing for the many scenes shot in apparently verdant woods. Contrast was poor throughout sharpness non existent colour was a mismanagement.Nadine Nortier is miscast as Mouchette. She has presence but no qualia. Utterly emotionless throughout even when she is crying less of an enigma and more of a non person. What is she thinking what is she about what makes her tick? The blank canvass of her acting output throws up no answers. Marie Cardinal as her mother in only a few short scenes with few words does a much better job of fleshing out a character we as the audience get what she is about a disillusioned weary woman physically and spiritually ill. Mistreated by life and men she is ready to depart this life. Her agony  in fact her life story is played out beautifully in an understated way by Cardinal. Nortier does not come even close with her performance.Mouchette is supposed to be a suffering martyr of some kind but 'm not sure why. Yes the family is poor mum is sick and dad goes out at night to deal in contraband but is that enough to warp your mind and deaden your soul? Why does she refuse to sing in school and throw mud at her schoolmates? Bresson is just sloppy here a few more psychological angle shots wouldn't have been amis just to really set the background on Mouchette's despair.A plot development sees Mouchette out in the woods late at night huddled under a tree. She is found by Arsene the village daredevil who first 'rescues' her from the rain then walks her back to the village and to his house where a little incongruously because there was no build up to this rapes her. And Mouchette likes it. In fact the next day she alludes to him as 'her lover'. Yes she is sadly misused here.Then one hour into the film a host of secondary characters start popping up for the first time. Mouchette's mother dies on the morning after her rape and as Mouchette walks about town to get milk various personages make an appearance. All of them presume to help her with hand me downs and end up calling her a slut and wicked. For no particular reason at all. This grated on my nerves a bit first the glut of personalities piled up all at once what about pacing Bresson? Then their allegations towards Mouchette. If she is indeed a slut why weren't we shown it why wasn't it alluded before why spring it up out of the blue. Of course this may be a subtle reference to the fact Mouchette enjoyed her rape but of course the townfolk can't know this. The only thing this film had going for it is the ending. As Mouchette tumbles down a river bank and literally plops into the river the camera stays put for about thirty seconds on the water before fading out. Does Mouchette resurface or is she dead?".

Utterly emotionless throughout even when she is crying less of an enigma and more of a non person. What is she thinking what is she about what makes her tick? The blank canvass of her acting output throws up no answers. Marie Cardinal as her mother in only a few short scenes with few words does a much better job of fleshing out a character we as the audience get what she is about a disillusioned weary woman physically and spiritually ill. Mistreated by life and men she is ready to depart this life. Her agony  in fact her life story is played out beautifully in an understated way by Cardinal. Nortier does not come even close with her performance.Mouchette is supposed to be a suffering martyr of some kind but 'm not sure why. Yes the family is poor mum is sick and dad goes out at night to deal in contraband but is that enough to warp your mind and deaden your soul? Why does she refuse to sing in school and throw mud at her schoolmates? Bresson is just sloppy here a few more psychological angle shots wouldn't have been amis just to really set the background on Mouchette's despair.A plot development sees Mouchette out in the woods late at night huddled under a tree. She is found by Arsene the village daredevil who first 'rescues' her from the rain then walks her back to the village and to his house where a little incongruously because there was no build up to this rapes her. And Mouchette likes it. In fact the next day she alludes to him as 'her lover'. Yes she is sadly misused here.Then one hour into the film a host of secondary characters start popping up for the first time. Mouchette's mother dies on the morning after her rape and as Mouchette walks about town to get milk various personages make an appearance. All of them presume to help her with hand me downs and end up calling her a slut and wicked. For no particular reason at all. This grated on my nerves a bit first the glut of personalities piled up all at once what about pacing Bresson? Then their allegations towards Mouchette. If she is indeed a slut why weren't we shown it why wasn't it alluded before why spring it up out of the blue. Of course this may be a subtle reference to the fact Mouchette enjoyed her rape but of course the townfolk can't know this. The only thing this film had going for it is the ending. As Mouchette tumbles down a river bank and literally plops into the river the camera stays put for about thirty seconds on the water before fading out. Does Mouchette resurface or is she dead?";

Removing himself a bit from the Christian imagery Bresson takes a very disturbing and depressing approach to something like the comingofage movie where a confused and helpless teenager is thrust suddenly into adulthood.This movie isn't nearly as brooding as Au hasard Balthazar but in a way it can be more disturbing for it. Unlike in Balthazar Mouchette is given almost a moment of joy in the scene with the bumper cars after which she attempts to approach the boy she flirted with during the run. However she is quickly pulled away from any temptation by her father and quickly is thrust back into the land of quiet despair.It's no wonder her confusion and pain especially at the end. After Mouchette is raped and her mother dies she wanders the land in search of some certainty and instead is called several derogative names by the townspeople... all of her attempts to react back at them are rebuked and she's left with absolutely nothing.What Bresson is absolutely spectacular at doing is showing versions of death that are more transcendent than sad. When we mourn Bresson's heroes it is more with a happy knowledge that they have lived past this world of suffering. Bresson's Catholic values saturate much of his filmmaking especially in Mouchette and Au hasard Balthazar but his movies are just as powerful as character studies. Mouchette is a fine piece of filmmaking that endears the viewer to a sense of quiet suffering not often scene in any medium.PolarisDiB".

	schema:reviewBody "The reason the film does succeed and rises to greatness rests primarily on the shoulders of the lead actress Nadine Nortier who despite little dialogue conveys great depths within her character despite being a nonprofessional actress at the time. On the other hand JeanClaude Guilbert a professional actor who also appeared in Au Hasard Balthazar as another drunkard Arnold is also very good. The rest of the cast is solid. Yet critical missteps abound especially when some claim Mouchette is filled with anger. Yes there may be acts of seeming anger tossing dirt at her female rivals bur clearly the character of Mouchette is a walking mass of desensitization. This would explain why she reacts the way she does to sex with Arsene rather than seeing it as her 'striking back' at the world. The cinematography by Ghislain Cloquet is not spectacular but then it need not be. It does however have the simple look and feel of a film shot decades earlier and one need only compare this film with a film like JeanPierre Melville's Le Samourai a color film made the same year to get a sense of just how unique Bresson's vision was. The same is true for the scoring of the film with little music that is not diegetic. Since the film rises and falls on its tale and performance the technical aspects merely have to be solid and they are.The DVD put out by The Criterion Collection is a very good package. The transfer of the film is first rate as the 81 minute black and white film Bresson's last film sans color is shown in a 1.661 aspect ratio. The special features are also quite good. They include an insert essay by Robert Polito that is short on critical masturbation and quite pointed the film's original theatrical trailer by JeanLuc Godard which when seen against the film is utterly at odds with it a documentary called Travelling which is a segment from a TV series called Cinema and has interviews with Bresson Nortier and Guilbert another documentary called Au Hasard Bresson about the director and also an audio film commentary by film critic Tony Rayns which flows very well is not too scripted is scene specific in its comments and conveys both passion and erudition traits too often missing in most commentaries. His lone weak spot comes when trying to explain rather justify the rather weak ending. Rayns claims that death for the girl was preferable to life and that Mouchette had fulfilled her life with sex and death in the last day of her life with the death of the rabbit being the final straw but there is just no evidence for this and Rayns himself is dubious over Mouchette's reaction since she is a girl of the rural life where hunting is a normal activity. And while that may be what Bresson intended and what the character may have thought a critic needs to go beyond merely aping explanations put forth by an artist especially in matters that so clearly demonstrate an artistic failure and one which seems to accept in toto that failure merely due to the reputation of the artist as 'spiritual' therefore beyond needing to make his art cohere.However despite that failure Mouchette is a great film one whose concision heightens its power and one whose deftness of portrayal burrows more deeply into matters than its good but skeletal screenplay does. One of the best techniques Bresson uses to get more out of each brief scene is through the use of repetitions of actions in unrelated scenes which then connect those scenes to others. For example when Mouchette's teacher punishes her and forces her to sing a song it is under duress. Mouchette sings that same song while trying to tend to a seizing Arsene. Mouchette is pushed by her father whenever she wants pleasure and she then pushes Arsene before she has sex with him. There is also a scene where Mouchette is wet working in the bar and then gets some coins as payment. Later in his hut she is wet and Arsene pays her some coins to go along with his story regarding Mathieu's presumed death. What this does is not only link divergent scenes in a strictly visual and cinematic way but it emphasizes the elliptical and cyclical nature of the film where recurring images and motivs abound. Yet all of them are slightly askew and the camera always seems to look at its lead character's life slightly askance as if it was somehow recapitulating the clearly warped view of life Mouchette owns. In essence the film called Mouchette recapitulates the point of view of its character Mouchette which allows the viewer to both 'feel' a bit of the character's warp while also being able to step back and intellectually distance oneself and 'understand' the character's warp.Whether or not Bresson intended this doubled perspective on life it and many of the film's other strengths more than make up for its weak ending and lift it to a greatness that while it falls short of the utmost in the canon of great cinema nonetheless makes Mouchette a film for which the term great is applied a surety. There are certainly worse ways to misfire slightly or otherwise.".

	schema:headline " Well crafted and finely detailed";
	schema:reviewBody "You really have to admire Brian DePalma as a director. He's directed some of the finest thrillers in the last 30 years and even his misfires are interesting to watch like Snake Eyes. I really enjoyed how well made this film is. If you don't like the story thats your business. But this film is so finely detailed and shot that I put it in the same boat as Mulholland Dr. and Blackhawk Down. Interesting films that some viewers had mixed reactions to but the direction of these films was so expertly crafted that even the most ardent critics had to admit to the talent of the director. This film starts out at the Cannes Film Festival where a group of thieves are attempting to steal some diamonds off of a model by having Laure Ash Rebecca RomijnStamos seduce her in a lesbian encounter in the ladies bathroom. Things go wrong and Laure takes off with the diamonds. Seven years later Laure is married to an American diplomat and is in Paris with her husband when a papparazzi named Nicolas Antonio Banderas takes a picture of her. She doesn't want to be photographed because the former members of her gang are still looking for her. What I have just mentioned is just scratching the surface. This is a psychological thriller that has so many twists and turns that the casual film viewer will probably be in over their head. But this is a film that gives many hints along the way as you watch it. You have to pay attention to this film and one key scene takes place when Laure and Nicolas are having coffee in a cafe. Laure is sitting next to the window. Outside a poster is being put up for a film called Deja Vu and the reflection of Laure on the glass is centered in the middle of the poster. DePalma uses many overhead shots to allow the viewer to get full view of certain scenes. Some viewers and critics have said they were disappointed with the casting but I admire the job that Rebecca did for this film. Okay she's not Jodie Foster as far as being an actress is concerned but Foster couldn't exude sexuality like this if her life depended on it either. I thought it was believable that her character could manipulate Nicholas the way she did. How could he not? She was a combination of sexuality and vulnerability inside a very smart and devious mind. And for a film called Femme Fatale you had better find an actress that is smart and utterly beautiful at the same time. I found her performance to be bold and brave. DePalma uses each shot to send signals relating to the story. It sounds like a very difficult shoot because each scene has so much meaning. He doesn't have cameras following characters for nothing. Each shot has a reason. The details to this filming are enormous and difficult. DePalma again shows us the attention to details of his complex artistry. If your one of those shallow film watchers that only views films from the incredible mediocrity of Hollywood than your probably going to be lost watching this film. For the viewers that remember and care about risk taking when making movies than you can appreciate the effort made by DePalma. If you don't like it thats okay. But you should appreciate his effort and nerve as a director.".

	schema:headline " A masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "As I read the comments I can't help wonder how is it possible nobody thought this movie is an essay on cinema as well as a reread of De Palma's own creations and obsessions. The questions on the board suggest that almost nobody pay attention even to the plot. 21 years before Blow Out De Palma's most transparent reference to cinema craftsmanship and the relations between cinema and reality and what is most important to cinema as knowledge or even revelation merged from an almost hopeless vision of the world at the end of the film Jack Terry the character played by Travolta had found the truth but the price he paid for it is loneliness and madness maybe just like Hackman at the end of Coppola's The Conversation revelation is for him a sort of curse as he lost his second chance one of the director's recurrent themes as far as reality made the grade with its web of lies and corruption. Femme fatale shows that De Palma get older and wiser even though reality is as corrupted and plenty of lies as two decades before his faith on cinema as knowledge what is cinema but a dream? is stronger than then. He also has change his point of view about women. This turn that started with Carlito's Way and even more on Snake Eyes is evident here as he shows his own change of mind through a character that goes from his old kind of female character to the new one. And those who wonder about the snake read the Bible Genesis. At the very beginning of the movie Laure's reflection on the tv screen reunites she and Barbara Stanwyck as the summa and the evolution of the femme fatale kind of character. That DOUBLE indemnity starts a game of doubles along the movie. Later when the character of Lily appears there's a choice to be made Laure of course the reference is to Preminger's Laura though the film pays clearer homage to Hitchock's Vertigo has to decide to became Phyllis Dietrichson or to became Lily. The dream strategy is full of risk in fact when a writerdirector uses it as a solution the task is condemned to failure. But De Palma uses it masterfully because dream is not a solution but a way there are ten minutes of movie left after it to give that dream strategy a new sense and a justification that any film ever gave. As I wrote before that dream is built as a movie watch by both audience and Laure. But the collage made by Banderas character is also a movie a frame by frame or scene by scene construction of a reality that is outoftime of that reality. De Palma at the end of the film tell us that is what cinema is made of different scenes shot under diverse lights in separate times joined under one look and put together to make sense. We as spectators are the ones that can contemplate that work finished and this final revelation as the one at the end of Citizen Kane ask us to be able to join the pieces and reach knowledge cinema can give. There is a lot to write about this movie these are only silly notes compared to the type of study Femme Fatale deserves. For those who are not interested on analysing a movie and just want to know if they will have fun watching it I can only say that you can enjoyed the movie with its twists and its suspense even if you don't notice what I am talking about. Femme Fatale is an underrated masterpiece. Long live Brian De Palma even if he has to live in France.".

	schema:headline " Triple Indemnity";
	schema:reviewBody "Femme Fatale is best understood as a game played by Brian De Palma and appreciated by knowing cineastes. It's not about story or characters but about the construction and manipulation of art.Antonio Banderas plays Nicolas Bardo a photographer who has turned his back on photographing celebrities. He now spends his time living in an apartment making huge composite images by arranging tiny photographs. The Bardo character in many ways is Brian De Palma. At war with Hollywood storytelling which is fuelled by celebrity De Palma takes these multiple images and weaves them into a tapestry until a final image is made. The point is that the final image is not reality. It is the artists recreation and completely false.At the end of the film Bardo completes his masterpiece by inserting a little white figure of Laura a name which itself alludes to Otto Preminger's classic onto his wall. The figure doesn't belong Bardo simply chooses to put it there. Thematically Femme Fatale ends on the same note. Noir fatalism is thwarted by a completely arbitrary totally ILLOGICAL and cosmically IMPOSSIBLE moment of editing whereby De Palma redeems his hero and kills off her opponents.Critics call this sequence implausible. But De Palma's point is that it doesn't have to be plausible. Bardo puts the white figure on his wall because he wants to. Similarly De Palma ends the film as he does because he wants to. He shows us Laura's fatalistic noir dream and then rescues her from it. He makes it clear that he is redeeming her and willing this positive ending into existence solely because he as artist but more importantly as noir God has the power to do so.This flips the usual noir logic. If Kubrick's The Killing highlights the deterministic law of the universe Clay's plan crumbling to pieces all because of a random poodle De Palma's Femme Fatale highlights the power of the artist able to do recreate a universe entirely devoid of cosmic law.This theme is also highlighted by the use of the name Bardo a Tibetan word meaning intermediate state. A state between life and death. Over the course of the film Bardo will be caught between life and death as De Palma toys with killing him. Bardo's existence or artistic merit is down to an artist's mere whim.Everything else about De Palma is present in Femme Fatale the voyeur and his object the representation inside the representation the original and its fake copy the doubled characters key episodes built from multiple points of views the elaborate camera work...Watch as De Palma's camera continuously misleads our eyes giving the hidden predominance over the shown until we are forced to separate in our minds the real from its representation and to connect the different pieces into a sense. This technique comprises the film watching experience as a whole and is what De Palma's films are essentially about from Jack Terry's reconstruction of truth with the aid of montage in Blow Out to Santoro's investigations of a crime from partial testimonies in Snake Eyes.This theme the division between reality and image has grown increasingly important for De Palma. The majority of his films are concerned about how we see and watch movies the director obsessed with reminding us that information is not the same thing as knowledge.Consider Snake Eyes which opens with an unbroken tracking shot that essentially lays out the film's plot. The rest of the movie then becomes a demonstration of why everything we had seen in that sequence was a lie. Likewise the opening sequence of Mission Impossible showed us Tom Cruise's crew of agents being picked off one by one. We had already seen each of those murders though in nearly subliminal blips during the movie's credit sequence information without knowledge. Black Dahlia and Redacted similarly deal with a search for truth amongst an image bank of lies.Femme Fatale begins with a long heist sequence. Throughout this sequence allusions are made to Snake Eyes the literal serpent camera and the object of the heist a snake shaped piece of gold De Palma effectively saying The camera is a snake and not to be trusted. Note too the film EstOuest showing as the heist goes on. Like Femme Fatale this is another streamofconsciousness film with an unreliable narrator.And so the rest of Femme Fatale takes a dream within a film approach foreshadowed in opening shot. Watch how De Palma sets this dream sequence up with careful details the storm the clock the time 333 will appear on clocks throughout the dream the water running Laura sinking and by having the actors from before her dream taking on different roles within it.These signifiers and others will emerge throughout the film emphasising the surreal atmosphere of Laura's adventure. Everything becomes disconnected dialogue makes no sense at some points it's dubbed without even following the actors' lips! time jumps back and forth etc etc. Indeed during her dream like Mulholland Drive Laura herself will embody different female archetypes all traceable in film history and particularly in De Palma's films. She's Kim Novak in Vertigo and also Melanie Griffith's prostitute of Body Double and so on and so on.The majority of De Palma's films have dream sequences. Even a serious film like Casualties of War ends with a character waking up on a train realising that the whole film was a nightmare. Why does De Palma feel the need to insert this? My guess is that he doesn't want his films to be seen as real. They exist in a wholly metaphysical space.8.510  As usual with a De Palma film critics and audiences rejected Femme Fatale.".

Even a serious film like Casualties of War ends with a character waking up on a train realising that the whole film was a nightmare. Why does De Palma feel the need to insert this? My guess is that he doesn't want his films to be seen as real. They exist in a wholly metaphysical space.8.510  As usual with a De Palma film critics and audiences rejected Femme Fatale.";

Logistics are loose at best but as the final scenes play out the plot seems relatively unimportant compared to the much stronger elements of the film. The movie blends styles ranging from French independent films' European use of female personas and erotic sensuality to American cult genres such as Pulp Fiction or Twin Peaks with its use of musical counterpoint. There are intensely mature scenes involving more explicit sexual innuendo as well as sophisticated cinematic photography that plays with color shadow and texture. Much of the production involved such intimate attention to this stylistic detail it carries the film. Most wellversed filmgoers are sure to appreciate and relish in the varied themes presented here.The characters in the film are compelling although twodimensional through and through. At first I considered this a weak point but when the filmmaker's intentions of style and mood became more clear I reluctantly acknowledged that stronger characters would have drawn the focus away from the film's more abstract aesthetic qualities. Noire films are often more about style than plot and the characters are often frustratingly underexplained not that I necessarily support this aspect of this otherwise fine genre. It's the contemporary' part that adds the additional dimension of abstraction that demands less from the characters than what we think we want to see. This odd paradox is exactly why I felt the plot was too strong despite its logistical problems. Had the sequence of events been even less important I would have found it much easier to bathe in the visual audible and other aesthetic qualities of the movie.To that end Femme Fatale' is clearly form over substance which may not appeal to the more casual viewer looking for something reminiscent of previous De Palma mainstream blockbusters such as Mission Impossible.' This film cannot be critiqued with a simple view and I wish I had hours more to discuss its more intricate nuances but even still to recommend for or against seeing it is something I find more difficult than reviewing it.".

You have been warned.SPOILER I loved and hated this movie. I loved the vast majority of this film even the use of the split screen which typically irritates me in De Palma films. We're moving along nicely in this slick film great on a technical level and interesting on a plotcharacter level to the point that I'll forgive the unprecedented degree of chance that the story rests on . . . and then . . . and then . . . De Palma basically gives me the middle finger by climaxing with my single greatest pet peeve of all time in all cinema  main character wakes up and its only a dream. My jaw dropped and a stream of thoughts entered my head utilizing language that would be inappropriate for an IMDb review.Dare I say that that moment was more disappointing than Uwe Boll's House of the Dead? At least Boll's film never resembled anything good and never got me to the edge of my seat I never got into that lousy film. But De Palma Femme Fatale rocked! I loved the opening scene the whole first heist which for some reason resonated with a Kubrickian vibe for me probably due to the choice of music over the action. Kudos for taking your sweet time. It was appreciated.And never before had I loved and hated in a good way a character as much as I did Rebecca Romijn Stamos' character. She was so evil but at the same time hilarious and fun with how she played Antonio Banderas' how she manipulated everyone around her. Let's not forget the dialogue between the two when they first meet  the hilariously awesome scene where Antonio has made it into her hotel room with the fake story of losing a 'floppy disk.' This film was so freakin' good . . . and then to be given an It was all for nothing dream ending? Leading up to the end of the film I thought I might just might actually see a film where Laure gets away and continues to be a plotting evil little witch or maybe she'd get what's coming to her and end on a downbeat and I thought to myself I don't really like De Palma but I have to admit if anyone has the artistic integrity and the balls to go against Hollywood formula and uninformed preview audiences . . . it is Brian De Palma. How is it gonna end? How are they gonna get out of this bind?! You're killing me with suspense De Palma . . . and . . . and . . . aw crap.In the De Palma's defense he was aware that the move would split his audience down the middle and he did give numerous clues that it was a dream. I can't stress enough that the bulk of the movie worked so wonderfully in grabbing my attention keeping my attention and keeping me on the edge of my seat. In that respect it is a damn good movie. Also in the film's defense the degree of which the film worked really set up my expectations but its resolution just happens to be my ultimate narrative pet peeve . . . .Ah well as they say en franais C'est la vie.".

	schema:headline " DePalam's last personal statement";
	schema:reviewBody "Scopophilia is Greek for 'love of looking' Brian DePalma like Dario Argento and Hitchcock is always looking. And so are his characters. In the opening of 'Femme Fatale' 2002 Laure is watching Billy Wilder's 'Double Indemnity' 1944. She and her 'gang' are about to steal a fortune in diamonds at the Cannes Film Festival from the girlfriend of film director Regis Wargnier playing himself his film played Cannes that year. The plan is for Laure to successfully seduce her in the bathroom stall while Wargnier's 'EastWest' plays on the big screen. Now it strikes me that as 'meticulous' as the plan sounds it is really fraught with potential failure! Will Laure's seduction happen on cue? Will security take a leak on cue? The last five minutes of the film make you realise the seduction was a dead certainty . What saves it is the bravura filmmaking. The heist shows a technical wizardry that reminded me of the best bits of DePalma's 'Mission Impossible' 1996.He has made remarkable use of the splitscreen technique before but never has it been so selfreflexively and personally deployed as it is here. To slowly introduce the technique during the heist he uses 'natural' screen dividers such as toilet stall walls to divide the screen. This results in later when he actually does split the screen that the divide doesn't seem so gimmicky or jarring. Twenty minutes in and the blonde Laure has performed a double cross. We then cut to a rainy day as Nicolas watches from up high on his balcony he is a photographer Laure was impersonating a photographer at the heist and he snaps Laure who has donned a dark wig and will in more than one way become Lily. About half an hour into the film DePalma begins to caress or is it 'lull' us with running water ticking clocks Pino Donnagio music but by Ryuichi Sakamoto and then a sudden crack of thunder sends us the message that 'something else' is going on here as Laure is in the bath at Lily's parents' house and in walks 'Lily' upset and crying on the day of her funeral the overflowing fish tank is a big clue As Roger Ebert correctly assesses This is a movie about watching and being watched about seeing and not knowing what you see.Seven years after the heist so therefore based on when the film was released we are now in the future! Laure unwillingly returns to Paris she is 'Lily' and married to the American ambassador. The Dj Vu 2008 poster that decorates a telephone booth outside Nicolas' apartment may seem like a simple wink to the audience but the use of the painting Ophelia 1852 by John Everett Millais in the poster points to Laure's trouble with water. In Argento's own 'Trauma' 1993 and Argento fan Chang Younhyun's film 'Tell Me Something' 1999 the Millais painting is used as similar visual shorthand. And mentioning Argento DePalma again uses the surprise reveal from Argento's 'Tenebre.'A classic 'femme fatale' Laure packs a gun and uses her awareness of men to devour them and spit them out. She turns very nasty in the scene on the bridge and Nicolas becomes acutely aware of her intentions. The film becomes very dark indeed with them going to a bar not dissimilar to 'One Eyed Jacks' in David Lynch's 'Fire Walk With Me' 1992 where all the patrons are men wearing black apparently not a gay bar but more a nest of thieves. In the climax on the bridge Laure is thrown in the river having finally been tracked down by her double crossed cohorts but look once she is in the water she is nude born again she has a second chance.Arguably the most personal film DePalma has made since 'Body Double' 'Femme Fatale' is nowhere near as dark a film the Argento within is harder to find but it is there with an outsider investigating seeing and not seeing. It comes complete with a typically frustrating DePalma denouement I suppose he is allowed to use dream sequences Aeschylus' invented them in 'The Persians' in 472 BC.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brian De Palma made a return to the thriller genre in which he made his name after the gigantic blip that was Mission to Mars which he suffered two years earlier. But is his return to the genre a hit or another misfire? Neither actually it's decent.The plot follows the escapades of a young lady that screws the mob out of a heist of diamonds stolen during a thrillingly executed heist at the Cannes film festival. After assuming a new identity she later returns to Paris where she must evade her past by any means necessary.Brian De Palma obviously has a talent for filmmaking this is evident in the majority of his works particularly the earlier ones. It's not as abundant in this film as it is in some of his others but that flair is still shown to a certain extent. He does however seem to spend a lot of the movie piling on the style when he would have been better served building character and giving the audience something to care about. Anyone that knows De Palma knows that he is the man that does Hitchcock. Here he doesn't tribute Hitchcock but rather the melodramatic noir thrillers of the 40's and 50's. This is clearly shown at the start of the movie from the shot where Rebecca Romijn Stamos is sat on a bed watching the classic noir Double Indemnity. Having only seen Stamos previously under heavy makeup in the delicious XMen films it was nice to see her here in a 'normal' role especially as I was one of the people that saw her sex appeal even under all that attire. De Palma teases the viewer with her at first he keeps her face hidden behind various objects and camera movements but when she finally appears she doesn't disappoint Rebecca is one beautiful woman. Especially when she dons that brown wig. Starring alongside Stamos is Antonio Banderas. I like Antonio a lot I rate him as an actor and not just for his role in the spectacular Desperado series. However he isn't at his best in this film. In a role that requires him to don a silly gay accent at certain points Banderas doesn't quite look at home. Maybe it's just because I'm used to seeing him flying round shooting bad guys but he struck me as being a little bored.It may or may not be a good thing that the film is done partly in French as on one hand it makes it more realistic and firmly places us in France but on the other we have to read subtitles in an American film and when I watch an American film I'm not expecting to read subtitles. Especially not ones that disappear before you have a chance to read them fully as they often do here. Another thing about Femme Fatale is that it never manages to be as sexy as it pretends to be. Despite making almost full use of the lead's assets it is ultimately more tease than strip. This could be seen as a nod to the classics to which the film owes itself but for a film that states itself as being a 'steamy thriller' I was expecting slightly more steam.The film boils down a final and surprising twist. Throughout the film keeps you guessing despite being largely hinged on coincidence and the twist does come as a surprise but it is that awful clichd twist that everyone dreads. However to De Palma's credit he does almost make it good. To pull off a twist like the one in this film the storyteller needs to be talented enough to not make the audience demand their money back when the movie finishes. When the twist first hit my eyes were starting to role but credit has to be given to De Palma because even though the twist he's working with is silly he manages to bring the film to a close which wraps it up and does tie all the loose ends together. And although I'm still not sure if that was the right route for the film to take it is well done.Overall Femme Fatale is an enjoyable thriller that is bound to keep most audience members on the edge of their seats throughout. It doesn't echo the brilliance of Dressed to Kill Carrie Sisters or most of De Palma's earlier oeuvre in the thriller genre but it is the best film that the man has made since The Untouchables and is therefore recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an example of how to convey information with a minimum of dialogue this movie is absolutely outstanding. Its plot unfolds so naturally and gracefully across the screen that as well as telling its tale with great efficiency it also creates a wonderfully hypnotic atmosphere. Its story about a wellplanned diamond heist involves doublecrosses blackmail and revenge as well as some reflections on the level to which individuals are able to control their own destinies and interestingly it also includes a number of Hitchcockian influences such as voyeurism doubles confused identities and the disguise motif.Stylistically the emphasis is on presenting the action with the kind of deliberate pace and fluid camerawork that together contribute so strongly to the dreamlike mood of the piece. This in turn makes some of the plot's stranger coincidences apparently illogical developments and moments of deja vu seem far less incongruous than would have been the case if they'd have been seen in a more conventionallyfilmed movie.During the 2001 Cannes Film Festival Laure Ash Rebecca RomjinStamos has a key role to play in a heist that's been planned by her gangleader Black Tie Eriq Ebouaney and posing as a press photographer at one of the premieres sees a model called Veronica Rie Rasmussen who attracts a lot of attention because of the very revealing gold serpentshaped diamondencrusted piece of body jewellery that she's wearing. When Laure and Veronica meet in the ladies' room immediately before the movie's due to be screened Laure is seen apparently seducing the model and during their encounter removes the various pieces of Veronica's bodyjewellery and drops them to the floor. Black Tie who's hidden in the adjacent cubicle then systematically swaps each piece for a fake replica in readiness for making off with the loot which is valued at 10000000. Things don't go so smoothly from this point on and culminate in Laure doublecrossing her partnersincrime and escaping to Paris with the stolen jewellery.In Paris Laure is mistaken for a missing woman called Lily who looks identical to her and so after stealing her double's passport and plane ticket to New York Laure takes the opportunity to escape to a new life in America. During the flight she meets a wealthy businessman who she subsequently marries. Seven years later when her husband Bruce Hewitt Watts Peter Coyote is appointed as the American ambassador to France Laure reluctantly has to return to Paris coincidentally at the same time as Black Tie is released from prison. After a period during which she's able to keep a low profile her cover is suddenly blown after freelance photographer Nicholas Bardo Antonio Banderas takes a photograph of her which then appears in numerous publications and puts her life in danger because her fellow gangmembers are out for revenge.The surreal series of events that follow illustrate further just how evil and manipulative Laure is and produce a dizzying succession of twists and turns that lead to the movie's entertaining and highly unpredictable conclusion. Intriguingly during this part of the movie it also becomes apparent that a number of things that had happened earlier were not actually what they'd appeared to be.Brian De Palma's Femme Fatale is an immensely absorbing mystery thriller that features a woman whose characteristics are typical of the noir archetype and readily admits that she's a bad girl real bad  rotten to the heart. Rebecca RomjinStamos hits all the right notes as both Laure and Lily and Antonio Banderas is charming and humorous as her victim. The real star of the show however is the camera. The ways in which splitscreen techniques tracking shots and overhead camera angles cover the action are totally breathtaking and clearly the work of a filmmaker who fully understands and is inspired by all the possibilities of cinema as a visual medium.".

Those where all films that require the viewer to participate use their brain and have a good time.Brian De Palma is a master filmmaker. One that has been manipulating audiences for over the last 30 years. The opening of this film is brilliant with nearly 25 minutes of no dialogue scenes. Yes there are lines given off here and there as the jewel heist is prepared and executedit is cool that the heist is the opener and not the climax of this story but really it is like watching a silent film. The attention to detail in the opening and all through out is what makes the film great you will watch this over and over and catch something new on each viewing.Some have argued that De Palma is not an autuer but indeed he is. He has his trademark long one takes with the camera gliding around to create a universe that is almost real but still we are aware we are watching fiction. There is the common theme of duel perceptions and persona's burning bright in this film much like in Carrie Dressed to Kill and Blow out. That theme is best illistrated by his use of split screen. Also the slow motion is used to perfection here at critical times unlike Micheal Bay who uses it to make things look pretty.This is a great film yes it takes some suspension of disbelief but that is why its a movie. If its your first De Palma venture you should check out his older thrillers like Body Double and Blow out. He is a great movie maker that has influenced todays greats like David Fincher Quinten Tarantino Richard Kelly and P.T. Anderson in one way or another.".

Femme Fatale is one of Brian De Palma's greatest thrillers along with Dressed to Kill Carrie Obsession etc. If you are not familiar with Brian De Palma films it might be best if you watch some of his more conventional thrillers before watching Femme Fatale.This is definitely one of De Palma's more personal films to date and as he both directed and wrote the screenplay for Femme Fatale he has virtually complete control over the film. Every single camera shot has a meaning to it and this film as many of De Palma's classic camera styles such as split screen slow motion action sequences long takes before a disaster occurs etc.A lot of the talent behind this movie also comes from the cast. Rebecca RomjinStamos gives a noteworthy performance as the bisexual seductive Laure Ash and Anotnio Banderas excels himself as Nicolas Bardo the retired stillobsessed professional photographer who gets trapped in LaureakaLily's seductive web. Other noteworthy performances got to Peter Coyote as Bruce Watts and Eriq Ebouaney as the sinister and ruthless Black Tie.Generally the screenplay for the movie is wellwritten and flows smoothly throughout the movie except for the ending which is a little bit strange. Those who have seen the movie would know what I'm talking about.Also one there's one pretty major problem with the heist at the beginning but you don't really notice it when you're watchingI only picked it up after my fifth viewing of it.AlsoFemme Fatale wouldn't be the same were it not for the film's sweeping and riveting score which sets the slightly mystical yet mysterious tone for the film.Overall a topnotch De Palma classic although nolovers of Brian De Palma may not appreciate it in it's full brilliance".

	schema:headline " Doubled Double Indemnity at 333";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.There's a huge subterranean battle raging for the soul of cinema and it may be one of the most important things in this waking life.A huge contingent sees movies as illustrated stories or recorded plays. In this world the acting matters. The characters are expected to draw us into attentive focus on some matter usually related to archetypes situational humor or sex. Because this is so character focused disciples of this culture feed a celebrity priesthood. The camera is a recorder only. Most people in this world cannot believe there is a larger world of cinema.Another group sees film additionally as a whole new vocabulary for perceiving and reasoning about the world. It is part of a new evolution in how we think and live. It is more visceral and communal than books and takes far less skill to master. In this world it matters what the eye is who the teller is what the form of the vision is. Images matter. All even the actors and story are tokens moved by greater forces of worldcreation. Its where our future lies.DePalma has always been in this second camp and is often reviled because he just doesn't care to cater much to the theatrically inclined. For him everything is about who the watcher is and what heshe knows or fabricates. His best film prior to this was Snake Eyes' which was all about the camera moving Rashomon' from the level of character to narratorcamera. The snake here is the fluid eye possibly untrustworthy. But with this new film he has achieved a whole new level.In terms of story his films have always been about other films rather than life. For some reason people only recognize Hitchcock but Eisenstein Welles Kurosawa and Kubrick are more prominent. Here we have them all plus Antonioni. Oh and Lynch.Lynch is the only other living mainstream director that works this way. His strategy is to have simple folding and to have one of those folds reflect the spookiness of our own minds and how we mess up his movie by the lack of control over our own nightmares. He invented the notion of making film archetypes into characters. Blue Velvet' was about the Capra movie bumping up against the noir and so was Mulholland.' dePalma adopts this by creating two films. See how the second is lit completely differently. See how the camera moves completely differently. See how Laure is a wholly different person even the makeup in the parent's house is radically different.But where Lynch puts surrogates for our own demons dePlama makes room for lots of selfreferential commentary on what he is doing.So we have indications of the film within the filmThe first shot of watching a movie.The heist is at Cannes involving that serpent eye and incidentally employing a literal serpent camera. Moreover that heist is overlain on the screening of Est  Ouest.' If you've seen that you'll get the baitswitch and lying narrator joke. And you'll also get the Bolero reference.The MacMurray character is a photographer who has given up celebrity photography. See how the battle between the two film types is literally reflected?

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers herein.There's a huge subterranean battle raging for the soul of cinema and it may be one of the most important things in this waking life.A huge contingent sees movies as illustrated stories or recorded plays. In this world the acting matters. The characters are expected to draw us into attentive focus on some matter usually related to archetypes situational humor or sex. Because this is so character focused disciples of this culture feed a celebrity priesthood. The camera is a recorder only. Most people in this world cannot believe there is a larger world of cinema.Another group sees film additionally as a whole new vocabulary for perceiving and reasoning about the world. It is part of a new evolution in how we think and live. It is more visceral and communal than books and takes far less skill to master. In this world it matters what the eye is who the teller is what the form of the vision is. Images matter. All even the actors and story are tokens moved by greater forces of worldcreation. Its where our future lies.DePalma has always been in this second camp and is often reviled because he just doesn't care to cater much to the theatrically inclined. For him everything is about who the watcher is and what heshe knows or fabricates. His best film prior to this was Snake Eyes' which was all about the camera moving Rashomon' from the level of character to narratorcamera. The snake here is the fluid eye possibly untrustworthy. But with this new film he has achieved a whole new level.In terms of story his films have always been about other films rather than life. For some reason people only recognize Hitchcock but Eisenstein Welles Kurosawa and Kubrick are more prominent. Here we have them all plus Antonioni. Oh and Lynch.Lynch is the only other living mainstream director that works this way. His strategy is to have simple folding and to have one of those folds reflect the spookiness of our own minds and how we mess up his movie by the lack of control over our own nightmares. He invented the notion of making film archetypes into characters. Blue Velvet' was about the Capra movie bumping up against the noir and so was Mulholland.' dePalma adopts this by creating two films. See how the second is lit completely differently. See how the camera moves completely differently. See how Laure is a wholly different person even the makeup in the parent's house is radically different.But where Lynch puts surrogates for our own demons dePlama makes room for lots of selfreferential commentary on what he is doing.So we have indications of the film within the filmThe first shot of watching a movie.The heist is at Cannes involving that serpent eye and incidentally employing a literal serpent camera. Moreover that heist is overlain on the screening of Est  Ouest.' If you've seen that you'll get the baitswitch and lying narrator joke. And you'll also get the Bolero reference.The MacMurray character is a photographer who has given up celebrity photography. See how the battle between the two film types is literally reflected? He now spends his time making composite images. A fine point note how the coloring of the pieces of two types are shown in the ending composite.The girl being watched by the photographer who is watched by the security guy who is watched by the doublecrossed heist comrades.We have lots of foldingThe two futuresThe two identical' womanThe two loversThe two screensAnd of course along the way we get the jeweled serpent eye the camera. And no one in Hollywood has a more fluid eye a more curious stance than dePalma. Incidentally it drives me wild when people call this noir just because the camera is unnatural and I admit because there is the venetian blinds shot. But this is something larger it subsumes noir because we WATCH the noirish elements.This battle for the soul of the mind is mirrored by wrestling match between avatars of the Microsoft and AppleLinux worlds which is why all the computers in this film are Macs.Ted's Evaluation 3 of 4  worth watching may be elevated depending on what else appear this year as I only allow two fours per year.";

Certainly It would not be to stay with her belovedhusband in Paris. Therefore there is no plausible explanation for her return to Paris. Further divorces are common in America so it would be very easy to her to resolve her problem. In addition this situation of double life has been successfully explored in many movies like for example by David Lynch in Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive.

	schema:reviewBody "I have some questions. As I watch this movie I'm going to write this. 1. Why is there a cat in the security area of the theater?2. Why is the chick with 10 million worth of jewels and gold on so stupid that she lets another woman not only strip her but also cut the gold threadwhich obviously can't be fixed and is the only thing holding her costume on? 3. Why is the chick in camouflage wearing the exact same clothes with the exact same hair cut 7 years later? And why is the guy wearing the exact same blood stained tux shirt I know he just got out of prison but can't he get another shirt? Wasn't the shirt held as evidence and why wasn't he given a deal to get out of jail early by turning on the people who he was working with?4.And so he gets out of prison and throws the chick into the truck without interrogating her or getting any info from her first which really doesn't matter because he sees the real girls photo on a poster across the street. Luckily even though he just committed a murder he has enough time to see that poster because he's not worried about looking around for cops or witnesses or getting away quick? 5.What world do you live in that you can believe that a woman that hot can be walking down the street in those cameo shorts without every guy on the street totally staring and willing to come to her rescue when those two guys grab her and throw her into a truck? Or at least grab the guys who did it? Are we really suppose to believe that nobody saw anything? Why doesn't Antonio get a picture of them throwing her into the truck?6.She just happens to meet her twins parents and be taken in to their house and the twin just happens to kill herself and leave a passport and a plane ticket which just happens to get bumped up to first class.7.Why was Antonia Bandito's character so intent on taking the photos of two women talking outside of a church? 8.Those bad people? It's one bad person and if she's married to the the richest man in the world and looks like she does why can't she just find another bad person to take him out? Although I did like the line Bad people read papers too. 9. If she wants 10 million and she's married to the richest man in the world ever heard of divorce? I hear it pays well. 10. An American French ambassador's wife of the richest man in the world doesn't have 24 hour security? 11.They have sex with their clothes on and Ainthony Bentdildo turns out to be a forty second man? I know I'd want to spend a bit more time with her. At least forty five seconds. 12. What kind of professional killer doesn't shoot someone before they throw them over a bridge? Anybody remember the last scenes from the Batman TV show? Holy freaking nude hot chick Batman? 13.OK so why did I have to watch a stupid dream sequence? What's the point of watching a movie where everything that happens is written off as not being of any value? Everything you just watched is all beyond any criticism due to the fact that it's not real? Lame.14.So two guys just got killed and the photographer isn't trying to get a shot instead he's trying to get some pussy? Well... that sounds right. 15. What's up with the Conan music? 16. Why Why Why was this made? A big waste of time. Oh Oh oh I have to add this one what was the deal with the two gangsters having the guy in their car and him slamming heads and making like he was about to get away and then it just switches into them on the bridge running behind RomajinStamos and slapping her head and then throwing her over the bridge? And then shes in the water naked? What was that all about? A way to sell more posters and hand lotion? Was that a landing strippinstripe shave on her bush? I prefer a triangle myself but then I don't sleep with supermodels.".

Femme Fatale is no different one critic  both professional or amateur  will have it as a 110 movie another will have it at the maximum rate available. Femme Fatale is high grade stuff if one is either a De Palma fan or a lover of film noir. Conversely if these two things don't tick your film loving boxes then the law of averages suggests you should have  or should  stayedstay away from it.De Palma opens up the doors to his fun house and invites noir lovers to come on in and enjoy. It's difficult to write about the plot because it holds many twists and turns it's a veritable supply of uppers and downers twisters and benders all sexed up and pumped full of De Palma's trademark tricks and devilish rug pulls. In truth the story and setup is predictable but the journey is what makes the pic ooze quality and bare faced cheek with the director giggling away like a schoolgirl in the background.Opening up with a sequence that sees our titular fatale Rebecca RomijnStamos watching famed noir classic Double Indemnity De Palma proceeds to homage and love the film noir world. As he uses splitscreens canted angles uptilt shots shadow plays etc the narrative pulses with eroticism and impending cruelty this really is a femme fatale based movie of the grandest kind. As events unfurl with hapless photographer Nicola Bardo a fun packed Antonio Banderas caught in the web Ryuichi Sakamoto's magnificent classical based score swirls around like some sort of peeping tom. The latter of which finds a shifty accomplice in Thierry Arbogast's noir photography.It's a picture awash with dupes dopes and vengeful criminals where the themes of identity duality sexuality and distorted perceptions gnaw away at those investing fully in the viewing experience. Some critics prof and amat have lazily likened the film to David Lynch's Mulholland Drive as if De Palma in 6 short months watched Lynch's movie and then knocked this film out! The copycat charge as funny as the rugpull that De Palma pulls here. Besides as any film noir lover will tell you this has more in keeping with Fritz Lang's 1944 noirer The Woman in the Window than Lynch's film which is no bad thing at all and De Palma knew that. 810".

I didn't think anything could be worse than Wise Guys but he certainly managed new lows with Femme Fatale.I'm not one who thinks Rebecca RomijnStamos can't act. She does a pretty good job on her TV show and has turned in some nice guest performances. I think she's better at comedy though and while there are certainly ways to inject Films Noir with wry humor any attempts at doing so in Fatale failed miserably. And the huge flaws in Femme Fatale only highlight what shortcomings RomizjnStamos does have.Some of the unbelievable developments in the film can be explained by the fact that the main body of the movie is a dream sequence like RomijnStamos being dropped from several stories through a glass ceiling and landing on a pile of cushiony insulation material that just happens to be there. But her just happening at least I think it was coincidence. The film is very short on clarity to obtain the new identity of a woman who is her exact double and ending up being found by friends or family again unclear and left alone in the woman's apartment is as hard to accept as Antonio Bandera's comeandgo accent. I never did figure out if he was playing an American or not.Certainly the doppleganger bit could be an accepted premise on which the film could have been predicated. Instead it was a contrivance as phony and unacceptable as that handy pile of insulation. There was one element that was the hardest to swallow in a film that was full of them. How is it that in a film that features a European leading man and was largely filmed in Europe with a lead actress who must have spent considerable time there during her modeling days was said actress allowed to very clearly call the beverage EXpresso?I laughed almost as hard at that gaffe as I did when in The Principle Jim Belushi pronounced the title word as princeabul.If anyone has ever wondered how a commercially successful director has gotten five Razzie nominations for Worst Director a viewing of Femme Fatale will explain all.".

How is it that in a film that features a European leading man and was largely filmed in Europe with a lead actress who must have spent considerable time there during her modeling days was said actress allowed to very clearly call the beverage EXpresso?I laughed almost as hard at that gaffe as I did when in The Principle Jim Belushi pronounced the title word as princeabul.If anyone has ever wondered how a commercially successful director has gotten five Razzie nominations for Worst Director a viewing of Femme Fatale will explain all.";

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this movie the first thing that came to mind was Wow these kids sure are fake. In many initial reviews this movie was derided as being a joke. It was either hearing about the various nude scenes of Anne Hathaway or a bunch of white kids trying to act black and doing it poorly.I said that that fake was the first thing that came to mind because we are immediately presented with this group of rich white kids acting like they are black. However it is being mistaken by some reviewers that these actors are doing a bad job. What we are really seeing is truly how superficial that these kids are. They are fake in every sense of the word and that is the whole point of the movie. Don't try and act like something you aren't because there are consequences.I say this is a social commentary not perfectly executed but still fairly well done nonetheless. It does truly present many aspects of youth behavior nowadays that most people don't really look at. We are given a true side to high school where there are fake people everywhere underage and illegal activity is happening and its all going on without parents there to see. This movie takes the comedy out of the teenage life that has been prevalent in movies over the past 8 years or so such as American Pie and other similar styled teen comedies and turns it to a sort of opposite view. Now I am not by any means saying that this movie is a guiding light which everyone should see. In fact I don't know if this movie is for everyone because of the issues it presents. Some people especially parents would undoubtedly have problems coming to terms that the behavior seen in this movie happens. Now it doesn't happen everywhere or in every school but I'm pretty sure that you know what I mean.I think this movie is backed up by pretty well performed acting done by the majority of its cast. Anne Hathaway who many doubted had the range to tackle such a role seemed very natural in the part. I don't mean that negatively and I actually give her credit for really becoming the character. The rest of the cast does a good job but it is her performance that truly helps you understand most of the underlying message of the movie.I know that some will not see in this movie what I saw but to each their own. I do hope that people see this movie and don't criticize it solely on what they think is bad acting. It has a much deeper theme than that and I think that the more people understand that the more people will realize this is a pretty good movie.".

Now Anne was a bad choice for the lead because she does look a little old for the role but other than that it was a good film. Let me tell you why if I may. I grew up in the hood. Not what little preppy white kids consider the hood but the actual hood. I am talking about drivebys gang wars drug dealers on the corners and at every bus stop. It might bother people but this was an accurate portrayal of the ghetto. This showed the stereotype of suburban white youth. No not all white kids are whiggers with attitudes that they can't back up. Just like not all Latinos are rock dealers. But please you must recognize that this is showing stereotypes and nothing more. Remember we wouldn't have stereotypes if there wasn't a lot of truth behind it. White kids especially affluent ones are fountains of cynicism. They have no direction in life. Therefore a great many of them turn into what this film shows. Latinos those from areas like my own often do gang up and its very common for them to sell rock and reef. Its not racism and its not an attack on a culture its the truth painful as it might be. If you actually watched this film closely and had an open point of view you'd see that the only thing in this movie that lacks credibility is Anne's age.".

It's possible the filmmakers aren't at fault here because when you make a movie about irritating people don't be surprised that the viewers will find themselves irritated. But if you take on a film that'll make people's brains hemorrhage you probably deserve to be booed.Honestly though after seeing this piece of crap I'm surprised Stephen Gaghan can still get work in Hollywood. Likewise for Hathaway who does a respectable job with a vastly mundane script. Not so kudos to Bijou Philips for whom playing trash isn't exactly a huge stretch or test of acting ability nor to Freddy Rodriguez who to make his speech more threatening actually slows himself down so much that he starts. Speaking. In. Fragments. Of the trio though he may be the most surprising transformation especially since he's so squeaky on Six Feet Under. It was unexpected but it may have been a casting mistake. Instead of appearing threatening he looks more like he has Short Man's Syndrome since Hathaway has a head of height on him and may appear more menacing therefore. I know I shouldn't be so astounded but it stupefies me still how far Hollywood will go to make the worst casting decisions in the name of getting someone proximately famous for the DVD cover. Oy...I think the most irksome thing about Havoc is that in the end it's a vacuous morality tale. They had a chance to make something of the examination of bored rich teenagers who want to be poor on purpose but they instead glazed over it. No one involved has longlasting suffering. It's like the whole thing was just a bad dream which is I suppose a fitting description of a night spent watching Havoc a most aptlytitled film. The most disappointing aspect of the whole deal is that the personal responsibility lesson isn't given enough gravity. Bored unlikable upperclass adolescents get in a wee bit of trouble with a Latin gang of their own accord? My cup overfloweth. Honest to God if I have to hear another person defend an individual's actions on the basis of the It's only your fault until you get hurt then you can blame someone else line I'm going to implode. And guess what Havoc does? Bottom line if you're looking for halfnaked girls you've hit the jackpot. Also if you're a teenager and you're looking for some kind of searing expose of the Gee I think I'll go join a gang today lifestyle you too are in luck. Otherwise don't be surprised if you find yourself vomiting uncontrollably and crying for your mother during the ninety minutes of the train wreck called Havoc.".

But on the other hand that's pretty much the point. Los Angeles certainly has a reputation somewhat deserved for plasticity so I suppose that Los Angeles high schools would be even worse because a large percentage of high school students everywhere tend to conform to some clique or another as do many adults for that matter but the join a club to fit in and be accepted mentality is usually more transparent and focused in high school. So the main characters should be annoying and Allison and later her friend Emily Bijou Phillips should be frustrating in their lack of direction and independent identity.The problem with Havoc however is that the bulk of the running time is given to this irksome frustrating and ridiculous group of characters. That's not exactly a recipe for falling in love with a film. Both Allison and the audience will likely respond to the Mexican gang better because there is an air of authenticity present with them thanks largely to the cast playing those roles but they're just not in the film enough and the climax and dnouement are far less than satisfactory in that regard. Likewise one rich kid character who is making an amateur documentary on the rich kid gang comes across as more authentic and interesting but he ends up having an inexcusably minor role.Still if you can bear the inundation of poser behavior and lingo there is an interesting story somewhat buried here plus some attractive cinematography a good soundtrack both the songs and the more traditional score and I'm certainly not complaining about seeing um more of Anne Hathaway.

It is an insulting story one that stereotypes Hispanics as drugpeddling raping thugs in a totally black and white manner not taking into consideration the viewpoint of a cultural group's positive attributes and philosophies.No longer a viable gimmick the film begins with the tired clich of a kid making a documentary about his friends asking what they like and don't like their goals their outlooks. The fact that none of the interviewees has a clue about life preferring to follow the current Hip Hop language very poorly written and focusing on sex drugs and escapes from their wealthy environments. Among these are three girls the main character being Allison Anne Hathaway miscast in every way who follow their superficial boyfriends on a joyride for drugs into East LA. There they meet Hector Freddy Rodrguez trying his best to create a character without the benefit of a decent script who sells them drugs and whom Allison eyes. Allison is so shallow she doesn't have a clue about her motivations just wanting something 'dangerous' to happen. She coaxes her equally clueless girlfriends into going into East LA to seduce Hector and ends up in a ridiculous barter for joining Hector's gang no mention is made at all about the Chicanas who would never allow these three geeks to enter their territory unchallenged.

	schema:reviewBody "Words cannot express how much I hated this movie. I hated every aspect of it from the direction to the writing to the acting. Havoc is the story of one teenager's Anne Hathaway exploration of a world outside that which she is accustomed. And that's putting it in a way that gives this movie more credit than it deserves. Hathaway's character is part of a gang of white upperclass highschoolers who backlash at their upbringing by emulated black culture. She and her friends eventually decide to take a trip to East L.A. and no hilarity ensues.I decided to watch this movie for two reasons Stephen Gaghan had a hand in it and Anne Hathaway who I have always found enjoyable to watch was starring in it.I'll begin my criticism with the writing. After finally viewing the movie I can honestly say that I found nothing that resembles Stephen Gaghan in the script. Vapid is the only word I can think of to describe the thoughts and ideas of this movie. It is one of the those movies that tries so hard to make a social comment yet fails so miserably. The characters are all onedimensional especially Toby Mike Vogel the wigger boyfriend of Hathaway's character Allison. His actions are so broad and exaggerated I had a hard time taking anything he or anyone on screen at the time did seriously. Finally each character was written to be an example of a stereotype. I almost laughed when Hector Freddy Rodriguez tried to explain that not everything in East L.A. was about gangs and drugs then proceeded to fill every stereotype of a movie gang member. Each and every actor in this movie lost points in my book for being associated with this film. Even those I like and respect. Michael Biehn Laura San Giacomo Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips all have done serious believable roles. Even Joseph GordonLevitt whose only respectable role I've seen him in was 10 Things I Hate About You I haven't seen Manic as of this writing in which he was at least believable. Here his unbelievable overacting reaches a point at which Paris Hilton would be proud. This brings me to the directing. Because I respect many of the leads and they have done great work in the past I can only blame the awful choices on the director. Very few movies reach the depths this movie does. I have not hated a movie so much since The Doom Generation. Stay away if you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "Negative comments about this film need to be tempered by the sad story surrounding its making. The script was written by a 17year old girl named Jessica Kaplan. No It's not Citizen Kane but it is an extraordinary piece of work for a teenager. And most sadly she perished in an airplane crash at the age of 21. The film is dedicated to her memory.As to the film's merits it is by my count the 1464th variation of Rebel Without A Cause which I think said all that needed to be said on the subject. Did you know that adolescents often find society empty and pointless? And that they do stupid things by way of rebelling against it in hopes of dispelling their angst and finding something more meaningful? Yes it's true. In this version of that old chestnut the rebels are a particularly spoiled group of high school students living in Hollywood. To find something they consider real they form youth gangs in imitation of the poor folk in East L.A. And then they actually go there at first to buy drugs but then rich girls Anne Hatahway and Bijou Phillips try to get involved in the local Hispanic gang scene. Some pretty modest mayhem ensues.The East L.A. people are awfully sanitized and not very believable. Nobody is addicted to anything. Nobody is desperate. Nobody appears to be poor. These are basically solid middle class folk devoted to family who have a few surface quirks and who happen to sell crack cocaine instead of say life insurance.Is it my imagination or does the gorgeous Bijou Phillips always play exactly the same role  a sexually eager girl who gets in over her head discovering the hard way that yes she has limits? That's the role she plays here and she is fine as is lead Anne Hatahway. But I wonder whether that is her entire repertoire. Perhaps she will branch out someday.Somewhere on this planet there must be some group of people more deserving of sympathy than affluent Hollywood teenagers. So I found myself wondering why this film had been made. The young scriptwriter should not be held accountable but you would think older people would know better.".

	schema:reviewBody "After reading the comments for this movie I had a strong urge to see it. To be honest it seemed like a bit of a pot boiler though I was surprised when I found out it was penned by the same writer that gave us Syriana and Traffic. What I really liked about this film was what lied beneath its surface even if that seed wasn't brought to fruition for a number of reasons. What I thought the film truly attempted to explore was the membrane between cultures that has become permeable in today's mediasaturated environment or more specifically the access granted to those with the means to appropriate what has become a stylized version of ghetto culture. It is one of the more fascinating reversals in contemporary culture made possible only by the media explosion  the cultural performance of a sort of ghetto aesthetic by white suburban youth whose participation in that aesthetic is one of choice rather than of necessity as it could possibly be said is true of those who must actually navigate the ghetto. I appreciate the effort on the part of Gaghan to explore this cultural phenomenon but unfortunately he and his collaborators fell short of their endeavor in more than one area.For one and I imagine many would agree the choice of Anne Hathaway as the lead was particularly disastrous and not because of her association to more wholesome films but because she simply did not have the capacity as an actress to perform this role. Secondly the performance of the PLC actors was fairly laughable though the blame must be placed on the scriptwriters for this one. The characters switched too freely from their thug personae to their authentic if that word is appropriate suburban personae. The filmmakers truly cut their own feet out from under them and missed the point white teenagers immersed in this sort of cultural performance are usually far more invested in their own individual performances and thus would not be likely to slip so freely between identities. That they were able to do so betrayed the fact that the teenagers were aware that they were in fact performing rendering the characters unbelievable and blunting the point of the film. But the film's true failure was in its mindboggling refusal to prioritize the subject matter above the personal struggle of the protagonist which comes off as pretty flimsy. If the filmmakers really wanted to explore the interplay between cultures and the consequences of that interaction as the result of our mediasaturated environment there really should not have relied on such an antiquated notion of a central protagonist. It's just not that kind of movie or shouldn't have been. Gaghan did a stunning job of elevating his subjectmatter in Traffic and Syriana which leaves me with the sinking sensation that there might have been some studio intervention on this one. In the end Havoc is stifled by the centrality of Allison's moral dilemma. What is far more interesting is the implications of this threshold  both figurative and literal  that has been opened in contemporary American society. Havoc's endeavor is a bold one in exploring a sojourn between cultures not just in a circumscribed sense wherein suburban teens take part in a cultural performance within the confines of their own environment mediated by digital medium but in a real world scenario. The most poignant moments occur within this awkward zone of interaction and much of the praise can be placed on Johnny Vasquez the scene where he explains that East Los Angeles is a place where people live rather than a vacuum of nightly news reported crime. Perhaps the most searing line occurs after the contentious rape scene in which Manuel asks Allison What did you want? alerting her that this experience is not within the locus of control usually allotted her as the result of her white privilege. An authentic experience is inherently alien to her and experiencing the alien is rarely comforting. Such interaction carries the weight of victimization for both parties  Allison and Emily for whom the sexual taboos are too great a hurtle to jump and Manuel who suffers the consequences of Emily's attempt to grasp at some sense of control and to cover up the shame that she feels following the sexual interlude. This double victimization is something that is overlooked in the wasit or wasitnot arguments over the sex scene which is unfortunate because the point of the film although poorly articulated can be found in the aftermath of that scene.".

He is an actor's actor! he will knock you out with his acting muscle. Although this film surrounds the lives of teenagers it is in no way shape or form a teenybopper movie. It is a movie that displays the problems with having everything but whats really important like the real love of a family. In the film Allison will go so far as to sleep with a gang member as an initiation to be a part of this gang..this family. She is desperate for the feeling of family. Sound more clich than it is. See this movie it was very moving and I left feeling like I went through something besides just sitting there watching a bunch of actors pretend something for my enjoyment!".

What was she thinking? What was Roeper thinking? I thought maybe she chose this movie because she saw some challenge. The only challenge I believe she had was showing her breasts. Her character was shallow and it was supposed to be. How difficult is it to play a shallow character? It couldn't have been too difficult because every one of the gangbangerwannabes was shallow. True to life for them but so what? The parents were just as shallow. The more I watched the more I prayed for someone to start acting. Just when I saw possibilities I was disappointed once again.The best characters were Hector and his gang. They were the most intriguing because once Allison made contact it became possible that someone was going to experience a change in life and Hector was truly one who could make that change. On the other hand Allison could also make the change. Welll it disappointed again. It isn't that a change hadn't occurred a change did occur but not one that would help this movie.The movie is weak and often gives one a reason to walk away. Someone wanted to tell a story that would show life on the wild side and probably encourage abstention to anyone tempted to indulge in a very tough and rough life. But the people who wanted to tell that story gave up ironically just like the shallow characters. The lesson was apparently lost with any hope to make this a quality film.One last thing if anyone can find a character to relate to good luck to you. Good luck to Anne too. Maybe now that Anne has bared her breasts she will be able to bare her soul in a role more deserving.210 is the best I can do. I guess anyone having anything to do with Havoc is destined to give so little.".

It isn't that a change hadn't occurred a change did occur but not one that would help this movie.The movie is weak and often gives one a reason to walk away. Someone wanted to tell a story that would show life on the wild side and probably encourage abstention to anyone tempted to indulge in a very tough and rough life. But the people who wanted to tell that story gave up ironically just like the shallow characters. The lesson was apparently lost with any hope to make this a quality film.One last thing if anyone can find a character to relate to good luck to you. Good luck to Anne too. Maybe now that Anne has bared her breasts she will be able to bare her soul in a role more deserving.210 is the best I can do. I guess anyone having anything to do with Havoc is destined to give so little.";

	schema:headline " A promising premise and a solid performance wasted";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite the fact that this movie is like the umpteenth variation of Rebel Without A Cause anybody who has gone to a high school in an affluent area in the last decade and seen the amount of pampered young 'wiggers' there are knows that the premise of this flick is relevant to today's youth and is worth exploring. Unfortunately the movie fails to deliver on this promising premise and only succeeds in wasting a fine performance from Anne Hathaway.The movie WANTS to make a powerful statement about spoiled naive pseudodisillusioned youths searching for identity in the superficial only to receive a colossal reality check when they realize the life they've been imitating isn't as glamorous as they had thought. Unfortunately this noble message is lost in a weak script and characters that are either onedimensional unbelievable or both. Although one must consider the fact that the screenplay was for the most part written by a 16yearold girl before judging it it is disappointing that an Academy Awardwinning cowriter with some experience with this genre of film Stephen Gaghan could not give the screenplay and characters a more authentic feel.Even if it was the screenwriter's intention to make the script's dialogue horrible for the sake of legitimizing just how inane the gang of rich white teens are acting the horrid screen writing comes off so cartoonish that the viewer will have an extremely difficult time accepting the dialogue and consequently the behavior of these characters as being legitimate. As a result the gang of rich white wannabe thugs come off for the most part as being overwrought caricatures saddled with some of the most laughably horrible dialogue ever heard in a motion picture. As for the gang of cholo thugs in the movie they come off as being far too nice and too stereotypical to Latinos and thus seem only marginally less cartoony that the gang of rich white kids.The movie's lone saving grace is Anne Hathaway. Playing a role that shares some parallels with and could be considered a natural extension of her smartgirlwitharebelliousstreak Meghan Green character from the shortlived TV series Get Real hers was the only character in the movie that had any sort of depth and believability. The script despite its many shortcomings succeeds in making it clear just how selfaware intelligent and capable of good Hathaway's character is in spite of her actions as a member of the gang of rich white teens giving the film its lone threedimensional character. Because of Hathaway's talent as an actress as well as her successful exploitation of the public's predominant perception of her as a wholesome girl next door for this film it is easy for the audience to believe that Hathaway's character is the rebelwithoutaclue fish out of water that the script is trying to portray her as. Hathaway's acting is superb head and shoulders above anyone else in the film which adds to her character's legitimacy. However the people who see this movie will likely be too busy snickering at the inane lines of dialogue she's repeatedly forced to drop or more likely be gaping at their TV thinking O...M...G! The chick from The Princess Diaries is actually TOPLESS! to notice her solid performance.Which leads to a discussion of arguably the biggest reason most people even know this film exists. Hathaway has claimed in interviews that she only does nudity in films if she deems it necessary to the story. While a case can be made that most of the nudity in the film was appropriate when considering the context of the scenes in which it was featured I find myself questioning just how necessary it is for example to show Hathaway's character popping her top while making out with her boyfriend or for that matter to see Bijou Phillips' character in the film topless while taking a bubble bath. That's not to say this movie should be mistaken for a latenight film on Skinemax it most certainly isn't. But Hathaway is topless just enough in this film to make this obvious attempt to expand her acting repertoire beyond the roles in family films she had previously been limited to seem heavyhanded and maybe even a little desperate. Anne take it from me you're a wonderful actress. That alone will do more to land you mature roles than taking off your top for sex scenes in a poorlyscripted indie movie ever will.When all is said and done the amount of nudity in this movie only made it worse when you factor the amount of it in along with in how disappointing the movie is it only adds evidence to the argument that the only reason this movie exists was for Hathaway to prove to us just how far she was willing to go to avoid being typecast as Princess Mia Thermopolis for the rest of her acting career...which is a shame considering her legitimately solid acting job in this movie.Rent Kids or Thirteen instead both films are about topics similar to this movie and both are far better.".

Havoc is easily in my top three worst movies ever seen and is probably fighting hard for number 1. Just when you think it can't get any worse it does. The plot for this movie is horrible. This movie represents a studio advertising Anne Hathaway's nudity and making money off of it while putting a horrible plot and other actorsactresses around her. Don't misread this I am not against nudity at all but there wasn't anything else in this movie that made it worth watching. Don't waste your time watching this movie because it will only leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.

At least MMW was a psstake of these sorts of kids rather than trying to be serious.This film is not entertainment.Watch it once but no more that is if you can bear the annoyance of the little rich immature 'ganstarapimitating' punks.People who rated this film highly need to growup get real and get a life.

She just looks flat out out of place with the other actors.The opening sequence was just about as pitiful as it can get.Yeah seeing Anne Hathaway naked is interesting she is absolutely gorgeous. The language probably close to reality. It just doesn't make good film.Points for the film being well shot and with very good sound.

Having her material needs satisfied by her ultra rich parents but living in essentially an empty home her friends and her seek out the alternative lifestyle which promises loads of fun and excitement  drugs drink and fights. Being associated with a gang brings about some perceived self esteem and self worth. But where do you draw the line when you're always seeking another high moment? A journey to downtown  the areas of the havenots where seedy bogeymen reside in areas where parents warn their children to stay away from sparks a discovery of a wonderland for Allison and her best friend Emily Bijou Phillips as they make repeated trips to be amongst the real boys in the 'hood to hang out chill and do whatever them wannabes have done at a magnitude of 10. It's a primal attraction and sexual tension between the girls and the men not the boys they hang out with who pee in their pants when faced with real danger  acting cool is not cool and between Allison and Hector Freddy Rodriguez.But like all revelations sometimes it takes the hard way to learn a lesson and the movie picked up on this rather rapidly in the last third once they got enticed into playing a game of dice with sexual connotations in order to be initiated into Hector's gang. Basically the audience observes the attraction of an alternative lifestyle of wannabes thinking they can handle it all and of redemption and change.While it was a surprise to see Michael Biehn in the movie the movie clearly belonged to Anne Hathaway in her very first attempt to break away from her goodytwoshoes roles like in the Princess Diaries and Ella Enchanted. However with the M18 rating here this movie suffered cuts where it really mattered and a poor edit too at one of the more pivotal scenes which literally screwed up the understanding of what actually happened only to be told at face value suggesting the truth of the matter at a later stage. Sometimes I wonder why not release it as R21 and keep the film intact. Surely Hathaway has fans but to mutilate the movie to let them in is a bad decision.It's peculiar to have the movie released this week up against Singer's SUperman. Maybe some rebellious bored teenagers happen to be the answer to balance the truth and justice that the last son of Krypton embodies?".

That said though I could have easily watched another 30 minutes of this. No one was ready for it to end and that's a good sign. The plot is what it is being based on a true story and all. It felt like the screenwriters and director wanted to stay close to the actual events and it worked. I would have paid for this and been happy. Romance drama fans will be pleased.

The fact that this movie was based on one with a moronic character and a mediocre ending shows just how masochist viewers are. The movie is slow not emotional enough given the subject matter and just in general not all that good. The only emotional part of the movie was the scene with Paige McAdams' character interacting with her mom near the end of the movie. For a film about a girl who loses her memory and therefore the memory of the love of her life this movie was pretty blah.

The only similarity to 50 First Dates is that both the female leads suffer from amnesia with their respective significant others trying to win her heart. The Vow actually comes across having a feel more like The Notebook.It's the story of the romance between Leo Channing Tatum and Paige Rachel McAdams and who are victims of a car accident. Leo recovers but Paige emerges with no memories of her whole relationship nor marriage to Leo and he must now make her fall in love with him again. In her mind as Leo says in one of the trailers for this movie she's still engaged to her exfianc.The movie manages to avoid cheap Hollywood writing and gently leads you down its plot. Just when you think you might know where the story is going it heads in a different direction. Details are revealed to you layer by layer as Paige discovers them. Tatum's voiceover was somewhat annoying and unnecessary.In trying to remember her memories Paige manages to gain a new life. Opening in time for Valentine's Day this makes for a wonderful datenight movie.".

This movie gave them exactly what they paid for. There were plenty of cute moments that make you say ahhhhhh. There strange nostalgic moments that makes you realize exactly how much time Rachel McAdams forgot wait for the moment when she turns to Channing Tatum and asks him who the President of the United States is.This movie delivered for the audience at large. But several problems persist. For such a unique perspective on memory loss The Vow falls into the flow of the average romantic comedy. As the core of the storyline develops which strangely reminds me of Terri Schiavo I can't help but feel like I have seen this before. There were so many interesting possibilities that a memoryloss movie could pursue. Instead the writing team which is known for big star movies such as He's Just Not That Into You and Valentine's Day decides to take the safe route. The writing team stops this movie from being great.Despite its problems The Vow relies heavily on its actors. With Rachel McAdams Channing Tatum Sam Neill and Scott Speedman who I still see as the romantic interest from the TV hit Felicity relying so heavily on your actors is perfectly alright. Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum have a chemistry that I didn't expect. This chemistry drives the storyline forwards and leads to several dramatic and hilarious scenes that will surprise you.I need to make a note about movies that are Based on a True Story. It's difficult to take these story lines at face value. By basing a story on true events the producers are hoping that you will not look too far into the plausibility of the situation. When you compare the movie with the true events however the differences are immense. Namely the movie makes the crash result in one problem the loss of several years of memories. In reality the woman what badly hurt and also suffered from severe short term memory loss. The possibility of losing several years of memories and not haven't any other physical sideeffects aside form a tiny scar around her eyes is almost entirely impossible.The Vow is cute enough to enjoy at facevalue. If you are looking for a movie to simply enjoy and not think too deeply this is the movie for you. 2012 has been an awful year for Romantic Comedies. One for the Money was dreadful. This Means War promises to be almost as bad. If you are pining for a romantic comedy this will fill your appetite until the first great one of the year is released. Looking over the list of romantic comedies to be released however there isn't much. My money is on the new American Pie movie.".

The problems begin with the lack of any discernible chemistry between Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum who play Paige and Leo  the fictional couple who go through that nightmare scenario and it continues with weak acting and a bunch of important characters who are just totally unlikable. The only part of the movie that came across to me as raw with emotion was when Leo slugged Jeremy in the face. I'd have done the same thing under the circumstances. But it made me wonder why this movie had to be populated with such imbecilic characters.Sam Neill as Paige's father and Jessica Lange as her mother are nothing short of manipulative as they try to turn their daughter's horrible accident and memory loss to their own advantage actively trying to cut Leo out of their daughter's life and Jeremy Scott Speedman is no less manipulative. The downright ugliness of those characters certainly raises up in the viewer a desire for things to work out for Leo and Paige but they don't make the movie enjoyable. McAdams struck me as lost through most of this  her portrayal of Paige and her situation just not coming across as believable and Tatum didn't especially impress me either.The basic concept has been seen before. Think 50 First Dates although this is more serious than that or Regarding Henry although this is less serious than that. What this should have going for it is the inspired by true events angle but frankly that gets done so much now that I don't think anyone takes it all that seriously. I'm glad it worked out for the real life couple whose story did inspire this. I just wish this movie had itself been a bit more inspiring. 210".

Production design is good with good background score gelling well with the film. Coming to performances  Channing Tatum and Rachael Mcadams are easily one of the sought out actors of today's generation.

The set director seems to think messy is what an authentic apartment in the city looks like and the whoever was in charge of wardrobe should be made to wear those hideous outfits for the next year.The only reason this didn't get a one from me is that it really does capture that hometown in the big city essence of some of the neighborhoods in Chicago. The following contains general spoilers not specifics.What really turned me off about this movie was that anyone thought this story was inspiring enough to put it on screen. I was shocked when I found out it was based proudly on a real story. Let me tell you I would not want to know the woman who was the inspiration for Paige. The movie portrayed Paige after the accident but they don't really show us much of what she as like before the accident. The few glimpses give us the impression that she was a woman who loved life and honored the bond of marriage. I don't buy it. Losing your memory may change things but it does not change your underlying personality. Paige didn't turn into a selfish uncaring itch. She probably always was one.A decent woman would have put some effort into recovering her marriage and would have at the very least had some respect for the man she was married to. This woman didn't care that she was ripping this poor man's heart out. She cared for no one but herself. At least as far as the movie was concerned she never gave much thought to anyone but herself. She was after all not the only one who was going through a traumatic lifechanging experience and she was not the only one injured in the car crash. If this story is actually true my heart goes to the woman's real family.This should never have been immortalized in film. It is the very epitome of the me generation. The best part of the movie for me was when the end credits finally started rolling so we could leave.".

Overall I think this movie lacked drama and character. For instance why was it suck a big deal that her father cheated. Yes I understand the pain but to stop speaking to your entire family for five years when it wasn't anyone's fault but your fathers. Could have been written a little better.

	schema:reviewBody "While reading up on The Vow I learned that professional reviewers didn't particularly care for this film. The same can be said for many of the IMDb reviews. While I would disagree since I really enjoyed the film I can certainly understand some of the dislike. For folks wanting a traditional romantic film The Vow isn't exactly a date movie. A traditional date film has a formulaincluding a happy ending. And oddly the film ends on a hopeful but vague notedisappointing those needing the happy finale.In addition to reading up on the reviews I also looked into the story of Kimand Krickitt Carpenterthe couple whose real life story inspired this film. I say inspires because so much of the film is fictional and the religious faith of the Carpenters was omitted in The Vow. It's sad as although you don't want a preachy film it's odd how in films today there is NO reference to God or almost none and this might have been an interesting addition to the movie.Now on to the film. The story if you don't know is about a newly married couple who are in a terrible traffic accident. Leo Channing Tatum is okay but his wife Paige Rachel McAdams is left in a coma. Oddly when she awakens she has a strange sort of amnesia where the most recent portion of her life is missing. This means she has no idea who her husband is and their time together is naturally quite uncomfortable and awkward. At the same time Paige's no longer existent relationship with her parents is suddenly given a second chance and they work hard to recapture her love and make her the girl she used to be. What will become of poor Leo? The two leads McAdams and Tatum were quite good in the film and easy to watch. The script rather clever and enjoyable. And overall I have very little negative to say about the film. Well worth seeingjust be forewarned that although there is a lot of romance in the film it is not at all traditional or what you might expect from such a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Written by Markus Robinson Edited by Nicole I. AshlandI swear the only purpose of films like The Vow are to make the rest of us guys look bad. Directed in ample fashion by Michael Sucsy Grey Gardens  but written by a trio of B rate romantic comedy writers including Abby Kohn Valentine's Day Marc Silverstein He's Just Not That Into You and Jason Katims The Vow works not on the theory that love conquers all but on the lesser addressed notion of good guys always finish last but if they stay loyal like dogs they will eventually get the girl they want. The The Vow if you don't know by now is about this fairly annoying couple played by Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum. You know the type. The far too quirky couple who continuously acts as if they are perpetually in their honeymoon phase in public. Anyways this couple who has been married for four years is in a car crash where the wife Paige loses her memory. Well she doesn't lose her memory entirely just conveniently the memories that include her life with her husband Leo. So if Leo really loves Paige he must work to make her fall in love with him all over again. I don't want to scoff at or downplay this lame premise too much because it is based on a true story but COME ON! This sounds like a Nicholas Sparks story on steroids. And in fact if you are a fan of the lesser Nicolas Sparks film adaptations The Last Song Dear John The Vow might be right up your alley. BUT still there are some major issues here that may work to disappoint even the most fierce sappyromantic film addicts. Because truth be told the premise of The Vow is exponentially more interesting than anything the movie has to offer. Writing for men Many instances in Hollywood films there are writers that produce screenplays that contain poorly written female characters. In these cases the woman will be more of a prop than an actual fully developed person. She will be a supporting stand by your man subservient character whose sole purpose is to get the man where he needs to go. With The Vow just the opposite holds true. The film seems as if it were written by writers who don't know how to write for men. While the female cast is given characters that are more vibrant and have lively backstories Tatum is given a character that has little substance if any at all and can be only described only as nice guy husband. This makes the Leo character so unrealistic that his sweet gestures which are meant to seem romantic come off as phony. Furthermore his character is so one dimensional and effeminate on many occasions not to say guys can't be effeminate that even the section of audience that bought a ticket just to see Tatum get the girl will find his character tedious and undesirable at times.Final Thought At the end of the day this movie is what it is. If you are expecting romantic greatness then you've come to the wrong place because most of The Vow is very love story paintbynumbers. But if you are looking for a fluffpiece to get you though Valentine's Day because your significant other forgot to plan a nice dinner then The Vow may be what you are looking for. In a nutshell the main reason why The Vow is a subpar romantic movie is simpler than just the acting was bad or the dialogue was poorly written. In a nutshell The Vow doesn't work simply because not for one minute was I invested in any of the characters onscreen. And that is the kiss of death for any romantic film.Please visit my page on Examiner.com httpwww.examiner.comx52464SanJoseIndieMovieExaminer and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

Leo is determined to help her regain her memory but her nasty parents Sam Neill and Jessica Lange don't like him and want her to live with them and let Leo go.I won't lieI went to see this to see Tatum's butt shot which lasts all of 12 seconds. It's worth seeing but so is the movie! It's pretty welldone and I was never bored. The movie never gets too syrupy and doesn't try to force the audience to cry. There are some beautiful shots of Chicago and a good music score. Tatum can't act everybody knows that but he still is very good in most of his scenes. McAdams is excellent in her role. Also even better is that these two play off each other very well and makes you root for them even more.On the debit sideNeill and Lange are stuck with the evil parents roles and can do little with them. Even worse is Scott Speedman as an exfianc. He looks terrible and doesn't even try to act. The movie moves unsteadily. Scenes start out of nowhere and seem to end before they're finished I'm assuming there was a lot of prerelease cutting. Still I liked it and I'm not ashamed to admit that I broke down crying more than once. If you like chick flicks and romcoms this is for you. I give it a 7.".

There are some beautiful shots of Chicago and a good music score. Tatum can't act everybody knows that but he still is very good in most of his scenes. McAdams is excellent in her role. Also even better is that these two play off each other very well and makes you root for them even more.On the debit sideNeill and Lange are stuck with the evil parents roles and can do little with them. Even worse is Scott Speedman as an exfianc. He looks terrible and doesn't even try to act. The movie moves unsteadily. Scenes start out of nowhere and seem to end before they're finished I'm assuming there was a lot of prerelease cutting. Still I liked it and I'm not ashamed to admit that I broke down crying more than once. If you like chick flicks and romcoms this is for you. I give it a 7.";

But it failed to truly pull deep emotion out of me and I can get choked up pretty easily.This is appropriate for most teen and up audiences. All intimation of sex are between a married couple. There is full backside nudity of Tatum Channing but it fits appropriately in the movie.My last negative point is that it seemed slow particularly at the beginning. Maybe that's because I watched Mission Impossible last night but nonetheless it sure felt like it.I would certainly recommend seeing the movie but it probably will be just as good as a Bluray instead of paying 10 for a movie ticket.".

This movie does an excellent job at building the characters and allowing you to feel the emotion.

There were many things in that film that I could relate to which was amazing tears and laughter! I also love how this film portrayed marriage.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Vow";
	schema:reviewBody "Inspired by real events the Vow takes a cold hard look at how we are who we are because we're made up of memories that shape our lives and if taken away from us we can almost be someone else because we're robbed of what we had remembered and from there the experiences drawn that craft our actions and reactions. Not to mention the opportunity to relive and take a different path in choices presented although what we cannot have is to rewind the ticking biological clock that continues to surge forward.If five recent years of our lives were to be wiped out and we cannot remember what had transpired with scant records lying around and even so they don't do squat in jogging our memories how would we cope and how would others especially loved ones or enemies even cope? There will be frustration as normalcy is slowly eased into a life we never knew loved ones will be exasperated when we spurn their care and concern because they're strangers to us now and enemies may find it timely to exact revenge or take the easy path to reconciliation since we cannot remember what had transpired.This forms the premise for The Vow which starts off just as the trailer presented with married couple Paige Rachel McAdams and Leo Channing Tatum getting involved in a car accident and Paige suffering the brunt of the impact because she had her seat belt unbuckled traffic safety warning so subtly sneaked in. In a comatose state Paige cannot remember who Leo is after she wakes up and thus begins the road forward in trying to jolt her back to remembering what would be the best years of their lives in Chicago.A good part of the film transpires in flashbacks to set the movie firmly in the romance genre showing how the couple met their courtship their marriage and lifestyle with him still involved in a sunset industry with the setting up of a recording studio and she pursuing the dream of being an artist much to her parent's disdain in wanting her to become a lawyer. Played by Sam Neill and Jessica Lange Paige parent's see the chance to reclaim their estranged daughter back into the household which Leo fights tooth and nail against and Lep's story dwells a lot on this contention on which party should be able to provide the best care  the one with money or the one with love.Complication and challenges come from an exfianc Scott Speedman who sees it apt to try and woo back his one time love without much effort since in Paige's mind she's still engaged to him and not married to Leo and with Paige's automatic drift toward her graduate school days and her friends then leaving Leo pretty much in the lurch when he decides to tag along just to make sure she's safe.With the leads having cut their teeth in Nicholas Sparks film adaptations to date with The Notebook and Dear John both Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum I might add have what it takes to play lovebird in a romantic film outside of the Sparks series. McAdams nails it playing almost two characters one spoilt and very much dependent on others and the other fiercely independent who leads her own life the way she wants to. This causes trouble and pain for Leo which Tatum to my surprise tackles it quite well having come from being a dancer to an action star and perhaps now a bona fide romantic lead.Together they share incredible chemistry that makes you root for their coming back together again somehow especially with Leo's lofty ideals that wooing his wife all over again will be a walk in the park and a piece of cake since she had done it before and will perhaps do it again but I guess the harsh reality is that it's never that simple to expand effort and not expect something in return which in this case expectations built by one does prove to be a bummer when the returns aren't exactly what was planned for especially with the increasing amounts of cold shoulders being ignored and witnessing someone carry on their lives as if you don't exist.What I thought was interesting in the narrative is how it played out almost like a time travel movie where we're presented the current timeline that got interrupted and we go back to a past where the couple hasn't met yet and then from that point tangent off into an entirely new timeline in itself. Moments become a big deal in the film as the monologue narration makes a huge point about the impact that moments can have and in some ways it's true to life if you reflect upon what makes you and how you remember events in specific memorable snapshots.Released during the Valentine's Day week in the USA and only finding its way to our shores now The Vow will still pack an emotional punch for couples out there who will likely flock to this like bees to honey and Kleenex may be the order of the day as well. It's really very standard lovey dovey moments and time spent apart that drives everyone in the film but just how it played out in the end really served to anchor this with a heavy dose of reality without the need to pander to the general romantic inclinations of how a romantic movie must end. I like possibilities and The Vow firmly delivered on that promise.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Vow is inspired by a true and romantic story but to me it's just another cheesy Friday night movie. In the very first shot two happy young lovebirds Leo and Paige exit a movie theater not giving us any ideas. They waste no time getting to the point there a loving couple. As Leo and Paige drive home they tease they laugh they pull over for a little fooling around and get rearended by a large truck. Paige loses her memory and never recovers from the accident. From this point in the movie I actually enjoyed it it was interesting and kept you questioning what's going to happen. I think those elements from the movie were actually helpful in representing the theme of the whole movie. The past four years Paige doesn't remember anything such as her husband why she stopped pursuing her law degree and why she doesn't talk to her family anymore. To me The Vow is just an average gooey Valentine's movie that will soon be forgotten as soon as February fourteenth passes. Half way in the movie when she is trying to reminisce with her husband I continually waited during every little scene for something to happen. They just kept dragging it out which made the movie boring and long to watch. The movie was not the best but the previews did an excellent job in advertising that it would be the next Notebook or Titanic. What I did like about the movie were the cheesy romantic scenes. For example Paige was at work and she saw a box on the table with her name on it. As she is walking toward the box she saw her loving hubby Leo outside in the rain saying open it. There was Advil with a note saying for your head tissues for her nose sexy lingerie for him condom for later and a picture of him for her heart. The last fortyfive minutes are a mindnumbing vacuum as the various plot contrivances resolve in the way you will not expect and the movie finds a perfectly soothing path to its inevitable ending.".
