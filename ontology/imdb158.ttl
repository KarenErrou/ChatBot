	schema:reviewBody "A lot of comments have been made about the gimmick of Andy Lau's body suit but I think the director intentionally used it. Much of the film is metaphorical and symbolic. The movie artfully provides a story that is richer for its indirectness. Just as Daai Chek Liu fights the form of his would be self and prevents the triggering of a new karmic thread through a potential revenge justifiable killing of Sun Ko the body suit may in fact symbolize the effort that many people put into developing the unimportant ineffectual aspects of their lives. In the first part of the movie none of his highly developed skills or extrasensory perception can avert the eventual course of karma and only in the second part when he forgives Sun Ko is he successful in making any difference. His shedding of his overdeveloped physique during this journey is perhaps symbolic of his return to simply pursuing the only thing that Buddha taught per his soliloquy after he resolves the conflict with his alter ego. If you watch carefully everything you need to understand the story is right there but it's not obvious. There are many places where the director has only sown the seed for further inquiry. I could go on but suffice to say it's not a movie that can be fully appreciated without at least some analysis on the part of the audience  In the end if your interpretation even makes you think about the laws of nature the meaning and purpose of your life that's what matters and is perhaps what the director scriptwriter intended.".

The transitions are nice to take in as they travel from city to country and through past lives and the present.  They hop along nicely from place to place to keep the story going.

Directing duties were handled by Johnny To a mainstream director known for smart scripts of intervening nature compounded with heavy bloodletting long before Tarantino had left that video store and Wai Ka Fai an art house director known for making beautiful looking films which usually had underdeveloped characters think Chow YunFat's Peace Hotel.The main actor is Andy Lau. Easily the biggest actor to never try to break into Amerikkkan mainstream from Asia Lau is like a Tom Cruise type young and fashionable but now like Cruise is aging and his films usually make a llllllloooooottttt of money even if they aren't all that great. Oh and yes on the side he's a bit of a popstar. I'd never actually liked Lau but he had done a couple of decent films recently the passable Fulltime Killer another Johnny ToWai Ka Fai film and the excellent Infernal Affairs with the king on Wong KarWai films Tony Leung ChuiWai think  John Woo's Bullet in the Head and Hard Boiled plus Wong KarWai's Chungking Express In the Mood for Love and  Happy Together. The supporting actress is twentythree year old Cecilia Cheung think Shoalin Soccer Tokoyo Raiders and Tsui Hark's The Legend of Zuwho really has done anything of real note to a nonHong Kong fanatic.Ok now for the film. To label this in one genre would be the height of arrogance because despite being advertised as an action film it is far from it. In fact it's far from anything. I went with a seasoned Hong Kong film watcher and a mainstream American orientated viewer. Not one of us could tell which way this film would go. None of us could predict what was going to happen next. The plot of this film is fantastic. However one must go into this film with no preconceptions so to read anymore than I will lay out below would be foolish.The opening scene shows Lau doing a strip act in a nightclub in believe or not a huge rubber suit that's meant to make him look more buff than Vin Diesel. Ok Hong Kong doesn't have the biggest budgets this suit is here to stay and folds whenever Lau moves and funnily enough he's naked for about a quarter of the film. Nearby a C.I.D. investigation is proceeding and when the victim runs from the scene at the same time that Lau the stripper runs from an undercover cop Cheung the paths cross but the story doesn't come together as one might expect. What does happen? Get into the film and find out.Now the film starts out as a sleazy comedy moves to a crime thriller moves to a martial arts flick to a romantic comedy to a supernatural thriller to a ...it goes on and on and it would seem to a mess but except for a small flat spot about and hour and twenty in this film stays brilliant. Unlike P.T.U. Johnny To actually remembered to write a third act and let me just say that the last act has some absolutely classic scenes and yes I can see American cinema copying it in five years or less. Wirework is used how it should be done as is what has always been Asian style cinema but in the west has now been dubbed Matrixlike fights.Some classic scenes I can mention without ruining the plot about five or so tasteful but bloodily decapitations by a Japanese with a samurai sword. An almost vigilante like policecaptain hitting a bag with a very flexible man inside it with the butt of his shotgun until the bag becomes bloodstained. An amazing fight in front of a huge statue of Budda. A classic scene that I can't describe due to spoilers involving a rock a stick and a handy cam you'll known what I mean when you see it. And oh yes the one scene I can definitely see American copying involving a tissue yes that's right a tissue!Now how can you see this film? Well I saw it on a onenight only preview screening in Adelaide on Saturday the 27th of September despite it being released in Hong Kong on October 1st this coming Wednesday. I've heard that it will be showing in Melbourne this week if you can't catch it you may have to wait for dvd and vcd import. Hopefully Miracut won't touch this one.Eight out of Ten.Peace. Scott.".

Great performances from Cecilia Cheung and Andy Lau make you care about the characters and their fates despite the loopydeep? storyline that will have your brain spinning. No description of this film is a match for actually seeing it so what are you waiting for?";

As it is it's good to see Cecilia Cheung out of period costume or hanging out with Wong Jing. The film's first half with its police cases and action are its best.

The DVD version of THE LOVE OF JENNY NEY from Kino Video is truly beautiful to look at. The new orchestral score by Timothy Brock is excellent and very effective. Like many of Pabst's films a little patience is required as characters and situations only become clear as the story progresses. And this film plays like a classic Hitchcock film  with innocent people getting deeper and deeper into a web of destruction. This is a film that is even more interesting to watch the second time around. And as noted above it is truly a text book of what the silent cinema was capable of doing. Brigette Helm who made such an impression in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS gives a moving performance as a blind girl pulled into the intrigue.

	schema:headline " Wonderful film!";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all I think that this is the best Pabst film I've seen. I really love Die freudlose Gasse but there is something about Die Liebe der Jeanne Ney that is so much better. In Pabst's Die freudlose Gasse I thought that Pabst did a great job experimenting with slow motion different film stock and lighting with Geheimnisse einer Seele Pabst did a terrific job with special effectsvarious techniques perhaps maybe even overdoing it but with Die Liebe der Jeanne Ney I think he was able to really find a happy medium. He used various techniques he used in Geheimnisse einer Seele but didn't overdo it and used them to their full advantage by using them as a plot device that fit in seamlessly with the story. Whereas Die freudlose Gasse has the potential to be perfect Die Liebe der Jeanne Ney has almost reached perfection. Maybe Die freudlose Gasse appears to be a bit rough due to missing parts and scholarsfilm archivists not knowing the order of the scenes thus restored versions of the film don't guarantee that the presentation of the film is that close to the original but Die Liebe der Jeanne Ney really was a step forward. I'm not making sense and it's a bit hard for me to try to explain my thoughts but what I'm trying to get to is that this film was a huge improvement from his previous films.The film is a melodrama but it had me intrigued almost from the beginning. I hated that Pabst started the film with Fritz Rasp because Rasp is truly a hideous man. I noticed that he always plays the sleazy guy in films and his face is really perfect for that.Jhanne and Helm's acting is so natural and beautiful particularly Helm's but Rasp overacts in almost every scene. What's the point of slowing getting closer to a girl and then all of a sudden grabbing her? Jhanne plays the sweet innocent and somewhat nave Jeanne and although I would usually be annoyed with characters like Jeanne I couldn't help but like her. The story is of lovers who are madly in love with each other yet something happens that separates them. Then another incident occurs that could separate the lovers but a nice man comes along and patches things up. Misunderstandings happen murder and all other great things that probably happen in soap operas occur but the film implies a happy ending. I really adore this film but my biggest problem with it is the story. Although highly enjoyable I wonder why the film leaves Gabrielle with an unhappy ending and doesn't even return to her after her father's death. Out of all the characters in the film I think she has suffered the most and deserved a happy ending. Jeanne deserves it as well but Gabrielle was such a tragic figure that I couldn't help but almost cry when she found her father's dead body. I also didn't understand why Gabrielle first flinched from Khalibiev's Rasp touch but then somehow fell in love with him. I thought that she was able to see despite being blind behind is friendly exterior but she somehow fell for him because he brought her flowers and acted as if he really loved her when all he wanted to do was seduce Jeanne. Jeanne was never comfortable around Khalibiev and I kept looking forward to a scene when she would tell Gabrielle that she is not comfortable with Gabrielle's engagement with Khalibiev but that never happened. The final shot is truly a beautiful one but it's too simple to wrap up everything how will Jeanne and Andreas Henning be together when there are political problems surrounding their relationship? One of Die freudlose Gasse's criticisms is that the melodrama overpowers the message behind the film and that applies to the film perfectly. I don't agree much with the criticism for Die freudlose Gasse but the happy ending truly seems tacked on like it just needs to happen. But things really aren't that simple! But nonetheless that final shot means multiple things which is why I love it. The obvious one is that the murderer has been caught but the diamond also can be foreshadowing Jeanne and Andreas' marriage and perhaps maybe it is a happy ending for Gabrielle since the diamond was found by her father's company most likely she would be able to have the reward money.After watching this film I really didn't understand why Die freudlose Gasse got all the attention out of the many films Pabst directed. Is it because Die freudlose Gasse addresses the political social and moral problems in GermanyAustria directly whereas Die Liebe der Jeanne Ney brings forth what was going on around the time the film was made but is overshadowed by the melodramatic story? I just think that this film is one of Pabst's strongest silent uvre because everything fits so well but that's just my opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Georg Wilhelm Pabst or GW Pabst born in 1885 was one of the great German filmmakers during the silent period. He established his name with his first film the drama of greed The Treasure 1923 but with the third one The Joyless Street 1925 he revealed himself as a major force of the New Objectivity beyond the distortions of expressionism touching the social problems of Germany between the two great wars. He continued with Mysteries of a Soul 1926 and The Love of Jeanne Ney 1927 whose recent vision motivates these notes then gave a masterstroke with Pandora's Box 1929 which led Louise Brooks to immortality and when sound came in 1930 he released the antiwar drama Frontline 1918  which was banned by the Nazis made the film version of The 3Penny Opera 1931 by Brecht and Weil followed by a drama of FrancoGerman solidarity Camaraderie 1931 an incursion into fantastic cinema with L'Atlantide 1932 and his own reading of Cervantes' Don Quixote 1933. Although he did not stop working and made more films of value Pabst saw his career affected by the rise of the Nazis when he had to move between Berlin Paris Hollywood and Vienna where he died in 1967. The romantic account of The Love of Jeanne Ney goes from Ukraine to France following the daughter of a French diplomat who is in love with a Bolshevik. The couple reunites in Paris after several vicissitudes. The characters include Jeanne's uncle owner of a research firm his blind daughter Brigitte Helm the Maria of Metropolis a North American millionaire who has lost a invaluable diamond and a Russian informer who sells to the highest bidder. There are moments of great visual force as the scene in which the blind girl discovers the corpse of her father and the initial scenes of the Russian revolution. However the reason that motivates me to write about the film is above all extraordinary actor Fritz Rasp 18911976 as the ruthless snitch fearsome as none. Rasp is an icon of the Teutonic villain from the first time I saw him as the overwhelming Thin Man in Lang's Metropolis serving the owner of the city every time I see him in another film his characters are not to be trusted and his presence is intimidating as the colonel in Spies and as The Man in The Woman in the Moon both by Lang or as the Jew J.J. Peachum King of the Beggars in Pabst's The 3Penny Opera. In The Love of Jeanne Ney Rasp builds the disgusting character of Khalibiev an informant who fingers the Bolsheviks in Ukraine and in Paris not only does he stalk Jeanne and her lover but uses Jeanne's young blind cousin to concrete his evil plans. As Pabst Rasp also continued working during the Nazi period although not acting with the frequency of the past. He had a long career that included playing the lead in a film of the new cinema of West Germany Lina Braake 1975 which was his last appearance in cinema.".

He continued with Mysteries of a Soul 1926 and The Love of Jeanne Ney 1927 whose recent vision motivates these notes then gave a masterstroke with Pandora's Box 1929 which led Louise Brooks to immortality and when sound came in 1930 he released the antiwar drama Frontline 1918  which was banned by the Nazis made the film version of The 3Penny Opera 1931 by Brecht and Weil followed by a drama of FrancoGerman solidarity Camaraderie 1931 an incursion into fantastic cinema with L'Atlantide 1932 and his own reading of Cervantes' Don Quixote 1933. Although he did not stop working and made more films of value Pabst saw his career affected by the rise of the Nazis when he had to move between Berlin Paris Hollywood and Vienna where he died in 1967. The romantic account of The Love of Jeanne Ney goes from Ukraine to France following the daughter of a French diplomat who is in love with a Bolshevik. The couple reunites in Paris after several vicissitudes. The characters include Jeanne's uncle owner of a research firm his blind daughter Brigitte Helm the Maria of Metropolis a North American millionaire who has lost a invaluable diamond and a Russian informer who sells to the highest bidder. There are moments of great visual force as the scene in which the blind girl discovers the corpse of her father and the initial scenes of the Russian revolution. However the reason that motivates me to write about the film is above all extraordinary actor Fritz Rasp 18911976 as the ruthless snitch fearsome as none. Rasp is an icon of the Teutonic villain from the first time I saw him as the overwhelming Thin Man in Lang's Metropolis serving the owner of the city every time I see him in another film his characters are not to be trusted and his presence is intimidating as the colonel in Spies and as The Man in The Woman in the Moon both by Lang or as the Jew J.J. Peachum King of the Beggars in Pabst's The 3Penny Opera. In The Love of Jeanne Ney Rasp builds the disgusting character of Khalibiev an informant who fingers the Bolsheviks in Ukraine and in Paris not only does he stalk Jeanne and her lover but uses Jeanne's young blind cousin to concrete his evil plans. As Pabst Rasp also continued working during the Nazi period although not acting with the frequency of the past. He had a long career that included playing the lead in a film of the new cinema of West Germany Lina Braake 1975 which was his last appearance in cinema.";

	schema:reviewBody "I know that G. W. Pabst is a worldfamous director so I know that many will disagree with me on this one but I truly disliked Die Lebe der Jeanne Ney. I also know that it has a much more than respectable overall score of 7.9...but I just thought the film was very overrated and there are much better German films of this era. Most of my reasons for disliking the film are because the script is just goofy and makes little sense but I also thought that the performance of the supposedly blind woman was very poor and I would have expected more of Pabst.The film begins during the Russian Revolution. Jeanne and her father are there on some sort of diplomatictype mission and her father laments that the years spent in the country have been a waste of time. At this point you see Jeanne thinking about her experiencesfalling in love with a Communist and her championing of the Bolshevik revolution. This is the sort of plot by the way that NEVER would have been allowed just a few years later during the Nazi yearsno way would such a film ever see the light of day because it is proCommunist.An evil schemer Khalibiev has created a list of supposed Communinists and sold it to Mr. Ney. Jeanne's lover comes to Ney to demand the list and in the process he kills his lover's father. Jeanne comes in to see this happen and soon flees to Paris to stay with an uncle. However and this makes no sense at all she STILL is in love with her Bolshevik boyfriendeven though she knows he murdered her fatherwho she supposedly loved!! Who writes this sort of stuff?! Once in Paris Jeanne is lusted after by her nasty Unclewho happens to be a private detective. At the same time her blind cousin is courted by Khalibievwho ALSO lusts after Jeanne!! Eventually the Uncle is killed by Khalibiev it's a long story and Jeanne's Communist lover who just happens to be in Paris as wellit's odd how NONE of the Russians in the film seem to stay in Russia!! is implicated. So it's up to the plucky Jeanne to save the day.Very little of this movie seems plausible. Mostly it's because of Jeanne's unwillingness to bear some sort of grudge for the murder of her father but there is still more that makes no sense. Khalibiev is a scoundrel but is so unsubtle and obvious you wonder why it took anyone more than a fraction of a second to suspect him! And as for the blind girl she needed acting lessons and Pabst did nothing to stop this overacting. Get this....in her own home where she has lived for years the lady gropes around like she's never been there before AND she never looks towards people when they talk. Had Pabst or this bad actress spent more than a minute or two with a blind person then they would have realized this was all wrong. Yes I expect that by 1927 the films had become sophisticated enough that they should have gotten this right.Overall the film is a silly trifle and not much more. For a better German silent film try something by Fritz Lang or F.W. Murnau...or a good film by G. W. Pabst such as Die Freudlose Gasse or Tagebuch Einer Verlorenen. Or see and here Pabst's brilliant sound film Westfront 1918 for that matter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Liebe der Jeanne Ney or The Love of Jeanne Nay is a German film from 1927 and this is a year when sound films slowly became more relevant. But this one we have here is still silent and consequently also in blackandwhite. It runs for 100 minutes roughly and was directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst. Rudolf Leonhardt and the more known Ladislaus Vajda adapted a novel by Ilja Ehrenburg for the screen here. The lead actress is dith Jhanne and it is by far her most known portrayal. Her character was surprisingly shortlived compared to her costar's Brigitte Helm for example and she also did not manage to make a transition into sound films. Overall this is nowhere near Pabst's most or least known works but the French background also shows that the filmmaker worked on movies that went way beyond Germany's borders. However I also must say that this film here did not get me interested in any other of his works and most of the stuff I saw from him left me fairly unimpressed. Of course the reason may be that I generally do not care about silent films too much but still looking at some of the films' IMDb rating also this one I expected better quality. I do not recommend Jeanny Ney as I did hardly care for the character at all. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well what can one say about this film? You could just agree to all the bad critics that have been written about it  that Better than chocolate is nothing more but a clich and an unrealistic fairy tale. Fairy tale's the word What is cinema supposed to be if not a fairy tale? It's unrealistic it helps us forgetting our daily troubles and allows us to dream and to bathe in romantic feelings. And these are exactly the reasons I recommend Better than chocolate and think that it's a splendid movie a hilarious comedy and a love story so sweet you just get enchanted by it.It's a classic The sweet princess Meggie just quit university and preferred becoming part of Vancouver's gay scene performing in a gay bar and she's so great in it! and working in a lesbian book store. Things seem to go pretty fine until the day when Maggie's Mum Lila calls and informs our princess that she just left her current husband and wants to move in with Maggie bringing Maggie's teen brother Paul with her. The problem is Mum doesn't know or doesn't want to know that her little daughter is gay. Things get even more problematic when one night after her performing at the club Maggie meets her knight who does not wear an armour or ride a white horse but who is an attractive tough and cool girl named Kim rides a funky van and lives on the road earning her money with drawing portraits. When all the characters mentioned above finally find themselves living under the same roof some days later things become chaotic and almost grotesque cause it's so obvious that Kim and Meggie are a couple but Lila is simply blind for it.Mind you the movie also deals with other interesting characters. We get to know Frances the neurotic owner of the book shop Maggie works in. There is also Judy who once was Jeremy but now is a woman and hopelessly in love with Frances. And don't forget Carla whose favourite pass of time is sex who seduces almost every person crossing her way is an expert in the newest toys and digs on Maggie as well as her brother Paul.Of course it's one or two clichs I mentioned it before. But if you see how lightly and heartwarmingly the story is told if you hear the hilarious jokes and oneliners follow the soft filming of the camera you just can't help forgetting about those clichs and falling in love with this movie. For in the middle of this colourful chaos the love story between Kim and Maggie is the calm and comforting pole it's told in silent pictures and gentle sounds which become a bit louder when it comes to  well the making love part. And this beautiful love story has highlights of its own and I don't want to reveal even one of them. I can only say that much A lot of colour and  goddesses  everyone who's seen the movie of course knows what I'm talking about There is also something else I love about this film Although it's a fairy tale and most parts of it are simply utopic Better than chocolate can be inspiring and show possibilities The possibility of an alternative life style and that you can be comfortable with it no matter what others might think the possibility to break out of certain expectations society burdens us with and the possibility to love differently. For example when Maggie quits her finance studies to live her dream of being an author. So besides allowing us to dream this film also gives incredible hope and this might be its greatest strength.A word on the cast which is simply  brilliant. And before concentrating on one of the protagonists who in my opinion stood out I'd like to compliment the others. There is this young actor playing Paul who up to Better than chocolate has had no acting experience but is very good at what he's doing. There is the sexridden but likable Carla. The neurotic Frances  Canada's currently probably most famous lesbian actress and author AnnMarie MacDonald and according to director Anne Wheeler the only openly gay actress participating in this movie. The icing on the cake in this film are two profound Canadian actors  Wendy Crewson as Lila and Peter Outerbridge as Judy. Wendy who is probably most familiar as Harrison Ford's wife in Air Force One is just outstanding as the confused sweet and clueless Mum with a weakness for chocolate. Peter Outerbridge is just incredible as Judy and you really have a hard time to believe that this is his first transsexual performance  he's so great in this role and just a beautiful woman. And now let me point out the person who impressed me most with her performance Christina Cox as Kim. She's hot she's sexy she's tough and cool but at the same time so soft and feminine. I think only few actresses can add so many different facets to their role. I mean she could have easily played a simple butch but she adds such charisma and dignity to her character  it's just amazing. There enough said she's just great. The movie's soundtrack is a highlight of its own  Sarah McLachlan with Ice Cream for example  and perfectly mirrors the film's young spirit it's modern it's sexy it's dreamy and it rocks. And with this I'd like to give Better than chocolate three thumbs up  a summer movie with heart soul humour and a lot of love.".

The pretext is that Dwyer has dropped out of the university but Crewson wants to check out more than that.Acting honors in this film go to Peter Outerbridge who plays the transgender woman Judy formerly Jeremy. Outerbridge in his own way is playing a role as much a pioneering effort as Hillary Swank in Boys Don't Cry. Had this been a major American film we might have been talking Oscar for him.Outerbridge is a wise old soul who's seen life from a few different perspectives. She's been cast out by her family kind of like Michael Dunn is Ship of Fools. Just as Dunn's parents didn't want a dwarf around and gave him spending money to constantly travel Outerbridge's parents by him a flat precisely so he can live away from them. It's quite a scene when Judy discovers that the flat is really a kiss off. Crewson and Outerbridge aid each other in their moment of crisis.If nothing else should have tipped her off that Dwyer was not living the 'normal' life those battery operated sex toys should have said something. Of course Crewson finds they have their uses and she who has said that sex is now being sworn off for chocolate finds that even battery operated love is better than no love at all. Better Than Chocolate is funny and sweet and endearing all at the same time. A triple threat on the emotions from Anne Wheeler in Canada.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before Wheeler and Thompson set out to make Better than Chocolate they interviewed several lesbians about what they wanted to see in a film. Disregarding the fact that the number one response was sex toys ?! this method here points up the major problem with the filmin trying to be the ultimate lesbian film it doesn't succeed as a narrative film at all.First of all is the problem of the romance between the two main characters. In a typical romantic comedy which this tries to be regardless of the atypical gender roles you have a series of problems keeping the couple apart. Here this is not the caselike many other lesbian movies Better than Chocolate suffers from the misconception that when two lesbians meet they immediately fall in love. Add to this the fact that neither character has any distinguishable personality traits and you wind up with a serious lack of plot. No tension here and no reason to particularly care.The next problem is the rest of the story sorry guys. For whatever reason in promoting a positive image of lesbians Better than Chocolate feels the need to stereotype each one of its other characters. So you've got the repressed bookstore owner repressed transsexual the repressed housewife and the omnisexual bisexual. The one story line that did seem to go somewhere was the friendship between Lila the mom and the transsexual character. But unfortunately it took second place to the love story so no luck there.The final flaw here is in the censorship subplot which really has no place in the storyit just feels like the writer had a desire to make a muddled political statement.  Like the rest of the story lines it appears out of no where and we never get the feeling that anything is at risk. As a result the final dramatic blow up at the end feels tacked onan attempt to give the film a dramatic quality it was lacking all along.Over all Better than Chocolate has been received pretty well. That its rating on this website is much higher than I believe it deserves seems once again a perfect example of the lesbian population's need for a good representative film. Trust me I'd like to see one just as much as anyone but Better than Chocolate hits way below the mark. It's a shame more lesbian films aren't made because if this movie can do so well it's a clear example that there's a hungry market out there.".

How many of us have not been hated by someone who sees the world differently? How many of us have not instantly fallen in love? It is almost irrelevant that the production is set in the gay section of Vancouver or that the main characters focus on same sex love. It is emotions common to everyone that give the production its extreme appeal. I was cheering the girls and would have been very hurt if they had not gotten back together again.I might add that this is the only DVD I have seen in which I enjoyed the director's comments as much as the production itself.Both of the young actresses displayed an amazing variety of facial expressions. The shot focusing on Cox's deep blue eyes while Karyn is unable to confront her mother with the truth is priceless as is Cox's gesture half hiding her face and half saying so what as she flees the applauding crowd after the bathroom scene.The film's only weakness in my opinion is that everybody found someone in the end at least at the very same instant.

I unfortunately get easily irritated by movies weighed down with a political agenda but fortunately this one had enough funny charm and emotional content to keep me interested.  The framework of the film is your typical girl meets girl girl almost loses girl because she can't come out to her parents scenario.  The very involved subplots however create the film's promise.Lila Wendy Crewson is the betrayed housewife going through a divorce and mothercumroommate and she's not the only character we get to see cum in the film of the movie's central character Maggie Karyn Dwyer. Aside from the artfully sensual yummy! lovemaking scenes between the main character and her new girlfriend Kim Christina Cox the friendship formed between Lila and her daughter's transgender friend Judy Peter Outerbridge makes for some of the movie's most delightful moments.One character who isn't given nearly enough screen time is Carla Marya Delver a gorgeous omnisexual as described by Maggie feminine biker babe who works at the bookstore that serves as the dramatic hub of the film. She is flirtatious and outrageously forthright with her sexual appetites. Carla seduces Maggie's seventeen year old brother Paul Kevin Mundy into exploring new possibilities after all boys like toys too..   I couldn't help thinking however that the writer was at times poking gentle fun at her though with no real disrespect intended.As an interesting side note the film steps outside  the realm of gender and sexual politics to touch on other sensitive issues.   One of those being the role of the artist.   Almost all the film's characters are artists in one way or another.   From Maggie's window installations to Lila's forsaken Opera career to Judy's fantastic nightclub acts to Kim's paintings the arts are heavily addressed.  In the dialogue between Lila and other characters we see that as filmmakers the writer and director have a real grasp on the difficulties of being creators.  What is fascinating is that coming out as an artist in the film is nearly equated with coming out as a lesbian. Aside from the annoying inyourface rhetorical quality typical of many gay and lesbian films Better Than Chocolate is warmly amusing and appealing to those of any gender or sexual orientation.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is somewhat annoying because it goes out of its way to be political correct but if one looks past that it is pretty good if taken on its own terms. The movie has a kitchen sink philosophy of sorts by trying to toss in loads of material ... not only do we have a baby lesbian falling for a offbeat but deep down sensitive artist we have a transsexual a mom experiencing her sexuality commentary on conservative Canadian obscenity laws that were meant to help women but turned out harming lesbians an omnisexual opportunity for an offbeat romance for the bookstore owner promotion of sex toys etc.  You are almost overwhelmed and all done in a PC way without many surprises.All the same the movie is enjoyable because of the very things some find problematic  joyfully promoting all things in a cheerful way. It is basically a fun movie ... you enjoy seeing the mom come of her shell the title refers to her chocolate habit the joys of young lesbian love and so on. A special nod should got to the well done performance of the transsexual it is only fitting to note that I think drag queen is a misnomer because she wants to live a woman not just dress up as one ... it is more than a matter of clothing and affect.The whole thing has a bit of too good to be true about it but I applaud the sentiment. As with Bar Girls this movie at times has better intentions than great movie material but as with that movie more so actually the cast is game and we applaud them for a pretty enjoyable effort all the same.Not quite better than chocolate especially double fudge but at times equally good  and less fattening.j".

	schema:reviewBody "Last night I went to a screening of this film and didn't know what to expect. I have to say this is the best Adam Sandler comedy since Happy Gilmore. It seems that with this new comedy duo that Sandler got his magic back. This story is about two firefighters in Brooklyn who have been best friends for what seems like forever. Larry Valentine James is a single dad trying to raise two kids on his own and Chuck Levine Sandler is a notorious playboy who has a new girls every night. When Larry tries to change his beneficiary from his late wife to his children he finds out that the process would take a long time. Because he's a firefighter and worries that he could go at anytime he wants to make sure his kids will be OK. After a traumatic incident he feels even more pressure. When he finds a loophole in the system he asks Chuck to be his domestic partner. Throughout the movie their relationship is under fire and it's up to their attorney Alex Jessica Beal who believes they're gay to save them from criminal charges. They try to keep their relationship a secret but it eventually gets out that they're a couple. Everyone they know starts treating them differently and they are witness to the discrimination homosexuals face on a regular basis. Little do they know when they defend themselves they defend gay people in general. Dan Aykroyd plays their Captain at the fire house and is also their voice of reason. Steve Buscemi plays an inspector who is sent to their house to catch them at their game. There are numerous cameos by some of everyone's favorites and they show up at some of the most random times making their appearance in the movie that much funnier. When I left the theater I felt like a did 100 crunches because I was laughing so hard. It didn't drag and it didn't get overly sappy at any point. Some of the jokes are stereotypical but it's the first time most of them have been on the big screen so it was fresh humor. I sat next to my gay friend through the screening and I've never seen a man laugh so hard in my entire life. So for all you people who think this movie will be a bash at homosexuals I say watch the movie and then make your opinions. I enjoyed this movie so much that when it comes out in July I will PAY to go see it with my friends.".

Parts of the film do remind one of 'Three To Tango' but it has its own jokes and is quite an enjoyable comedic flick. It rests on a thin plot that is lifted by the chemistry between the actors. James and Sandler are supported by a hilarious cast which includes Ving Rhames like you've never seen before Steve Buscemi Dan Akroyd and Rob Scheider that provides some excellent comic relief. Jessica Biel has never looked better what a body!. Child actor Cole Morgen is remarkably talented. And of course Kevin James and Adam Sandler are great. While the film is full of fun and laughoutloud moments fortunately it's not offensive in any way considering the theme. It's quite progay. Overall this is a fun film. If one is in search of something light and some laughter 'I Now Pronounce You Chuck  Larry' is a recommendation.".

Some of the scenes were set up really well and the comedy acting was superb.OK the plot is unbelievable and a little silly but it's a comedy! Give it a go. If you love meet the parents dumb and dumber there is something about Mary and Kingpin you will enjoy the show.

They are very close and would do anything for one another so when a problem with Larry's pension arrangements comes up that can be solved by entering into a civil partnership Chuck agrees to pose as his husband in order to solve the admin problem. Sadly a high profile fraud case in another state means that the couple are under scrutiny from obsessive investigator Clint Fritzer and must play their roles to the full. Hilarity naturally ensues but can everyone also learn a lesson as well?It dismays me to hear people praising this film for its sensitive handling of the subject of homosexuality and the way it challenges bigoted thinking on the subject  such thoughts can be found in the comments section on this site and they dismay me because sadly to some viewers this film may be the nearest thing to discussion on homosexuality that they have had. In this way maybe one could make a case for this film being an effective but blunt tool for the mostly teenage male fanbase of Adam Sandler to be reached and educated by giving them what they want in terms of crude humour and broad stereotypes but then also leaving them with a message that will teach them the error of their ways. It would certainly be nice to say that but one cannot help feel that this is not the reality and that rather than using the crude stereotypes as a vehicle to deliver a message to a traditionally homophobic fanbase the film is actually using the message to facilitate lots of homosexual stereotypes jokes and clichs.This is what the film does throughout  it wants to have its cake and then also get to eat it. So spoiler alert it turns out that homosexuals are people too. Apparently according to the film it is NOT OK to treat them differently and exclude them from things and anyone who does well y'know what ell turns out those that are do are the real jerks. That is about as sophisticated as the message gets but that is perhaps to be expected and for the target audience maybe that is challenging enough. Unfortunately for the wider audience or casual viewer it will come off as little more than patronising and not make up for the fact that the majority of the film flies in the face of this. What the rest of the film does is draw laughs from the fact that two straight characters have to be gay  which of course means all the stereotypical stuff that we all know. So nobody wants to pick up the soap in the shower because all a gay man needs to be aroused is the sight of someone's ass disco music is played fingersnapping is everywhere and so on. Fortunately it is sporadically amusing and provided me with a few chuckles whether I wanted to give them up or not. It is not THAT funny though and the casual viewer will mostly just let the brash obvious humour wash over them without it doing much.The cast buy into it well though and do their best to sell it. Sandler is his usual rather annoying self and does his best to prove he cannot act by being the usual irresistible to women thing rather than the creepy manchild that he would be were his character real. James comes off a lot better I'm not really seen him before although he probably does fit TV better than films but he does have a good comic presence and also does OK with coming over more of a regular guy. Loved Ving Rhames in it  sending up his tough guy image while Buscemi Aykroyd and a few others are amusing in support. Biel has an amazing body and that is pretty much what she is asked to do  be in underwear and look stunning both of which she effortlessly does but nothing else comes forward.This film is not the awful piece of comedy that some critics have said but it is a simple stereotypical comedy about homosexual clichs that tries to justify it by having a very basic message that most people should have already learnt in the 1990's. While some may praise the film for having this message I find it more concerning that people still see this message as somehow worthy rather than d'uh  of course. Some laughs help it through and Sandler's fans will enjoy it despite the message but for the casual viewer it is just another clumsy and crude Adam Sandler film.".

Many have labeled it hypocritical for wanting to laugh at gays while standing up for them. Honestly I think the critics who say that had their minds made up about the film before they viewed it. The characters making homophobic remarks and jokes are seen as ignorant and unaware. True there are stereotypes present though most of them are stereotypes that the characters believe to be true.

There's about ten more minutes of fat that could have been sucked out of the running time. Luckily it's nowhere as dreadfully long as the Knocked Up was. However I do wish that the film shared Knocked Up's Rrating trims were made to make this a PG13. There are times when the editing is extremely obvious and distracting which took me out of the scene at times. Here's hoping for the original cut to be released on DVD. Somehow I doubt that it will.

In spite of the specious setup the opportunities for a charming farce were all there but Sandler and director Dennis as an actor I was who they got when they couldn't get Bruce Dern so I now direct bad comedies instead Dugan mucked it up with a bunch of lame jokes and condescending stereotypes of gays.The woman Jessica Biel who advises Chuck and Larry to beware of a fraud investigation is a heterosexual woman with a flaming queen for a brother.

In another scene the mailman hits on one of them. What's worse is Kevin James' character's effeminate son. Apparently because he wants to try out for the school musical and can dance he must be gay.This is not an issue of political correctness which I abhor. In fact I don't mind gay jokes that are funny. But there's a line between jokes about homosexuality and making fun of gays which this movie crosses like it was the finish line of the 100 yard dash. This film's message is apparently that gays are sick freaks but let them get married anyway. That is a profoundly antigay message. SInce GLAAD approved this film just as they also approved the patronizing BS of Will and Grace and Queer as Folk they ought to change their name to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Intellectual Honesty. Adding insult to that injury the film's funny moments are too few and far between.What's perplexing is how Barry Fanaro a former writer for The Golden Girls a classic 1980s sitcom which had a few episodes about nonstereotyped gays got into this mess. I guess Lifetime Network's been stiffing him on residuals and he's sick of Ramen Noodles. There is also an embarrassingly bad performance by Rob Schneider as an Asian justice of the peace. In fact I'm more offended by this than Mickey Rooney's character in Breakfast at Tiffany's at least that film could use the excuse that it was 1961 but there's no excuse here. That the untalented Schneider is halfFilipino does not make it better. And how did Dan Aykroyd or the obnoxious David Spade get involved in this bigoted debacle? With all the SNL alumni in this vomitinducing garbage I guess I'll be watching MAD TV from now on.".

Soon Larry realizes he has difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries in his life insurance due to the death of his wife. So in order to get his benefit he needs to get married. Larry asks Chuck to enter a pretend marriage with him after Larry read a article about domestic partnerships. Chuck declines at first but is reminded of his debt to Larry so he agrees. The main highlight of this film is when Alex McDonoughJessica Biel is thrown into the mix who play Chuck and Larry's lawyer. I however disliked Adam Sandler in this movie he just tries way too hard to prove he isn't gay in this film to point it gets a bit annoying and he is like banging every girl that crosses his path in this one yeah firemen get girls but c'mon. At times it had it's moments and had some funny jokes but it really drags and don't know how to quit. I think it would have been awesome if Chuck and Larry eventually found out they are gay for each other cause Chuck is a sleazy gay character but I doubt Adam Sandler would do it since he has such a high image of himself which I realized after I finished watching this movie. Basically the film is about Adam Sandler trying really hard to look manly while there is a bunch of stereotypical gay jokes thrown in. Jessica Biel was really hot and attractive in this and is the main highlight of this film and finds herself in many situations in her underwear.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is basically an average comedy. You can poke a lot of holes in the plot and there is a lot of stupidity. Yet there are some parts that make you laugh out loud. This is an entertaining film but your own sense of humor should dictate whether you want to see it or not.Sandler and James play New York firefighters. The basic premise is that Kevin James' character finds a loophole in the system so that if he marries Sandler his children will easily get his employee benefits. Without a wife his children would be held in limbo by the state for a while before they get any benefits. This of course is a stretch but since it is a comedy you just kind of go with it.So after James saves Sandler's life Sandler agrees to go through with this. This is where the gay jokes ensue. Add in Ving Rhames who is a gay firefighter who comes out of the closet due to James and Sandler and also add in Jessica Biel as some eye candy who Sandler badly wants to date and you have all the ingredients of this comedy. Rob Schneider is funny playing an Asian minister. This movie is progay I would say so it shouldn't offend homosexuals and Schneider is part Asian so I guess he is supposed to be off the hook for making fun of that ethnic group. Anyway all the jokes are supposed to be in good fun but some people might get offended. If you are the type of person who gets offended easily then you probably should avoid this movie.Some nice cameos in the film and the soundtrack is largely comprised of known gay artists.I saw this in the theater with my girlfriend. You would probably be smart to avoid the pricey theater tickets and wait until this comes out on DVD. This is not going to be a classic comedy and is not close to one of Sandler's best. At the same time I don't think that it is an awful film either. Rating 6 0f 10 stars.".

This of course is a stretch but since it is a comedy you just kind of go with it.So after James saves Sandler's life Sandler agrees to go through with this. This is where the gay jokes ensue. Add in Ving Rhames who is a gay firefighter who comes out of the closet due to James and Sandler and also add in Jessica Biel as some eye candy who Sandler badly wants to date and you have all the ingredients of this comedy. Rob Schneider is funny playing an Asian minister. This movie is progay I would say so it shouldn't offend homosexuals and Schneider is part Asian so I guess he is supposed to be off the hook for making fun of that ethnic group. Anyway all the jokes are supposed to be in good fun but some people might get offended. If you are the type of person who gets offended easily then you probably should avoid this movie.Some nice cameos in the film and the soundtrack is largely comprised of known gay artists.I saw this in the theater with my girlfriend. You would probably be smart to avoid the pricey theater tickets and wait until this comes out on DVD. This is not going to be a classic comedy and is not close to one of Sandler's best. At the same time I don't think that it is an awful film either. Rating 6 0f 10 stars.";

That made no sense at all and was not believable. And why would he even want Sandler's character to raise his children given his wild bachelor lifestyle? But I reminded myself that it was a comedy and I let the movie's ridiculous premise go. Still there wasn't much to laugh at in the movie. I'm heterosexual but felt it made fun of gay people and played up stereotypes. Why was just about everyone at an AIDS fund raiser flamboyantly gay? Why did the wedding chapel guy have to have stereotyped Asian speech and appearance reminiscent of racist films from the 1930s? I know Rob Schneider is part Filipino but it was still bad. And why did the women have to be such bimbos? I know it was a comedy but it was so offensive that I found very little humor in it.".

	schema:headline " Insulting to everyone who's not a white male but to to the gay community most of all.";
	schema:reviewBody "I went into the movie with very low expectations having read about how awful it was with regards to gay stereotypes. But what I didn't expect was for everyone who isn't a white straight male to be stereotyped. There were only two men who weren't white in the entire movie one was an Asian caricature to a degree that I thought was extinct since the fifties and the other one is the only black guy on the force  so of course he also doubles as the huge scary crazy guy. He's notable becomes a double offense when he form the moment that he comes out of the closet turns into a mincing sissy. This is supposed to be comedic because can you imagine a big black guy who isn't scary? Or a black guy who I gay? What a hoot! The movie also suffers from rampant misogyny depicting every single woman as a first class idiot who's naturally all over Chuck. Mind you that this trait has nothing to do with Chuck being handsome charming or anything else. In fact his way of seduction is to mock and insult his target then expecting them to obey his every command which they incredibly do. He's not just this way to women either in fact he constantly makes homophobic comments and treats his so called best friend like dirt including turning his plea for help down without as much as a thought and having sex with his maid in his bed while Larry's still in it and mere minutes after Larry clearly described how hard it was for him to let anyone sleep on his wife's side. Then there's the treatment of the issue at hand of course. Apart from the raging stereotypes it's as if the writers have no idea how homophobia works. The supposedly progressive lawyer asks the couple who is the chick  a question that is one of the parade signs of ignorance on homosexuality. Then she asks him out on a girl day basically trying to turn him into the gay pet clich. The main characters themselves also continue to look slightly panicked in the presence of gay men even as they go through a supposed character development.As bad as this or even worse is that this movie about homosexuality is completely devoid of homosexuality. Really there is no same sex love or attraction going on here at all except in the last five minutes or so. And then it's only a quick wedding between the two most prominent gay characters as in the only gay characters with more than one line who never even been shown on screen together before that. Even a fake kiss between the leads is avoided at all costs and treated like something absolutely horrific! Not to mention the often cited assurances of their heterosexuality in the form of an avalanche of female conquests and a dearly beloved wife respectively. Adding insult to injury all the homophobia that we get to experience is directed against two straight men that are rather homophobic themselves  it's all just an act so if they do feel hurt it's not on a personal level. With the contradictions I've mentioned earlier it seems like the purpose for this movie isn't to deal with homophobia but to make straight men the heroes of gay people  la every mighty whitey story in history. Think about it they never actually did anything to gain their heroic status. They were exposed as a fraud and then loads of people wanted them freed because I don't know. I really don't. They have done nothing for their community aside from punching an anti gay activist in the face. If this is really enough to gain iconic status in spite of everything else I can't see it as anything short of degrading the community to make Chuck Larry is nothing but a sidekick really look like a hero with minimal effort. This is a minority that has claimed enormous improvements in their treatment these past fifteen years who turn major cities into sanctuaries for diversity for a week of the year and that at least in the US has rioted multiple times when the authorities went a step too far against them. But in this movie they don't dare lift a finger unless a straight man or woman takes the first step. And just like that there goes the last drop of credibility that this train wreck of a movie might have had. This is where some might wave my concerns off as sensitive and say that this isn't relevant to comedy. But fact is that timing acting or even Larry's rather sweet character can't save this movie after all the misogyny homophobia racism and what not that it's built upon. If you're not a white and mildly homophobic male chances are that the continuous insults will ruin the fun.".

The first half of the film is given to proving that Larry is somewhat of a ladies man and like totally not a gay coercing two sisters he is cheating on at the same time to kiss bedding strippers 4 at a time ...ok we get the point Sandler and other such activities that are only permissible through a somewhat strenuous suspension of disbelief. Chuck on the other hand is a family man who has recently lost his wife has a daughter and rather camp son who he doesn't understand but has a talent for doing the splits that does raise a wry smile.The turning point in the film is when Chuck and Larry 'rescue' a morbidly obese man from a fire wisecracking all the way escorting him out through the burning building without any form of breathing apparatus they trip and predictably he lands on Sandler. And then farts. nope...didn't see that one coming either. Later on Chuck saves Larry's life and then owes him one so he makes him marry him. Fine...whatever...I'm not giving myself a hernia with this one. The presentation of women in the film is truly the grimmest spectacle since White Chicks. They are brainless topheavy morons whose only purpose in this film is to swoon over the irresistible charms of Sandlers character. One is a Doctor one is a Lawyer...both are apparently pole dancers and gullible ones at that.The only redeeming feature of the film is that in order to achieve a saccharine preachy ending the characters of Chuck and Larry soften in their attitude to gays even though from 'What you mean like fggots?' the only way can surely be up and the jury is out whether you can spend 99 of the time saying 'fggots are wrong and weird' and the end 1 saying 'sure they're wrong and weird but the correct vernacular is 'gay'. I gave one star for the use of the word vernacular in such a lowbrow filmWhat is such a let down in the film save every labored setup and grim inevitable gag is such a rich mine was not tapped not even skimmed. All cultures are funny especially gays they're ripe even ridiculous in parts. Where were the references to Brokeback Mountain a film needing a good spoofing if e'er there was one the Birdcagesquire situations? Even 'In and Out'...at least steal some decent gay jokes.It is a sad reflection of the LBGT community that they are so trod upon that the best they can hope for isin its own disarming way it's a call for equality and respect.GLAAD ...REALLY? Hey I'm glad these people don't represent me...so in its own way Benny Hill was a plea for understanding in a world of a masculine oppression? right? You can make a big deal of the 'yellowingup' Chinese character played by Schneider with 'me so solly' etc but it's not worth your time society has moved on and this is barely postironic just pathetic.More disturbing is the underlying homophobia throughout the film. There is no heart no empathy all the jokes are cruel and lame and will do nobody any favors. Except Sandler who will win an MTV award for comedic performance get 25000000 at the least and sit smugly in his mansion knowing that every race sexuality and religion save his own has been rightly put in its place.So is this just harmless entertainment? or a disgusting endorsement of every cruel playground stereotype...you decide. Personally I don't like to be preached to about acceptance by a movie so utterly homophobic that it's almost certinaly just over compensating for something...not that there's anything wrong with that.".

There is a gay joke at the expense of the Hudson character and knowing what we know now we might well ask how much of an 'injoke' this really was and just who was in on the joke. The film was a huge success and revitalized Day's career in nonmusical roles.

It has everything a romantic comedy needs...a wonderful script snappy dialog and of course the wonderful performances by every single actor in the movie. Doris Day is dead on as Jan Morrow a single interior decorator living alone in New York City in the late 1950's who has to share a party line on her telephone which was not that unusual for that day and time as hard as it is to believe now with Brad Allen played with smarmy brilliance by Rock Hudson. Tony Randall plays Jan's friend and client Jonathan a neurotic millionaire who wants to be more than just friends with Doris but can't get to first base with her. The delightful Thelma Ritter is perfectly cast as Alma Day's hard drinking but wise housekeeper. Doris can't stand sharing her party line with the womanizing Brad Allen but when Allen sees her at a night club and figures out who she is and that she will never have anything to do with him if she knows his true identity he invents an alter ego for himself Rex the cowboy from Texas. The ensuing story just gets funnier and funnier as Jonathan Tony Randall's character starts figuring out the deception and romantic mayhem ensues. Doris Day never looked lovelier as she did in this film and Rock never looked more handsome. It is ironic that he played such a blatant womanizer in this film when of course in real life he was a gay man. Although the film seems kind of dated now at the time this film was made it was unusual for a woman to be single and successful it is still tons of fun to watch. They just don't make movies like this anymore. A definite 10 stars!".

	schema:headline " A New Screen Coupling Creates Box Office Magic";
	schema:reviewBody "By 1958 Doris Day's career was on the downslide and something drastic needed to be done to revive her career. 1959'S PILLOW TALK redefined Doris' image and created an entirely new genre of the will she or won't she sex comedy as well as introducing one of the greatest romantic screen couplings in history...Doris Day and Rock Hudson. Day plays Jan Morrow an interior decorator who shares her phone line with Brad Allen Hudson a songwriting playboy who ties up Doris' phone by singing love songs actually the same song over the phone to the parade of women in his life. Day's attempts to get a private phone line fail and she and Hudson begrudgingly come up with a system to share the phone which Hudson doesn't stick to. Tony Randall plays Jonathan Forbes a rich playboy who is a client of Doris' and Rock's best friend who is crazy about Doris but she doesn't feel the same way. One night Brad discovers Jan at a nightclub and knowing she already hates him pretends to be a wealthy Texan in order to romance her and this is where the fun begins. Yes the story is dated because party lines are virtually a thing of the past but it is the linchpin upon which this story delightfully plays out. Director Michael Gordon cleverly uses splitscreen images to put Doris and Rock together on screen in seemingly compromising positions very adult for 1959 and watching Brad pretending to be cowboy Rex Stetson trying to romance Jan while Brad tries to advise Jan over the phone about what a cad Rex is is a lot of fun. Day lights up the screen here in a luminous performance that earned her her first and only Oscar nomination. Hudson previously only seen in dramatic films up to this point turns out to be gifted farceur and interviews in his later years always credited Doris for teaching him how to do comedy. Randall is comic perfection as Jonathan as is Thelma Ritter who was also nominated for an Oscar for her work as Jan's housekeeper. A delight from start to finish that introduced a new movie couple that would give Fred and Ginger and Spenceer and Kate a run for their money.".

There is a thinly veiled reference to Rock's sexual preference as there is in Lover Come Back. Was Hollywood jerking our chain? Doris plays the dedicated career girlunspoiled maiden and I am reminded of Oscar Levant's comment I knew Doris before she was a virgin. The atmosphere of New York City in the 50s is faithfully reproduced and the dialog is witty and clever. This was Rock's debut as a comic actor and he pulled it off flawlessly. His acting skills have been for the most part underrated.".

There is still a battle between the sexes and although the movie premiered in 1959 it's as fresh and relevant as it ever was. I'm sad now that Rock didn't do more comedy than he did as he had a knack and a timing that is second to none. I loved 'Send Me No Flowers' and 'Lover Come Back' also.

Personally I don't think it was their best but it's entertaining enough.Though for the life of me I can't understand what Doris did in this particular comedy to warrant an Oscar nomination. Pillow Talk doesn't stand out in that way. Doris was passed over for such things as Love Me Or Leave Me The Man Who Knew Too Much and Midnight Lace where she really did do some good acting. The premise is dated party lines are certainly a thing of the past now with text messaging cell phones. I do recall back around the same time my grandparents still having a party line. In that sense Pillow Talk is dated.Still the film is funny enough. Virginal interior decorator Doris Day happens to get the same party line as wolfish songwriter Rock Hudson. Rock with his nonstop love life is constantly cutting in on Doris's business calls.When he accidentally learns who she is when at a bar she's fending off the advances of young Nick Adams Rock embarks on an all out campaign to nail her as another trophy. Of course the imponderable of love always gets in the way in these films.Doris Day in all of her comedy films be they with Rock Hudson or others always got a good group of supporting players. It seemed obligatory that Tony Randall before finding fame as Felix Unger was always cast as the hero's best if goofy friend. It's either him or Gig Young in these roles. He creates his perennial character in Pillow Talk. On the female side Thelma Ritter as Doris's perpetually hung over maid is her deadpan best. My favorite scene in Pillow Talk is her drinking Rock Hudson under the table.Though audiences today might not get the whole party line premise Pillow Talk is still funny enough for even the younger viewers.".

However through a common acquaintance the two meet  but Brad covers his accent and woos her with her never suspecting his true identity.The story won an Oscar!  How!  The contrived and unlikely plot is just one of many unlikely set ups that romantic comedies use to get people to fall in and out of love before sorting everything out in a big happy hug of an ending.  The plot here is OK but an Oscar?! and is slightly better than average in it's scenario.  It's quite predictable and unlikely but as long as it's fizzy and enjoyable then it shouldn't matter.The delivery is quite enjoyable and is fizzy without being hilarious.  The jokes are never more than amusing but still add enough fizz to the mix to the film.  The chemistry between Hudson and Day is at an early stage in their career together and doesn't always come together  although it may be the fact that she spends the majority of the film disliking him.  Hudson however is actually pretty good throughout and delivers a lot of really good jokes and asides.  I'm not a big fan of him as I've always seen him as just a matinee hunk but the material suits him here.  The two leads are OK but the support cast are wasted for the most part.  Tony Randall is capable of much more than the bitter friend role given to him here and only occasionally does he get a chance to look good.  A bigger waste is Ritter as Alma.  She has delivered a similar character in other films to good effect most famously Rear Window  but here she barely has any screen time to work her world weary drunken wonder.Overall this is a Saturday afternoon matinee at best.  The predictable plotting and unlikely set up would be terrible if it didn't have fizz and some nice humour.  If you're in an undemanding mood then this would suit you well for a wet Saturday indoors.".

Well with Pillow Talk I found it. It is witty charming smart fresh and funny and like I said with Move Over Darling it doesn't have a single wasted scene. Also it is my personal favourite of the films Day made with Universal Studios.I will admit when I first saw the film I did occasionally find it slow and the ending a little abrupt. Seeing it again any flaws I had with it initially went completely and the more I saw Pillow Talk the more I found to like and the more I liked it. The story about a telephone party line is smart and quite original. It is glossy froth but I like glossy froth. The production values are pretty simple yet glamorous and the music is pleasant and memorable I especially loved the title song which is really quite catchy. The screenplay is witty and funny and has charm to it too while the film is very well directed by Michael Gordon.Even better are the performances. Doris Day once again is fresh and endearing and Rock Hudson also has his share of adroit humour and does it with flair. But these two are superbly supported by Tony Randall who I think gives his best performance in this film and Thelma Ritter who also have the best material. In conclusion a truly wonderful film if you give it a chance I think you'll like it. 1010 Bethany Cox".

In the late fifties especially in the booming New York City area private phone lines were hard to come by. Thus she has a party line she shares one with Brad Allen Rock Hudson a smooth songwriter of Broadway hits. Since Brad is very handsome women call him at all hours thanking him for their nights together and begging him to sing them love songs on the phone. This exasperates Jan for she needs to make business calls as well as personal. Arguing and pleading with him does no good. So she goes to the phone company with a complaint and a plea for a private line but it backfires. Wouldn't you know Ma Bell sends a unmarried female inspector to investigate and Brad charms her into writing a positive report. This upsets Jan even more. But one day wealthy businessman Jonathan Tony Randall who provides the finances for Brad's shows happens to mention that he has a new love interest. Yes he tells Mr. Allen her name is Jan and she decorated his office very nicely. Not only that she's a looker. Well well. Soon after a chance encounter at a restaurant lets Brad see Ms. Morrow but he knows if flirts with her as himself he's dead in the water. Thus when she needs help with a drunk client he poses as Rex Stetson from Texas with a drawl and since Jan has never seen him she has no idea he is pulling one over on her. But oh how she likes his looks and charm! The two begin to go out on dates and Jan falls head over heels. Meanwhile Brad still calls up Jan to give her advice on love which she can't help listening to since she knows he's an expert. How soon will it be until the truth comes out? This is a classic romantic comedy that may indeed be the best one ever made. My sisters and I loved it as teens in the early sixties and caught it on the tube whenever we could. The two stars Hudson and Day are perfection itself as the sparring phone partners and as the couple falling in love. In addition the rest of the cast including Randall and Thelma Ritter is also quite nice. The setting costumes and camera work are topnotch too while the script is gleefully unabashedly funny AND romantic. If you have never seen it don't delay. Buy borrow or rent it plop yourself onto the couch with some soft pillows and giggle your cares away.".

The plot is as follows an intelligent hard working woman Doris Day shares a phone line with a handsome womanizer Rock Hudson and he is always on the phone line romancing women so she cannot use it. She detests the man but after a series of events Hudson fakes his voice pretends to be a southern man with values. They fall in love.This funny clever witty and fluffy movie is what inspired 'Down With Love'. I actually saw Down With Love first and was really interested to see what inspired that great love. Just the pure wonder of the amazing quirky lines and the fun outfits makes this movie worth buying. You can see the transition to the early sixties fashions was very much taking place.I love this movie because it will always cheer me up no matter how I feel. It's very clever and witty  one of the best of this era.".

What they don't know is that they share a common friend the ever great Tony Randall a millionaire in this one who can't seem to get Day to marry him.Doris is an interior decorator in this one and when she does the home of the wealthy Lee Patrick son Nick Adams in a funny performance gets drunk while with her at a local nightclub. As luck would have it Hudson is in the next booth with his date a lovely Julia Meade. He realizes that this is his enemy from the party line. Too woo her he puts on a terrific Texas accent which he may have learned from his role in Giant and becomes Rex Stetson.You can imagine the hilarity when Day finds out who he really is. Along for the ride is Thelma Ritter Day's maid who portrays Alma an alcoholic maid ready to give good advice to all concerned.The dialogue is great. Randall hopes that Hudson will do great scoring when he loans him his weekend retreat in Connecticut.This was the only film that Doris Day was ever Oscar nominated for. Thelma Ritter received her 5th of 6 supporting nominations for this film.A classy movie funny to watch and a pleasure to view. You may even wish for crosswires after seeing this great film.".

Tony Randall and Thelma Ritter are marvelous in their supporting roles. This is not a deep and socially important movie  if you want that why not try To Kill A Mockingbird? It's somewhat preposterous and improbable and centering as it does around something called a Party Line telephone it's dated. For those who don't know what that is a Party Line was a telephone line shared by two or more parties. It was very much like having an extension in someone else's house. And yes if they were using the phone your phone was also busy  you could neither take nor receive calls while your party line sharers were on the phone. Private lines were available but they were priced at a premium. Most people were satisfied to have party lines...they were actually fun in many ways one of those being that you could eavesdrop on your neighbors. This movie is a lot of fun doesn't require much thinking and is safe for the whole family. No meanspirited slapstick here just fun and if you give yourself permission to suspend disbelief you'll love this movie as much as I. You get a couple of great tunes sung by Doris Day too. Doris had it all wholesome beauty great acting talent and an amazing singing voice. I almost never pass up a chance to see this movie whenever it's on TCM.

	schema:headline " The Best ConspiracyPolitical Thriller of The Year";
	schema:reviewBody "In 2008 the American Carnegie Endowment's Foreign Policy magazine named Russia as the worst place to be a terrorist and highlighted especially Russia's willingness to prioritize national security over civil rights.But this movie represents the other side of the story which is based on the similar life experience of Luke Harding who summed up his Post Cold war Russia Experience in his 2011 book Mafia States. Now most of the people who don't know about him know thisLuke Daniel Harding born 1968 is a British political journalist working for 'The Guardian newspaper.' He was the correspondent of 'The Guardian' in Russia from 2007 until he was expelled from the country in 2011 over his critical articles. His 2011 book Mafia State discusses the political system in Russia under Vladimir Putin which he describes as a mafia state.He is the first foreign journalist to be expelled from Russia since Cold War ended. He is now posted in the London office of 'The Guardian.'The movie basically depicts his experiences thought with some changes but the basic settings or plot remains the same where a foreigner journalist who is from Germany and also the son of a deceased political journalist who used to work with the same magazine during the USSR era and post USSR era.comes to work for a Russian Celebrity Magazine who publishes page three stories for rich and influential Russians as they no longer publish stories which might displease the powerful government and The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation who treat media censorship as a necessity to suppress the things they don't want to go public in dealing with matters of terrorism or national security any way they please to justify here the concept of national security over human rights.But the movie not only depicts the inhumane methods of tortures developed by stasis in Germany during WWII days but also the terrifying possibilities of secret services' hand behind some of the domestic terrorist attacks to justify the military warfare in Chechnya. As one character saysThe threat of terror is the only thing which unites the people of a country its a historic fact. He also saysRussia was on its Knees..In 1988 Russia was as poor as a third world nation most reflecting for the country that once was second most powerful in the world everything collapses..Army economy whole society..we were at the abyss. Then the president managed to take us back. Only a fool thinks that it doesn't have its prize.So the story deals with the question of who being the actual threat is. the main character writes an article of a recently deceased investigation journalist who was found dead in mysterious circumstances completely unaware of the fact that he soon will be involved with psychological war with secret service officials and terrorist attacks and dark and twisted power games who will terrorize him and will test him when his fathers past is also revealed during his investigation for truth.Overall the movie do raise questions about some serious issues of human rights and social willpower to resist the misuse of power which uses terrorist attacks to make more anti terrorist laws to give more power to military and make the life of common man more difficult. It represent the side of modern day Russia which has been hidden or unseen for masses of outside.I saw this movie and it do has a similar plot with the book Mafia State though i have not read the book completely yet an on screen view was a treat. It had a gripping plot and twists were in plenty. Every person shown in the movie was not what they claim they were..there were many moments of doubt and suspense and it is entertaining.On the whole the movie is a decent effort and to show these kind of stories is always a challenge. Screenplay is good and it is fast pace. Acting is also decent and some serious efforts by male lead has been put in some scenes especially in the FSS prison where the inhumane conditions prisoners are kept in.I was impressed by the movie and it is a great to see a decent political thriller after the Pierce Brosnan starer Ghostwriter and it is commercially entertaining.My rating is 7.510..Go watch it for things Russia is not famous for!!".

	onyx:emotionText "In 2008 the American Carnegie Endowment's Foreign Policy magazine named Russia as the worst place to be a terrorist and highlighted especially Russia's willingness to prioritize national security over civil rights.But this movie represents the other side of the story which is based on the similar life experience of Luke Harding who summed up his Post Cold war Russia Experience in his 2011 book Mafia States. Now most of the people who don't know about him know thisLuke Daniel Harding born 1968 is a British political journalist working for 'The Guardian newspaper.' He was the correspondent of 'The Guardian' in Russia from 2007 until he was expelled from the country in 2011 over his critical articles. His 2011 book Mafia State discusses the political system in Russia under Vladimir Putin which he describes as a mafia state.He is the first foreign journalist to be expelled from Russia since Cold War ended. He is now posted in the London office of 'The Guardian.'The movie basically depicts his experiences thought with some changes but the basic settings or plot remains the same where a foreigner journalist who is from Germany and also the son of a deceased political journalist who used to work with the same magazine during the USSR era and post USSR era.comes to work for a Russian Celebrity Magazine who publishes page three stories for rich and influential Russians as they no longer publish stories which might displease the powerful government and The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation who treat media censorship as a necessity to suppress the things they don't want to go public in dealing with matters of terrorism or national security any way they please to justify here the concept of national security over human rights.But the movie not only depicts the inhumane methods of tortures developed by stasis in Germany during WWII days but also the terrifying possibilities of secret services' hand behind some of the domestic terrorist attacks to justify the military warfare in Chechnya. As one character saysThe threat of terror is the only thing which unites the people of a country its a historic fact. He also saysRussia was on its Knees..In 1988 Russia was as poor as a third world nation most reflecting for the country that once was second most powerful in the world everything collapses..Army economy whole society..we were at the abyss. Then the president managed to take us back. Only a fool thinks that it doesn't have its prize.So the story deals with the question of who being the actual threat is. the main character writes an article of a recently deceased investigation journalist who was found dead in mysterious circumstances completely unaware of the fact that he soon will be involved with psychological war with secret service officials and terrorist attacks and dark and twisted power games who will terrorize him and will test him when his fathers past is also revealed during his investigation for truth.Overall the movie do raise questions about some serious issues of human rights and social willpower to resist the misuse of power which uses terrorist attacks to make more anti terrorist laws to give more power to military and make the life of common man more difficult. It represent the side of modern day Russia which has been hidden or unseen for masses of outside.I saw this movie and it do has a similar plot with the book Mafia State though i have not read the book completely yet an on screen view was a treat. It had a gripping plot and twists were in plenty. Every person shown in the movie was not what they claim they were..there were many moments of doubt and suspense and it is entertaining.On the whole the movie is a decent effort and to show these kind of stories is always a challenge. Screenplay is good and it is fast pace. Acting is also decent and some serious efforts by male lead has been put in some scenes especially in the FSS prison where the inhumane conditions prisoners are kept in.I was impressed by the movie and it is a great to see a decent political thriller after the Pierce Brosnan starer Ghostwriter and it is commercially entertaining.My rating is 7.510..Go watch it for things Russia is not famous for!!";

The relationship between Paul and Katja feel genuine an improvement over the not so well fleshed out relationship in Wir Sind Die Nacht. On the other hand the acting and writing is not as good as in Die Welle and Wir Sind Die Nacht Gansel has a lot of good ideas going on but I think he needs a cowriter who can help him write. That said some of the characters are really well fleshed out.Mark Ivanirwho looks like he is Peter Stormare's brother as Alsan a Chechen terrorist steals the show completely and is by far the most interesting character. Rade Serbedzija also gets some interesting stuff to say at the end.The cinematography is a bit bland and seems to have been color corrected a bit to much but the music is pretty good. There is some interesting visuals like the contrast between the modern globalised club and the small traditional Russian bar.The story seems very realistic it is much like all the news we get from Russia these days. The plot seems all to plausible.In the end I think people should see Die Vierte Macht if they get the chance but Gansel can do better than this.".

Without the brilliant Moritz Bleibtreu this would be just a piece of junk. The director got lost in the conspiracy theories behind the Russian military actions in Chechenia with the apparently stolen idea on the staged terrorist actions of CIA regarding Sept.11 developed by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit 911.

They need to chill a bit and realize the purpose of this film simply a tribute to the music.How could any fan of blues not like this? I mean look at all the great performers in this film and how much better does it get to have all of them join in for a couple of jam sessions at the end? The movie sports a Who's Who of modernday blues musicians and singers and also is directed by John Landis who has directed some of the most entertaining films of the last 25 years.Plus it was simply a funny movie with two funny guys  Dan Akyroyd and John Goodman  and a really neatlooking little kid in J. Evan Bonifant who really makes me laugh. Just looking at this 10yearold dancing is his Blues Brothers outfit alone is worth a number of laughs. Some of the characters in here are so outrageous they would be tough to describe. The car chases the dances and clothing and overthetop story all add up to two hours of lamedbrained fun. No this isn't Shakespeare and it wasn't mean to be. It's a much niceredged movie than the first Blues Brothers too. Unfortunately too many people want edgy material all the time .Not only are the characters colorful so is the cinematography making it both a visual and audio treat.

	schema:headline " NOT a sequel but a TRIBUTE!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Contrary to popular opinion this is not a sequel. It is supposed to be a tribute to the original. People who bash this movie without reading Aykroyd's interviews are ignorant to the intent here. This movie was originally to be a sequel back in 1981 just before Belushi died. When that happened the idea for another adventure fell away. But after almost two decades Aykroyd wanted to do something to revisit the classic film and pay homage to his friend and costar Belushi so he assembled this Concert Movie which is supposed to be all about THE MUSIC not the story. The only reason a story was put in was to keep it moving from musical number to musical number because everyone knows that straight concert films are pretty boring even if you really like the performers. So here it is for the true Blues Brothers fans to enjoy. P.S.And if your problem with the plot was some of the cartoony style actions that occur Cabel being pulled heavenward and his clothes magically changing et cetera remember that the original had the same things. In the first one the entire band's clothing magically changes for a concert but if you know that this is merely a representation of the character's psychological state and not a literal change then the film works much better. The same idea works for the muchmaligned zombie sequence near the end at Queen Mousette's mansion. Also people complain about the Bluesmobile in this film being able to drive underwater. Well in the first film the car flew performed flips and was nearly indestructible. In fact if you watch the DVD of the first film you find in the deleted scenes and Makingof section that the Bluesmobile is supposed to be magic because it was parked each night inside a power transformer. How is that for cheesiness on the first film? So that also explains Elwood's ability to smuggle himself in the dash of the car in this one and the car being able to crash land from a fiery loopdeloop at the fairgrounds. Even though I wish this film could have been a little edgier and darker in tone like the original I do find its bold and effective use of color to be magnificent and fascinating. Perhaps this film has a little more depth than people expect so they incorrectly perceive it to be a lackluster and shallow mindnumbing entertainment. I know better .......

	onyx:emotionText "Contrary to popular opinion this is not a sequel. It is supposed to be a tribute to the original. People who bash this movie without reading Aykroyd's interviews are ignorant to the intent here. This movie was originally to be a sequel back in 1981 just before Belushi died. When that happened the idea for another adventure fell away. But after almost two decades Aykroyd wanted to do something to revisit the classic film and pay homage to his friend and costar Belushi so he assembled this Concert Movie which is supposed to be all about THE MUSIC not the story. The only reason a story was put in was to keep it moving from musical number to musical number because everyone knows that straight concert films are pretty boring even if you really like the performers.

I originally saw the movie when it was released on VHS and rented the movie for 3 in the late 90's and I felt ripped off beyond belief. I just recently rewatched the movie and I feel just stupid for doing so. The movie is even worse the second time around. There are no redeeming qualities or performances to save the movie which has a dumbass plot and is just boring to watch. The whole 'feud' with the russians is like what a 2 year old would do and shows early on what a disaster the movie is. The ending is pointless driving off into the horizon with the cops chasing. Seems like no one knew how to end the movie so they went the brainless way out at least the first movie showed what happens when you fool with the cops you become the prison band which made the end of the original excellent. The only thing they could have worked is have James take over John's role because the explanation of Jake's death is soooo stupid it's insulting. In the trivia to this movie it says the movie was ranked 4th out of 25 worst sequels I would like to know what was worse than this? I would have said it IS the worst. Even giving this movie a 1 seems like a compliment but they should add a vote of Avoid at all costs because this is the case for this flop. I am really disappointed with Dan Ackroyd he is almost always good and this movie looks like he was asleep at the wheel.".

For instance in the original movie the Blues Brothers a were actually brothers and b were on an actual mission from God.  Their goal was to make some honest money to save an orphanage from shutting down while trying to flee from the police at the same time.  The movie brought back blues legends such as Aretha Franklin and James Brown back into the spotlight and it helped contribute to the death of disco. Eighteen years later Jake's dead Cab Calloway's dead the orphanage has been shut down so why are they being chased by the police?  Because a half brother of Elwood got ped off at finding his real past? The kid I must add was a nice touch and it was cool to see twice as many blues legends in this movie including some new artists like Johnny Lang and Erykah Badu.  But there should have been a better plot because it seemed as though the Blues Brothers Band were going from event to event for the hell of it.  Where's the plot in that?  Police leave these guys alone. The big mistake in this movie was its attempt to outdo the original movie. The music was great and I highly recommend buying the soundtrack.

The jokes that are in the film are direct rip offs from the original.There isn't even any car chasing. And the bad guys get turned into rats! BS! BS! BS!

	schema:headline " This movie is god awful. It gives me the blues.";
	schema:reviewBody "1980s Blues Brother was perhaps the greatest Saturday Night Live skit to spin off from the show into the realm of movies. Still The Blues Brothers wasn't the perfect movie to be made. It was a nightmare for Universal Pictures to complete. It was wildly off schedule had an everchanging script drugfuel stars and was way over budget. Yet the movie made nearly triple of its money back when it was released. The reasons why it work was because the movie was action packed kinda funny and had great musical numbers. Still most of its success came from its two top drawings stars Dan Akroyd and John Belushi. This sequel didn't have any of those achievements. It's felt like a desperate retread between writeractor Dan Akyroyd and writerdirector John Landis to relive the glory days. The sequel fails to live up to the original big time. The reasons why are very clear. First off the movie plot is paper thin. The movie tells the story of Elwood Blue Dan Aykroyd trying to reunited the old band to fight in a battle of the band contest in Louisiana. In my opinion this plot is very weak compare to the Mission from God from the first movie. The movie never establish why Elwood need the band in the first place or why the other band members would come to his rescue when they themselves are living pretty welloff. Second off the movie kinda ruins the first film by stating out that the orphanage that the brothers were trying to save ended up closing. It kinda a bummer opening to a film. The Studio didn't like this and force John Landis to make the rest of the film more lighthearted. It gets worst as the film turns PG to capitalize on a wider audience. It really limits the amount of violent and language that they can show. This makes for a very underwhelming film. It was really boring for the most part. The jokes are very childish and cartoony. I really couldn't get into the whole over the top supernatural sequence this movie brings. It felt like a 10 year old wrote this film. I really didn't like the fact that Elwood was being team up with a kid named Buster J. Evan Bonifant. Not once in the film does Elwood seem like he has any fatherlike connection with the kid. The movie acts as if the kid wasn't there for the most part. It was very pointless. Even new members like Mack John Goodman were underwhelming. The movie never does a good job in making it seem like Elwood and Mack have somewhat a connection. The chemistry between them isn't there. It's sad because I love John Goodman as an actor. John Landis and Dan Aykroyd were reportedly very unhappy with the changes the studio forced onto the film even coming close to quitting the project. Third off I can't believe they made a sequel 18 years after the 1980's hit Blues Brothers. John Landis really waited too long to get this sequel off the ground. Nobody really wanted to see this film in the late 1990s. Why is this movie even made!? It's not like the fanbase were asking for a Blues Brothers sequel. If they were clearly the producers should had quickly capitalize on it in the early 1980s. Maybe they did wanted to make a film sequel as quick as possible but production of the film was halted due to main actor John Belushi's odd drug behavior. Maybe they were waiting for Belushi to go into rehab. Well that day never came as John Belushi died in 1982. Since Belushi couldn't reprise his role I don't understand why this movie wasn't shelf. Clearly they can't use a double for Jake. Nobody can double Belushi. The death was actually worked into the film's plot it didn't really help but it was at least respectful to John Belushi. The film was originally intended to include Brother Zee Blues Jim Belushi brother of John Belushi. But due to an already existing television deal Jim Belushi was unable to appear and the script was altered to include Cab Blues Joe Morton. This was a huge mistake as Joe Morton really didn't give us much in humor. He's a good actor but he's no comedian. The movie has a lot of cameos by celebs. Aretha Franklin B.B King James Brown Frank Oz and few others return from the first movie for a small paycheck and reprise some of their classic hits. One person from the first movie that didn't return was Cab Calloway  John Candy who died four years prior to the film's release. Still the movie does give them some homage. I like that new musicians at the time like Blues Travelers  Erykah Badu gives the movie so needed new flair. It made the film somewhat entertaining. The music is pretty damn good for the most part but the movie doesn't mixed the musical sequences so well with the rest of the film. Overall This movie is one of most pointless underwhelming and just downright bizarre sequels in comedy history. It wasn't good man. I don't recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Blues Brothers is one of the most classic comedies of the past 25 years. Somehow someone decided to mess up the legacy by creating a sequel...18 years later.Dan Akyroyd returns as Ellwood Blues. He has just been released from jail and trying to put the band back together again. Because of the real life death of John Belushi the writers instead throw in John Goodman and a child as new band players.First of all I want to point out that I respect in this film that when Ellwood tells Goodman about Jake the writers didn't come up with Oh he's down in Florida vacationing or something stupid excuse for his absence like that. At least they payed John the respect he deserved and Ellwood tells him that Jake died paying some respect to John Belushi and his character Jake Blues.Where they got the idea for a child to join the band is beyond me. Is this a guarantee PG13 or what? Obviously they decided to make this at least a PG13 and I think that is stupid. The original film was R and sticking to it they should have done the same here. I like when there are family films but this film is not! There is a strip bar sequence and yet this is PG13? Come on! As for these scenes they paid absolutely nothing worthwhile to the film other than filling in 20 minutes of stupid cheap gimmicks Ellwood gets on stage and sings blues as the strippers come out This is so dumb and while the original had obvious dumb sequences they came out funnydumb this film did not. It almost was not intended to be a real film rather a joining of Akyroyd with Blues. They do not really care about the film itself. It's like a music video gone wrong. You'd expect to pick this video up and have a music CD pop out instead of a film.How anyone could think up such a lame excuse of a sequel is beyond me and how Dan Akyroyd would ever join the cast again just completely mind boggling to me. What was Dan thinking?Overall this film pays some respects to John Belushi's SNL and film legacy but overall does more damage to him than honor. I am disgusted that Dan would do this to such a classic film and such a classic comedian. John Belushi wasn't a favorite of mine but he was pretty funny and very controversial for the time. I think if he were around today he would've lost his career like Dan Chevy Steve and Bill. Not that these hilarious guys don't do funny films anymore but they don't do ENOUGH films anymore especially Chevy he has the most wasted career out of allSo if you like cheap gimmicks and ripoffs of the first Blues Brothers film by all means see Blues Brothers 2000. But if you're like me and hate cheap gimmicks and unhonorable ripoffs then stay clear of this flop. 15 starsJOHN ULMER".

I'd watch the car chases over and over again and to this day can recite whole reams of dialogue. BB 2000 I thought can't be as good but it must be worth seeing.How wrong I was.I have tried but I regret to say that I can find no redeeming features for this movie whatsoever. Not one. The dialogue which once was cool and sharp is stilted forced wholly unrecognisable as everyday English. The addition of the little kid and the black forgotten brother was pointless pandering to political correctness and family appeal. The car chases were overblown without being entertaining and the plot was sadly not even laughable. I only kept watching after the first five minutes in the hope of one solitary laugh to give me something positive to write about. No chance. Even the usually excellent John Goodman was well below par and this is to say nothing of the washed up Ackroyd.Terribly photographed crippled by being utterly devoid of plot jokes charisma and with even the music shoehorned in with no thought to aesthetics or taste I can honestly say that BB2K ranks alongside root canal work as the least pleasant way one could ever spend time. This film took me two long hours closer to my death. I suggest you do not let it do the same to you.".

BB 2000 I thought can't be as good but it must be worth seeing.How wrong I was.I have tried but I regret to say that I can find no redeeming features for this movie whatsoever. Not one. The dialogue which once was cool and sharp is stilted forced wholly unrecognisable as everyday English. The addition of the little kid and the black forgotten brother was pointless pandering to political correctness and family appeal. The car chases were overblown without being entertaining and the plot was sadly not even laughable. I only kept watching after the first five minutes in the hope of one solitary laugh to give me something positive to write about. No chance. Even the usually excellent John Goodman was well below par and this is to say nothing of the washed up Ackroyd.Terribly photographed crippled by being utterly devoid of plot jokes charisma and with even the music shoehorned in with no thought to aesthetics or taste I can honestly say that BB2K ranks alongside root canal work as the least pleasant way one could ever spend time. This film took me two long hours closer to my death. I suggest you do not let it do the same to you.";

We didn't need all of those special effects. In fact it seems anymore there must be a requirement for computer graphics to take up 80 of the scenery.  As for the characters Elwood was OUT OF CHARACTER! John Goodman while has talent needs to find a role other than loser in SOMETHING! The boy was a plot device we didn't need. The only thing saving this movie was a few cameos by original cast members. But John Lee Hooker and Ray Charles aren't here and they're still alive last I checked.  Most of the music scenes had no real purpose. And then there's the fact that Elwood is now a stuck up jerk who will lie to just about anyone. Take my advice and forget this movie ever happened. In fact buy the original and avoid this. This deserves to be on MST3K.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Blues Brothers 2000' is a sequal that just didn't work. Whereas the original felt gritty dirty cool and funny the new one shows us characters in bright clothing the sun is always shining and everything seems so squeakyclean. It's as if 'Disney' took over the production put a cute kid in it and turned it into a jolly piece of family entertainment. For example in the original the car chase was on the mean dirty streets of Chicago with all the rubbish and shadows that come with a city location. But in the sequal the car chase was staged on a nice piece of quiet country road with green grass and lovely scenery. It seems the filmmakers decided to take it easy with this one and do all their work in the most comfortable of surroundings. Why block city streets when you can take your time out in the middle of nowhere? While that may sound convenient in the end the original car chase was much more exciting real and funny than the newer version.Even the prison that Ellwood is released from at the beginning of the film is in a nice piece of verdant countryside. I thought Jolliet was deep in the heart of Chicago in a kind of industrial wasteland... Aretha Franklin and her crew are all now rich and selling expensive cars! Oh dear whatever happened to the 'blues'? Blues music plays so much better in more rundown areas. Well that's what I think.Certainly the music is awesome and I cannot help feel that they should have all just gone on the road rather than make this ineffectual and silly sequal. There were just to many characters not nearly enough story and Ellwood seemed to talk nonstop to the point of being annoying. Ackroyd's voice even sounded cartoonlike he definately didn't sound the Ellwood from the original.I have seen the original more times than I can count and could happily sit down and watch it now but the sequal I have seen maybe two and a half times and have no wish to sit through it again. I would love to see a Part 3 but this time getting back to the roots of what Blues really is and not a cleaned up sanitised and bubbly episode like what '2000' was.".

Respect that shows NO RESPECT at ALL. The woman is STILL the greatest singing voice of the Twentieth AND Twenty First century and it is her VOICE that is the best ever  and that song remains the most beautiful anthem of RB blues and soul... and to trash that destroys any credibility you had up to that point as a worthy critic of ANY kind. John Belushi John Candy and Cab Calloway are dead and nothing can be done about that but to say this film is totally without merit is silly and so is comparing it to the original Blues Brothers movie which by the way has plotholes you could drive a CONVOY of trucks through. For instance what the hell were the Good Ole Boys country band pd about? Didn't they arrive AFTER THE BAR WAS CLOSED EXPECTING TO PLAY? That should have had their cabaret and union license taken away right there and it's their OWN damn fault. And then the comments about Dan Ackroyd's bald spot. Didn't they guy wear a hat the whole time anyway? SO THAT'S a pretty lame critique too. Look the music was phenomenal the speech that Dan makes about the Russian mob is classic inspired Dan Ackroyd writing... and the kid had some decent moves and could play the mouth harp with the best of them assuming he really DID play the thing and I loved the Ghost Rider's In The Sky rendition done by the band. So don't compare it to the original. It's an homage for cryin' out loud though I do wish John's brother Jim Belushi had been in it but it had something to do with contractual stuff I believe anyway.

Aside from that the signature clothing black suit black fedora sunglasses etc. and the Bluesmobile this movie is almost unrecognizable from the original film.Out of the two stars of the original only Dan Aykroyd survived to make this film. RIP John Belushi. Unfortunately Elwood Blues must have gone to the grave with Jake Blues because Dan Aykroyd's reprisal of his role is disgraceful. Elwood's voice accent mannerisms and overall attitude have totally changed...for the worse. A once mysterious serious resourceful and charming character has been warped into a worthless goofball and this change sets the tone for the rest of the movie as well.The original movie though very funny had a serious tone to it at least the performances seemed that way but Blues Brothers 2000 is just goofy and cheesy. The only thing that I can compare the goofinesscheesiness to is a kids movie...which makes sense since one of the main characters of this movie IS a kid Buster Blues. After visiting The Penguin from the original movie Elwood gets stuck mentoring an orphan boy Buster who turns out to be a blues prodigy. Add John Goodman's equally goofy character Mighty Mack McTeer into the mix and you've got a recipe for disaster.The only things that saves this movie from being a 010 are the outstanding musical sequences with the exception of Johnny Lang's contribution. With the exception of John Belushi the original band is reunited in this film and they do not disappoint! The Blues Brothers Band and the various cameos from famous musicians throughout the movie are reason enough to watch it. The final sequence a Battle of the Bands contest is particularly good.To Summarize the movie sucks but the music is great! Watch it at least once especially if you've seen the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts out with a woman at a bar in Japan just as the band is introducing a guitar player. The woman's barmate translates that the guitarist is a tourguide by day. We see Shoru and Chenli meeting Hogun for the first time at a school concert he is with his 'cousin' and the girls speculate on whether the 'cousin' is indeed a relative. Sho and Chen run into Ho at parties etc with Ho sometimes playing his guitar. At one early party Ho keeps looking over to where Chen and Sho are standing and Chen counts the number of times he does this while wondering which of them he is looking at. At a later party Sho walks up to Ho presumably about to ask him which of the two he was looking at when she vomits on him having gotten a little tipsy from the punch. A few days later Chen is rushed to the hospital with a terrible headache and that day Ho comes to see Sho at school. They spend the afternoon together and when they check in on Chen at her house in the evening Chen asks them Were you two together all afternoon? Sho and Ho are getting closer and Chen is being distant to Sho. Sho has been living with her aunt and around Christmas time her mother comes to visit with her fianc. Sho is thus unable to spend time with Ho during the holidays. She is able to get away one day and spend the night with Ho at a motel though nothing happens. This is quickly discovered and Sho's mother threatens to never see her again if she decides to stay in Hong Kong. When Sho says she would still rather stay with Ho than go to Canada with her mother she goes ballistic and instead meets with Ho.All along we have also been shown a parallel storyline where a female film director is telling this story to a screenwriter. They analyze the characters together and discuss points such as how Sho's mother's reaction is too typical etc.After meeting Sho's mother Ho is distant to Sho being abrupt on the phone and having almost no contact with her. When Sho shows up at his house to discuss something that Chen has mentioned to her they fight and break up. As Sho is being comforted by Chen Chen abruptly declares her love for Sho. Sho screams her utter shock and horror at this revelation and next we see Sho leaving with her mother for Canada and Ho leaving his house. Sho grows to be a designer and we see her getting assigned a business trip to Japan.We've had a pretty good idea of what's been going on so far with the director and her relation to the story but at this point we know for sure that this is her own story as the screenwriter asks why Sho's job has been changed from director to designer and the director tells him that stories shouldn't be identical.Sho runs into Ho in Japan who is a tourguide and it is clear by their conversation that they've had no contact with another since Hong Kong. After dinner they end up in bed and the next time they meet Ho tells Sho that he is married but they still go to bed again. At this point the director says that just because they've had sex this cannot be an affair considering Sho met Ho before anybody else but the screenwriter says that Sho is a little obsessed and that Ho is irresponsible. Ho and Sho keep in contact through mail and we find out that Sho does not know who Ho's wife is because she neglected to ask. As we see Ho reading a letter from Sho we also see him gathering a blanket and pillow from the master bedroom where his wife sleeps and assume the marriage is not all well. As Ho is writing a response to Sho the wife walks in and it is Chen. She wants to talk.Ho is at the doorstep of Sho's house where she lives with her mother who never remarried. He has come to see Sho but she is out and instead we get a flashback of what happened back when Sho's mother had a talk with Ho and his mother. She pleads to him that Sho is everything to her and this is perhaps why Ho gave Sho up.Ho is waiting at Sho's house with her mother for Sho and in their conversation we are told that he is just recently divorced and with no children. Sho comes home and as she and Ho talk at a caf he asks her as she is so busy would she have time to be married. He takes out a ring and drops it in a glass of water. If she drinks all the water it is yes and if she leaves something it is no. Sho asks him why he got divorced and he says because of differences in personalities. Sho continues to talk about how her company is sending her to all of these chaotic places and Ho tells her that she can quit it all and come live with him in Japan. She says she cannot she has work. She then takes the ring out of the glass and puts it on her finger while saying she doesn't want him to force a response out of her.The screenwriter asks if they cannot get together because they didn't work hard for it. The director says that they couldn't force each others lives. The screenwriter asks perhaps Sho knew she wouldn't have a better life in Japan with Ho and perhaps Ho was too weak to make Sho come with him.".

	schema:headline " Kyon Ki...its special and of course Salman Khan!";
	schema:reviewBody "Kyon Ki is one of the mostawaited films for Salman Khan and in the BO market for the second half of 2005. By looking at the promos people are expecting to see a film that will be highly on emotions. And since its DiwaliEid people want to see comedy and not a serious film like Kyon Ki. However since I have been such a Salman Khan fan since Maine Pyar Kiya and judging by the promos from the film I am expecting him to deliver an amazing performance after Tere Naam. So despite being a serious film the question is IS KYON KI WORTH THE WATCH? The answer is a resounding YES go and watch it.SCENES THAT STOOD OUT The scene where Salman Khan gets admitted in the hospital  Somescenes in the mental institution  Scene where Salman Khan explains the significance of music  Rimi Sen death  Salman Khan and Om Puri confrontations  Jackie Shroff final speech to Om Puri  Heartrending climaxHimesh Reshammiya is simply good not better than Tere Naam. The soundtrack should finish this year as one of the best selling album of 2005 probably the best. Songs like Kyon Ki Itna Dil Keh Raha Hai Aa Jeene Ek Pal and Jhakte Mare are placed well and are welltuned. Only song that didn't have much impact was Dil Ke Badle as it was placed bad in the movie. I felt that Priyadarshan direction was good at places but it could've been better. Since this was like a serious film I was expecting the same Priyadarshan from Virasat and Gardish and for that I was kind of disappointed. However to keep in the mood of film I was little happy with Priyadarshan in a way because he had comedy action and sad scenes in Kyon Ki. However the direction should have been more hardhitting like Gardish and some of the scenes do drag a lot. Suneil Shetty was wasted. Kareena Kapoor has done a great job. It's good to see her in a different role. Her new look is very well and simple. She is bound to win come accolades from her performance. Her ending scene will be a shock.Rimi Sen plays her part okay but not that good.However she does make an impact.Om Puri was great as strict father and the mean doctor who believes that brutal force are the ways to cure an ailing patient. You will hate him for what he did at the ending.Jackie Shroff was simply good in Kyon Ki might earn him a nomination for best supporting actor. He played his scenes excellent and his dialogue delivery was good. His final scene was simply great.HOWEVER THE SHOWSTEALER WAS NONE OTHER THAN SALMAN KHAN. Salman played his role superbly you have to see it to believe it. If he succeeds a good way when seeing his story with Rimi Sen then he was excellent as the patient in the mental institution. Salman Khan was the lifeline of Kyon Ki without him Kyon Ki would have fallen flat down. Your heart will go for Salman Khan at the ending as it was very sad. Salman Khan should earn a nomination for this performance and probably should win the Critics Actor award for it. His fanfollowing should increase once more for this super performance. His performance should finish off as one of the best of 2005. Screenplay was a complete letdown in my opinion. Some scenes didn't make sense. Salman Khan once he recovered he instantly falls in love with Kareena and then they sing a song it was kind of stupid. Cinematography was excellent they managed to capture Romania.Background was good.Dialogues were very good.Editing could've been better.Seriously go and watch Kyon Ki which is a mature and sensitive product from Priyadarshan. It may have not taken a big opening thanks to its lame promos and being calls as an Emotional film however Kyon Ki doesn't disappoint. However the movie does have its flaws but critics like Taran always writes from a BO point of view and hope he gets the shock of his live when Kyon Ki succeeds. Come on if a guy like Mr. Jha can write a good review for Kyon Ki then you should watch it. And look at it Kyon Ki collections increases and it is steady right now. And thanks to Salman Khan huge starpower since he is having such an amazing year and that his performance is hugely appreciated people hopefully will support their hero and see a superb performance from Salman Khan. There is a time to watch entertainment cinema and there is a time to watch seriousintelligent cinema like Kyon Ki. I can bet that Kyon Ki is a much better film than Garam Masala and Shaadi No.1 combined together. Well since it's DiwaliEid go and watch Kyon Ki for its performance esp. Salman Khan and good soundtrack. I'm sure you won't feel that disappointed. Kyon Ki is one of the best films of 2005 simply put thanks to its different theme.810".

	onyx:emotionText "Kyon Ki is one of the mostawaited films for Salman Khan and in the BO market for the second half of 2005. By looking at the promos people are expecting to see a film that will be highly on emotions. And since its DiwaliEid people want to see comedy and not a serious film like Kyon Ki. However since I have been such a Salman Khan fan since Maine Pyar Kiya and judging by the promos from the film I am expecting him to deliver an amazing performance after Tere Naam. So despite being a serious film the question is IS KYON KI WORTH THE WATCH? The answer is a resounding YES go and watch it.SCENES THAT STOOD OUT The scene where Salman Khan gets admitted in the hospital  Somescenes in the mental institution  Scene where Salman Khan explains the significance of music  Rimi Sen death  Salman Khan and Om Puri confrontations  Jackie Shroff final speech to Om Puri  Heartrending climaxHimesh Reshammiya is simply good not better than Tere Naam. The soundtrack should finish this year as one of the best selling album of 2005 probably the best. Songs like Kyon Ki Itna Dil Keh Raha Hai Aa Jeene Ek Pal and Jhakte Mare are placed well and are welltuned. Only song that didn't have much impact was Dil Ke Badle as it was placed bad in the movie. I felt that Priyadarshan direction was good at places but it could've been better. Since this was like a serious film I was expecting the same Priyadarshan from Virasat and Gardish and for that I was kind of disappointed. However to keep in the mood of film I was little happy with Priyadarshan in a way because he had comedy action and sad scenes in Kyon Ki. However the direction should have been more hardhitting like Gardish and some of the scenes do drag a lot. Suneil Shetty was wasted. Kareena Kapoor has done a great job. It's good to see her in a different role. Her new look is very well and simple. She is bound to win come accolades from her performance. Her ending scene will be a shock.Rimi Sen plays her part okay but not that good.However she does make an impact.Om Puri was great as strict father and the mean doctor who believes that brutal force are the ways to cure an ailing patient. You will hate him for what he did at the ending.Jackie Shroff was simply good in Kyon Ki might earn him a nomination for best supporting actor. He played his scenes excellent and his dialogue delivery was good. His final scene was simply great.HOWEVER THE SHOWSTEALER WAS NONE OTHER THAN SALMAN KHAN. Salman played his role superbly you have to see it to believe it. If he succeeds a good way when seeing his story with Rimi Sen then he was excellent as the patient in the mental institution. Salman Khan was the lifeline of Kyon Ki without him Kyon Ki would have fallen flat down. Your heart will go for Salman Khan at the ending as it was very sad. Salman Khan should earn a nomination for this performance and probably should win the Critics Actor award for it. His fanfollowing should increase once more for this super performance. His performance should finish off as one of the best of 2005. Screenplay was a complete letdown in my opinion. Some scenes didn't make sense. Salman Khan once he recovered he instantly falls in love with Kareena and then they sing a song it was kind of stupid. Cinematography was excellent they managed to capture Romania.Background was good.Dialogues were very good.Editing could've been better.Seriously go and watch Kyon Ki which is a mature and sensitive product from Priyadarshan. It may have not taken a big opening thanks to its lame promos and being calls as an Emotional film however Kyon Ki doesn't disappoint. However the movie does have its flaws but critics like Taran always writes from a BO point of view and hope he gets the shock of his live when Kyon Ki succeeds.

If that is not enough he goes to the extent of conducting unnecessary surgeries on his most hated patients in order to make their living even worse and yet manages to hold his position in the Sanctorium without being checked by anybody. How come this is possible in today's age? Isn't it set a bad example? The Sanctorium is decked up with glass sheets all over so that whenever any patient gets restless a normal thing at such places he can have an easy access to break them one by one. If he gets more restless security guards starts beating him up with sticks. The film has character of a normal girl who when want to play a prank on his lover starts driving a car recklessly on the roads without having any safety regard for pedestrians. Are such people considered normal by any standards? No wonder when she dies she did not evoke any empathy. The character of Kareena Kapoor is surprisingly unconvincing as she did not fight for her love at all. The film is not just bad but is plain unbearable and cruel. In such film you cannot see anything beyond this even if for a change there are some picturesque locations captured vividly by cinematographer Tirru which is a trademark of most of Priyan's films. A couple of melodious songs also uplift the general tone of the film. Lastly if your argument about films still is that of an artistic expression and it should not to be taken seriously as in commercial Hindi films things are shown like that since ages then I am sorry to say indifferent attitude and insensitivity brought this type of apathy and there is no point in arguing further on this. How come then we expect the things to change and to bring the right awareness? The film is rightly condemned by the psychiatrist community. My question to the audience is who should actually be send to asylum for showing such shoddy picture of the homes for mentally challenged ones?".

	schema:reviewBody "There were several problems with this film. But let me just say that I am giving it a 9 out of 10 for the acting. As much as I hate Salman Khan as an actor and person he was good in this role in which he plays a mental patience who isn't really crazy just in denial. He doesn't stereotype the role and that was great! Kareena Kapoor haunts as the doctor who eventually falls in love with him and loses herself in the wake of her love for him. Jackie Shroff and OM Puri round out the cast with strong supporting and impeccable performances as family friend and father of the afore mentioned protagonists respectively. Rimii Sen and Suniel Shetty are also great in friendly appearances but the script was in a world of its own. There was just too much going on for one film!! It was insane! The script was truly insane! I mean in one film the story of the life of Salman Khan and his wife is told the story of Kareena Kapoor and her potential hubby is told the story of the mental patients is told the story of Jackie Schroff is told the story of Salman and Kareena is told I mean it was too much for one film. It was like the editor did not do their job or maybe there was no editor for the film. Like I read in a previous review by another poster and he said that he is surprised the audience did not go mental watching this film and that's so funny but you have to be prepared for this film or you will go insane watching it. BRACE YOURSELF! It's the type of film you would love to hate but just can't find the hate. Salman Khan makes you fall in love with him and Kareena Kapoor gives the most heartbreaking performance of her career second only to her turn in Asoka.".

As soon as Kareena finds about Salman's ludicrous love story Which involves throwing his fiance in a pool and then leaving her and come back to see her dead and in no time at all when he falls down some hill he is normal again? This is an insult to our intelligence! In contrast to the slow beginning the ending of the movie was a rushed 'quick fit' and decide to have a 'tragic' ending by Salman being murdered and Kareena being put into the same mental home. The time it took for all this to happen5 minutes which in a way was good as I could not endure it any longer so if you are thinking about watching this movie go and watch some paint dry instead.

	schema:reviewBody "One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was one of the most deserved Best Picture awarded by the Oscars and still appears compelling to watch on screen. It exposed the harsh realities in the mental hospitals and the horrific treatments the patients receive yet covering the theme with a sweet melodramatic story. Much has been copied in this film but unfortunately the things don't seem to work much in this one due to a poor development of the story and characterization. Much of the story has been manipulated to a regular Indian movie. Few songs and sequences seem to be beautiful. But overall the film suffers from a memorable character. Salman Khan's and Kareena Kapoor's chemistry don't seem to work much in the melodrama. Om Puri Jackie Shroff and Sunil Shetty from a regular camp of Priyadarshan movies look weary. On a whole the film feels a weak adaptation of a genuine movie which could have been better.Rating 2 stars out of 4".

	schema:headline " Kyunki it doesn't involve the viewer totally";
	schema:reviewBody "So this one from Mr. Priyadarshan is not going to make you laugh. The film shot well in the verdurous landscape of The Nilgiris revolves around a sanatorium run by a gruff exarmy doctor Khurana Om Puri who along with his daughter Tanvi Kareena Kapoormanage the place. Anand Salman Khanis the new patient that has been admitted in this sanatorium. He is in this condition because of the shock when he realized that he had accidentally caused his fiance's death by the way of a prank. It also turns that a doctor in the sanatorium Sunil Jackie Shroff is an old acquaintance of this new patient. The movie revolves around how Anand with the efforts of docs Tanvi and Sunil is brought back to his state of normalcy or sanity. But there is a slight twist towards the end which somehow ands up salvaging the otherwise humdrum script. The movie moves pretty sluggishly in the first half. The sequences where Anand is brought to the sanatorium and his subsequent mischiefs the association with the other inmates could have been tightly edited and packed but unfortunately they aren't. Similarly Anand's track with his love Maya Rimi Sen isn't developed strongly so as to involve the average viewer totally. It is only when the viewer begins to feel that the movie is going to come to a predictable end that there is some redemption of sorts by the film maker.Salman Khan's performance is unexceptional. There isn't a major difference in his performance when he is playing an 'insane' person and when he is 'normal'. Kareena Kapoor is good in her role. Om Puri plays the brusque dad cum sanatorium boss very well. Jackie Shroff is very good in his part. Even after all these years he proves that he can deliver the goods with ease. Rimi Sen is only in a brief role but she looked good in it. Sunil Shetty is in a minuscule role. The others like Atul Parchure Arun Bakshi Asrani Manoj Joshi Nagesh Bhosle Javed Khan have supported the main cast well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nice Italian Western with sad atmosphere  marvelous musical score and elements of Greek tragedy about two brothers  CainAbel alike . It deals with an excon Anthony Steffen out of prison and seeks justice and vengeance against his brother who wrongly incarcerated him . His sibling is called Sartana Gianni Garco or Gary Hudson who took this pseudonym based on Gary Cooper and Rock Hudson  a violent bandit dressed in soldier clothes and including the usual poster  Wanted 10.000 dollars  dead or alive . Sartana is a leader of a nasty gang Sieghart Rupp of Fistful of Dollars who carry out blackmails and massacre against various locations as Campos  Wishville and Blackstone . The unsettling and disturbing Sartana supported by the corrupt Judge Waldorf Carlo A'Angelo proceeds his activities at whatever cost  acting as judge  jury and executioner . The film ends in a sentence  Non Odiare Il Tuo Fratello Nel Tuo Cuore  E Non Levanti Contra Al Tuo Sangue  Levitico XIX It is a typical Spaghetti Western including common scenarios  twofisted antiheroes  rapid zooms and strong confrontations full of shots  crossfire and violence . Nice production design shot in Elios studios and Almeria  of course  and adding a peculiar Aztec temple where the villain Sartana lives  in similar style to Requiescant Carlo Lizzani temple . ItaliaYugoslavia actor Gianni Garco or Giovanni Garkovich and the Brazilian Anthony Steffen give their ordinaries performances . Support cast is pretty well  it is filled with familiar faces from Spaghetti such as Sieghardt Rupp  Franco Fantasia  Carlo D'Angelo and Carla Cal as tragic mother . Besides  brief appearances from Sal Borghese and Riccardo Pizzuti . Evocative and thrilling musical score by Michele Lanzeranza in Ennio Morricone wake . Being decently filmed by Colmenar Viejo and La Pedriza  Madrid  Spain and El Lacio  studios Elios Rome  Italy . This Spaghetti Western was decently shot by the Italian professional Albert Cardone . Albert was a prestigious assistant director to popular films as Ben Hur Purple noon Cagliostro  Carmen  Don Camilo  Return of Don Camilo. And shot some films  most of them entertaining Westerns such as   Blood at Sundown  Kidnapping  Il Lungo Giorno Del Massacro  20.000 Dollari Sul  L'ira Di Dio and starred by usual genre stars as Brett Halsey  Gianni Garco  Peter Martell  Wayde Preston  Fernando Sancho and Anthony Steffen . Rating  Better than average 6.510 . Only for Spaghetti Western aficionados . This Mille Dolollari Sul Nero was first movie in which showed up Sartana  but this Sartana has nothing to do with true Sartana who appeared in Se Incontri Sartana Prega Per Tu a Morte1968 by Gianfranco Parolini or Frank Kramer  along with screenwriter Renato Izzo . Here Garco performed an unforgettable role as the Mantello Nero hero  as Sartana is a cunning card player elegantly dressed in black  he looks like a magician Mandrake more than a gunslinger . Parolini gives this character a ghostly style  introducing cynicism and amorality . To be followed by other Sartana his origin name seems to be Satan starred by Garco such as 10.0000 Dollari Per Un Massacro 1967 by Romolo Guerrieri and Per 1000.000 Dollari T'amazzo1967 by Giovanni Fago . Then  Anthony Ascott or Giuliano Carmineo filmed 4 Sartana entries  such as  Soni Sartana Il Vistro Becchino 69  Buon Funerale Amigos  Paga Sartana 70  Sartana arrives70 and Sartana Vendi La Pistola E Comprati La Bara 71 most of them starred George Hilton . Giuliano Carmineo shot with Gianni Garco two similar roles to Sartana as Gli Fumavano Le Colt  Lo Chiamavano Camposanto71 and Lo Chiamavano Spiritu Santo 72 . Subsequently  Sartana was played by William Berger in Sartana in valley of the gold 70 and Peter Lee Lawrence performed A dollar for Sartana71 by Leon Klimovski .".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the aspects of Spaghetti Westerns that most fans take for granted is the element of HUMOR and like Sergio Corbucci's MINNESOTA CLAY here is an example of one without a genuine lighthearted moment in the proceedings. Oh sure the store clerk character is there to get a couple of chuckles but he isn't funny by a long shot and almost every Spaghetti of importance at least has some unintentional comic effect. ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE BLACK is about as funny as breaking your ankle.Johnny Garko and Anthony Steffen play two prodigal son like brothers of a powerful rich matriarch Carla Cal looking like she was ready for MACBETH in some nowhere tumbleweed Hellhole. Steffen is the Good Son and Garko  in a startling rare turn as the villain  is the insane cackling bipolar Bad Seed who sets up his brother for murder to weasel him out of the power structure. And sort of resents having Steffen turn up 10 years later looking to settle the score set things to right and redeem his family's honor even if it kills him. In other words the usual stuff but what makes this entry special is the unceasing overbearing feeling of dread inevitability and hopelessness that slowly builds over the course of the film. One of them is going to end up dead.I won't reveal how it turns out except that my fellow commenter is correct This is the stuff that Shakespeare made 350 years ago  it still works. Steffen and Garko may be the lead actors but the real star is Ernesto Gastaldi's epic screenplay which forgoes the usual breezy comedy that Sergio Leone and company made an integral part of the Spaghetti formula. It's tempting then to label this as a Euro Western a cowboy movie that just happened to be filmed in Spain with an Italian  Spanish cast but there is more going on here. The film is all style and image some of which doesn't work as well as the rest but it's all Spaghetti the only difference being that there is some substance to the plot. It's not just people shooting flies and offing oneliners.Erika Blanc is excellent  still freshfaced as the revenge minded daughter of the man killed a decade before Carlo D'Angelo is appropriately despicable as a duplicitous judge Roberto Miali comes off well as the emotionally scarred basket case spurred to action by the cruelty he sees and good old Franco Fantasia gets to play the sheriff who finds he can't just stand back and watch it happen anymore even though he'd rather. Everyone in the cast is wounded desperate thirsty looking and unable to do anything about the plague of madness that grips the town as Garko's Sartana goes completely to pieces  descends into fits of slavering homicidal insanity between shaking down the local bigwigs for protection payments. This could have been a Mafia movie or a psycho killer cop action flick maybe even a costumer involving a crazed Lord of the land who holds the serfs below him in a grip of terror. The only ones who seem to be able to stop him are his brother  his mother and the only reason he doesn't just kill them is because you can pick your friends but not your family. Blood is thicker than blood.It's Garko and Steffen's show and they have probably never been better  Anthony Steffen's Johnny may have been patterned after Clint Eastwood's Monco character but is far more brooding and regretful. He can take a beating like a man  dish out the cold justice for sure but he'd rather not and if anyone messes with his family they had better make sure he doesn't find out about it. And Johnny Garko's Sartana may be a bit histrionic and over the top but that's exactly what the idiom called for and unlike Gian Marie Volonte's Indio the insane loco weed puffing Pistolero Garko is acting rather than just inflecting behavior on screen. His Sartana is as pained by what he sees himself doing as anybody else. The only difference between he and Johnny is the difference between good  evil and something will have to give.Garko's Sartana is very interesting in particular because in 1968 director Frank Kramer launched a series of Sartana films that were at least as good as anything attributed to the Django movies. Anthony Ascott picked up the reigns and turned the franchise into a series of uproariously excessive cartoons for grownups with Garko's Sartana emerging as a James Bond like hero popping off glib comments  using at times ridiculous contraptions or gimmicks to do his dangerous work. Leave it as saying this is a totally different Sartana that just happens to be played by the same actor which bears no relationship to the later character. Gianni Garko played so many heroes that it's fascinating to see him as a truly evil despicable cretin. The man had the range and this is one of the films which proved such. It deserves to be seen again.The ending is powerful for this kind of stuff. It's worthy of Peckinpah or Bergman and perfectly understated in the ordinary way it's depicted. Good and evil must eventually confront each other but that doesn't mean one will necessarily win. And the way our world is going to Hell the message is still just as poignant forty years later with the film only suffering from an extremely low budget and subsequent clunkiness in handling certain moments. But the rest of it is riveting and in a way heartbreaking and how often can you say that about a Spaghetti Western. Usually they conclude with a twisted morbid little joke or some kind of gag to ensure that the audience at least shuffles out with a smile on their faces. I needed a drink when this one was over.810".

Gino Santini's sumptuous cinematography offers plenty of bold and startling compositions the sweeping panoramic shots of the dusty and desolate desert are especially striking and impressive.

The plotline is still fairly typical for the genre and by the end of this you can't say it doesn't deliver the usual spaghetti goods. Ultimately though it boils down to a tale of two brothers with Anthony Steffen playing good one and Gianni Garko the one who's psychotic.";

Matt Damon is Mike an affable law student with little interest in the law and a passion for high stakes poker.  When he loses his shirt and promises his girl friend cute and perky Gretchen Mol that he will never play poker again you know this piecrust promise will quickly be broken.  And broken it is when Matt picks up his former schoolmate buddy Worm Edward Norton who is getting out of prison and leads him back to the poker table and deep deep into debt and hot water.As usual Matt Damon is adorable as the talented gambler flashing those dimples and that Gary Cooper downturned grin John Malkovich is over the top as cookiemunching Teddy KGB and yes if you're familiar with Russians just off the boat you know they really DO speak like that and have a natural flare for the dramatic Martin Landau delivers another impeccable performance as the aging melancholic law professor whose family expected him to become a rabbi Famke Janssen is nicely understated as the errand girl who has the obvious hots for Matt and John Turtorro puts is solid as Knish the grinder.  Indeed Mr. Turorro is becoming one of the most reliable and dependable supporting players to grace any film in which he appears.  When the time and the role are right his time will come.But the real star of this film is Edward Norton as the lowlife sociopath who bears the appropriate sobriquet Worm. Twenty years ago when I first saw The Onion Field I thought James Wood had created the sleaziest character ever to appear on film.  Jim move over.  Norton is cheap slimy and skinny devoid of scruples and empathy a little wise guy with a big mouth and nothing to back it up. You just KNOW this scumbag neither bathes nor brushes his teeth and when the little rat gets the stuffings beaten out of him by a group of offduty cops whom he has cheated you want to join in and get in a punch.  Women will want to slap him.  In his first scene he lets you know he's a hardhearted louse  told that he is being released from prison in the middle of a pennyante card game with his cell mates who beg him to leave his cigarettes behind he gathers them up and then contemptuously drops them in the dumper on the way out. This is a cockroach with no redeeming social value who lives to use and con and degrade people.It's no trick for an actor to make you love him to make you despise him so much you'd like to throttle him takes real talent. I've seen Ed Norton in Fight Club Primal Fear and The People vs. Larry Flynt and this is one young actor to watch. He's one of those natural actors who can be whatever he wants to be and it will be sheer joy watching him grow and mature.Rounders may be short on originality but it's long on suspense action and entertainment and while not the best flick to come down the pike it's a wonderfully satisfying two hours.  I don't know much about the game of poker but I sure do know a good movie when I see one. I give it an 8 out 10 rating for human interest.".

You have Matt Damon Edward Norton John Malkovich John Turturro Gretchen Mol Famke Janssen Martin Landau and some small roles by Melina Kanakaredes of Providence and Goran Visnjic of ER.  Matt Damon is quite a good actor and this is just another great film to add to his list of already impressive roles.  Edward Norton is fantastic as Worm he plays a truly unlikeable person but at the same time you respect him for taking the fall for his friends.  John Tuturro is excellent as always he has such a cool style about him.  John Malkovich is superb in his portrayal of Teddy KGB.  And the rest of the cast does a great job as well in their respective roles.If you are a poker fan then I recommend you see this film hopefully you'll enjoy it.  I myself am not a huge fan of poker but I do play the occasional game and I loved this film.  I loved the characters the dialogue the acting EVERYTHING.  I truly hope you enjoy the film.

	schema:headline " One of the most under rated films ever!";
	schema:reviewBody "Rounders is nothing short of hypnotic. It is a film that introduced me and many others to the surreal world of poker. High stakes Texas Hold Em winner take all poker. For those unfamiliar with the game not only is this a perfect tutorial to understand the game but this is a movie that will entertain you right to the very end.I like to think that this is just like Rocky. Matt Damon plays Mike McDermott just like Stallone played Rocky. He has all the talent in the world but he needs to find a way to harness it and get the right opportunity. KGB is a little like Appollo Creed and John Tuturro is like Mickey in some ways. But enough of the comparisons of Rocky.What makes Rounders so compelling is the interpersonal relationships in the film no doubt but let's face it what really makes the film as vibrant and energetic as it is is the poker scenes. We are introduced to several games here namely Omaha Omaha Hi Lo 7 Card Stud and of course Texas Hold Em. According to Mike Texas No Limit is the Cadillac of all poker games. He of course got that info from reading books by some of the poker greats such as Phil Helmuth Amarillo Slim and of course The Godfather of poker Doyle Brunson. Great detail is spent on the feel of poker in this film. When you are in the poker rooms you can smell the smoke taste the mustiness of the air and you can feel the emotions that the players feel. It really is a masterful job by Dahl to convey these emotions. And full credit has to be give to the screenwriters to know the lingo to mollify us with terms like flop river rags and bicycle. Rounders helped introduce me to this nefarious world and just like many others before me I am hooked. Rounders can take credit for that.What also must be mentioned here is the performances. Like many of the reviewers before me I was awed by the absolute mastery of these characters by Damon Norton Malkovich Turturro and Landau. My favourite performance is that of John Malkovich. He plays a Russian mobster called KGB. He is a master poker player and in the beginning scene he takes all of Mike's bankroll as he hits a full house on fourth street to cripple Mike's smaller boat. Malkovich is a master. He can play any role and he proves it in spades here. Think of his performance in a film like In The Line of Fire or in Of Mice and Men and this is about as diametric from those roles as you can get. There is not one second in the film when you don't believe that he is a Russian mobster with a propensity for gambling. If this film would have been more recognized back in 98 he could have received an Oscar nomination. He is that good. Matt Damon is really a fine actor and this film while not as known as some of this others is really a layered performance and one of his best. He plays the young prodigal son here with absolute zeal.

	onyx:emotionText "Rounders is nothing short of hypnotic. It is a film that introduced me and many others to the surreal world of poker. High stakes Texas Hold Em winner take all poker. For those unfamiliar with the game not only is this a perfect tutorial to understand the game but this is a movie that will entertain you right to the very end.I like to think that this is just like Rocky. Matt Damon plays Mike McDermott just like Stallone played Rocky. He has all the talent in the world but he needs to find a way to harness it and get the right opportunity. KGB is a little like Appollo Creed and John Tuturro is like Mickey in some ways. But enough of the comparisons of Rocky.What makes Rounders so compelling is the interpersonal relationships in the film no doubt but let's face it what really makes the film as vibrant and energetic as it is is the poker scenes. We are introduced to several games here namely Omaha Omaha Hi Lo 7 Card Stud and of course Texas Hold Em. According to Mike Texas No Limit is the Cadillac of all poker games. He of course got that info from reading books by some of the poker greats such as Phil Helmuth Amarillo Slim and of course The Godfather of poker Doyle Brunson. Great detail is spent on the feel of poker in this film. When you are in the poker rooms you can smell the smoke taste the mustiness of the air and you can feel the emotions that the players feel. It really is a masterful job by Dahl to convey these emotions. And full credit has to be give to the screenwriters to know the lingo to mollify us with terms like flop river rags and bicycle. Rounders helped introduce me to this nefarious world and just like many others before me I am hooked. Rounders can take credit for that.What also must be mentioned here is the performances. Like many of the reviewers before me I was awed by the absolute mastery of these characters by Damon Norton Malkovich Turturro and Landau. My favourite performance is that of John Malkovich. He plays a Russian mobster called KGB. He is a master poker player and in the beginning scene he takes all of Mike's bankroll as he hits a full house on fourth street to cripple Mike's smaller boat. Malkovich is a master. He can play any role and he proves it in spades here. Think of his performance in a film like In The Line of Fire or in Of Mice and Men and this is about as diametric from those roles as you can get. There is not one second in the film when you don't believe that he is a Russian mobster with a propensity for gambling. If this film would have been more recognized back in 98 he could have received an Oscar nomination. He is that good. Matt Damon is really a fine actor and this film while not as known as some of this others is really a layered performance and one of his best. He plays the young prodigal son here with absolute zeal. Damon has to be one of the best actors working today and seeing as this was one of his first performances after Good Will Hunting you have to give him that much more credit for taking on such an esoteric role. Kudos to him.Rounders has grown in reputation over the years to the point where a special edition DVD with the likes of Helmuth Johnny Chan Chris Jesus Ferguson and 2003 WSOP champion Chris Moneymaker providing some excellent and enlightening commentary on the track.

So when I watched it on DVD I was pleasantly surprised how engaging a film it is.I am not a gambler so maybe that is part of why I found it so fascinating. Basic story  Damon's character is a 2nd yr law student in NYC and a good enough poker player that he has aspirations of entering and winning the milliondollar prize in the world series of poker in Lasvegas. However Ed Norton plays his good buddy just getting out of prison. Norton's character is also a poker player but also incorporates cheating because that just helps you make money faster. This approach gets both of them in some pretty hot water and also deep in debt!!Damon's character has a S.O. played by Gretchen Mol. Her distaste for gambling puts a great strain on their relationship. Will she stay or will she move out??And finally John Malkovich does a wonderful job as the Russian gambler nicknamed KGB. John Turturro is perfectly cast as Damon's friend and street advisor. I simply found myself caught up in this story anticipating the next poker game wondering if they would all get whacked or survive. Plus Matt Damon has such a relaxed acting style with that great smile of his which makes all of his movies easy to watch.I rate this one 8 of 10 for the welldone gambling drama depicted here.".

That makes for a pretty good movie if not a very accurate reality. It isn't quite enough to keep two hours going however and so the big picture here is to enjoy what it has.A quick comparison might be made to The Hustler and related pool shark movies. And like that classic Rounders is about charming deceit. Matt Damon is the main man here an expoker champ who has gone straight until his former partner in crime Ed Norton gets out of jail and ropes him back into the thrills and malevolence. Like the pool movies and like the glitzier and more ambitious Oceans movies personalities matter most. The setting the glint of money and most of all the plots matter less than you'd think.So everything is pretty good along those lines partly because Damon is fun to be with and Norton is simply terrific. An embarrassing appearance in the beginning and end of the movie by an overacting John Malkovich gets in the way of Damon's performance however. And the general attempt at creating a bunch of bad guys behind the scenes is filled with thin clichs and mediocre acting. This is the result of having to make more of the story that was ever there. The main ideathat the two leads get into money trouble and have to earn a ton of cash in a few days of wild poker gamesis eventually actually a bit of a bore. The gamesmanship is always interesting of course but the impetus behind it grows old. The addition of Martin Landau as a Jewish lawyer who gives Damon a mitzvah as a kind of honor paid to continue a favor once given him is a touching part of the larger plot making you wish there was more of this somehow more of something genuine and a bit different.It might not have helped that I recently saw Croupier with a young Clive Owen as a poker dealer because that movie whatever its simplicity and other limitations actually made the poker scenes more real for me. In fact one problem with Rounders is you never get to actually sense the betting itself and the cardsthe playing and the strategies of playingare glossed over with some tossing of chips and flipping of cards all in a vague muddle.I did enjoy watching overall but it left me a little disappointed and restless.".

Turturro Norton and Landau are fine actors who do well. Damon is a secondrater but he does his best work here. I think that is a matter of casting  the film is a reinvented Will Hunting' and Damon is cast as someone who doesn't know how to act.On the other hand in the service of setting a noir tone the women here are treated not as characters but as elements in the background of life that real people' stumble through. This is as cheap as using voyeuristic nudity and equally offensive.The thing that struck me was how lazy was the writer how closely he followed the Will Hunting' scaffold.In both we end with a sympathetic young prodigy leaving town and a misspent life to fulfill his real genius. What makes this better is that Will was about math genius and never showed an understanding of the magic and pain that accompanies that world. Here it is a slightly different type of genius softer but more obsessive. Although Oscar and Lucinda' did a deeper job we do get a feel for what is involved and how obsession necessarily follows and this is no Grifters.'In Will we had three men who interact with Will to braid the story a longtime childhood friend a highlevel professor and an advisor who triggers the story. One tempts the hero into an unhealthy expression of his gift one prompts him to follow his heart' by giving a very personal and tragic story and one provides nearly unqualified and admiring support. In this film we have the same three types with the roles shifted. The writer's simple musical chairs.Will Hunting' was an excrescence. This is better because of the talent of those three actors and because the director wisely targets the tragic dark pull of the obsession. But the film doesn't deliver.".

This is as cheap as using voyeuristic nudity and equally offensive.The thing that struck me was how lazy was the writer how closely he followed the Will Hunting' scaffold.In both we end with a sympathetic young prodigy leaving town and a misspent life to fulfill his real genius. What makes this better is that Will was about math genius and never showed an understanding of the magic and pain that accompanies that world. Here it is a slightly different type of genius softer but more obsessive. Although Oscar and Lucinda' did a deeper job we do get a feel for what is involved and how obsession necessarily follows and this is no Grifters.'In Will we had three men who interact with Will to braid the story a longtime childhood friend a highlevel professor and an advisor who triggers the story. One tempts the hero into an unhealthy expression of his gift one prompts him to follow his heart' by giving a very personal and tragic story and one provides nearly unqualified and admiring support. In this film we have the same three types with the roles shifted. The writer's simple musical chairs.Will Hunting' was an excrescence. This is better because of the talent of those three actors and because the director wisely targets the tragic dark pull of the obsession. But the film doesn't deliver.";

And that's what this film is lacking.The film's strong points are terrific characters brought to life by Edward Norton and John Turturro.  These very different poker pros don't meet in this film but they both tug on Damon's character is different directions Turturro encourages Damon to play it safe Norton encourages Damon to risk and cheat.  What an interesting film it would have been if it had been a drama focusing on these three characters and the resulting struggle within Damon.  Rather this film is about Damon's circle from gambling law student to giving up gambling and then giving up law to become a gambler.  And the movie portrays this in a good light.  He's the hero because he follows his dream to gamble.  What?  Damon and the other stars give halfbaked phonedin performances excepting Norton and Turturro.The script is also defective.  Some things just don't make sense.  Damon and Norton are severely beaten after they are caught cheating in a game which made sense  I thought the film was taking a better direction at that point but then they argue about it and Norton's character is suddenly absent from the rest of the movie.  Oops?  Did the writers forget this character?  Martin Landau's law professor character gives Damon 10000 to help pay off his friend's debt.  Really?  Don't we all wish we had teachers like this?  Damon's girlfriend leaves him because he lies to her about one game AFTER ABSTAINING FROM GAMBLING FOR NINE MONTHS!!  Is she perfect?  Is this how a rational human being would react?  Lying is a terrible thing but most real life relationships go through much worse than one lie  and still survive.The bottom line is that all the losers stay losers and no one learns anything.  But the movie doesn't play it that way  it portrays Damon as a hero and that gambling is a profession not an addiction.  And unless you are a card player andor familiar with pro poker jargon a good portion is likely to lose you and bore you.  Skip this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Rounders is no big deal.Starring Matt Damon Edward Norton and John Malkovich this savvy but soporific saga about highstakes poker seethes with classy acting and authentic atmosphere. Sadly where drama calls on the plot to pay off Rounders cashes in its chips. Unfortunately this lowkey pretentious potboiler never turns up the heat or the hustle. Coming from a gifted director like John Dahl Rounders qualifies as a major bust. Dahl and freshman screenwriters David the 2004 Walking Tall remake Levien and Brian Ocean's Thirteen Koppelman develop secondary characters and settings with greater vibrancy than either their hero or his predicament. But even the secondary characters suffer. They register with greater screen presence but less screen time. Evidently Miramax tamper with the film. Characters enter and exit without explanation and the plot comes and goes in fits and starts. Not only does Rounders ante up only intermittent moments of suspense sex and romance the filmmakers also never must enough momentum to keep the story from stalling out when the action should be steaming ahead.Rounders are card sharps. Mike McDermott Matt Damon of Good Will Hunting is a streetwise young stud working his way through law school with gambling addiction. The movie opens with dramatic potential as he loses 30thousand dollars of his hardearned savings to a creepy Russian gambler Teddy KGD John Malkovich of Of Mice and Men in a tense poker match. Mike's fellow law student and livein squeeze Jo Gretchen Mol of  Girl 6 persuades him to reform. Earning his bucks as a lowly route salesman holds little appeal for Mike. Mike has poker in his blood. Late one evening when he stops by to visit his law school dean Professor Abe Petrosvky Oscar winner Martin Landau of Ed Wood he catches them playing a friendly game of lowstakes cards. Mike doesn't have time to examine their hands to know what they're holding. Instead he can read their faces. If you can't spot the sucker in your first halfhour at the table Mike explains dazzling Abe and his colleagues with his extraordinary skills you are the sucker.Mike is a prodigy at poker. Nevertheless he lets his more legitimate statusquo ambitions of getting a law degree interfere with his first lovepoker. Like life Rounders concerns choices. The more that Mike thinks about it the more that he prefers poker. His blond girlfriend Jo struggles to keep him focused on his legal studies but neither her love nor her sexuality can overwhelm the thrill that Mike derives from gambling. If you look hard enough Rounders shares some literary similarities with the classic American novel Huckleberry Finn. Like the carefree irresponsible Huck who runs off to the river Mike knows that he shouldn't be gambling. Jo imitates the Widow as she struggles futilely to break him of his poker addiction. Rounders takes place in the shady gambling dens of the Big Apple. These hidden lairs lure Mike with the same potency that the river seduced Huck. Unlike Huckleberry Finn however Rounder doesn't qualify as a classic.On the other hand Mike doesn't have the reliable friend that Huck had in runaway slave Jim. Instead Mike has Les Murphy Edward Norton of American X at his sleazy best. Aptly nicknamed 'Worm' Les is just as illbehaved as the couple of conartists that hitched a ride with Huck on his raft down the river. Worm gets out of prison no long after Rounders unfolds. Mike and Worm had a scam going a couple of years back when their luck eroded. Worm shut his trap took the rap and did the time. Now Mike feels indebted to his old scummy buddy. Worm has no qualms. He cheats everybody Mike included and never blinks. Eventually Jo moves out when she learns that Mike is bluffing her again.Now not only does Mike find himself saddled with Worm's staggering 25thousand dollar debt but also Worm's unsavory adversaries harass him. Things worsen when Mike finds out that Grama Michael Rispoli of The Weather Man a vicious thug who pimps for KGB has brought up Worm note. Grama threatens to smash Worm's arms and legs if he doesn't fork over the fund in 48 hours. Mike and Worm hit the road in search of suckers. Refusing to let Worm win by cheating Mike vows to get their bucks solely on the strength of his gambling genius. Things are looking up and Mike is winning hand after hand from a bunch of cops when the incorrigible Worm shows up and spoils everything. The cops catch Worm dealing off the bottom of the deck. Confiscating all their dough the boysinblue beat them black and blue. Rather than face an even worse beating from Grama Worm leaves Mike in the lurch.Nobody gives a bad performance in Rounders. Matt Damon evokes more sympathy here than he did in Good Will Hunting. Indeed these two Damon characters share similarities. They both display genius in their calling. Mike either wins or loses by knowing facial tick of his opponents. The filmmakers beef up Mike's charisma by letting him provide narration. Mike's character suffers his biggest drawback from passivity. The writers don't give Mike much spunk. Matt Damon breathes life into a pretty colorless character. The scenarists stretch credibility when Mike allows Worm to use him. Something is missing. For all the card sense that he possesses Mike shows little common sense.Good movies require a beginning middle and an ending. Rounders bogs down in the middle. The movie starts well but stalls out early. The story digresses and wander off onto lateral concerns. Rounders doesn't end with a bang but folds without a sight of hope. Ultimately Rounders lacks both the psychological tension and depth of the 1974 James Caan movie The Gambler about a compulsive gambler in the selfdestructive those of a wagering addiction. Moreover Rounders never mobilizes the competitive spirit of the classic Steve McQueen poker parable The Cincinnati Kid.".

The more that Mike thinks about it the more that he prefers poker. His blond girlfriend Jo struggles to keep him focused on his legal studies but neither her love nor her sexuality can overwhelm the thrill that Mike derives from gambling. If you look hard enough Rounders shares some literary similarities with the classic American novel Huckleberry Finn. Like the carefree irresponsible Huck who runs off to the river Mike knows that he shouldn't be gambling. Jo imitates the Widow as she struggles futilely to break him of his poker addiction. Rounders takes place in the shady gambling dens of the Big Apple. These hidden lairs lure Mike with the same potency that the river seduced Huck. Unlike Huckleberry Finn however Rounder doesn't qualify as a classic.On the other hand Mike doesn't have the reliable friend that Huck had in runaway slave Jim. Instead Mike has Les Murphy Edward Norton of American X at his sleazy best. Aptly nicknamed 'Worm' Les is just as illbehaved as the couple of conartists that hitched a ride with Huck on his raft down the river. Worm gets out of prison no long after Rounders unfolds. Mike and Worm had a scam going a couple of years back when their luck eroded. Worm shut his trap took the rap and did the time. Now Mike feels indebted to his old scummy buddy. Worm has no qualms. He cheats everybody Mike included and never blinks. Eventually Jo moves out when she learns that Mike is bluffing her again.Now not only does Mike find himself saddled with Worm's staggering 25thousand dollar debt but also Worm's unsavory adversaries harass him. Things worsen when Mike finds out that Grama Michael Rispoli of The Weather Man a vicious thug who pimps for KGB has brought up Worm note. Grama threatens to smash Worm's arms and legs if he doesn't fork over the fund in 48 hours. Mike and Worm hit the road in search of suckers. Refusing to let Worm win by cheating Mike vows to get their bucks solely on the strength of his gambling genius. Things are looking up and Mike is winning hand after hand from a bunch of cops when the incorrigible Worm shows up and spoils everything. The cops catch Worm dealing off the bottom of the deck. Confiscating all their dough the boysinblue beat them black and blue. Rather than face an even worse beating from Grama Worm leaves Mike in the lurch.Nobody gives a bad performance in Rounders. Matt Damon evokes more sympathy here than he did in Good Will Hunting. Indeed these two Damon characters share similarities. They both display genius in their calling. Mike either wins or loses by knowing facial tick of his opponents. The filmmakers beef up Mike's charisma by letting him provide narration. Mike's character suffers his biggest drawback from passivity. The writers don't give Mike much spunk. Matt Damon breathes life into a pretty colorless character. The scenarists stretch credibility when Mike allows Worm to use him. Something is missing. For all the card sense that he possesses Mike shows little common sense.Good movies require a beginning middle and an ending. Rounders bogs down in the middle. The movie starts well but stalls out early. The story digresses and wander off onto lateral concerns. Rounders doesn't end with a bang but folds without a sight of hope. Ultimately Rounders lacks both the psychological tension and depth of the 1974 James Caan movie The Gambler about a compulsive gambler in the selfdestructive those of a wagering addiction. Moreover Rounders never mobilizes the competitive spirit of the classic Steve McQueen poker parable The Cincinnati Kid.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rounders is directed by John Dahl and written by David Levien  Brian Koppelman. It stars Matt Damon Edward Norton John Turturro John Malkovich Gretchen Mol Famke Janssen  Martin Landau. Music is by Christopher Young and JeanYves Escoffier is the cinematographer on location in New York  New Jersey. Film is based around the underground world of high stakes poker. Plot sees Poker playing law student Mike McDermott Damon team up with his Poker playing excon best friend Lester Worm Murphy Norton to try and raise some serious cash. The cash is needed because Worm has saddled them both with high debts the sort of debts that can get you killed.In the years since Rounders was released to mixed reviews and a Luke warm box office Poker has really taken off to become a hugely popular television staple. So it's perhaps no surprise to learn that John Dahl's Poker based movie has gained a cult following. It's also found momentum due to a number of pro Poker players citing it as either the reason they got into Poker playing or that it's the best Poker movie ever. High praise indeed then. Yet for someone like me who doesn't play the game but most assuredly loves a good sports movie the film has too much wrong with it to deserve such plaudits.First off is Damon a fine actor but not in this role. He never once convinces that he needs to play Poker let alone play himself into a life and death struggle due to his borderline volatile best friend. He looks and seems out of place throughout his boyish charm undercuts what little tension there actually is. While his relationship with Norton turning in a good show is never interesting or spiky enough to form a solid core from which the film can grow. Dahl merely uses their relationship as intermittent fillers as we jump from one Poker table to the next. Cue one moment when Mike's girl Mol barely getting time to breath let alone act who shock shock hates cards leaves him a period of refection for a moment a life is cards summary and bingo lets go play cards! I'd have laughed if it wasn't so insulting.What is totally humorous is Malkovich who after promising much in the beginning as brooding Russian gangster Teddy KGB descends into pantomime farce for the supposed nail biting finale. His accent so ludicrous you wonder if you have been whisked into a HannaBarbera cartoon whilst you sneaked a peak at your cards. There's also no surprise with the outcome. Poker may be a sport not often filmed on the big screen but this is a traditional sports movie across the table. Janssen as yummy as ever threatens to be a great teasing character but isn't given anything to get her teeth into which when one considers the director likes his peccadilloes to be film noirish is a surprise. And Landau too is given lightweight fluff to work from as a kindly professor type who seems more token than earnest.On the plus side. Escoffier's photography is neat and on the money particularly for the first quarter as we go into seedy card dens that are dimly lit and tinted by cigar smoke. While Young's score is unobtrusive and deserving of a better film to accompany it. Away from the seemingly always watchable Norton it's Turturro who comes out the brightest with his non histrionic and believable portrayal of Joey Knish. A sensible and honest character in a film that lacks enough of either of those traits. Utterly predictable and smug into the bargain Rounders it seems is for Poker players only. 410".

However his dreams are shattered when he is accused of a triple murder and is convicted to three naturallife terms. Despite becoming a cause celebre and his dogged efforts to prove his innocence through his autobiography the years of fruitless efforts have left him discouraged. This changes when an AfricanAmerican boy and his Canadian mentors read his book and are convinced of his innocence enough to work for his exoneration. However what Hurricane and his friends learn is that this fight puts them against a racist establishment that profited from this travesty and have no intention of seeing it reversed.";

I waited for the video for this movie because a movie about boxing didn't seem interesting. But that's just the thing. It's not about boxing. So if you're thinking you're going to see Raging Bull you're not. There are a few boxing scenes but they only serve to move the story along.I have seen this movie more than once. The first time I was touched by the underlying theme of the movie which was in my opinion love conquering hate and injustice. Then I watched it again. I realized Denzel did a superb job. It WAS NOT a typical Denzel role. He convincingly played Rubin Hurricane Carter raised full of hate for and distrust of white people. When he goes to prison for the murder he does an excellent performance showing the different personalities in his head as well as showing how his inner spiritual journey transformed him. Any good movie shows the hero growing and changing. And Denzel again does this well towards the end of the movie after befriending Lazarus and the Canadians. My favorite line which to me sums up the entire movie is when they're waiting to hear the judge's verdict and Rubin tells Lazarus Hate got me in here. But love's gonna bust me out.I don't know much about the real Rubin Carter or the details of the case. What I found compelling about the movie was the fact that some people  be they white or black  can harbor such hatred for another person I'm referring to Della Pesca's hatred toward Rubin. Another thing that got me was the friendship and love between Rubin and Lesra and the whole message of examining the higher principle of truth for which the law was meant to serve. It's just one of those movies that makes you think. Yeah some of the writing is just OK in places but the theme of the movie is wonderful and I think Denzel gave an Oscar worthy performance.I gave this a 9 out of 10.".

It's one of those standupandcheer movies where everyone seems to be against the hero but above all odds and with more than a little help from some of his friends he rises above The System and gets his belated due.  It's an oftused scenario with many scenes that could easily have been taken from Jewison's other films A SOLDIER'S STORY or IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT.  Yet despite the familiarity of the storyline I'll be damned if I wasn't choking back tears of elation at the movie's triumphant conclusion.  It's a masterful piece of filmmaking that proves Norman Jewison's skill as a director as he transcends the clichebound script and with the help of Washington and company makes it a powerful entity all its own.As the Hurricane Denzel Washington proves he is one of the best actors if not THE best in the business today.  He can run the gamut from cold hatred to hearty laughter like few others can. He brings dignity and class to every one of his pictures he was the only thing worth watching in THE BONE COLLECTOR.  Here he makes you FEEL every single thing he's feeling.  In times of righteous indignation you feel morally outraged alongside him.  When he's at his most vulnerable you can feel your throat constricting and your eyes watering.  He has an uncanny knack for reaching into your soul and making you part of the picture itself it's almost as if he's channelling the viewer while acting.  Other actors delight in wowing the audience with grand theatrics and histrionics but neglect to make the audience care Denzel is usually softspoken and lowkey but always holds your attention.In summary THE HURRICANE was one of the most exhilarating motion picture experiences I've had all year.  Norman Jewison directs with a deft surehandedness reminiscent of his late 1960searly 1970s glory years Denzel Washington delivers perhaps the most aweinspiring performance of the year and the audience goes home happy and feeling good about themselves and the world.

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw this movie I heard all the hype and I heard how people said that Denzel deserved the Oscar alongside his Golden Globe and I believed he must have done an outstanding job considering Kevin Spacey was excellent.  I was wrong.  I realize that people say this not to anger the African American community if they are not African Americans themselves.  I always hear complaints on how African Americans are never nominated and how they should have won.  Sometimes this is true not as much nowadays because Whoppi Goldberg should have won best actress for The Color Purple and the movie should have won best picture.  The only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was is because people see a movie about the SEMISPOILER hardships of an African American during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.Denzel Washington is an outstanding actor but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever.  I was bored with him in the movie and his acting here was quite similar to his role in Malcolm X but not as good. The audience is supposed to leave believing this man Rubin Carter is a saint. People left the movies worshipping this man this hero and they went out and bought his book making this hero of a man rich.SPOILERS This movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit.  Of course the crimes he did commit stealing mostly was only to survive nothing more.  People felt sorry for him even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society. Everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife but why wouldn't itafter all it is his point of view.  I do not like movies especially Hollywood interpretations that are based on true stories because they usually distort the true parts into something else something not so true.  This was his point of view and a Hollywood construction yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably.  Well I researched his past a bit before making any assumptions and he was a very violent man.  Not only that there is still a possibility that he did murder those people.  If you do not believe me search for him on the internet and read the articles some people have of him.  The boxing match he claimed to have won so easily was actually won by his opponent Joey Giardello and there are tapes to prove it.  Besides that there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie.  The supporting cast were the nicest people I have ever seen on the face of the Earth and their nice and perfect persona looked difficult to keep up.This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully.  Denzel's acting is stale and the supporting cast's Mickey Mouse attitudes are annoying.  The movie also begins very slow paced and is boring.".

	onyx:emotionText "When I saw this movie I heard all the hype and I heard how people said that Denzel deserved the Oscar alongside his Golden Globe and I believed he must have done an outstanding job considering Kevin Spacey was excellent.  I was wrong.  I realize that people say this not to anger the African American community if they are not African Americans themselves.  I always hear complaints on how African Americans are never nominated and how they should have won.  Sometimes this is true not as much nowadays because Whoppi Goldberg should have won best actress for The Color Purple and the movie should have won best picture.  The only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was is because people see a movie about the SEMISPOILER hardships of an African American during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.Denzel Washington is an outstanding actor but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever.  I was bored with him in the movie and his acting here was quite similar to his role in Malcolm X but not as good. The audience is supposed to leave believing this man Rubin Carter is a saint. People left the movies worshipping this man this hero and they went out and bought his book making this hero of a man rich.SPOILERS This movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit.  Of course the crimes he did commit stealing mostly was only to survive nothing more.  People felt sorry for him even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society. Everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife but why wouldn't itafter all it is his point of view.  I do not like movies especially Hollywood interpretations that are based on true stories because they usually distort the true parts into something else something not so true.  This was his point of view and a Hollywood construction yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably.  Well I researched his past a bit before making any assumptions and he was a very violent man.  Not only that there is still a possibility that he did murder those people.  If you do not believe me search for him on the internet and read the articles some people have of him.  The boxing match he claimed to have won so easily was actually won by his opponent Joey Giardello and there are tapes to prove it.  Besides that there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie.  The supporting cast were the nicest people I have ever seen on the face of the Earth and their nice and perfect persona looked difficult to keep up.This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully.  Denzel's acting is stale and the supporting cast's Mickey Mouse attitudes are annoying.  The movie also begins very slow paced and is boring.";

First of all I'm still not sure if Carter and Artis committed these murders but there seems to be a lot of documents and articles which proves they did. I'm not going to go to details here but check out for starters www.graphicwitness.comcarter if you are interested. One example In movie Carter is sent to jail as a boy for stabbing a man implied to be a pedophile. In reality he stabbed somebody in the face with a beer bottle while robbing them.One thing I don't understand is why they changed the facts so much in this movie and still this was marketed as based on true story. This might have been a good movie if they'd just make it completely fictional but probably it wouldn't have sold as much. The championship fight scene seems also to be completely wrong from the Herald Sun The Hurricane typically claims racist boxing judges robbed him but every sportswriter who covered the fight agreed he was beaten by a better man. On the other hand if they'd make this movie true to the facts imo this movie would have been much more interesting.I think it's a shame that Hollywood takes out a tragedy where 4 people were murdered and makes a disgrace towards them and their grieving friends and families by twisting the truth to make this movie better selling and getting more profit. All in all if ignoring this the movie was pretty ok although a bit too long there was many scenes that could have been cut out and some characters were just plain ridiculous Canadians and of course Lt. Vincent Della Pesca who was almost the opposite of the real detective. Denzel was good maybe not Oscar nomineegood but isn't the Oscars usually awarded to those who make most money not those who have the most talent One more quote from Herald Sun By ANDREW BOLTOf course it's quite possible Carter is innocent. But is he still the right man to preach to us about reconciliation? While on bail for his second trial he beat Carolyn Kelley the black head of his Carter Defence Fund so badly that she took a month to recover.

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with this movie is summed up in the very first scene where Rubin  Hurricane  Carter fights Emile Griffith for the world welterweight championship in 1963 . You might be surprised when I point out that Carter never fought Griffith for a world championship in 1963 though he did fight for the middlewight championship a year later against champion Joey Giardello who beat him on points with plenty to spare . You might also be shocked to know that Carter was never in fact much more than an average fighter who was well past his prime when arrested for murder so why this movie is making out that Rubin Carter would have been a boxing great if it wasn't for being WRONGLY convicted of murder I have no idea . At the very best Carter was a very mediocre journeyman fighter at best . Robinson  Hagler  Ali or Hearns he was not Oh yes he was WRONGLY convicted of murder and just to lay it on with a trowel a very early scene has the sadistic warder from THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION telling the wronged but noble Rubin to keep calm because he knows a cruel injustice has been done but there's nothing he can do to help . Meekly Rubin forgives his captor because that's who Rubin is  A noble forgiving paragon of humility  we're only three scenes into this movie and we're weeping tears for the guy  in fact you have to wonder why such a great guy was ever convicted of murder when he was a decorated war hero with a chest full of medals and we don't have to wait too long because it transpires that the cops are racist . We know they're racist because the arresting officer states  Your black ass is going down   but that doesn't worry Rubin because he defiantly replies  I know I'm innocent  and he is  such a pity that the twelve jurors were all white and all racist and decided he was guilty simply because he was black . Thankfully justice is served though be it belatedly when a bunch of Canadians expose this terrible miscarriage of justice and Rubin is set free . Despite having his best years taken away from him Rubin bares no hatred towards the people who set him up . Compared to Rubin Carter Jesus Christ was a bitter and twisted man . It makes Washington's performance as Steve Biko in CRY FREEDOM look like an amateur performance in a school play . Or so we're led to believe This film is a total disgrace . It doesn't play hard and fast with the facts because there's little in the way of facts . As I pointed out he was never a contender for a world title so forget all the boxing scenes that suggest he was . You can also forget all about the racist arresting officer investigating the murder case because he's a composite character that includes at least one black detective so racism wasn't at the heart of the case . Rubin Carter was dishonourably charged from the army and never had a distinguished military career  the jurors in the case included two blacks and he was found guilty by a unanimous decision so having  a black ass  wasn't a motive for finding him guilty  he was finally released on a technicality not because he was innocent and there's umpteen other revisionist aspects to the story . If you read the FACTS  Something the producers of this movie clearly haven't done  of the Carter case you might not think he's guilty but you'll instantly realise that this story is entirely fictional . It's Hollywood rewriting history in the worst possible way . Okay there's an opening disclaimer pointing out that some of the characters are composites and some scenes are dramatized but people with no prior knowledge of the facts won't realise just how disgraceful this film is at changing facts into something entirely different I have awarded THE HURRICANE three out of ten and it would have got even less if it wasn't for the good performances and some technical achievements in editing and cinematography".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hurricane as emotionally gripping as the film is is an outright a lie and a complete fabrication of the real events and occurrences that took place on that fateful night in Patterson New Jersey. First off I believe it is the job of a responsible filmmaker and a storyteller to educate the public not mislead them and purposely cover up the true facts and evidence as Norman Jewison has in his film. I too was caught up in the Rubin Carter hysteria upon seeing this film in fact I loved this film but I dug a little deeper and what I found was both shocking and disgraceful. Dramatic license is one thing but to falsify and ignore so many details pertaining to this case is unforgivable and deceptive. Here are some true facts of the Rubin Carter case which somehow didn't make the final cut of the film. I wonder why for those who are interested here are just some of the many facts.Racist pig cop never existed.  Both Bello and Patty Valentine identified Carters car less than an hour after the crime.  The Police did not stop Carter and Artis because they were black as the film would have you believe. They were rounded up because their car matched the description of the killer's getaway car. At first just 14 blocks from the murder scene the cops let them go. When the same two cops got a description of the getaway car they immediately recognized it as Carters car and were in pursuit.  When police searched Carter's car shortly after the murders they found a live shotgun shell and a live .32 caliber bullet rolling around inside. The live rounds are significant because they fit the murder weapons and were found long before the caliber of the handgun used in the crime was determined.  No conspiracy was needed to frame Carter. On the day of the murders Bello told a friend Rubin Carter shot up the whole bar. Months later he voluntarily and reluctantly names Carter as one of the two killers in two police interviews. Three days after Bello talked Bradley was interviewed confirming Bello's story while he was incarcerated in a reformatory 75 miles away. Bello names Carter again in a taperecorded interview falsely depicted in the film. In actual fact Bello had already talked and didn't know he was being taped while Bradley was nowhere near the place.  In jail awaiting his first trial Rubin Carter writes to his main alibi witness and tells her the story I want you to remember. He runs through the alibi story point by point.  Contrary to the film Rubin Hurricane Carter failed a lie detector test just hours after the Lafayette Grill triple murder in 1966 according to the man who gave him the test John J. McGuire a former police polygraph examiner. McGuire said the results showed that Carter lied when he denied being involved in the crime. He refused to take a second test. Artis also failed his lie detector test.  On the 8376 the Prosecutor told Carter Pass a lie test and go free. Carter refused.  There was never any attempt to falsify the time of the murders and no evidence to claim it.  Hurricane Carter and his coaccused John Artis have never been found not guilty of the Lafayette Grill Murders. They were twice convicted and twice the convictions were setaside on the grounds that they didn't get a fair trial. The State of New Jersey decided not to retry them a third time because so much time had passed and withdrew the indictments against them.What a disgrace of a film. What an outright lie I can't believe they got away with this propaganda.".

I have done some research and there are some facts you need to be aware of. First of all Carter had an extensive criminal record he was 29 years old when arrested for the Lafayette murders and had spent 11 of those years in confinement of some sort! The film shows him as a child rescuing a friend from a child molester and then stabbing him in self defense! Wrong! Carter actually beat a defenseless man over the head and stole his watch. He was always getting in trouble for fighting and beating up people that was why he was sent to juvenile hall. He escaped in 1954 and spent two years in the Army he was dismissed for unfitness after four court martials. He then went to jail for four years for assaulting and robbing three people. This film makes it look like he was pursued by a Javeatlike bigoted detective named Della Pesca who set him up for the murders. There was no such person. Vincent De Simone was the real detective assigned to the case. According to all accounts he was a very nice man and an outstanding police officer who was not a racist or had anything against Carter. Also contrary to what this film would have you believe Carter was not unfairly robbed when he lost a decision when he fought for the title. Carter himself admitted this in an interview. Bob Dylans song The Hurricane said they put him in a prison cell but he could have been the champion of the world. Carter lost eight of his last fifteen fights and wasn't even rated when he was arrested. In a 1964 Saturday Evening Post article Carter talked about going up to Watts and shooting cops I could get about four or five. He owned an extensive gun collection and was feared by the people in Paterson. Is it any wonder he was considered a suspect! Like I said this is a good film but its just not true.".

Well first off it wasn't because the acting was bad by any means he gives a very strong performance which is why he was nominated to begin with. So why the Oscar went somewhere else was because of the distortion of the events this movie was based on. Lets start with the main man himself the movie depicts Ruben Carter as a noble person who was the victim of racism and injustice were as the real Carter was an unstable violent character with an extensive criminal record. Now the events the movie got wrong Carter did not stab a child molester as a juvenile it was assault and robbery. Carter was dishonourably discharged from the army and declared unfit for service he was not the highly decorated solider depicted here. Carter was not robbed of the middleweight crown Joey Giardello won the fight fairly even Carter himself admitted this. Carter's boxing career was in decline at the time of his arrest he was not about to challenge for the title. The main detective was not the foul mouthed racist who was obsessed with getting Carter in reality he never met Carter before the murders he rarely swore and was a sensitive individual due to a facial wound received during WW2 he couldn't have been present at the Federal Court hearing he died years before. The Canadians did not find new evidence neither did anyone else and nobody tampered with their car. Carter WAS tried by an all white jury in his first trial but the second jury had two black members. I could go on and on about what the movie got wrong but there isn't enough space this movie butchers so many facts and ruins the reputations of people some of whom are not around to defend themselves. As I said before it's not a bad movie to be sure however this is not a true telling of the story by all means watch it but don't accept of what you see as fact.".

	schema:reviewBody "Framed by a white cop for a murder he didn't commit boxer Ruben 'Hurricane' Carter tries to free himself from the constrains of his cell mentally by studying picking over his case and writing his autobiography. Seven years later Carter is still in prison with appeal after appeal being turned down but his book has found its way into the hands a young student Lesra who is inspired to study by the lessons in his book. As the two get to know one another through letters and meetings Lesra and his teachers devote themselves to getting Carter freedom through a successful appeal.Despite the fact that the basics of the story is interesting and compelling this film only manages to be reasonable entertaining rather than compelling because it never really goes deeper than the basics. The story of a man wrongfully imprisoning and yet somehow overcoming that is going to be worth a look as it offers enough human interest for me to give it a try but the problem here is that the film will give you a very basic look at the story and this basic feel will stop you getting involved in the story and maybe even make you wonder how much of it has been simplified down. Enough elements of the film remain interesting to cover this gap though and the character of Carter is interesting and semiinspiring as he is portrayed here I say 'as portrayed here' because I do not know how real this person I have seen here is. Part of the problem may be Jewison himself as his background is of a time where things could be as simple as literally black and white  but he brings that view to this movie and the story and even the truth appear to suffer as a result.In Jewison's world there is no complex issues no legal technicalities no nothing  there is only a good black man who has been framed by bitter racist cops even though everything points to his innocence and boy does Jewison spread it on thick! We trace Paterson's hatred of Carter all the way back to childhood and a scene where he comments on Carter's boxing fame just so we are totally clear that he wanted Carter more than anything! It's a real shame because the truth must be more interesting than this although I imagine a lot more complex and for the film to just present such a clear cut and simplistic view of real life events not only insults the intelligence of the audience it also does a disservice to the real life events it represents.The cast are a big reason most of the film is interesting or rather Denzel is a big reason it works. How close his Carter is to the real Carter is anyone's guess but his dialogue and his performance are both great. Washington made me believe this man's inner struggle by looks words tone of voice  this is the performance he deserved his Oscar for not the more showy and less controversial one in Training Day. Shannon is also good even if he is far from central to the film. Unger Schreiber and Hannah have clearly been told to play 'nonthreatening white people' and they are all about as bland as a collection of people as I have seen. There is no meat on their characters and as a result the three just play them very simple basic and far too 'nice' to be believable I'm not suggesting we have more detail on their lives but there was nothing to them whatsoever  a real problem when they are asked to carry some scenes near the end by themselves. Hedaya gets paid with a lazy 'racist cop' role that he can do nothing with while Brown is OK in a return to his Shawshank role. Pastore Steiger Yulin and Paymer all add the feeling of depth in minor roles but really this is Washington's film and he is a big reason I found it entertaining.Overall this was potentially an interesting compelling and emotional film based on an intriguing real life story of injustice. However the script simplifies the story and characters to the point of being almost a version for people in a rush or without the intelligence to understand more. I cannot understand why the film just brushed past areas that would have made it more interesting albeit more morally complex and Jewison is to blame for a film that is very black and white in the portrayal of circumstances and its characters. Washington's performance and well written dialogue makes the film worth seeing but I was surprised by the film's ability to take an interesting and compelling story and simplify it to the point of lacking any real punch sorry  he starts with a pun and he ends with a pun!. Watch once but there are much better examples of the genre and much better sources for hearing Carter's story.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of a worldfamous boxer unjustly imprisoned for more than two decades for felony murders he did not commit. His conviction upheld in a second trial before he is finally released by a federal court is practically an operational definition of the term railroaded. Rubin Hurricane Carter would still be in Trenton State Prison a hell hole if there ever was one if it hadn't been for the altruistic efforts of three adults and one adolescent member of a Canadian commune who became amateur sleuths by accident.The film isn't particularly complicated. In fact it's dumbed down to a point beyond which a lack of comprehension would be attributed to pathology. Almost all the frissons that might have made this more than a simple tale of moral strength and fortitude have been left out or shaped to fit a familiar mold. Dan Hedaya for instance is Paterson New Jersey's Detective Della Pesci the personification of racistmotivated darkness. The only reason he's in the movie is to snarl threaten make foul racist remarks chivvy Carter and see to it that he spends as much time in the slams as possible. Now imagine that the movie gives him edge and adds other dimensions. Imagine instead of Detective Della Pesci Inspector Javert of Les Miserables another police officer who simply cannot give up his persecution and yet is recognizably human rather than another familiar stereotype. It would have been so EASY to give the heavy a family and a dog or at least a social context  rising black crime in the cities of the 1960s and the panic associated with it. Yet the writers and the director throw away any chance to turn the film into something other than a condemnation of racism and the white people infected by it. As a kid Hurricane stabs a middleaged white guy only to save his chum from an oily child molester. Does anyone believe this? Ho hum.Not to diminish the heinous effects of racism or more generally prejudice in our justice system. It's an imperfect machine and Carter suffered abominably for every fourteenyearold black kid who ever decorated a brick wall with graffiti from a can of spray paint. During one of his trials the prosecution refers to his having been convicted by a jury of his peers and Jewison gives us a long shot of the allwhite jury in case we might otherwise miss the point. We can't help being relieved when Carter is ultimately released and can't help thinking somewhere in the back of our minds about those twenty years of imprisonment.Nobody really has much to do as far as acting is concerned. Denzel Washington is pretty good at projecting pentup anger and defiance. And the writers have his character develop too. At first he concentrates on turning his body into an instrument of power. But after reading some inspirational books he develops his mind as well and in practical ways. He resists being swept up in the prison system by rejecting what sociologists have called the small reward system of total institutions. If favors are returned by cigarettes Carter doesn't smoke. If submission leads to protection Carter can do without the protection. His career in the Army however was not quite the smooth ride the movie gives us but let's not dabble in too many discrepancies between art and life.The other characters are rather blank. Life in the Canadian commune was evidently not lastingly satisfying. Carter and Deborah Kara Unger's blond altruist were married then divorced. But we don't really get to know much about them. They  and Carter's legal defense team  are played mostly as bland dogooders who would have failed if not pushed to the wall by the power of Carter's will.There's a good movie around this story lurking someplace unorganized entropic waiting for someone to write it and put it on the screen. It's a parable of good and evil. Not of good people and evil people but of people who are each within themselves good and evil just like all the rest of us. But this isn't that movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is the story of a worldfamous boxer unjustly imprisoned for more than two decades for felony murders he did not commit. His conviction upheld in a second trial before he is finally released by a federal court is practically an operational definition of the term railroaded. Rubin Hurricane Carter would still be in Trenton State Prison a hell hole if there ever was one if it hadn't been for the altruistic efforts of three adults and one adolescent member of a Canadian commune who became amateur sleuths by accident.The film isn't particularly complicated. In fact it's dumbed down to a point beyond which a lack of comprehension would be attributed to pathology. Almost all the frissons that might have made this more than a simple tale of moral strength and fortitude have been left out or shaped to fit a familiar mold. Dan Hedaya for instance is Paterson New Jersey's Detective Della Pesci the personification of racistmotivated darkness. The only reason he's in the movie is to snarl threaten make foul racist remarks chivvy Carter and see to it that he spends as much time in the slams as possible. Now imagine that the movie gives him edge and adds other dimensions. Imagine instead of Detective Della Pesci Inspector Javert of Les Miserables another police officer who simply cannot give up his persecution and yet is recognizably human rather than another familiar stereotype. It would have been so EASY to give the heavy a family and a dog or at least a social context  rising black crime in the cities of the 1960s and the panic associated with it. Yet the writers and the director throw away any chance to turn the film into something other than a condemnation of racism and the white people infected by it. As a kid Hurricane stabs a middleaged white guy only to save his chum from an oily child molester. Does anyone believe this? Ho hum.Not to diminish the heinous effects of racism or more generally prejudice in our justice system. It's an imperfect machine and Carter suffered abominably for every fourteenyearold black kid who ever decorated a brick wall with graffiti from a can of spray paint. During one of his trials the prosecution refers to his having been convicted by a jury of his peers and Jewison gives us a long shot of the allwhite jury in case we might otherwise miss the point. We can't help being relieved when Carter is ultimately released and can't help thinking somewhere in the back of our minds about those twenty years of imprisonment.Nobody really has much to do as far as acting is concerned.

The scene where Rubin allegedly jokes with the reporter about killing white cops. I suspect he did make these remarks in a serious way.I don't know if either of these events were as they were portrayed but I suspect the reality was very different from what was shown.I found the first half of the film amateurish and disjointed admittedly after that the film improved but still there was a large lack of believability.  The Policeman who seemed hell bent' on making Rubin's life a misery was totally unbelievable.  I'm sure there are bent' cops but they was absolutely no explanation as to why he acted in the manner he did.

For such deep and complex issues to be addressed we need deep and complex filmmakers.

Him and his low life buddies decide to make an amateur porn film. Lots of big laughs. It is like State and Main meets Boogie Nights. Bridges is always good and Ted Danson gives one of the funniest supporting comedic performances I have ever seen. The end seemed a bit thrown together but very funny. I give it a B.

Stars Jeff Bridges Joe Patalinano Ted Danson Tim Blake Nelson Bill Fichtner Pat Fugit among others. Bridges plays a small time guy who has been unsuccessful in life. Him and his low life buddies decide to make an amateur porn film. Lots of big laughs. It is like State and Main meets Boogie Nights. Bridges is always good and Ted Danson gives one of the funniest supporting comedic performances I have ever seen. The end seemed a bit thrown together but very funny. I give it a B. Will be out later this year";

Yet somehow this film about porn has next to none of it and that's a good thing. In the place of bare asses it has some great performances and funny sequences. Notably Jeff Bridges' character channels a Dudelike vibe while still feeling fresh and different. Joey Pants is bizarre and at the same time likable in his role whose name you just need to watch to see and laugh at. Finally Ted Danson is so completely cast against everything I have seen him in previously and it works. It's a sad state of affairs in Hollywood when you see a preview for a film like this and cringe knowingly the almost inevitable result would be a lame script with calledin performances. Thankfully the result is an unexpectedly good natured rompabout porn. I hope this film gets the attention and wide release it deserves.".

The version i saw was called the moguls but since the studio thought that i would get confused with a skiing movie they changed the title. Also the version i saw i was told is going to be slightly different form what is going to be opening in NY and LA.

I have known characters like these all my life who continue to try and succeed in life to win the respect and love of family e.g. Bridges's son.

This is the moral of this wonderful movie which made my eyes misty at the end when Bridges kept replaying his son's voice mail....I love you Dad! and then put the new sheets on his son's bed. The characters all mirror Bridges's desire to succeed at something in life. Bridges is like a pied piper in uniting the cast to follow his lead. Danson is a riot. Pantoliano is absolutely terrific. I have never seen him before in such a subdued hilariously funny role. Run! Don't walk to this very wonderful movie. Adding to the foregoing comment which was written over a year ago I saw the recut version of the film last night42206 and wondered why many of the scenes of the funny grumpy old guy Clara's man were cut particularly the part near the end when he drives away in a new car with a wide smile after he had been frowning during the whole film. The recut version is a tighter film which focuses almost completely on the main characters at the expense of the peripheral characters. However it is still a terrific film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just got back tonight from an early screening of a new movie with Jeff Bridges called The Amateurs at Penn State. The movie was originally meant to be screened last month with an appearance by costar Joe Pantoliano. Joey Pants did come his daughter is a student here but technical difficulties plagued the screening twenty minutes in. Joe was very apologetic and stayed to answer questions for a while and in the meantime they set up another screening for tonight. No Joe tonight he's apparently filming a new pilot for CBS about waterfront crime but the movie did work so I can tell you what it's all about.Jeff Bridges stars as a recent divorce who is down on his luck in a small town. Looking for a way to make it big and have the means to spoil his son he decides to make a porn movie. He does this with the help of his supportive friends including Pantoliano Ted Danson William Fichtner Tim Blake Nelson and Patrick Fugit. Their film will be distinctive because it will be made by and feature talent from their own small town. Now I know this entire plot sounds kind of corny but it is well executed  everyone laughed pretty hard throughout.Besides having a great cast what makes this movie different is that it is a sex comedy for and by adults. This may be a tough sell but I can say that at least half of tonight's audience was definitely professors and community members rather than students. Though there is little nudity or hard language this is an Rmovie because of its frank discussion of sex. It's funny because these guys are trying to be respectful by replacing words for genitalia with other appropriate but ridiculous terms.As I mentioned the cast was great and everyone was prefect for their role. Pantoliano plays the appropriately named writerdirector of the production Some Idiot. Danson plays a gay friend who tries too hard at hiding his sexual orientation making for some very funny and awkward moments. Fichtner does a really good job with making a fairly plain character entertaining and fun to watch. Bridges plays a loser in the vein of The Dude except he's got it together a little more and is a little cleaner cut. About half of Bridges performance is voiceover as well which was done fairly well. My biggest complaint would be that their female characters receive very little screen time and are underdeveloped. The cut we saw really underused Lauren Graham and Judy Greer.The film was written and directed by Michael Traeger whose most notable previous credit was writing the script of MTV's Dead Man on Campus ouch. The script was really funny and the direction was suitable though not very special. Based on what Joe said at the first screening it sounds like they will only be changing the opening of the film  so the cut I saw was pretty close to finished. I believe it will be hitting theaters late springearly summer. All in all it was an entertaining little indie comedy and its worth checking out for a good laugh.".

	schema:headline " Joke. Thud. Joke. Thud. The flat coke of sex comedies.";
	schema:reviewBody "You may remember a little movie being advertised back in 2005 called The Moguls. It starred Jeff Bridges playing a riff on his Dude persona and a whole load of other respected character actors such as William Fichtner Joe Pantoliano Tim Blake Nelson John Hawkes promising up and comer Patrick Fugit Almost Famous and Ted Danson. The film looked amusing quite possibly a fine night in one could do much worse. Time goes by and we hear nothing more about it. Then suddenly out of the blue in November 2007 we begin to see a little movie being advertised called The Amateurs a sweet little comedy romp starring Jeff Bridges Ted Danson and a host of respected talent.The reason for this pull back and rerelease is simple. The Moguls The Amateurs or whatever you want to call it just isn't very good. In fact it stinks like a big pile of dirty knickers. Brace yourself because now I'm going to tell you why.The MogulsAmateurs begins with Andy Bridges a divorce who visits his son on his birthday to discover that his ex's new partner is filthy rich. Andy goes to his local bar head hanging realising he's never done anything with his life. Finally Andy comes to the conclusion that the only way to win his son's respect is  to make a porno.As we are introduced one by one to the characters we meet Mo and Ron. Of course they call them MoRon. We also meet a character named Some Idiot. Amateur porn the stuff that Any Idiot can make with his video camera hey Some Idiot's got a brother! Moose Danson is gay but doesn't want anyone to know yet of course they all do because he acts like your average stereotypical homosexual. Crickets. Tumbleweed. Otis played by William Fichtner wants to know if there's a guy who just stands around on the set and so he is made executive producer of the porno. And so the lazily written and completely unnecessary voice over goes on pointing out each and every thing in the movie that we can quite clearly see or work out for ourselves. Andy's inner monologue delights in it's quirky pausing of the film to slip in a quick jokey point about a character or point something out to us that we may need to know later on. A neon sign saying Look! Look here for a plot point! would have been less obvious. This voiceover even has the audacity to tell us that when making a film one of the main things you must do is to show and not tell. You would think that writerdirector Michael Traeger would have caught the irony.This opening half hour is rushed and unconvincing with very little actual character development with which to care about anything that's going on. A film similar in overall character to this one would be Dodgeball in which we have a group of likable underdogs who are not only developed but have quirks that are actually quirky. Here the characters only need a few seconds of pointless voice over to describe their entire lives and make the caricatures of Poseidon look they strolled right out of Of Mice and Men.The script itself is a lame duck and that reflects in the performances. There are for example some potentially funny situations put forth here for example the porno production meeting at Some Idiot's house where he lives with his mother but the execution is so bland that none of the actual comedy gets across. Another scene in which Andy has an argument in a crowded coffee shop with Isiah Washington about big black phalli as customers leave in disgust also falls short and ends up being a tad racist as well as being as unfunny as well someone shouting the word 'dck' in a coffee shop. The constant feeble desperate attempts at euphemistic humour are about as funny as listening to a conversation between a group of 14 year old boys giggling about sex.A burning question here is how if the entire crew are made to stand with their backs turned the entire way through shooting a scene do the pans and alternative angles get in there? Extraordinary. How do industry professionals get it so wrong? You'd think they would be their own technical advisors. As it is the cinematography in this film is flat and uninteresting making Year of the Dog look positively vibrant.One wonders how this cast were attracted to such a script. Lauren Graham seems to be wondering exactly what it is she's doing there as her character is nothing but a potential love interest for Bridges to bumble over. Ten Danson's buttocks look to be particularly self conscious an image that I would have quite happily gone without. It's not sordid enough to be shocking or daring and not amiable enough to be sweet or heart warming. By the end the film has degenerated into one big schmaltzy lovein without having earned it culminating in an awful slow motion conga montage of respected talent acting elated in the most unconvincing way possible.

	onyx:emotionText "You may remember a little movie being advertised back in 2005 called The Moguls. It starred Jeff Bridges playing a riff on his Dude persona and a whole load of other respected character actors such as William Fichtner Joe Pantoliano Tim Blake Nelson John Hawkes promising up and comer Patrick Fugit Almost Famous and Ted Danson. The film looked amusing quite possibly a fine night in one could do much worse. Time goes by and we hear nothing more about it. Then suddenly out of the blue in November 2007 we begin to see a little movie being advertised called The Amateurs a sweet little comedy romp starring Jeff Bridges Ted Danson and a host of respected talent.The reason for this pull back and rerelease is simple. The Moguls The Amateurs or whatever you want to call it just isn't very good. In fact it stinks like a big pile of dirty knickers. Brace yourself because now I'm going to tell you why.The MogulsAmateurs begins with Andy Bridges a divorce who visits his son on his birthday to discover that his ex's new partner is filthy rich. Andy goes to his local bar head hanging realising he's never done anything with his life. Finally Andy comes to the conclusion that the only way to win his son's respect is  to make a porno.As we are introduced one by one to the characters we meet Mo and Ron. Of course they call them MoRon. We also meet a character named Some Idiot. Amateur porn the stuff that Any Idiot can make with his video camera hey Some Idiot's got a brother! Moose Danson is gay but doesn't want anyone to know yet of course they all do because he acts like your average stereotypical homosexual. Crickets. Tumbleweed. Otis played by William Fichtner wants to know if there's a guy who just stands around on the set and so he is made executive producer of the porno. And so the lazily written and completely unnecessary voice over goes on pointing out each and every thing in the movie that we can quite clearly see or work out for ourselves. Andy's inner monologue delights in it's quirky pausing of the film to slip in a quick jokey point about a character or point something out to us that we may need to know later on. A neon sign saying Look! Look here for a plot point! would have been less obvious. This voiceover even has the audacity to tell us that when making a film one of the main things you must do is to show and not tell. You would think that writerdirector Michael Traeger would have caught the irony.This opening half hour is rushed and unconvincing with very little actual character development with which to care about anything that's going on. A film similar in overall character to this one would be Dodgeball in which we have a group of likable underdogs who are not only developed but have quirks that are actually quirky. Here the characters only need a few seconds of pointless voice over to describe their entire lives and make the caricatures of Poseidon look they strolled right out of Of Mice and Men.The script itself is a lame duck and that reflects in the performances. There are for example some potentially funny situations put forth here for example the porno production meeting at Some Idiot's house where he lives with his mother but the execution is so bland that none of the actual comedy gets across. Another scene in which Andy has an argument in a crowded coffee shop with Isiah Washington about big black phalli as customers leave in disgust also falls short and ends up being a tad racist as well as being as unfunny as well someone shouting the word 'dck' in a coffee shop. The constant feeble desperate attempts at euphemistic humour are about as funny as listening to a conversation between a group of 14 year old boys giggling about sex.A burning question here is how if the entire crew are made to stand with their backs turned the entire way through shooting a scene do the pans and alternative angles get in there? Extraordinary. How do industry professionals get it so wrong? You'd think they would be their own technical advisors. As it is the cinematography in this film is flat and uninteresting making Year of the Dog look positively vibrant.One wonders how this cast were attracted to such a script. Lauren Graham seems to be wondering exactly what it is she's doing there as her character is nothing but a potential love interest for Bridges to bumble over. Ten Danson's buttocks look to be particularly self conscious an image that I would have quite happily gone without. It's not sordid enough to be shocking or daring and not amiable enough to be sweet or heart warming. By the end the film has degenerated into one big schmaltzy lovein without having earned it culminating in an awful slow motion conga montage of respected talent acting elated in the most unconvincing way possible. The final 'twist' ending if you can call it that is at first glance interesting and suggests that there may be hope for the film yet but the neatness of it all brings us right back to contrivance once again inane voice over checking the characters' fates off the list one by one as it did at the start.It's easy to see why this film was so desperately pulled and reissued under the guise of quirky low budget indie.

We saw many other notable actors such as Ted Danson William Fitchner and Tim Blake Nelson. The cast was put together well and the story was original and worthy of checking out. It had it's one liners and funny moments but the story also brought good moral into the end. I really would recommend for all fans of Jeff Bridges' work to check it out sometime. It wasn't a really strong hyped movie but hey it was all and all decent because of the story that it had to it. This movie to me deserves a total of 810 stars. Basically because it entertained me.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE AMATEURS is about as close to the quality of British film comedies a high compliment indeed! as we have seen thanks to writerdirector Michael Traeger. It is everything a small town community aura represents without the stumbling blocks of cruelty that so often provide the turning point in 'rural stories' that defame the simple homespun humanity that is too often foreign to the big city life. Perhaps to refer to it as 'sweet' will rile some review readers but for this viewer the overriding emotion at the close of the story is just that  sweet in the finest sense of the term.The film is narrated by the down and out unemployed newly divorced middleaged crisis victim Andy Sargentee Jeff Bridges who spends his time in the local watering hole trying to come up with an idea that will change his fortune  and life. Giving up his marriage to Thelma Jeanne Tripplehorn and his son Billy Alex D. Linz has been painful but Andy believes he will somehow regain their respect by discovering his 'big idea'. Surrounding him are other underachievers such as Some Idiot Joe Pantoliano Barney Macklehatton Tim Blake Nelson hopelessly in love with loony dreamer Helen Glenne Headly church janitor Otis William Fichtner local video store worker and video buff Emmett Patrick Fugit MoeRon John Hawkes and Brad William Henke who are never seen alone the closeted gay Moose Ted Danson and bartender Floyd Tom Bower among other 'observers'. A wild idea occurs to Andy he and his friends could make an amateur porn film and make money and gain fame. Out of both love of Andy and individual needs to make something of their boring existence in the little town the group commits to helping Andy with his project. How the steps succeed and fail underline the integrity and unconditional friendship these simple people represent. Along the way we meet the porn film's stars including Valerie Perrine Judy Greer Fiona Hunter Isaiah Washington Melinda Dahl  all of whom eagerly participate in the 'very private' filming concept of an amateur porn film. How the final product is threatened and ultimately survives produces the warm ending to the film. And along the way we get to know Thelma's new husband Howard Steven Weber who breaks the stereotype of the rich new stepfather and these small town folk including Dawn Didawick Jayne Taini Lauren Graham and Eileen Brennan who contributes a very special cameo role.The film has been named THE MOGULS and DIRTY MOVIE in other countries and perhaps that confusion of titles has been part of the problem of the lack of promotion the film received in the theaters. But in a way seeing this very special movie in home surroundings adds to the intimacy and the very warmly honest view of the genuinely kind and caring interrelationships among the people of this small town. There is much to be learned from this film and the added features include the writerdirector sharing the experience with each of the actors in this truly ensemble work. Highly recommended.

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this movie titled for my viewing The Amateurs 2008 US and was ever so pleasantly surprised. I'd seen the preview and thought it looked pretty darn funny.Pretty darn funny is exactly what it was! It's the story of a small town comprised of many sweet downandouters whose inspirational leader the iconic Jeff Bridges is suddenly inspired for a really good reason to make a porno film!!!.What follows is a wonderfully absurd combination of the somewhat sordid idea of the production of a porn film and the somewhat corny idea of nice people coming together to support each other and cooperate on a project for the benefit of all.The cast contains so many faces you will recognize but may not be able to name so I'm thrilled that these folks are involved in this tremendously fun film. Standout performances abound! Check out Ted Dansen Joe Pantoliano and William Fichtner for example. The screenplay was deftly written A combination of the story itself how the story's told and how the story's told again. Quite clever. Far more clever than meets the eye in fact. While many people have qualms about narration in a film and often justifiably the story of The Amateurs a far better  more logical title than The Moguls by the way was actually dependent upon the narration... That's where a whole lot of the subtle humor lies!One of my favorite movies is Boogie Nights brilliant dazzling and awfully sad... If you want to see a different take on the porn business albeit a completely innocent heartwarming and comically ironic take on the porn business have a look at The Amateurs.You won't regret it.".

I'd seen the preview and thought it looked pretty darn funny.Pretty darn funny is exactly what it was! It's the story of a small town comprised of many sweet downandouters whose inspirational leader the iconic Jeff Bridges is suddenly inspired for a really good reason to make a porno film!!!.What follows is a wonderfully absurd combination of the somewhat sordid idea of the production of a porn film and the somewhat corny idea of nice people coming together to support each other and cooperate on a project for the benefit of all.The cast contains so many faces you will recognize but may not be able to name so I'm thrilled that these folks are involved in this tremendously fun film. Standout performances abound! Check out Ted Dansen Joe Pantoliano and William Fichtner for example.

It was sort of dim and had not a darkness exactly but a kind of a threadbareness a shabbiness about it. It wasn't just that the characters portrayed were lowlifes poor uneducated and mostly losers albeit kindly ones. The dimness went deeper than that. Maybe the film was blurred or the lighting wasn't crisp dunno. But SOMETHING was 'off' like milk on the last day of its shelf life. You keep asking yourself has this gone bad? But then you keep drinking it.And the studio changed the movie's name. I saw it in Wales in the UK months ago. Evidently the advance buzz was pretty bad. So they changed it from 'The Moguls' to 'The Amateurs'. A sure sign of desperation. But alas that's not going to save it.Jeff Bridges plays lovable 'ordinary' guys that are extra solid and extra real. He plays characters that are very easy for a man I'm about his age and coincidentally lived in Santa Barbara his town for years to relate to. At least I do. It appears based on his wide appeal that women like him too. I also admire him for eschewing the Red Carpet paparazzichasing kind of celebrity grab that so many other actors have fallen prey to IMHO Brad Pitt Ben Afflect Julia Roberts to name but a few. Unfortunately the tone set here was either missed or set too low. Bridge's characters and the supporting cast's characters are just too losery too dim too depressing.This movie also reminded me of 'The Big Lebowski' another Jeff Bridges movie and another darkish movie about lowlifes but one that was much much better done than 'The Moguls' now known as 'The Amateurs'. The derivativeness kind of rankled with me a bit.This movie could have been brighter funnier and stronger. It could have been better. It has a few things to admire though so if you've seen everything else at your theater or nothing else strikes your fancy try this one. And let's all hope meanwhile that Jeff Bridges' next movie will be more like his usual great work.".

One I remember is when Harry Liedtke Don Jose expresses the desire to shoot her and she stands there and stretches her arms out. He can't do at the time.Besides Pola being so much betterlooking than Gerladine Farrar it's not even funny the story gives you lots of background into Don Jose's background. We get to know him. In the DeMille Carmen Wallace Reid is introduced as a guardsman at an entrance to the city.Then there's the death scene. Farrar's is a neat as a pin which is probably what Mr. DeMille wanted.Pola's Carmen? After Don Jose stabs her she lets out a yell and then writhes around before dying. It was a DEATH SCENE!

Compared to DeMille's film Lubitsch's Carmen appears unpolished but I don't think that's bad. Because of their glitter DeMille's scenes often seem staged and stagy. Although Lubitsch's direction isn't recommended either aside from some occasional dolly shots and the addition of framing the story as a told story.Additionally Farrar was annoying as Carmen. Negri is much better in comparison but still rather unremarkable I think. Edna Purviance in Chaplin's burlesque is still my favorite Carmen. The WalshBara version doesn't exist anymore as doesn't many early Fox films that burned in their vaults so there's very little one can say about it. One thing to mention however is that Theda Bara's character was a vamp prototype and Fox advertised it creatively which is similar to Negri's persona and Ufa's publicity of her. Both Negri and Lubitsch emigrated to work in Hollywood. Negri wasn't very successful but it's no wonder that Lubitsch was a better American filmmaker than a German one.I saw the American version of this film retitled Gypsy Blood which was kind of the original intention anyhow.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering the great talents of Ernst Lubitsch and Hanns Krly this film is a bitter disappointment were it not for these men and Pola Negri's Carmen this film would be hardly worth mentioning it could have been made by any competent but uninspired director. During the credits Lubitsch is shown behind his desk smoking a cigarette and not a cigar!! as if the viewer is already warned that this film is not Lubitsch.Problems start with the casting of Don Jos. Pola Negri is sensual lively and very good though very Teutonic but I can accept that Harry Liedtke on the other hand is stiff as a board probably his military uniform was too tight to give him room for natural movement and expression. Therefore not one NegriLiedtke scene works when ever the viewer expects eroticism and longing Spike Jones' parody of Bizet's Carmen enters the mind.The adaptation is too straightforward and  more importantly  spiritless. Besides on several moments the story telling is that clumsy that it is hard to follow the story were it not that the subject is widely known. But there may be a reason for this Herman G. Weinberg in his book The Lubitsch Touch claims that originally the story was told in flashback within a frame story these parts being colouredin by handand as such more or less following the setup of Merime's novel. I could not find confirmation of this and the copy I saw today only had the Carmen story. Nonetheless the problem still remains that  with the exception of a few scenes like the one in which Carmen throws a flower at Don Jose  the film is pasted together with scenes that do not even try to capture the spirit of the novel it never really visualizes the nuances of the relationship of Carmen and Don Jos was that aspect of the novel too subtle for the German public? Were they only interested in an exotic environment and Carmen just happened to be in it?Quite some other weak points could be mentioned a 1000 words would not do. To mention but a few 1 Don Jos's fiance is introduced at the beginning of the film only to disappear totally as the film progresses. She returns only once in the prison scene Don Jos in agony over to escape or not but in a double exposure trick as old as cinematography and too corny for Lubitsch. 2 We spend long minutes at the coast when every and I mean every gang member tries to cross the water I was  waiting to see at least one member fall into the water to give the scene some tension and meaning. 3 Lubitsch was known for his direction of masses but I could for instance make neither nor tail of the marching in of the soldiers. 4 How could Lubitsch be contented with a bullfighting scene without a bull? To get a real Spanish bull into Germany that short after the war was over indeed might have been a problem But why was not a better filmic solution found? As it is now it is just well bull ....It was a huge success in Germany with audiences and press but I think we should not be mislead by that. This success says more about the psyche of a defeated country after 4 years of war than about the film. Curiously enough in 1947 Lubitsch said that Carmen was one of his best dramas claiming that he made a drama not influenced by Italian dramas. Did he ever see it again? I wonder.".

However on duty he stumbles upon a woman of ill repute Negri and is so completely enchanted that he leaves the military abandons his fiance and resorts to a life of crime to support himself and his gypsy lover. She quickly tires of him and moves onto the next best thing. This is the fourth Pola Negri film I've seen and I do not understand her appeal. She isn't terribly attractive which is essential for this role so we can understand why the soldier destroys his life for her. Although Negri was a trained dancer she clumps around devoid of a shred of grace and her seductive dancing is laughable. Because the film lacks a charming leading lady there is very little to rave about. Even though Ernst Lubitsch directs there is very little sex appeal. The setting is dirty and destitute and although the film is short it doesn't feel like it. This is a classic story so if you want to familiarize yourself to feel more cultured go ahead and watch but keep your expectations low.".

With this age it is of course blackandwhite silent film and the director here is Ernst Lubitsch who was still in his 20s when he made this film a long time before his breakthrough in Hollywood. Lubitsch is also known for the silent comedies he made around that time but this one here has nothing to laugh about. There is some mystery in here even a touch of horror and lots of drama and tragedy. According to IMDb this film runs for 70 minutes but the version I saw ran for 80 minutes so maybe that one had fewer frames per second I guess. All in all I still must say I did not really enjoy the watch but then again I am not the greatest silent film and also did only like some of Lubitsch's work I saw and this one here is not among them. Also I would have preferred more frequent use of intertitles which is however not just a problem with Lubitsch but with so many other silent films too. At some point it is just difficult to understand the action exactly and there were moments here too when this applied. That's why I overall give this film a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

To me not having the music is a fatal problemso no matter how good the story is too much of the play is missing for it to be all that great. Seeing Carmen without music is like going on a honeymoon and being told not to touch!! It loses a lot in the deal.This German version has the distinction of being directed by a very young and inexperienced Ernst Lubitsch and starring the vampish Pola Negri who was famous for her supposed adoration of Valentino...after he died. While it's pretty good and has relatively restrained acting and decent sets the overall effect is just okay. It's not really bad...just what you'd expect from a butchered opera made into a silent film.So is it worth seeing? Well it all depends. If you are a total nutjob like me who adores silents then by all meansthough the ending seems all but missing. If you are a novice to silents there are many many many silents out there that are simply more entertaining and interesting. Worth a look but hardly a mustsee.By the way I saw the version that was shortened slightly and renamed Gypsy Blood. It came in at 64 minutes and I have no idea if the original and slightly longer version exists. Perhaps this shortening of the film could explain why it seemed to end so abruptly.".

	schema:reviewBody "Following a period of rehabilitation where he managed to beat his addiction to morphine character actor extraordinaire Peter Lorre felt confident enough not only to leave his secure employment as a lean sleek villain in myriad Hollywood noirs and go back to his native Germany after almost 20 years which like many compatriots he had fled when the Nazis came to power but also to embark on his sole foray behind the camera. Adopting an unfussy technique but a compelling flashback structure Lorre turned out a truly remarkable piece of work that equally unsuccessful on its first release as Charles Laughton's THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER 1955 and Marlon Brando's ONEEYED JACKS 1961 has yet to have its somewhat maligned reputation vindicated in the same unequivocal manner as these two 'onehit wonders' by actorsturneddirectors. A chubbier infinitely worldweary Lorre gives a haunting central performance as the dedicated reallife scientist Dr. Karl Rothe who being told by his superiors that his discoveries were being passed on to the allied forces by his beautiful and much younger fiance strangles her in a moment of silent rage upon returning to the lodgings he shares with his motheronlaw and her cat the actress playing Lorre's first victim Renate Mannhardt makes such an indelible impression on the spectator that upon a second viewing one is surprised to discover how brief her appearance in the film actually is. Changing his identity and now serving as a medical doctor in a refugee camp Lorre is brought once again face to face with his inner demons in the shape of his assistant during WWII who apart from having carried on an affair with Lorre's wife was secretly also an important Party official investigating the infamous Night Of The Long Knives conspiracy which is rather murkily dealt with in the film's latter stages another enigmatic aspect of Lorre's personality that is somewhat oddly thrown into the mix is his troubled dealings with other women over the years culminating in another murder committed in a stationary train carriage. Interestingly the film opens with a shot of a moving train out of which emerges the tiny figure of Lorre walking towards the refugee camp and ends in a devastating medium shot of Lorre one hand clasped dejectedly to his face standing stationary on the railroad tracks as a locomotive rushes headlong in his direction! As one can surmise from this synopsis THE LOST ONE's lack of critical and commercial success ought to be attributed more to its utter grimness and thoroughly defeatist view of postwar Germany than to any jinx the production might have been vested with the film's producer Arnold Pressburger died in midproduction the original negative was lost in an editing suite fire and the film survives via a reconstructed print etc. and indeed should be much better known even among film connoisseurs. Personally I had first come across a copy of the film at a priceless DVD rental store on Santa Monica Blvd. in Hollywood in January 2006 but I have since added it to my collection in a seemingly restored version albeit sporting distractingly ungrammatical English subtitles.".

Everything on a technical level is fantastic with Lorre composing some starkly haunting shots the shots in and around the camp that book ends the film. Here was a man who clearly learned how to put a film together from the masters like Lang and Hitchcock. He paints a wonderful portrait of the war and of its aftermath that is almost tactile.The problem with the film is that the story spins out of control like our characters life in odd unexpected ways not all of them good. The plot has Lorre as a doctor in a refuge camp after the second world war running into an old friend. It quickly is revealed that there is more to the good doctor than meets the eye and in a flashback that takes up most of the film we see what happened during the war years. From murder for survival to mass murder its a small jump. The problem is that the trip seems a bit unfocused with a couple of turns seeming to be forced forgive me for not telling too much since the bumps are late in the film and I don't want to give away plot points.Despite the bumps the film is definitely worth a look if for no other reason then to see what Lorre could do in the directors chair.6.5 out of 10 7 for IMDb purposes.".

However the Nazis protected him because he was very useful. His assistant Hsch Karl John covers him after investigations have been started and saves him from the gallows. But Rothe is slowly eaten up by his feelings of guilt. So for him personally the end of the war does not mean much. He changes his name in Dr. Neumeister and finds work in a camp for emigrants. He drinks heavily. Soon an assistant is assigned to him a certain Nowack which turns out to be Neumeister's former collaborator Hsch. Neumeister is very wrong in assuming that he has finally found the right person to talk over his difficult psychological situation. Nowack has no feelings of guilt and no understanding at all for Neumeister. In a moment of affect Neumeister kills Nowack and leaves the camp.Many reviewers have found that Der VerloreneThe Lost One 1951 the only film that Peter Lorre directed is a masterpiece in the legion of movies about World War II. The movie is very special since he does not only show the bombed cities but also the ruined souls. Lorrebiographer Stephen D. Youngkin has even seen strong autobiographic traces in Lorre's life. It seems as if the way from Dr. Rothe to Dr. Neumeister is a series of transits First the transit of the war there will be an end but when?. Second the transit of postwar The allies control Germany there will be an end with searching for Nazi criminals but when?. And third the isolation of someone who is incapable of excusing his own deed although it was committed during the Nazi time and therefore under circumstances that others use as excuses. Therefore for Dr. Neumeister there is no light at the end of the transitcorridor of his life. Nevertheless he prefers meeting a trainengine al fresco instead of killing himself with the same weapon by which he killed Nowack in the camp some half hour ago. When we see at the end of the film LorreNeumeister walking slowly towards the approaching train even throwing his cigarette away at the right moment we must realize that it is impossible to emigrate from ourselves.".

	schema:headline " This movie is a mess  but a fairly interesting one";
	schema:reviewBody "Somehow Peter Lorre wanted to make a comeback in post war Germany with this movie. He plays the principal role in Der Verlorene a little guy stumbling through the Nazi years in Germany and ending up just wanting to put an end to his life apparently based on a true story. He also directed and participated in the screen writing. And that was probably too much. The movie is ill paced and takes several unexpected turns which break down the narrative rhythm. The movie also seems to shift in an uneasy way into different genres. It starts out as a solid firm noir with a flashback a love story betrayal and a murder. Then Lorre reverts to his role in Fritz Lang's M and becomes a psychotic woman hater and mass murderer. Then back in the noir mode he stumbles inadvertently into the preparation for the assassination of Hitler a real event that took place in 1944 and believe it or not the movie definitely becomes a kind of a black comedy. The main character ends up a tragic clown who can not be taken seriously and I am pretty sure it was not meant that way. Some plot details are plainly ludicrous and do not work. An example Lorre's character takes to strangling women who try to make him hot. They are decidedly bigger and larger than he is and all look as if they would put up fierce resistance against a strangling Lorre probably easily overpowering him. But they react like frightened lambs  I just had to laugh at that or was I missing a crucial symbolic twist here? However other aspects of the movie are interesting. The theme of betrayal and double cross are cleverly presented as the essence of every day life in Nazi Germany. The set design and the scenes shot on location somewhere in Germany create an oppressive atmosphere with darkened parlours basement laboratories bleak apartments and landscapes of ruins and emergency shelters. Actually all the elements that make a good movie are there and in itself well presented some good dialogue the observation the surprise moments the suspense and even a car chase. There are some very good female parts. The game of flirting and sexual innuendo is presented in a frankness that was pretty drastic for the period I guess. But these elements stand by themselves and unfortunately don't come together to form a good movie. Robert Siodmak's thematically related movie Nachts wenn der Teufel kam was a much more convincing comeback with a film that transports American noir mode to Nazi Germany.".

	schema:headline " Not quite a masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "A wellmade intelligent film with big faults. First the virtues Peter Lorre acts very well as the disillusioned drunken doctor in a refugee camp and the other actors all do their jobs well the camerawork is very good the picture of a desolate camp in the middle of nowhere and the surrounding country the solid bourgeois apartment where Lorre's character lives and a city under attack are all superbly portrayed. The film's themes the relationship between mass murder and individual murder the distance between what people seem and what they are solitude and society are interesting in themselves even if they crowd one another out in the film. However the film has some pretty big flaws. The first is Lorre himself in the standard Lorre role he is good as i said but as the dedicated research doctor capable of inspiring desire in women he is completely unconvincing. It's interesting that Lorre and Karl John were born about a year apart John is completely convincing as the young opportunist and as the slightly older desperate opportunist but Lorre always seems twenty years older in body and a thousand years older in soul. We can't believe that Lorre ever felt strongly enough to kill the women whereas we are persuaded by his contempt and hatred for John in those parts of the film set after the war. Equally we cannot believe that any of the women were ever attracted to Lorre in the first place. These are big faults but it's a sign of the film's qualities that they don't overwhelm it and nor does the intrusive music. The other faults of the film are faults of overambition and a desire to do things film can't do faults so rare that we needn't worry too much about their frequency. The greatest regret is that Lorre couldn't make more films and learn from his mistakes and build up his successes it would certainly have been a better fate than doing Peter Lorre impersonations to earn a living as he had to.".

	onyx:emotionText "A wellmade intelligent film with big faults. First the virtues Peter Lorre acts very well as the disillusioned drunken doctor in a refugee camp and the other actors all do their jobs well the camerawork is very good the picture of a desolate camp in the middle of nowhere and the surrounding country the solid bourgeois apartment where Lorre's character lives and a city under attack are all superbly portrayed. The film's themes the relationship between mass murder and individual murder the distance between what people seem and what they are solitude and society are interesting in themselves even if they crowd one another out in the film. However the film has some pretty big flaws. The first is Lorre himself in the standard Lorre role he is good as i said but as the dedicated research doctor capable of inspiring desire in women he is completely unconvincing. It's interesting that Lorre and Karl John were born about a year apart John is completely convincing as the young opportunist and as the slightly older desperate opportunist but Lorre always seems twenty years older in body and a thousand years older in soul. We can't believe that Lorre ever felt strongly enough to kill the women whereas we are persuaded by his contempt and hatred for John in those parts of the film set after the war. Equally we cannot believe that any of the women were ever attracted to Lorre in the first place. These are big faults but it's a sign of the film's qualities that they don't overwhelm it and nor does the intrusive music. The other faults of the film are faults of overambition and a desire to do things film can't do faults so rare that we needn't worry too much about their frequency. The greatest regret is that Lorre couldn't make more films and learn from his mistakes and build up his successes it would certainly have been a better fate than doing Peter Lorre impersonations to earn a living as he had to.";

	schema:reviewBody "This 100 minute movie from almost 65 years ago is mostly known for one fact It is the only movie from Peter Lorre as director and writer. He is the only director here but got help from a trio of other writers. And he plays the lead part as well. The character fits Lorre very nicely again. His history of playing characters who fight their inner demons turned him into one of the most famous actors of his generation M. And his reputation has probably even risen with time. It is a blackandwhite movie which is not a given for 1951. Lorre looks like a mix of Peter Falk and Bruno Ganz here. The rest of the cast is not known. Or I should probably say not known anymore unless you have a really deep interest in German movies in the 1930 1940s and 1950s.This film was made shortly after the division of Germany into East and West. There are constant references on murder and suicide in this film but it's all fairly difficult to understand. You can never be sure if Lorre plays a coldblooded killer or just a victim of unlucky circumstances as the camera frequently blends out in the most crucial moments. The only real killing we see is the one near the end involving Lorre's assistant who he tells the story to. I personally felt this film becomes more and more difficult to understand the longer it goes. So after the onehourmark the entire action and plot was basically completely blurry to me. It is probably easier to understand if you read the summary before watching this movie but this cannot be a requirement to understand and enjoy this movie. Also the plot mentioned here about betraying secrets was totally nonexistent for me probably just a minor part. Forgettable movie. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "MARIE GALANTE is an interesting relic of 1934 cinema on several counts1 One of the few readily available films on DVD anyway of Spencer Tracy's preMGM career.2 The first starring role for Ketti Gallian. This was her first major American film and her only other significant role in Hollywood was as Lady Denise Tarrington in the classic AstaireRogers musical SHALL WE DANCE three years later. After that film Ketti apparently returned to her native France and aside from a handful of French productions did no more movies though apparently she was also active on stage. Lovely woman and one wonders why she failed to make it in Hollywood.3 Interesting political context As with many 1930s films involving espionage the villains are not any identifiable countries but unnamed parties who profit from war. This was the era in which the First World War was being blamed on munitions manufacturers merchants of death who supposedly encouraged international instability and chaos in order to sell weapons.4 It's almost startling to see a Japanese naval officer turn out to be one of the good guys in a Hollywood film. Of course MARIE GALANTE was released seven years before Pearl Harbor. And of course he's played by a Caucasian actor Leslie Fenton.5 Other interesting casting Helen Morgan has a minor role as a saloon singer and does a couple of songs Ned Sparks does his cantankerous act and Sig Ruman plays a fairly straight role rather than hamming it up.6 Henry King's direction and pacing are fascinating  at times I thought I was watching something by Josef von Sternberg with all those giant closeups. Unusually brisk cutting between scenes too for a film of this vintage.7 Some nice stock footage of the Panama Canal and the U.S. Fleet.No one should mistake MARIE GALANTE for a great film. Even by 1934 standards it was no more than casual entertainment. Reportedly the author of the original novel Jacques Deval was so disappointed in the film that he unsuccessfully tried to have his credit removed from it. But if you're interested in 1930s movies or if any of the factors listed above grab you it's worth a rental.".

The release of Marie Galante in 1934 came from a studio in a state of panic and is one of many curious little pieces from the era.Marie Galante was directed by Henry King one of the longestserving and most respected men at Fox. This picture finds him at his most baroque and artistically European in style. During the opening scenes the camera tracks along following Ketti Gallian through a number of settings but she is back amid the clutter of the sets. This draws our attention to the star but gives us the feeling of voyeurs stood outside the action. Later in the office where we first meet Spencer Tracy and the other secret service people a huge whirring fan and its shadow dominate every shot. It's not only a reminder of the oppressive heat but touches like this give the environment a character of its own. The only time we are totally focused on the actors it is via gritty closeups. There were only a handful of directors in Hollywood during this era who were giving such prominence to the sets but they were mostly Germans like Fritz Lang and Josef von Sternberg.Appropriately enough for this European flavouring the star of Marie Galante is a French woman. Ketti Gallian's looks and some extent her mannerisms make her appear as another Marlene Dietrich and this is probably why the studio snapped her up. Compared to the German siren though she is a somewhat bland and makes a rather weak and forgettable heroine. Spencer Tracey his star on the ascendant provides a steady and realistic performance but he seems just a little constrained by this rather stolid role. Amid all the stark sets and quirky angles resolutely American character players Ned Sparks and Stepin Fetchit seem strangely out of place although sensibly their roles have not been emphasised too much and they at least give the picture its only flashes of warmth and humour.Marie Galante is a strange little picture and the way it is made is even stranger. The plot points don't seem directed towards the audience. Instead understanding it is like watching a group of people across a restaurant and trying to piece together their relationships. It's not that it's difficult to follow just that doing so is a slightly cold and alienating experience. It does look incredibly neat and stylish and is vaguely interesting simply for the oddity that it is but the sense of vitality and connection that 30s Hollywood usually offered is sadly missing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit to being a bit disappointed. This film seems to bring forth a lot of talented actors but loses their interaction in the plot. Beautiful Frenchwoman Ketti Gillian starts off at as the star and she acts well. I like that she has several realistic scenes speaking French where there are no subtitles. English speakers need not freak out. She isn't saying anything important in these scenes. However she practically gets lost after the first 15 minutes.At that point we are introduced to the real hero Spencer Tracy. He is a nicely laid back rather intelligent hero. The movie quickly becomes a rather standard mysteryspy tale with the audience and hero trying to guess the identity of the rogue agent who is plotting to blow up the Panama Canal. The other supporting actors deliver nice performances Ned Sparks Helen Morgan Sig Ruman and Leslie Fenton are all effective. Unfortunately they each get a few scenes about ten minutes and their characters don't develop but just tend to disappear. The feel is very much like a Charlie Chan or Mr. Moto or other slightly aboveaverage clever mystery movie of the 1930's. It is just disappointing that it wasn't more ambitious. With some more work it could have been much closer to Casablanca. Instead it feels like two reels of an A picture and then six reels of a B.".

One would be wrong. This one is 1934 at the Panama Canal and the American Commissioner at Cristoforo General Phillips is getting briefed by Ratcliff of Scotland Yard about a mystery man who may be plotting to blow up the power house and put the whole Pacific Fleet in drydock. His m.o. is that he always works through a woman who appears...and disappears...and sometimes her body is found. The nationality of the man is unknown to Scotland Yard but they have pictures of him when in 1914 he was member of the House of Commons and had a key position at the War Department and important secret files disappeared in 1916 under another name he was the master mind in the Central European Spy Organization in Paris and two of his confederatesboth womenwere caught and shot next he was a Llama in Tibet who put himself as head of affairs in China and things went badly for all Western Powers He turned up later as chief engineer of the Potosi Munition Works and they were blown up and when last seen and heard of he was the man behind the scenes of a big Communist uprising in Germany. Ratcliff of Scotland Yard had six photos of the man but no name. About this time Dr. Crawbett from the University of Wisconsin pops in to give a report on how well his study of tropical insects mosquitoes and diseases is going. This alone makes this a watershed moment in movies as the only other mention of the University of Wisconsin in filmhistory came in 1953 when Republic made Crazy Legs starring Elroy CrazyLegs Hirsch...himself. Ratcliff and Crawbett go out for a night on the town at the Pacific Gardens where Helen Morgan as Miss Tapia or something sings a torch song. They also meet a Japanese poetcurio shop owner named Gennosaki Tenoki but he has only been a poet since 1933 and prior to that he was a Lieutenant Commander in the Japanese Imperial Navy and in fact had just returned to Panana yesterday from a visit to Japan. They converse a bit and then the masterofceremonies announces that he he now happy to introduce a singer that can sing without leaning all over the piano and Miss Helen Morgan seems to take offense at his rude inclusion of her in the introduction of...Marie Galante. She sings a song half in French and half in her own brand of English and then Miss Tapia sends her over to pump information out of Ratcliff of Scotland Yard and Crawbett U. of W. while working as a Bgirl sipping small glasses of diluted orange juice. Marie mostly tells them about how put out she is by being in Panama where nobody speaks French. Crawbett suggests that Brogard sitting across the room eyeballing them perhaps does since he owns the Paris Bazaar and Botique. But Brogard with a furtive nod to Miss Tapia departs the premises. So she then tells them of how to come it is she is in Panama against her wishessomething to do with delivering a Postes Telegraphies at San Briac to a ship and the ship sailed with her still aboard. Crawbett then makes the mistake of asking her about her home in San Braic and she says.... Oh m'sieure it is so beautiful There is the old church where I am confirmedthe homes of my friendsthe flowersthe fields beyond town! Everybody tell meBon jour Marie! 'Ello Marie! The gooses go quack quack quack'ello Marie! The sheep and the cowsesthey call BaaBaa Marie  moomoo Marie. Marie is indeed enchanting and even inspires Tenoki the retired Japanese Naval Commander turned poet to send her an example of his work dedicated to her Blonde girl resting is like flower in sunshine. But when she moves in affairs of men she may be like cat in mischief. Why not be happy to remain a flower. It doesn't quite scan and sounds like a threat but Marie liked it. Later Teniko's clerk who delivered the poem turns up quite dead what with having been shot with a twoeightthree automatic and stabbed with a long thin knife with a Japanese mark on the handle. Tenoki smilingly says of the clerk...he has contrived to get himself murdered in the canal zone. I forget what else happens but I'm sure I can watch a Charlie Chan or Mr. Moto panamacanal film and find out from the stockfootage.".

The part was originally offered to Lili Damita who turned it down because she could not stomach playing the part of a French traitress.A couple of years down the line and we have a new title a new French actress a new script and a new country to betray. Marie Galante is a French post office employee who gets shanghaied delivering a telegram to an arms smuggler. She eventually finishes up officially accused of being a stowaway and singing in a bar in Panama.But Panama City is a hotbed of spies and counter espionage. The counter spies are looking for an unsavoury character who turns up in trouble spots all over the world  only no one knows what he looks like. Naturally we try to guess who the person is only to find that the film makers have cheated by making him a character that doesn't appear until at least halfway though the film. Just for a change the Japanese is one of the good guys. Spencer Tracy is an expert on tropical diseases although we have guessed early on that he is not what he says he is. Marie Galante is tricked into spying against the USA rather than France.Probably because of the rewritten screenplay the denouement is a bit of a mess but the film has a happy albeit uncertain ending when the girl gets not only Spencer Tracy at the end but the Japanese as well! Ketti Gallian who plays the title role plays a stereotypical French girl. Her hair photographs badly. She is meant to be blonde but looks more like an albina. There is nothing particularly wrong with her acting except that it lacks the personality of a star.The film is perfectly watchable although it lacks the tension of a really good thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "As reported here Marie Galante is a French girl working with the French telegram public agency who after suffering several mishaps ends up singing in a caf in the Panama Canal Zone. She soon gets involved in a plot to destroy the canal a ship or a fleet. Marie Galante was based on a bestselling novel by Jacques Duval published in 1931 but when the screenwriters adapted it to cinema they fumigated the story and almost canonized Marie. In the original Marie Basilide is a poor girl from Bordeaux that is kidnapped and abandoned in Venezuela and who finally arrives in Panama where she prostitutes to achieve her goal of returning home. It was a mixture of espionage and sex and a reflection on French colonialism referring to the Panama Canal. The movie is anything but that maybe espionage and a little of prudish sex but no more. Referring to the synopsis what caught my attention most was the phrase caf in the Panama Canal Zone. Was this kind of place existent in the Canal Zone? I do not have the answer and I have no idea what the Zonians would do to have fun at night outside the barracks or homes in the military forts. I know that the city of Panam once had fancy cabarets where famous artists performed where Evita Pern sang and where soldiers and marines used to go. But I never heard of cafes or bars strictly speaking within the militarized Canal Zone. In my youth if I ever went to anything remotely similar it was a big wood yacht club on the banks of the canal where bands of American soldiers and Panamanians played rock and roll. In any case returning to Marie Galante the film was not as successful as expected though it is entertaining enough and director Henry King maintained the interest with discretion without becoming a great espionage opus. Nevertheless that did not prevent that a theatrical producer urged Deval to turn it into a musical the year the film was released. To that end the producer hired none other than Kurt Weill the master composer who collaborated with playwright Bertolt Brecht and author of the song Mack the Knife. But the frivolous Deval did not take the job seriously he went to the United States to have fun and did not really adapt his novel to the stage but directly transferred fragments of dialogue from the novel to the musical libretto with many sets to make any set designer crazy including a port with moving ships. The musical did not last a month in the theater. Efforts were made in 2009 to resurrect it and it was staged in Rome and New York. In the movies the novel had better luck when a new unacredited version was made by Fox in 1940 for the Charlie Chan series the quite appreciable Charlie Chan in Panama in which Sidney Toler was by far more entertaining and astute than Spencer Tracy in Marie Galante as the investigator who uncovers a plot to destroy the Panama Canal.".

Also to be especially relished are Leslie Fenton as Tenoki Robert Lorraine as Ratcliffe and the lovely vivacious Ketti Gallian as the beset heroine.

In other words there was great realism put in a story that is a famous farfetchedtype of tale. To be fair there are some scenes in which you wonder how the monster got where he did inside homes etc. without being seen....so to say there weren't SOME credibility issues would not be true...but overall no complaints here.I'd like to put a quick plug in here for the music too.

	schema:reviewBody "In the 90's there was a string of remakes following the classic universal monsters DraculaBram Stoker's Dracula The Wolf ManWolf The MummyThe Mummy and FrankensteinMary Shelley's Frankenstein. Sadly this is a more overlooked remake that I feel is a very strong movie. Not to deny any praise to the original Frankenstein from the 30's Boris Karloff's performance is still one of the best and it's still a very scary movie. But there was no Frankenstein film to come out that would remain true to it's original story. In high school we read Frankenstein and it brought up so many interesting conflicts where do you draw the line between living and playing God? Was Victor responsible for Elizabeth's death? Was the creature really a monster or just a victim? Kenneth Branagh took on this story and did an absolutely wonderful job.Victor Frankenstein is the son of the wealthy Baron and Caroline Frankenstein. At one point in his childhood Victor's parents adopted Elizabeth who would become the love of Victor's life. Years later Victor's mother dies giving birth to his brother William. Sometime before going off to the university a griefstricken Victor vows on his mother's grave that he will find a way to conquer death. On the night of his graduation Victor and Elizabeth promised to wed when Victor returns from his studies. He finds a friend in Henry Clerval and a mentor. Victor comes to believe that the only way to cheat death is to create life. Victor spends months in his apartment working on creating a living breathing creature. Using dead body parts from various sources he begins piecing a creature together. Late one night Victor finally gives his creation life but he recoils from it in horror and renounces his experiments. But it might be too late for him to take back what he shouldn't have messed with in the first place.Robert DeNiro did a great job playing The Creature what a heartbreaking role to take on and he plays it with such amazing sympathy. He says to Victor Did you ever consider the consequences of your actions? You made me and you left me to die. Who am I? and you seriously feel so much for him he is the true victim. As in the book and not in the original movie Victor does feel like a God when he is doing his experiments but when he succeeds he regrets it immediately. Kenneth did a wonderful job taking on this complicated man who isn't evil by any means but a victim of his own intelligence and wanting to cheat death. The supporting cast is wonderful with Helena Bonham Carter and Tom Hulce. The film can be a little over the top at times playing like a soap opera but when I read the book that's how I felt about the story as well. The sets the costumes and the make are just incredible. Frankenstein is an underrated gem and deserves a better look. It's one of the most intelligent horror stories of all time Kenneth put a lot of love into this film and I think Mary Shelley would be proud.910".

The Creature decides to revenge from Victor killing everyone that he loves.Frankenstein is an underrated version of the classic story. Directed by Kenneth Branagh the dramatic story was not well accepted by the professional critics and by many viewers. I saw this movie in 1995 and I have just saw it again on DVD and it is a great movie that has not aged. Unfortunately I have never read the novel by Mary Shelley to compare with this version that is considered the most faithful film adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Frankenstein de Mary Shelley Mary Shelley's Frankenstein".

However he realizes that his experiment is a mistake and he abandons The Creature expecting that it could die alone. however The Creature survives and learns how to read and write but he is a monster rejected by the society and by his own creator. The Creature decides to revenge from Victor killing everyone that he loves.Frankenstein is an underrated version of the classic story. Directed by Kenneth Branagh the dramatic story was not well accepted by the professional critics and by many viewers. I saw this movie in 1995 and I have just saw it again on DVD and it is a great movie that has not aged. Unfortunately I have never read the novel by Mary Shelley to compare with this version that is considered the most faithful film adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Frankenstein de Mary Shelley Mary Shelley's Frankenstein";

	schema:headline " Not your typical horror film  much much better";
	schema:reviewBody "spoilers hereinI saw this movie for the first time in the dark solitude of my attic late at night. I was trying to create a scary atmosphere for maximum effect To my surprise though after it finished I wasn't very frightened but very emotionally drained. I had expected Frankenstein to be your classic everyday lame horror film which you only watch to get some cheap thrills and see some horrible overacting. I didn't find it so at all.This movie was there is no other word for it beautifully done  a powerful dynamic story of how man attempts to achieve greatness but ends up ruining their lives and the lives of others as a result. I have not read Mary Shelley's book but if it has half the emotional effect of this movie I'll consider it time well spent!What really surprised me though was that this wasn't a horror film in the traditional sense of the word  it wasn't so that the monster would jump out and the audience would scream. It was more about how the audience would slowly writhe as they realize the tortured motivations of the creature and what he's willing to do as consequence.Kenneth Branagh brought this movie together wonderfully with both his directing and powerful memorable acting as the tormented Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Frankenstein is somewhat obsessed with death after losing his mother at an early age so he attempts to create a new form of artificial life derived from various body parts of corpses a life which cannot be so easily extinguished and is superior to normal human life in every aspect. except perhaps looking normal However he soon learns that it's not good to muck around with creating life when his creation attacks him and he abandons it. The creature although initially showing signs of being a sympathetic and caring soul quickly learns that the ways of man are harsh and judgmental so he swears revenge on his creator for bringing him into this world of isolation.The 'creature' was played absolutely masterfully by Robert De Niro. Before Frankenstein the only movies I had seen with him were Analyze This and Analyze That and those were comedies so it was difficult to see his skills as a serious actor but in playing Frankenstein's creation he created a character that is confused alone hostile manipulative and clever a very conflicted antihero. The scene at the end at Victor Frankenstein's funeral left me in shock by the sheer aura he projects  mixed hatred with compassion and confusion. In my opinion his best moment is when he meets the ship's captain who asks him 'Who are you?' and the creature nods to his dead creator and responds 'He never gave me a name.' If nobody felt the power in that line then I don't know what to say to them. I think De Niro deserved an Oscar or at least a nomination for this role.The supporting cast is also very good with Helena Bonham Carter doing a wonderful and chilling job as Frankenstein's wife another one who I think should have gotten an Oscar nod and John Cleese in probably the only downright serious role in his career being very creepy as Frankenstein's mentor who realized before that the moral implications of his kind of work cannot be lived with. Ian Holm as Baron Frankenstein was also good but sadly his part was underused. It would have been nice to see more of this great actor in this movie alongside all these other great actors. This isn't really a problem for the film as a whole Holm played a relatively minor character but I have a lot of respect for his acting skills and I would have liked to see more of them in this movie.This is probably one of the most powerful and draining movies I've ever seen in my life I was so impressed by it that I had to run out and buy the DVD right away. I realize this film has many critics who claim that it is 'seriously flawed'  I really can't understand what they're talking about. I guess some people are harder to please than others but I find it almost impossible to find anything wrong with this film. Perhaps it was expected that it would be more your traditional horror film but it really wasn't a horror movie  it was a character movie. It's true that there were some disgusting parts I won't go into specifics but you can probably get the idea but they seemed to merely add to the mood of the movie and increase your revulsion that Victor Frankenstein would have thought of creating such a monstrosity. For anyone who needs a good powerful movie that'll leave you drained and thoughtful this is THE movie for you!910".

	schema:reviewBody "Victor Frankenstein is the son of a famous doctor who watches his mother die in labour with his younger brother.  As an idealistic young man he travels to university to study to become a great doctor.  However he brings with him nonscientific teachings he has researched into life and the influence of electric currents.  His belief is supported by shadowy lecturer Dr Waldeman and Frankenstein continues his work and brings a man back to life using parts of other men.  Realising what he has done Frankenstein leaves his monster to die but the creature learns fast and wants revenge for his creation.I have seen far too many monster movies that all blur together and share the same focus on effects and gore than story or character.  So when this was promoted as being close to the original material dark and more of a story than a horror I was looking forward to watching it.  For the most part it sort of works but it's main flaw runs all the way through it like a stick of rock  it's far too worthy.  Or at least it thinks it is.  The film has a constant swell of dramatic music that is only ever seconds away and it really makes the film feel grander and more serious than it really is.  The film isn't scary but that wasn't a problem to me  it just has all these big worthy dialogue scenes with sudden pauses up comes the music and then lines.  It doesn't work and the film feels heavy and even dull as a result.This is never more evident than in Branagh's own performance.  He is far too dashing and too much of a young man gone wrong to be believed.  If he'd played it a little less worthy he would have been more of a human and less a cardboard type.  De Niro really tries hard and did well for me.  He may be stuck with a creature but it has been developed past the clich but not far enough perhaps.  I did feel for him and it was all De Niro's doing.  Carter is miscast both before and after  far to light and modern for the role Briers is OK but Cleese is way to miscast.  First of all the fact that he only appears half in shadows and when he opens his mouth the music comes up doesn't help but it didn't feel like him.  Quinn is a good cameo but the majority of the cast seem to have bought into the whole worthy' thing and are dulled as a result.Overall the film is worth watching because it is a good telling of the classic tale and De Niro does a good job of showing us the basic human behind the combined dead body parts.  If only Branagh hadn't been overwhelmed by the sheer importance of what he thought he was doing and had let the film flow and bit more and given in less to worthy music acting and directing.".

Quite a natural question for a film maker to be asked as the notions of theme and point of view are not optional they are mandatory. A director must decide beforehand on the ideas he wishes to set forth and craft the means to set them forth clearly. When dealing with a classic oftfilmed work he must choose a new slant and exploit themes that have not been emphasized before at least in quite that way if his work is to be at all original.Branagh's breezy response was something on the order of I didn't really have a theme in mind I just wanted to tell a good story.This is precisely why Branagh's version fails is an unanchored misguided mess. Herewith is a barely coherent hash of styles a series of boneheaded choices a snotty Helena B. Carter as the liberated Elizabeth Frankenstein a tangle of hanging threads  beautiful clothes with no one in them beautiful sets that form a backdrop to utter nonsense.And it is dreadfully miscast. Branagh's ego trip as Dr. Frankenstein aside the worst performance of all is that of Robert DiNiro as his creature. In this role DiNiro proves that Pauline Kael was right all along. For years Ms. Kael kept telling us that this mediocre talent was considered a great actor just because everyone said he was. In other words he had been in the right place at the right time and had stumbled into his undeserved reputation by pure chance. Check out the way he sleeps through his role in Casino. The spectacle of Frankenstein's creature mumbling in that repellent thick New Yorkese is really one of the sorriest moments in all of filmdom  there is simply no excuse for such a thing. Did anyone bother to tell him the story is set in Switzerland? I saw this movie in New York at an East Side theater and the audience was giggling nervously every time DiNiro opened his mouth. Why nervously? Because they know DiNiro is a great actor... Because they were embarrassed pure and simple.And they should have been. Branagh's desire to tell a good story while arrogantly disregarding the most basic elements of storytelling quite naturally produced the opposite effect. In short it produced an embarrassment.".

	schema:reviewBody "When the young Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein she would be far from imagining the impact that it would have. There are literally dozens of films that address that story but cinema never succeeded in making a film that reproduce original novel. This film is the one that comes closest to the book although it also presents changes. Many are very positive but some of them have no obvious purpose and should have been avoided. For example the character Clerval was so ignored that he virtually became a prop in the plot as well as the majority of Frankenstein's family. Even so its a meritorious effort and worthy of congratulations. Despite this the public is often mistaken in the judgment that makes of this film. As the name Frankenstein is strongly associated with horror public is led to think that this is just another horror film when its actually a drama. The deception leads some public who seeks horror to be disappointed with what they find but let me stress this this problem lies in the public and not in the film. We should try to understand a movie for what it is not what we expected to find.In addition to this effort to be faithful to the book the film presents excellent filming locations although some sets may have been better and more faithful to the period in which the story was placed. Frankenstein House hall for example with that huge staircase absurdly disagrees with the location chosen for the exteriors. Costumes on the other hand seem more acceptable and historically accurate. The cast is very strong. Of course with so many stars a lot of them didn't have the proper time to shine. Kenneth Branagh is very good in the lead although sometimes theatrical and unnatural Tom Hulce was mediocre in the role of Clerval because his character was very mistreated by the writer Ian Holm and Helena Bonham Carter were OK John Cleese Robert Hardy and Trevyn McDowell fulfilled but didn't delight us Robert De Niro did the most striking work in a melodramatic intense powerful and psychological portrait of a character who in other films was merely an instrument of horror.Despite these merits the film has a big flaw it's too melodramatic full of presumption selfimportance and aspirations of greatness. The emphatic dialogues and attitudes are very theatrical. Soundtrack is magnificent but its too insistent permanent and likes to appear too much. The movie is very good but it's far from being an epic and the problem lies in the fact that it looks like it wanted to be. And no one really likes excessive vanity.".

All the elements for a brilliant film were in place a perfect cast especially De Niro as the monster breathtaking locations and for once complete faithfulness to the real story. With nary a bolt or piece of green skin in sight Mary Shelley's classic tale of antiscience terror has never looked so great.It's just such a pity that it cannot make its mind up whether it wants to be a pure emotional drama or a straightforthethroat horror story. Robert De Niro lends his characters the right degree of emotion and subtlety and John Cleese surprises the stuffings out of me by showing that yes he really can act. Helena Bonham Carter gives a good performance that allows the rest of the cast something to work with but her role is sadly underdeveloped. Unfortunately all of these foundations are brought crashing down by Kenneth Branagh's overacting. Had the wild bursts of energy and madness been a little spaced out as is generally the case with the mentally ill a great deal of believability would have been salvaged. Unfortunately his performance as Victor Frankenstein turns what could have been a modern masterpiece into a sophomoric stage play with production values captured on celluoid.Having said that much it is wonderful to see that Hollywood has finally dismissed the childish imitation of Frankenstein that has plagued it since the 1930s. No more bolts no more stupidlooking makeup and no more idiotic poses. De Niro and Branagh bring the monster to life in such an elegant way that in the scenes when we see the monster struggle alone we just cannot help but feel for him. Indeed the scenes when the monster is chased out of the town by ignoramuses who believe him to be carrying the plague one has to wonder who the real monsters of this story are. Speaking as a mental patient who has never to this day been properly treated my favourite point of this film is the moment where Frankenstein confronts his creation. Hearing the son tell the father how the latter gave the former these major impulses and bursts of violent strength without teaching the poor creature how to deal with them rings so true for me that I still show this scene to the health professionals I try to educate from time to time.If I could sum up my comments on this film in a single phrase it would be that while we have a long way to go in realising the true horror element of this story Kenneth Branagh's effort stands head and shoulders above the pack. Well worth having a look at and the photography alone makes it worth owning on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kenneth Branagh took on quite a challenge with this film How do you top the original movie which while it hardly captured Mary Shelley's book was so well made for its time?  And how do you overcome the fact that for over 60 years your audience has been ingrained with the image of a boltedtempled grunting monster as professor Frankenstein's creation rather than Shelley's patchwork man?  Kenneth Branagh's solution is perfect leave the old classic behind and instead follow the book.  If only he had followed through until the end this movie could have been spectacular. Unfortunately Branagh took artistic license with the ending and flawed his masterpiece.  But the rest of the movie was too good to be completely overlooked because of a bad ending.  I love Branagh's portrayal of Professor Frankenstein.  He is brilliant passionate and sometimes visceral. Handsome in a scruffy sort of way I never did buy the squeakyclean neat Frankenstein.  I have always admired the talent of the classicallytrained Branagh.  DeNiro stepped out of his typical mobster character to play a Creature not monster which is the closest portrayal I have seen to Mary Shelley's creation.  I was actually impressed with DeNiro's performance because he was able to disguise himself.  When I heard he was cast as the Creature I halfexpected the mobster DeNiro to appear.  Luckily he did not.  And yes you sympathized with the Creature.  He was created then discarded to survive without guidance.  An ugly quilt of a man.  I enjoyed the chemistry between Frankenstein and Elizabeth.  Their love is very believable.  I'm glad they chose to delve into the development of the relationship from adoptive brother and sister to lovers.  This movie until the end is darkly and beautifully rich in Mary Shelley's writings.At one point I say Branagh even improved upon Shelley's work.  The character Justine is wrongfully accused of murder.  In the book to prevent further discord she is forced to falsely admit her guilt and is hanged. Branagh turned this instead into a lynching by an angry mob in the heat of the moment.  A much more acceptable scenario in my opinion.  But just as the audience is swept away but the brilliance of the film after Elizabeth is killed the movie loses its way.  As I watched I remember mentally screaming No! No! You were doing so well!  Stay with the book!  I was very disappointed with the conclusion of this work of art. That having been said this is still an intelligent very well made movie. You'll appreciate it more if you've read the book.  My rating  710 because it was a fabulous movie sans ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow this film is so inaccurate on so many levels. I read the book in 12th grade and I can't say I liked the story but that is not my beef with this movie. Why call it MARY SHELLY'S Frankenstein if its not based on her novel? The inclusion of the author's name implies more accuracy not less.Okay why is Frankenstein dancing on the mountains with his halfsister and a lightening pole? He was a medical student because of his mothers death not a random science enthusiast. His mother also died from illness not childbirth. Frankenstein's friend Henry was from his hometown not his school. And why did Kenneth Branagh feel the need to slick himself up in goo for the monstermaking scene? Also there was no need for the sex scene unless it was just to spice up the movie as Frankenstein and Elizabeth never had a chance to consummate their marriage. And what was with the whole trialgoneawry!?? It was supposed to be an unfair trail not a mobgonemad and throwing the girl off a cliff. Why was the monster going to secret meetings in ice caves? But the MOST ridiculous part was when Frankenstein tried to regenerate Elizabeth. She's DEAD and should stay that way! Why could he not make the one girl with the perfectly fine body come to life but magically when he hacks off her head and stick's on his lovers she sparks to life. And was it necessary to shave half her head in the process? The longer this movie went on the more i just wanted to laugh. It went so far off base it shouldn't have even been called Frankenstein let alone dared to include the author's name as if she'd given personal approval. Unless of course he knew it was so far removed people wouldn't recognize and confuse it with Bob Smith's Frankenstein.".

Why call it MARY SHELLY'S Frankenstein if its not based on her novel? The inclusion of the author's name implies more accuracy not less.Okay why is Frankenstein dancing on the mountains with his halfsister and a lightening pole? He was a medical student because of his mothers death not a random science enthusiast. His mother also died from illness not childbirth. Frankenstein's friend Henry was from his hometown not his school. And why did Kenneth Branagh feel the need to slick himself up in goo for the monstermaking scene? Also there was no need for the sex scene unless it was just to spice up the movie as Frankenstein and Elizabeth never had a chance to consummate their marriage.

For the love of god sit still so we can enjoy the movie guys.The characters are onenote and are usually yelling at someone or are very angry.If anything the editor should never receive another assignment. In the end though it is the director who is responsible for this mess. And therefore I will never watch a Kenneth Branagh film again!

The acting is decent from everybody and the movie is full of illustrious camera work set design and haunting music. What stands out more than anything however is Dr. Frankenstein's monster.Robert De Nero's performance is unique because instead of being a mindless hulk he plays the monster as more of a human being who can talk think and even read. He he does not just kill at random this creature has a purpose which is revenge on his creator for making him an ugly figure. The monster portrayal is the part of the film where it can get controversial. One of the problems with treating him this way is that there is a lacking fear factor. While he may be cunning and villainous there is no great sense of monstrosity to him. In fairness one could say that this creature sort of has a life of his own and should probably not be compared to the original Frankenstein monster. The make up job on De Niro is sensational and it really deemphasizes his mole. He is a whole new kind of Frankenstein.Kenneth Branagh's film does not fully honor Mary Shelley's classic masterpiece but it feels engaging and fresh and it shines new light on one of the most memorable literary creations of the 19th century.".

The picture contains brief remarks about Claus Graf Von Stauffenberg 19071944 but focusing mainly the July Plot.

Wickie was a famous actor and filmmaker  he directed Morituri The visitor  The longest day and the prestigious The bridge. Other versions about this fateful tale are  an American TV movie starred by Brad Davies and German adaptation titled 'Stauffemberg2004' with Sebastian Koch Christopher Buchold and directed by Jo Baier who bears special remembrance to 'Valkyrie' by Brian Singer with Tom Cruise  Tom Wilkinson and Kenneth Branagh.Adding more details over the widely described on the movie the deeds happened of the following manner In the early part WWII StauffenbergBernhard Wickie served with distinction as an officer in a Bavarian cavalry regiment in Poland France and North Africa where in 1943 he was deeply wounded. He was saved by the expert supervision of Dr. Ferdinand Germany's most famous physician. Reporting back for service he was appointed chief of staff of the Army Department. During his convalescence he revised his attitude . He made no secret of his utter contempt for Hitler and Nazism. He resented any form of totalitarianism especially National Socialism and criticized Hitler as the Antichrist.The meticulous Stauffenberg then decided to join the conspirators against Hitler with the goal of liquidating the Nazi regime and replacing it with a new social state that would maintain the good name of fatherland. Always impelled by Christian morality and angered by the excesses of Nazism Stauffenberg became the leader of the conspiracy. At the center of the plot were such senior officers as Gen. Von Tresckow chief of staff in Army Group Center on the Russian front Col.Gen Friedrich Olbricht head of supply Section of the Reserve Army  Major Gen. Erwin Van WitzleberErnst Fritz and General BeckDiehl. Added to these senior members were a number of younger officers who believed who Third Reich was a catastrophe for Germany and were willing to gamble their lives on the outcome of the plot. Others knew of the plot but did not take an active role in it. Among them were Field Marshal Erwin Rommelpopular war hero General Canaris and Field Marshal Hans Von Kluge army group commander in France. In March 1943 General Tresckow decided that the time had come for action. A Britishmade bomb time  disguised as a bottle of brandy was placed on the Fuehrer's plane  but the bomb failed to explode and it was never discovered. Then General Von Tresckow agreed with Stauffenberg that the assassination attempt must be made at all costs 'We must prove to the world and to future generations that the men of the German Resistance movement dared to take the decisive step and wager their lives on it'. When Hitler called a conference of his close military advisers at the headquarter at Rastenburg Staufffenberg arrived and in his briefcase along with papers and reports was a British time bomb.

	schema:headline " Fast moving film is as about as straight as you can get it";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of famed director Pabst's final films and is available under the title Jackboot Mutiny although it is actually titled It Happened on July 20th. Anyway as a film it is more or less a docudrama with little characterization or style. It looks like it could've been directed by any hack much less the renown G.W. Pabst. Expect nothing stylish or atmospheric cinematically but do expect an expert retelling of the events that unfolded on that day that a cabal of German officers attempted to kill Hitler and end the war. I've checked the details the film includes and they are right on the money. Much of the dialogue is lifted straight from historical records and there are no fictional characters added. The actor playing Goebbels looks much like him and the film intelligently dispenses with presenting an oncamera Hitler therefore eliminating the obvious distraction.

That's a heck of a story and it is told honestly but without any dramatic oomph. It is also confusing and with a running time of only 74 minutes it certainly could have spent a little extra time sorting some things out. As it is you can't make out at times who is who and doing what. That may be historically accurate but it is unhelpful to a viewer walking in on this story.

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of famed director Pabst's final films and is available under the title Jackboot Mutiny although it is actually titled It Happened on July 20th. Anyway as a film it is more or less a docudrama with little characterization or style. It looks like it could've been directed by any hack much less the renown G.W. Pabst. Expect nothing stylish or atmospheric cinematically but do expect an expert retelling of the events that unfolded on that day that a cabal of German officers attempted to kill Hitler and end the war. I've checked the details the film includes and they are right on the money. Much of the dialogue is lifted straight from historical records and there are no fictional characters added.

I wanted to see it after seeing the Tom Cruise version and amazingly Pabst film is identical on a beat per beat basis so much so that my wife asked if Bryan Singer who directed the Tom Cruise version had seen this film. Yet It Happened on July 20th is very different in other ways. It starts right before the Valkyrie plot begins rather than show the failed attempts on Hitler in advance and the blast that disfigured Stauffenberg. The Pabst film is fast paced very tight only 75 minutes and the focus is on the event less so Stauffenberg. Yet Stauffenberg takes center stage when he delivers the briefcase with the explosive and it is quite exciting. I have to say I liked this film very much even though it's not as emotional an experience as the new film. The Pabst film felt more authentic in that it was shot only 11 years after the actual event was shot Germany in black and white so they could blend in archival footage and of course the fact that everyone was speaking their native German language gave it an authenticity that the new film could never have. It seems both films followed the known facts very closely. I noticed actually no major differences other than some embellishments added for excitement in the new film. It Happened on July 20th is worth a look both for comparison purposes and just as a well made film on its own.".

Juli or It Happened on July 20th and there are many more German and English titles for this one is a West German film from 1955 so this one had its 60th anniversary last year. For the year 1955 it is not too uncommon that it is still in blackandwhite and has sound. Germany consisted of two countries at this point already and this film we have here is from the FRG i.e. West Germany. The cast includes a couple actors that may have been popular for their time but today almost everybody here is unknown. The only one I am vaguely familiar with is Bernhard Wicki who is also the lead actor. The star here is probably the director Georg Wilhelm Pabst was among the most lauded German filmmakers from the silent era and here we have one of his few German sound films. Some people with great history knowledge may realize immediately reading about the 20th July that this film is about the unsuccessful assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler's life led by a bunch of German soldiers especially Stauffenberg. It has elements you find in the films starring Koch and Cruise but there are also a couple scenes you may have seen in Der Untergang such as Hitler's famous meltdown that has been parodied on Youtube so many times. And we also hear Stauffenberg's famous last words. I personally thought it was a good watch. the film stays very essential at 75 minutes and works from start to finish for the most part rarely drags. Acting writing and direction are fine. I recommend this movie to everybody with an interest in blackandwhite films and in the years of Nazi Germany. Thumbs up.".

Silver Saddle is definitely not a bad or boring Spaghetti Western it is actually a fairly good movie and Giuliano Gemma plays the lead very good but I personally expected a little more from a Fulci Western particularly after great Tempo Di Massacro aka Massacre Time of 1966 with the great Franco Nero in the lead and the moving though sadistic Quatro Dell'Apocalisse aka. Four Of The Apocalypse which was maybe no Spaghetti Western masterpiece but which I personally liked a lot.Silver Saddle starts out very good when little Roy Blood witnesses the murder of his father by a henchman of the powerful Barrett Clan and subsequently subsequently shoots the murderer and takes his saddle which is adorned with silver. Grown up Roy Blood Giuliano Gemma has become a deadly gunslinger who still uses the silver saddle. After befriending a crook named Two Strike Snake Geoffrey Lewis Roy obtains an opportunity to kill the patriarch of the Barret Clan and therefore ultimately avenge his father's death. When Roy hides where he suspects his arch enemy however a little boy shows up instead. Some thugs try to assassinate the kid and Roy keeps them from doing so by shooting them all......and at this point things started to bother me. Cute little kids in bigger roles may work fine in many movies but they do certainly not belong into a Spaghetti Western directed by Lucio Fulci. The little kid was probably intended to be 'cute' andor 'funny' but I'm sorry to say this I just found the little brat annoying as hell and although he even admittedly is funny in some points of the film the whole movie could have been a lot better without him.Nevertheless Silver Saddle is entertaining in most of its parts. A Spaghetti Western enthusiast I have utmost respect for Giuliano Gemma for his performances in such films as Day Of Anger or The Price Of Power but I have never numbered Gemma among my favorite Spaghetti Western actors since he hardly ever embodied the typical antihero but was more of a typical 'good guy' in most of his films. Nevertheless Gemma fits perfectly in some roles and one has to say that his performance in Sella D'Argento is very good and I could hardly imagine anybody else playing the role of Roy Blood. Geoffrey Lewis also delivers a very good funny performance as Gemma's buddy Snake. The supporting cast furthermore contains two truly great Spaghetti Western regulars Donal O'Brien who only has a small role and Aldo Sambrell who once again plays a thuggish Mexican bandit. The locations are good the score is OK I especially liked Snake's theme the only parts I didn't like about the soundtrack were the parts with the singing. All said Silver Saddle has its flaws they should especially have left the little kid out and there is a lot of other unnecessary and silly cheese throughout the film but apart from that it is an enertaining if disappoining Spaghetti Western with a fair amount of action and violence in it. As a Spaghetti Western enthusiast I found it to be an enjoyable timewaster fans of Giuliano Gemma should give it a try. Don't expect too much though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lucio Fulci will probably always be best known for his gory zombie movies but he also directed some of the best films in the Giallo genre as well as a few other gems elsewhere. Fulci only directed three films in the popular Spaghetti Western genre and I for one am thankful for that as it was clearly not his strong point. His first attempt at the genre Massacre Time was an above average western if not especially brilliant. Four of the Apocalypse was well made but frankly dull which brings us on to this film which is more exciting slightly than Fulci's last effort but too sappy for a western and too lacking in important areas. The plot is very typical for a Spaghetti Western and focuses on a man who as a child witnessed his father being killed. He grows up to become a bounty hunter going by the name of Silver Saddle and naturally he wants revenge and starts plotting once he finds the people behind his father's death. However he ends up coming across the young son instead and after thwarting an assassination on the boy sets off for his revenge.The music is generally a very important element of the Spaghetti Western and again it's a place where this one is seriously lacking. The score is simply horrible. What we get is a singer droning on about the plot of the movie and it will do nothing but make you cringe! Ennio Morricone this isn't. The film seems all too keen to shy away from the stuff that usually makes this genre so great  namely violence and action and instead decides to put its focus on the relationship between the central bounty hunter character and his enemy's nephew a young and irritating blonde haired kid. This relationship may be interesting for some but personally I found it very boring and it wasn't what I went into this film looking for. There are a few action scenes but nothing particularly startling and the way the film moves is rather boring far too often. Prolific Spaghetti Western star Giuliano Gemma takes the lead role and is one of the film's few saving graces as he puts in a believable performance. The ending is rather decent too and wraps things up nicely but this is not a great western unfortunately.".

In fact even if star Giuliano Gemma perhaps best known for two Ringo Westerns is given the possibility of a couple of romances the central relationship involves him and the young nephew of his sworn enemy! As such it emerges as unremarkable but surprisingly engaging with a pleasant soundtrack and able support from Geoffrey Lewis as Gemma's sidekick a more likable version of the slimy bountyhunters played by Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones in Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH 1969 Ettore Manni as the chief villain and Aldo Sambrell as a Mexican banditleader.".

	onyx:emotionText "The third and last of Fulci's Spaghetti Westerns coming at the tailend of the genre  not up to the vintage MASSACRE TIME 1966 but preferable to the disappointing and unpleasant THE FOUR OF THE APOCALYPSE 1975  with a distinct kiddie interest since the violence isn't particularly graphic. In fact even if star Giuliano Gemma perhaps best known for two Ringo Westerns is given the possibility of a couple of romances the central relationship involves him and the young nephew of his sworn enemy! As such it emerges as unremarkable but surprisingly engaging with a pleasant soundtrack and able support from Geoffrey Lewis as Gemma's sidekick a more likable version of the slimy bountyhunters played by Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones in Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH 1969 Ettore Manni as the chief villain and Aldo Sambrell as a Mexican banditleader.";

	schema:reviewBody "While Italian movie director Lucio Fulci is best known for his bloody horror movies he actually did dabble in other genres in his career. He even made a few spaghetti westerns Silver Saddle being one of them. Made when the spaghetti western genre was breathing its last breath it's been all but forgotten today. To a degree I can understand this. It does have more than its share of dull spots and Giuliano Gemma is only adequate in the lead role. But the movie all the same has enough interest to satisfy spaghetti western fans. Fulci throws in some interesting direction at times such as with some particular camera movements as well as how he composes what's in front of the camera. Though there isn't enough action what action there is in the movie does catch your attention particularly with some very bloody squibs thrown in. Gemma's somewhat underwhelming performance is made up for by the presence of American actor Geoffrey Lewis who is amusing without being overbearing. And the music is great you'll be humming the title song for days after watching the movie. It's no classic but it's a respectable final effort for a genre that was breathing its last.".

The musical score overall is great and befits the feel and tone although the hippydippy theme song may mar it for some.For fans of Fulci andor Italian westerns from the 70's this is more than worth checking out...between this and Four... it's obvious the guy was up to something interesting and cool with his westerns during this time period it's just too bad he didn't have a better sense of pacing and focus and evidently wasn't aware that you save your best tricks for the end of the movie not the beginning.".

This movie is a dud dragged down by a lead who lacks the hardened charisma needed for a role of a lone cowboy bent on revenge and living off the rough terrain. Giuliano Gemma looks like he should be picking up gals or maybe even men in some Euro disco circa 1978. The fact that Gemma is wearing more makeup than a saloon hooker doesn't make matters any better. Maybe in the days of grainy VHS tapes it could pass unnoticed but that hidef picture quality is unforgiving and our hero is plainly wearing eyeliner and blue eye shadow and more foundation than a drag queen. But what really sinks the whole production is the music there is this theme song that is so unbelievably sappy corny and ridiculous that I thought it must be some kind of joke. And the song is played again and again...and AGAIN throughout the movie. This fitfully dire song completely destroys a movie that wasn't any good to begin with. The story concerns a lame revenge plot he sees his father killed in the beginning of the movie grows up and seeks revenge. Original huh?After watching the amazing Massacre Time and thoroughly enjoying the intelligently written and realized Four of the Apocalypse I felt like I had to search our Lucio Fulci's lessknown Silver Saddle. Now I know why it's so obscure it sucks..".

	schema:reviewBody "This fairly late entry to the western genre is fairly typical of its sort kept lively thanks to some interesting characters and wellstaged shootouts in the desert. The twistyturny plot  almost episodic in nature  concerns the trials and tribulations of the bizarrely named Roy Blood who began his life at 10 years old when he witnessed his father getting shot dead in cold blood by a crook. Picking up his father's fallen gun he shot the man in the back and thus the legend of the Silver Saddle was born a man who brings death and destruction wherever he goes.Director Lucio Fulci taking a break from his more usual horror fare keeps the events pacy and invests the many shootings and murders with his trademark penchant for exaggerated violence with bullets entering faces and chests although don't expect any of the gory special effects he brought to the crime thriller CONTRABAND. He also keeps the eye closeups and zooms to a bare minimum although the film is not totally lacking in them. The fastpaced story concentrates on incident over dialogue which is a plus and also which makes it a very easy viewing experience.The film's biggest flaw is probably the overly cheesy theme song which keeps on recurring throughout the movie although it did make me burst into laughter every time it kept popping up. The shootouts are extended and well staged throwing in imaginative props like carbide bombs into play along with lots of explosions and stunt work. Other unusual ingredients include a kite acting as a rescue beacon ! and a monastery of monks getting slaughtered and hanged what with this and CODENAME WILDGEESE I'm beginning to think Italian directors have something against religious pillars of the community.Another problem is with the film's lead the wooden Giuliano Gemma who bears an uncanny resemblance in profile to James Woods. Gemma isn't that bad but he fails to make his leading character likable so its hard to get enthused about his actions. To make up for this we have a strong supporting cast including Ettore Manni as a baddie the surprisingly likable Sven Valsecchi as the kidnapped kid who has a prominent part despite looking annoyingly cute like the kids in Fulci's horror films he's actually not a bad actor and sympathetic with it and Cinzia Monreale as the damsel in distress.On top of this good ol' Dr Butcher himself Donald O'Brien appears as a hired hand while genre favourite Geoffrey Lewis puts in another excellent and charismatic turn as Two Strike Snake an unlucky thief who enjoys picking the pockets of the dead. Lewis' strong turn is one of the film's highlights. Despite treading much the same ground as many other westerns SILVER SADDLE is a fresh and entertaining movie with a plot complex enough to stay interesting yet without getting muddled and one which I thoroughly enjoyed watching.".

Geoffrey Lewis who's the father of Juliette Lewis and who has been in a whole bunch of Clint Eastwoodmovies and other minor or major films appears in a role as a sleazy guy called 'Snake' I didn't even notice his name on the cast because they had like 7 or 8 Italian nonames listed ahead of him!! I thought he should have been at least the thirdhighest placed person on the cast overview list.The movie made me laugh a couple of times even though I don't think it was intentionally by the director except the hilarious ending which blew my mind completely!.. It was a truly amazing scene one that saved the entire movie in my opinion...I give the first part of the movie 13 points because I thought the daddykiller looked like Johnny Cash and he's cool the middle section 24 points because I was glad to see at least ONE familiar face in the movie G. Lewis and the ending I give 23 Well you'll have to see it to believe it... even though some might think it is very ridiculous!..All in all a pretty average western with a hokey plot but okay if you don't have anything better to do with your time.510".

Many of them have certain noticeable deficiencies in the content's sectoryet despite this poor content they are wellmade and likable. The one I have chosen here looks very lowbudget it has some qualities that make it very enjoyable and a must for all Gemma fans. It shares with other similarly themed films the same desolate barren landscape and notions of a dehumanized society.To describe it in one word Silver Saddle is a somewhat cartoonish nonstop adventure western. Very compact and concise  while the content itself is quite average the kidnapping and ransoming of a boy. Allow me here a parenthesis to mention that the western as a genre meant to meat first comics in Romanian and French magazinesthen books novelsFrnculescu ReidMay and Cooper in the third place movies . So I guess I especially enjoy this comic book look of the westerns.In a certain sense I like Gemma more than Nero. He has if I may say so a more interesting presence . Sella d'Argento 1978 came one year after California 1977 another good Gemma westernand two years after The Desert of the Tartars. It marks the end of Gemma's career as a western mythical actoras well as that of the European westerns as such. These movies are still considered like something of a guilty pleasureand still don't receive the esteem they deserve.Sella  is a quite straightforward western nononsense and violent there is a scene of cruelty when a kid is whipped by Garrincha. The tone is fortunately deprived of melodrama. Some of the characters are comic or funny or do comic thingsSerpent who is comic but in a grim way and the kid.The silver saddle in this film is an item belonging to Roy Blooda gunman played by the cultactor Gemma.The score that accompanies the suspense moments is very good the song with English lyrics a la Keoma is less happily chosen.At least six of the characters are noticeableRoy Blood himself his partner Serpent Turner Sheba Margaret and the kid.Creatures bizarre and grotesque yet somehow always familiaras Nathan M. Powers once happily wrote about Lem's world of Ijon Tichy.Like in many other Italian westerns there is a strange uncanny atmosphere.It is Lucio Fulci's film.".

Germany's postwar society found it almost impossible to talk about all the suffering of the people air raids destroyed each and every town and killed over 600.000 inhabitants over 2.000.000 died during the last month of the war while fleeing from the Russians and countless were deported to Russia.'Nacht fiel ueber Gotenhafen' is a very brave film tactful and true to the facts.

	schema:reviewBody "Nacht fiel ber Gotenhafen or Darkness Fell on Gotenhafen is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1960 so this one is already over 55 years old. It was written and directed by Frank Wisbar one of the most impactful German filmmakers between 1955 and 1960 so this one here is possibly his last fairly famous work. There were color movies already by 1960 but still it should not come as a surprise to anybody that this is one of the many blackandwhite films. But it has sound of course this addition existed for a long time at that point already. I cannot say I am particularly familiar with any of the actors from this 100minute film here except Wolfgang Preiss maybe. And he appeared in many films that attempted to come to terms with what happened during World War II in Germany. Most of the film's action takes place when Germany had already lost the war and the Russians were coming. Germany and its citizens were in no man's land at this point already. Some kept fighting some kept believing some surrendered and very many just tried to live. This was what everything was about. And this is also one of the core plot elements of this film we have here. Another would be the sinking of the Gustloff which is the central element of the last third of this film an important historic event. Unfortunately I myself am not too interested in films that are too much about the military and this is also the case here. Apart from that the film has one major problem namely the fact that it is just way too much for 1 hour and 40 minutes too many characters too much happens too many plot changes etc. Wisbar should have given the movie a lot more focus and just less action in general. The character elaborations also suffered from that and the result was that it was hard to care for anybody in here really despite all the gruesome things happening. These are the reasons why I did not enjoy the watch too much. And why I give this film a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

This movie moves very slow as do a lot of Lenzi's films and is acted quite badly. But then again the actors didn't have much of a script to go off of. Unlike Lenzi's other classics like Cannibal Ferox or Nightmare City this movie really doesn't hold your interest at all. With Nightmare City the gore was silly and the acting stupid but it was entertaining because the movie didn't stop and the same goes for Cannibal Ferox. This movie on the other hand had may be 3 decent scenes of gore most of which had someone getting an eye poked out and the rest of the film is talking filled with bad background music. The only thing that kept my interest at all was the costuming for the demonszombies. They looked genuinely kind of creepy.

Most people would argue that Nightmare City is a zombie film as well but Lenzi has stated it's about infected people. I'm inclined to agree.There really isn't anything particularly memorable about Black Demons. The zombies look pretty darn cool chains and all. We are also treated to a couple of entertaining eye trauma scenes and a bloody stabbing to the throat. They are the highlights of the movie which really is a shame since the story actually has a lot of potential. I mean black zombies coming back and killing white people just screams fun. It would have been great to see Lenzi option for a politically incorrect movie to shake the establishment. Perhaps the zombies could have utilized some of the oppressive tools used on them once upon a time? Unfortunately he doesn't and we're left with a rather mediocre effort. That means a terrible film to nonhorror aficionados. The most remarkable thing about Black Demons is that it's from 1991 when the look all the way only suggests the 80s. I know remnants from previous decades always linger but this one takes the prize. You could do worse but wouldn't you rather watch a better Italian zombie flick? Bruno Mattei's excellent Hell of the Living Dead or even Zombie 4 After Death are both better choices.Shriek Show provides us with a Lenzi interview where he mostly dismisses the movie and criticizes the actors. Good stuff.".

Everything about this movie the title the box art the dialogue is so politically incorrect that I had to check it out. Let me tell you right away it's bad Laughably bad. Black Demons is about a Macumba voodoo ritual that brings back six slaves the titular demons who were blinded and hung for trying to escape. Now they must kill six white people to rest in peace I guess. The film doesn't really give you a lot to go on. Most of the expository dialogue is given by Jose whose English is not so good. At the same time his performance is the best part of the movie. Just watch his death scene. It's the apex of perfection Oscar worthy even. Another noteworthy aspect is the bouncing Molotov cocktails that explode like grenades. If you check out this DVD be sure and watch Lenzi's interview it's the highlight of the disc. In it he talks about how disappointing this movie turned out and dogs all of the actors except for Joe Baloghand he's never been so right. Also in the interview Lenzi would have you believe that this is the only zombie movie he made stating that Nightmare City was about radioactive people. Why kid yourself Umberto? Nightmare City is more of a zombie film than Black Demons is! The only reason I bought Nightmare City is because it is a classic piece of zombie trash cinema. Sadly Black Demons is not.We're heading for the year 2000 in a sophisticated technological civilization and you're asking us to believe in a vendetta of the living dead?".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is supposedly the second sequel to Lamberto Bava's fun eighties trash flick 'Demons' although I'd say it's more like a lacklustre version of Lucio Fulci's zombie masterpiece 'Zombie FleshEaters'. Umberto Lenzi is undoubtedly one of Italy's most diverse and interesting directors but like many of the best his career took a downfall towards the end of the eighties and it's hard to believe that the same man who directed such cult classics as Seven BloodStained Orchids and Almost Human also directed this film. The fact that this film is touted to be the third entry in the series started by Lamberto Bava is forgotten about when it comes to the plot as the film really has nothing to do with the earlier series entries and this is shown again by the fact that Lambero Bava's own 'The Ogre' is also known as Demons 3! The story here follows three kids who travel to Brazil. One of them is into voodoo and uses his knowledge of the art to raise a load of dead black slaves. It's not long before the three kids and some other people in the vicinity have a big flesh eating problem on their hands! The problem with this film is that it doesn't have anything in the way of surprises and while there's some nice gore including some good gory Fulci style eye gouging the film is seriously lacking. If you're tuning in for gore only as you probably should be you're also likely to be disappointed as the gore isn't relentless and there are only really a couple of memorable scenes. Bad acting is something you have to expect from a film like this but with Black Demons Umberto Lenzi has taken that expectation to a whole new level with some truly diabolical performances from all concerned. The film starts off slowly which puts itself on the back foot as I was already starting to get bored of it before the gore even showed up. One thing that the film does do well however is hark back to the classic style of filming. The production values are a little better than Fulci's 1979 classic but the basics of the film are the same. I can't say many good things about the zombie makeup and they're nothing like the demons in Lamberto Bava's film. Overall this movie isn't very good but it's fairly fun at times and I preferred it to Demons 2 at least.".

What is interesting is the zombies and the special effects. I don't think I've ever seen real afroamerican zombies before so this was a new exciting thing. They look really frightening and extreme especially one of them. The deaths in the movie are quite gruesome. I give the movie 9 out of 10 points for being such a nostalgic shot from the hip. The thing that prevents me from giving it a 10 is that the scenes of dialogue have no charm  and that's because it's from 1991...so no funny men in funny moustaches who say hilarious things.".

Six dead slaves rise from the grave to have their revenge.First let me say something good about the movie. The DVD cover for this flick was great. It has a drawing of a guy on his knees in a graveyard. Standing in front of him are various members of the living dead. There are seven zombies on the cover while the movie makes a big deal about there being only six. A small nitpicking point but it's still a cool comic booklike cover. It sucked me in. There were a few scenes of carnage in this movie. Not enough to get overly excited about but they were there. They had one effect where they popped a girl's eye out and let it dangle from her skull. Popping eyes are good.Unfortunately this movie is pretty bad. If there was an excessive amount of gore I could have forgiven any other defects. But there is not nearly enough of the red stuff so I have to give Black Demons the finger.Where did they get this cast? It was the most jumbled mix of misfits ever assembled. I understand there are budget limitations for a Bmovie but give me a break. The bad brother was American. His sister was half English. She was dating an Englishman. They stayed at a house with three people of undeterminable accents. The man who ran the house could barely speak English. I had no idea what he was saying half of the time and the filmmakers conveniently let him do most of the talking. Genius!Basically Black Demons problems can be summed up in two words NO MONEY. No money for pretty girls to run from demons. No money for nudity although I'm not sad about that since the cast was uniformly unattractive. No money for excessive zombie gore effects. In conclusion no money for a movie yet they went ahead and made one anyway.Umberto Lenzi has made some great horror flicks. Nightmare City is one of my favorites. That was exciting and gory.

	schema:reviewBody "Black Demons 1991  12 out of 4 Italian horror flick has a group of people stranded in an old mansion in Brazil when black zombies not demons begin to attack them. All of this is brought on because a stupid brother went to witness a voodoo act which now has the black zombies not demons out willing white folks. To say I was disappointed in this film would be a major under statement as I'm usually a fan of Lenzi's films. The Italian horror genre was already dead and buried by the time this film was released and the producer's even released it as Demoni 3 to I guess cash in on the two Lamberto Bava films. Those expecting gore are going to be letdown because there's actually not too much of it. We get one good scene where a victim has her eye ripped out and another throat slashing but outside of these scenes the gore is pretty low. This is the type of film we've seen countless times before and I was rather shocked that Lenzi didn't throw anything original into the mix or at least try to make this film fly better. It takes thirtyminutes for the first murder to take place and then we have to wait nearly another thirtyminutes for the next. The film is full of really bad dialogue including one scene where the owner of the mansion finds his maid doing black magic and he punishes her by making her go to her room just like she was a kid! The performances are all rather bland which is to be expected but the fault of the film's failure has to go back on the director. The film looks very poorly done and there isn't any of the director's typical style.".

Wait until one scene where Jessica's boyfriend Kevin is attacked by the zombies.  These are the slowest moving zombies on the planet.  Yet when they attack the victims just cringe stand there and are resigned to their fate.  Instead of simply running away Kevin ducks under the blade but remains in place dancing around the slow zombie blows.  It would have been so easy to leisurely jog away he wasn't even surrounded.  It's almost like he is doing his best to make it look exciting but just can't pull it off.  And Jose's death!  Hahahaha!  What a riot!  You can clearly see him breathing when he is supposed to be dead. The whole movie was so fake it was worse than professional wrestling!And yet they made an effort to really play up the voodoo aspect the ceremony was well done the music was good it was simply the cheesiest acting in film history.

The demons in Demons 3 technically aren't demons neither but at least more demonic than ogres. Is anyone still following the logic here? No didn't think so. Demons ladies and gentlemen is the franchise infamous for NOT featuring anything even remotely resembling a storyline or tensionbuilding just buckets and buckets of gore! For this third venture into the universe of horribly nauseating demonterror Umberto Lenzi taking over the director's seat from his pal Lamberto Bava admirably attempted to come up with a slightly more ambitious screenplay. It's of little use however because the incoherence and senselessness begins to show within the first twenty minutes already. Five young persons tourists? Scientists? Anthropology students? become involved in South American voodoo practices and without much further ado the mansion where they're staying is overrun by hideous black zombies craving for flesh and blood. You can say a lot about Italian horror directors but not that they're discriminating anyone. The zombies in part three are resurrected black slaves with their minds set on vengeance even if this means extracting it nearly a whole century overdue. Enough about the absent intellectual values and deeper morals of Demons let's just talk about what really matters Gore! The makeup effects are awesome plentiful and nauseating enough to make even the strongest stomachs churn. The first mentionable gory scene shows a girl thankfully the worst actress of them all who's eyeball is ripped out of the socket nice and notsoclean! The image is so sickening that it would even make Lucio The Eyeball Master Fulci himself proud and emotional. The great gore also serves another purpose namely to distract you from the painfully awful acting performances the amateurish dialogs and the horrid clichsayings like We're on the threshold of the 21st Century. Do you really expect us to believe in Voodoo. Yuck! The makeup on the zombies is particularly terrific. Please note how I keep talking about zombies instead of about demons because that's what they are! Dead folks emerging from their graves and decomposing further as they slowly and aimlessly totter along. Actual demons like the ones in Bava's previous two films are hyperactive and unstoppable creatures from hell itself. Not intending to give a lecture here just pointing out fairly important and relevant details. Now that we're splitting hairs anyway the script repeatedly speaks of six cursed black slaves but the DVD cover depicts seven friendly fellas! And did you know you can only be 100 sure that a girl went missing if at least two pairs of shoes remained behind?".

Now the movie instead is being for most part very lackluster and you just constantly keep waiting for something good to happen.

Not that any of the previous two movies featured some impressive performances in them but the acting in this movie is so bad that it becomes an annoying aspect about the movie.You could admire the movie for trying something different this time around but it feels more as if the movie its script got written for a totally different movie and this never was supposed to be a part of the 'Dmoni' series in the first place.

The film has a man appropriately named Dick. You will never know what the heck Dick was trying to accomplish in this film as he is just what his name says. He wants to attend a ceremony for reasons that are known of our business or they may have been and I just could not hear them because at times you could not understand anything anyone was saying. Well he sees the ceremony and the next day heads out with his sister and her boyfriend and they end up stranded at a house where Dick promptly raises the dead for obscure reasons. You know what happens then right? Hordes of zombies come crashing the house devouring the occupants! No not quite as these zombies are the most tepid slow and boring zombies ever brought upon the silver screen! At one point it looks as if the zombie is going to stab some guy and he backs off twice when it hears something. What zombie backs off from an attack? The boring zombies of Black Demons that is who! Seriously all the people could have escaped with the exception of a girl who seemed to think that the best defense against zombies is to back oneself into a corner screaming no! rather than running. They also almost drove away till the driver drives the car off the road and into a ditch and it sure looked like he planned that one let me tell you! So a very slow moving zombie film with slow moving zombies and very slow characters. Very little gore and no nudity worth speaking of an utter disappointment to say the least. I expect more cheese in an Italian zombie film.".

At one point it looks as if the zombie is going to stab some guy and he backs off twice when it hears something. What zombie backs off from an attack? The boring zombies of Black Demons that is who! Seriously all the people could have escaped with the exception of a girl who seemed to think that the best defense against zombies is to back oneself into a corner screaming no! rather than running. They also almost drove away till the driver drives the car off the road and into a ditch and it sure looked like he planned that one let me tell you! So a very slow moving zombie film with slow moving zombies and very slow characters. Very little gore and no nudity worth speaking of an utter disappointment to say the least. I expect more cheese in an Italian zombie film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like most Italian horror flicks this Lenzi gem from 1991 is subliminally terrifying.Yes the acting is bad. Yes the dialog is cheesy. Yes the makeup is pretty laughable. But Black Demons given the right set of eyes and an open mind it about as close to a nightmare on film as you want to see.Upon my initial viewing it was hard to get my mind off of the negative aspects of the film. After a couple more viewings I noticed some things that stood out to be scary. For example nothing is explained about Dick's decent into the black magic it just kind of happens. All of a sudden his sister is a target. I know it doesn't make much sense but it's still scary the way Lenzi put it together. Also how do these kids end up in the jungle in the first place? The setting is damn good. That house definitely has the creepy factor going for it. In fact lots of the imagery in this movie is creepy as hell.I guess what I'm saying is for fans of Italian horror give this one a chance. I don't think it was intended to be seen as a realistic film. It is more like a nightmare captured on film. If you've ever woken terrified from a nightmare in your sleep and thought 'dude I should write that down...' you know what I mean. Kudos to Lenzi for having the guts to film it. I liked it more than anyone else on here I guess.8 out of 10 kids.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fourth installment of Amando De Ossorio's 'Blind Dead' series La Noche De Las Gaviotas aka. Night Of The Seagulls is a very creepy Spanish Horror Exploitation flick and after the great original the second best part of the series.When Dr. Henry Stein Vctor Petit and his wife Joan Mara Kosti come to a fishing village in the middle of nowhere where Henry is to replace the old local doctor the locals seem hostile and refuse to talk to the young couple. The young couple hear strange noises at night and after they employ a local girl Lucy Sandra Mozarowsky they begin to find out why the locals are not so keen on talking to strangers. The little village is haunted by the Living Dead. Devilworshiping Templars who had been blinded and executed for their evil habit of sacrificing young women and drinking their blood in order to gain eternal life in medieval times rise from their graves for seven nights every seven years. And the villagers have to pay a horrible price to the blind dead for sparing their village...Night Of The Seagulls is not quite as great as Lan Noche Del Terror Ciego aka Tombs Of The Blind Dead the first part of the series but it is definitely a very entertaining horror flick and creepy as hell. The performances are better than in the second and third part Vctor Petit and Mara Kosti are good in the leading roles and Sandra Mozarowsky who was only 16 when this film was made and who sadly committed suicide at the age of only 18 in 1977 fits into the role of Lucy very well. Amando De Ossorio definitely invented some of the horror cinema's creepiest creatures when he created the Blind Dead and these evil Templars are once again scary as hell. This fourth installment of the series is in my opinion actually the secondcreepiest part after the first. The incredibly eerie score was one of the greatest aspects of Tombs Of The Blind Dead and since it worked so well with the first one Amando De Ossorio wisely used it for all of the sequels too. And I couldn't imagine any other score that would fit as well into Night Of The Seagulls as this eerie choir which manages to even intensify the creepiness and suspense. The last part of the Blind Dead series and the secondbest to the first Night Of The Seagulls is a creepy and amazing little film that no lover of Eurohorror can afford to miss!".

	schema:reviewBody "You should be ashamed of yourself for voting this particularly unique entry into the horror canon a 5.4! The Blind Dead quadrilogy is unique in that the 4th film might be the best of the series at least in my mind after just recently watching all four. Most trilogies or quadrilogies fail to meet up to expectation in the third or fourth installment but I think this one might be the most interesting of the Blind Dead series. Amando de Ossorio expands and enriches the evil mythology of the Templar Knights and their use of black magic giving it a much more disturbing quality than seen in the previous three films.Technically this film is better photographed has better acting and truly delivers characters you believe in and empathize with. Also the Blind Dead creatures move with more fluidity than seen in the previous three. My only concern with this box set is the lack of the original voice track with subtitles included perhaps that is why these kind of films get rated so low. I admit the voice over work can be hard to listen to especially when you have lines from a 25 year old girl being read by a 55 year old voice over artist. The scene of Teddy Jose Antonio Calvo peering in through the bedroom window leaves a lasting impression especially after we see local boys pushing him from the cliff. It's a striking scene because it shows a village with a history with the Knights Templar so long that they have begun to imitate the Knight's evil ways. Usually I really like the darker horror film endings seen in Tombs of the Blind Dead and the Ghost Galleontruly great nihilistic contributionsbut i was actually hoping for a happy ending in this one. And you can almost see this film as a piece of AntiTotalitarian agitprop if you really think about it. One small family overturns a long tradition of systematized brutality that saves an entire village. I think this film is smarter than people give it credit for. I can honestly say I prefer this film to Tombs of the Blind Dead. This is definitely worth returning to. 9 out of 10 Stars.".

But this final answers allot of questions left open in the first three films. Plus it comes to a great climax scene which I will not give away. You'll have to see it to believe it. The dubbing was pretty good the voice over actors do a good job they stay loyal to original script without any major changes that I can tell. I might be wrong on that.

Night of the Seagulls is more mysterious and atmospheric than the other films and De Ossorio also throws in an compelling albeit unoriginal outsidersinaclosedcommunity sub plot. Young doctor Henry and his wife Joan arrive in a remote seaside village where they're given a VERY unfriendly reception by the oddly behaving locals. Only the town's nut Teddy and maiden beauty Lucy make acquaintance with the new arrivals and also inform them about the village's inescapable pact with the undead Templar Knights. For seven nights every seven years the villagers have to sacrifice their virgin daughters to these eyeless zombies during a nocturnal ceremony on the beach. Okay granted the sacrifice element in the story is definitely not new and the Templars are given less screen time than usual but still this is a genuinely creepy exploitation highlight! You can either begin to sum up all the shortcomings and stupidities in the script and yes there are quite a lot of them or enjoy the tense atmosphere and unique filming locations instead! The very weakest moments of the film  like that horribly lame ending  are somewhat more difficult to forgive but there's graphic gore and sleaze to make up for that. By the way did you know that skeletons that are dead for more than six centuries still bleed when you destroy them? Oh yeah massively even! Throughout filming four similar movies Amando De Ossorio's directing always remained solid the choreography was always stylish the music was always petrifying and the acting performances were always above average! That's definitely praiseworthy too. Every single entry in the Blind Dead saga is highly recommended to every true horror fan.".

Into this setting come the intrepid young doctor Henry Stein Victor Petit and his lovely wife Joan Maria Kosty.

It's as beautifully atmospheric as the best in the genre. Director Amando de Ossorio who'd done all the previous entries is in his element and he crafts an effectively macabre outing. It's not going to be nearly gory enough for some viewers but dwelling on the graphic violence is clearly not de Ossorios' priority this time around. It's all about the mood and the style.One can hardly fail to notice that there is an absence of strong primary colours therefore the picture doesn't exactly pop. It's done in a true black  white film in colour manner. The music score by Anton Garcia Abril is sometimes repetitive but overall it's eerie. The admittedly simple story plays like a nightmare come to life.The acting is generally engaging Henry and Joan are obviously not the brightest bulbs in the drawer but they're not unlikable. Both Petit and Kosty are fine. Standing out are Sandra Mozarowsky as the brave Lucy who's willing to befriend the couple defy her peers and divulge as much exposition as she knows and Jose Antonio Calvo as the much abused town simpleton Teddy for whom it's not hard to feel sympathy. The Knights Templar are as spooky and hideous as they've ever been.Well worth watching for genre buffs.Seven out of 10.".

But this eclectic disparate air only manages to lend the film a freshness missing from previous outings in the series. One thing that I was always curious about is that while the Knight Templars are always seen to wear white in the 'flashback' sequences the resurrected Blind Dead are clad in grayishbrown cloaks perhaps the color white was thought to give them too benign a look? Although this was officially the last of The Blind Dead films infamous Spanish filmmaker Jesus Franco apparently made his own version of the tale in LA MANSION DE LOS MUERTOS VIVIENTES 1982 unfortunately I missed out on a chance to rent this on DVDR while I was in Hollywood a couple of weeks ago!".

This is one of the best lowbudget horror movies of the seventies. It does contain many mistakes of course but that is to be expected in this type of movie. We can not wish here for production values such as in Gone with the Wind. Amando de Ossorio had enormous difficulty in financing this movie which was just about to become one of those forgotten movies who could not be finished due to lack of money. Finally they managed to solve the situation with the help of a friend of Ossorio J. Bermudez de Castro an aristocratic Spaniard from an old and wealthy family who possessed a vast culture and particular tastes in literature and cinema. This movie has also some peculiarities that make it an important film or at least a curiosity. One of them is the fact that Sandra Mozarowsky is one of the actresses. Sandra Mozarowsky is the pretty and young brunette maiden called Lucy. This girl died in mysterious circumstances not even three years after making this movie  being just 19 years old. The strange death of Sandra Mozarowsky conmotioned Spain at the time. This girl used to die in nearly all the movies she appeared in and her mysterious suicide still remains a matter of controversy as she was rumored to be friendly with high personalities of Spain. The script photography and story are pretty good. Also the HP Lovecraft touch goes very well with the story. The Pagan Idol worshiped by the Templars resembles very much the Philistine idol dagon or the CarthagePhoenician deity Moloch. Human sacrifices in coastal states were not unknown in history. The Dagon or Horror of Dunwich twist sits well with the movie. The scenes where the ritualistic human sacrifices take place at dawn in abandoned beaches are beautifully filmed. The scenes of the Idol Sacrifice and worship are very good and the Blind Dead Knight Templars are convincing and creepy as usual. Very interesting little gem with the added charm of the presence of the sad and hauntingly beautiful Sandra Mozarowski a pretty maiden with a tragic destiny.".

All action is located in a remote and isolate village in the Galicia's seaside  whose villagers are encircled by the Blind Dead cult . Sole solution to ease the templars' blood thirst is to offer them young virgin for sacrifice .A young doctor and his wife arrived there and obviously they don't seem to agree with local traditions . Villagers don't seem to love foreigners either  so you can expect a tied match Well  plot might seem a bit dull and won't dare to deny that actually is  but what counts here is the atmosphere Ossorio manages to create a chilly and eerie ambiance  maybe due to the remote localization in which the film was shot but for whatever reason film is actually very effective . Scenes where templar's appears on the beach to regain their victims are pretty well filmed".

	schema:headline " Excellent final entry to the series";
	schema:reviewBody "The first two Blind Dead films were excellent horror movies but after the stumble with the third film I feared that the series may have ran its course. However inventive director Amando De Ossorio wasn't happy to create a film like the rest of the series and this fourth instalment Night of the Seagulls is wickedly different to any of the other films in the series. The Templar's really do get everywhere and after their escapades in a small town and aboard a 16th century galleon in the middle of the sea we find them in a small fishing community. Their mythology has changed again and they have this little village at their mercy as they rise from the grave for seven days every seven years to claim virgins for sacrifice. We pick up the plot as a doctor and his wife move into town only to be greeted with a frosty reaction to their presence. Shop keepers won't serve them and townsfolk don't want to be treated by the doctor  only the village idiot and a beautiful young girl have anything to do with the couple...and what's the deal with the circling flock of seagulls? The title Night of the Seagulls sounds a bit silly but at least Ossario gives the audience a reason for the choice. The reason is actually quite good and while overall the film lacks originality the way that the director pulls elements such as the sacrifices the seagulls and his own troupe of Blind Dead Templar's together is really well done and ensures that this is more than merely a third sequel to an obscure Spanish zombie movie. The Templar's themselves don't appear in the movie for very long but at least they get to ride their horses this time something severely lacking in the previous instalment. Even during the scenes where the stars of the show aren't present Ossario keeps the action going with a fairly decent story surrounding the lead characters and a decrepit and foreboding atmosphere which is the real star of the show if you ask me. Considering that the Blind Dead series can be aptly described as Eurotrash it's surprisingly well produced and this film doesn't disappoint in that respect. Night of the Seagulls may not be one of the best zombie movies ever made but it's a nice little film and comes highly recommended along with the rest of Ossario's series!".

Another plus is it kind of plays out like Night Of The Living Dead combined with Straw Dogs. Of course I'm not comparing this film to either of those masterpieces but what great templates to use.The plot of unwanted visitors to a cursed village might feel familiar to fans of Italian or Spanish horror. While in today's cinema they'd probably CGI a creepy coastal village but of course nothing beats the real thing. You could probably look into where the movie was actually filmed but I prefer to think it just exists in a dream or nightmare if you prefer. When you watch this movie you'll understand what I mean. This locale combined with some of cinema's best looking zombies along with the requisite hints of blood and nudity will make any horror fan want to watch. The film starts strong and then slows up a bit in the middle to build tension. The zombies look so good and are so creepy that you'll wish they were on screen more. Never fear because the final 35 minutes are dedicated to our Blind Dead heroes and their siege on the doctor's house. Will mankind triumph over the evil zombie hoard in this final chapter or are we all doomed? You'll have to watch the movie to find out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nick Nolte is deadsolid perfect here as Vietnamvet Marine Ray Hicks the ultimate 70's zen antihero.  It's shocking to see him so young and muscular after the sheer variety of roles and physical embodiments he has taken on since.  Here he's tough flawed and jaded a onceidealistic cynic who has gotten himself into a bad situation but whose instinct for survival takes over.  One of his first lines in the film is Self defense is an art I cultivate. and he doesn't let down.  It's a Steve McQueencool kind of role and Nolte's wonderfully cinematic throughout whether it's smoking a cigarette drinking a beer cleaning a weapon kicking badguy butt with some quick martial arts moves or putting a supportive arm around Tuesday Weld.The story comes from Robert Stone's National Book Award winning Dog Soldiers which is a better if less marketable title.  The title refers to those mercenary soldiers who would hire on and die for someone else's cause as surely as if it was their own.  Much of the dialogue comes verbatim from Stone's book and it's rare that the translation is so perfectly realized as it is by director Karel Reisz and his actors.  The characters seem to be saying these words for the first time in the situation they're in and what's more much of the dialogue is endlessly quotable.  Nolte in particular builds a toughguy philosophy throughout snarling lines like I'm tired of taking st from inferior people.He's perfectly paired on the road from Oakland to New Mexico with Weld in one of her best performances as Michael Moriarty's pillpopping wife. Also wellcast are Anthony Zerbe Richard Masur and Ray Sharkey who add plenty of menace and dark humor as a trio of shady feds after the heroin Nolte has illadvisedly brought back from Vietnam for onetime pal Moriarty.  Also standing out is Charles Haid as a smalltime Hollywood hustler Nolte tries to have move the heroin.  Look fast for Wings Hauser in the opening scenes as a Marine jeep driver.  The film's tone may be too violent and downbeat for some tastes but it captures the feeling of cynicism and disillusion stateside during the Vietnam War in an appropriately harrowing manner.The climactic shootout is ingeniously staged at night on a mountain commune with strobes flashing and Hank SnowCCR music blaring.  The final shots of the film are striking and memorable particularly the stark image of a battered and worn but still not beaten Nolte marching along an endless set of railroad tracks in the New Mexico desert. It's only a shame Nolte didn't attempt a few more roles in this action vein while he was still young.The film is available on DVD though there are no extras.  It would have been nice to have interviews commentary and deleted scenes particularly the pivotal NolteWeld love scene which was reportedly filmed but wound up being only implied in the final cut.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on Robert Stone's National Book Awardwinning novel 'Dog Soldiers' Who'll Stop the Rain is both a suspenseful thriller and an affecting meditation on the chaos and disillusionment of the Vietnam era.Converse Michael Moriarty is a journalist who went to Vietnam looking for the big story but finds only madness and abject fear. He also discovers that in a world where nothing makes sense people are just naturally going to want to get high. In Saigon Converse falls in with Charmian Gail Strickland a wealthy French expatriate holdout from the Colonial days who maintains a life of relative luxury through narcotrafficking. Weary of the constant despair and terror Converse agrees to participate in a scheme to smuggle heroin back from Vietnam to Los Angeles. However Converse can't smuggle the dope himselfthe Army is on to the fact that correspondents and GI's have been smuggling kilos of ultrapure ultracheap heroin back from Southeast Asia and turning large profits selling the dope in the USso he persuades his old friend Ray Hicks Nick Nolte a Merchant Marine sailor whose vessel is about to set sail from Vietnam for the Pacific Coast to hide the dope on his ship and then deliver it to Converse's wife Marge Tuesday Weld who Converse assures Ray will pay him several thousand dollars for the favor once he makes the delivery. Ray reluctantly agreeshe's not sure he trusts Converse but he needs the money. All goes well until Ray arrives in LA and realizes he's being tailed by two thugs Richard Masur and Ray Sharkey who may or may not be working for Converse. To make things worse he arrives at the Converse home and meets Marge who is beautiful but obviously strung outnot on junk it turns out but rather on prescription painkillers. The thugs follow Ray to Converse's and Ray and Marge narrowly manage to escape. Not sure whether he's being doublecrossed by Converse or if Converse is being doublecrossed by his supplier Ray decides to go on the run dragging along the druggedout Marge. Ray turns out to be a bit of a paranoid survivalist with ties to the nowdwindling hippie counterculture and takes Marge first to his house where he keeps a dune buggy and a stash of weapons and then to hide out in an old all but deserted commune high in the California Sierra. Ray and Marge go on the road with the additional complication of Marge's painful withdrawal symptoms having run out of dilaudid. Ray quickly realizes that the only way to help Marge get off the painkillers while on the run is to start weaning her offwith the heroin. Meanwhile Converse has returned to the US to find the plan has gone wrong. Abducted by the thugs who it turns out are working for Charmian and Antheil a corrupt government agent played by Anthony Zerbe Converse is forced to help track down Ray and Marge and more importantly the sack full of very valuable dope. Though like most films Who'll Stop the Rain lacks the subtlety and depth of its literary precursor the movie quite skillfully employs the novel's biting cynical perspective on the despair and chaos surrounding both the war in Vietnam and the end of the countercultural revolution after Manson and Altamont. While in graduate school at Stanford novelist Stone was a fringe member of fellow novelist Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksterswhose 'Acid Test' parties were the main artery by which LSD was introduced to California youth culture. Among the Pranksters was Neal Cassady who first found fame as the basis for hipster prototype Dean Moriarty in Jack Kerouac's 'On the Road' and later fell in with the Grateful Dead before finding his end by a railroad track in San Miguel de Allende Mexico in 1966. Cassady is the primary model for Ray Hicks and thenunknown Nick Nolte is perfectly cast in the role capturing the rough blend of charming rake and pyschopath that made Cassady a counterculture icon. Indeed the film is rife with references to the Prankster and Beat glory days easily recognizable to those familiar with the history of those culturalliterary movements. The film's soundtrack as the title suggests consists mostly of songs by Creedence Clearwater Revival and though Stone always hated that the producers changed the title from 'Dog Soldiers' to 'Who'll Stop the Rain' Creedence's catchy country rock is an appropriate background. Tuesday Weld the oncepopular Hollywood ingenue whose career was derailed by addiction and mental illness portrays Marge's state of delusional intoxication and emotional distress like one who has actually been there. Michael Moriarty of 'Law and Order' fame gives a wellcontrolled performance as the somewhat cowardly morally confused Converse. But the show is really Nick Nolte's. Though this film has been largely forgotten it was a starmaking turn for Nolte his first shot to carry a movie and the first film in which he begins to establish the roughedged sensitive badass persona that has become his stock and trade.Who'll Stop the Rain is a fine piece of vintage seventies memorabilia a nailbiting thriller and a useful lens into the confusion of American life during the last years of our military presence in Vietnam.".

His energy here would fill a dozen lesser films  only the remarkable supporting cast keeps him from singlehandedly burning the movie down. A huge number of American films from this period are massively overrated. Not this one.";

Even Zerbe is a wonderful surprise. The only cavil I have with the overall effect is the dumb title. Terrible. Dog Soldiers would have been fine. But after that there is not much amiss here. Starting with the dope deal quite unlike the start of the novel it moves relentlessly as a snake from then on to its end which is also unlike the novel and the better for it. Robert Stone writes some of the if not THE finest dialog in modern American literature I have always had problems with his wandering stories but if it takes them to produce his characters sparkling talk what the hell so be it. And what other movie would even THINK of using Hank Snow's Golden Rocket for the music of a great great shootout. Also not in the book. All hands here can be proud of a work that time is gonna treat with the utmost tenderness. If it has one misstep it is right at the first the explosions tossing Moriarity around are at distinct odds with the slow buildup of the rest of it. But a minor matter considering how dead on perfect most of the rest of the film is. So good this one is it's no wonder that the great masses missed it's perfection.".

	schema:reviewBody "Who'll Stop The Rain is a sadly forgotten Nam era film that deftly blends genre better than most movies can ever hope to. The level of quality ratio to the amount of people who remember it is criminally unbalanced but that's commonplace in cinema. The title comes from the Creedence Clearwater Revival song of the same name serving as both a metaphor in itself and a theme for the film an anti war outcry that warbles forth beautifully at least five different times during the movie becoming the script's national anthem. Pluswho can say no to CCR on loop. It's actually one of the best and most fervent anti war films out there showing you an extended look at just how many ways the Vietnam War followed soldiers home and infected many customs institutions and individuals. That kind of important sentiment wrapped up in a thriller is the kind of package I strive to find in film and this is a glowing example. Nick Nolte plays Ray Hicks an American GI getting ready to head back stateside after a tour. His best buddy John Converse Michael Moriarty convinces him to smuggle a brick of hash back with him and deliver it to his wife Tuesday Weld. Only problem is that ain't where it ends. The people John was in contact with turn out to be a dodgy bunch and before Ray knows it he's o the run from some very dangerous dudes with his best buddy's wife in tow headed straight for a violent confrontation via a slow burn of a plot that sits on a low boil before you realized it's reached a fever pitch. Nolte and Weld are a corrosive romantic couple making the downbeat best of their situation evading two nasty drug runners Anthony Zerbe and Richard Masur being scary and classy as hell and getting a feel for each other along the way. Thriller. Drama. War. Moral dilemma. This one's got it all in a very specific concoction that never forces anything and treats you to more than it ever promised before you have the chance to realize it. All timer stuff.".

Richard Masur and Ray Sharkey provide a little bit of comedy relief as a pair of bumbling but psychotic idiots.  Also did I mention just how great Nick Nolte is in this movie?  I mean he's always had a strong screen prescence in everything he's ever done but here he does such a great job with the part that you really want to know more about his background.  There really isn't much explanation as to where he's from and just what he's about but in the end you do have a pretty good idea of what makes him tick.

Nick Nolte stars as Ray Hicks a soldier serving in Vietnam soon to return Stateside who is persuaded by his friend John Converse Michael Moriarty to smuggle some heroin back with him. Ray doesn't really want to do it but needs the money. When he tries to deliver the drugs he's tailed and attacked by two thugs Danskin Richard Masur and Smitty Ray Sharkey and is forced to take it on the lam with Johns' pill popping wife Marge Tuesday Weld. Ray decides that they will try to unload the drugs someplace but the bad guys also including crooked federal agent Antheil Anthony Zerbe tail Ray and Marge all the way to Mexico.Tough hard hitting action and complex characters  relationships make for an effective mix in this film that nicely captures the sense of dissatisfaction and despair felt by Americans during the Vietnam War era. John a reporter had gotten upset over what he witnessed in 'Nam and decided that a little money making venture would help him to get over it. Of course he's only bought trouble for himself his wife and his buddy. The character of Ray Hicks is a stoic man who's grown wary of others like John and lowlife associate Eddie Charles Haid and is tired of dealing with inferior people. He comes to develop some affection and respect for Marge who in turn starts to respect him.An intelligent script written by Stone and Judith Rascoe and efficient direction by Karel Reisz The Gambler The French Lieutenant's Woman create a compelling drama that does go on a bit long but delivers a memorable finale with Ray seeking to confuse his nemeses by blaring some music. The bittersweet ending is genuinely affecting. The acting is great from all concerned with Weld proving to be a delightful presence yet again. Character actors Wings Hauser Vice Squad and Jonathan Banks Beverly Hills Cop have early career bit parts.This is a film that doesn't seem to be that well known nowadays so viewers would be advised to give it a look.Eight out of 10.".

It was also a story  though sinister of friendship loyalty and love. The last scene with Nolte walking down the tracks was a classic. A real keeper. All in all i thought a great film of an era gone by. A great portrayal of an ExMarine Ray Hicks being thrust into a situation where he must act and risk his life and reputation in helping his timid friends deliver some heroin. And of course like everything that Ray Hicks encountered in his previous lifesee Dog Soldiers. It all goes awry. There are real feds on his trail joined by a couple of ex jailbirds as their henchmen. It all ends in a tragic yet heroic last stand by Mr Hicks. Again trying to get his friends out of the mess he fights the bad guys to the end. Amen!".

It was also a story  though sinister of friendship loyalty and love. The last scene with Nolte walking down the tracks was a classic. A real keeper. All in all i thought a great film of an era gone by. A great portrayal of an ExMarine Ray Hicks being thrust into a situation where he must act and risk his life and reputation in helping his timid friends deliver some heroin. And of course like everything that Ray Hicks encountered in his previous lifesee Dog Soldiers. It all goes awry. There are real feds on his trail joined by a couple of ex jailbirds as their henchmen. It all ends in a tragic yet heroic last stand by Mr Hicks. Again trying to get his friends out of the mess he fights the bad guys to the end. Amen!";

	schema:headline " Edge of Your Seat Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Who'll Stop the Rain is an edge of your seat thriller set during the Viet Nam war. It features one of the early successes of Nick Nolte. The story opens in Viet Nam where a burnt out reporter Michael Moriarity tries to make some easy money by smuggling two kilos of heroin rather than his usual marijuana to the U.S. He enlists as his currier Nolte who is somewhat reluctant at first but agrees. Nolte shows up at Moriarity's home to collect his fee from Moriarity's wife Tuesday Weld and then the fun begins. Two bogus federal agents Richard Mazur Ray Sharkey begin to lay claim to the smack. They are joined later in the chase by their boss a corrupt federal agent Anthony Zerbe. The performances are top notch all around. Nolte is suitably macho in one of his first big roles. Weld is overwhelmed by the events but soon gives in to Nolte's plans. Moriarity is also good as the naive husband who thinks he can make a quick buck to compensate him for the horrors he has experienced in Viet Nam. Mazur and Sharkey are outstanding as the brutal sadistic heavies and Zerbe is as slimey as ever as the chief baddie.  The Nolte character is somewhat of a mystery at least to me. Who is he? What is he doing in Viet Nam? Is he a soldier of fortune a mercenary? or what? He has a run down shack in Los Angeles where he has buried an assault rifle. In Arizona he has an elaborate mountain top hideaway complete with an amphitheater and loudspeakers that play Hank Jones music. None of this is explained to my satisfaction. What the movie does have is a good story great acting and an entertaining soundtrack featuring Creedence Clearwater Revival.".

	schema:headline " A Jaded Generation's Slide Into Crime  Corruption";
	schema:reviewBody "Who'll Stop The Rain is a gripping drama about the Vietnam War drug smuggling and betrayal but more interestingly it's also a very simple and effective depiction of how the attitudes of a generation were affected by the conflict. For those who were directly involved the loss of hope and idealism opened the door to disillusion and cynicism and for their loved ones at home despair took over. Standards of morality were compromised to such a degree that the resulting nihilism and corruption rapidly became prevalent throughout society and its institutions and a pessimistic preoccupation with selfinterest followed. One of the main strengths of this movie is the way in which all this information is conveyed through its characters in a style that's both skillful and very affecting.John Converse Michael Moriarty is a war correspondent working in Saigon who's become totally traumatised by the levels of violence and insanity that he's seen. He's no longer able to find or invent any positive spin to apply to his reporting of the events around him and as a consequence feels at an extremely low ebb. In this state of mind he allows himself to become involved with some drug dealers and conscripts the help of his old friend Ray Hicks Nick Nolte to transport 2 kilos of pure heroin to California.Hicks is a merchant seaman and as arranged with Converse he successfully smuggles the drugs into the United States and delivers them to Converse's wife Marge Tuesday Weld who's supposed to pay him 1000 for his work. Things don't go smoothly however because Marge clearly doesn't know anything about the arrangement and also Hicks realises that he's being followed. The men following Hicks are a couple of vicious thugs who work for a corrupt government narcotics agent who obviously had advanced knowledge of the deal and is willing to go to any lengths to steal the heroin. Hicks and Marge's only option is to go on the run and a deadly pursuit follows.A very young looking Nick Nolte in what must've been one of his earliest roles makes a great impact as a guy who isn't moral in the conventional sense but does nevertheless have his own code of decency. Tuesday Weld is also exceptional in conveying just how vulnerable and passive Marge has become. During her husband's absence in Vietnam the level of despair she experienced led her into drug addiction despondency and a pessimistic outlook that remained with her ever since.Who'll Stop The Rain which was based on Robert Stone's novel Dog Soldiers contains plenty of excitement violence and action as well as impeccable performances by its marvellous cast. The mood of the period in which the story's set is captured very convincingly and Richard H Kline's distinctive cinematography and the music of Creedence Clearwater Revival both contribute significantly to the success of this particular aspect of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I would not agree that this is Vietnam in a nutshell as some have said there being much better films that cover that topic this film is more like the spawn of Vietnam. It is well known that many US servicemen serving in that horrid war were introduced into a wide array of drugs and chemicals. Given the hellish life they were forced to endure it is not without a large measure of sympathy when we acknowledge their choices. We would most certainly have succumbed to some such numbing substance in order to dull the pains.Running drugs out of South East Asia went from a small scale to much larger scale operation during the 'nam years. Many GI's got caught up in the deals at some point not caring any more if they got caught. The premise of the film while a bit hard to believe he sends 2 kilos of pure heroine back to his wife who knows nothing about it's arrival probably happened more than we know. The involvement of dark figures from either the mafia or corrupt police officials I could not figure out what they are were just takes this film into murkier grounds.A telling line that haunts the remainder of the film comes early. Nick Nolte says after having been asked to run the drugs that's bad karma referring to the heroine. How much this is his truth comes at the end. There is little funny about this movie and it just goes from bad to depressingly awful. The attempt of Nolte's character to fob off the heroine to a fat flunky old friend spins wildly out of control with Nolte helping to get the prospective buyers drug novices screamingly and sickeningly high I felt ill watching that scene. It's bad enough that Michael Moriarity's character gets tortured he thought that he had left all of that behind in 'nam to quote one of the bad guys no boobie it didn't go away. There is little left of your emotions when your finished with this visit to the domestic Vietnam era America. It is hard to say what is at fault here. Is it foolish American's who will do anything to score drugs? Is it the blowback from the war with the drug addled soldiers unable to contain their need to indulge in drugs and other excesses?Think of other 'nam movies especially The Deer Hunter. At the end of the film one of the main characters has fallen so low that he ends his days in a drug hazed cloud of Russian Roulette unable to hear the screams of his beloved friend frantically trying to pull him back from hell. There are more grisly 'nam movies this one is more about the backlash of bad choices that were brought home. It is said that although American soldiers tasted great hell in the Second World War it is not my observation that the post war years produced such harrowing drug problems among the vets. I might be wrong about that but this is my impression. Something there is about the Vietnam experience that totally scorched the souls of those soldiers. There is nothing good to be said about it and this film only rams the point home. On the other hand the acting is all excellent but over all this is a really dark film. The desolation is not helped by the great music of that era in particular Credence Clearwater Revival. Nolte is always wonderful but I would not say this is his best role. His role in The Thin Red Line is a hard one to top. Overall a really depressing vision of the wreckage of bad choices and drug addiction.".

You see he writes in a word where flying men pursue elephants people just naturally have to get high. That's a pretty good line and it's not the only one in this fairly literate dialog.Moriarty obliges Nick Nolte a friend from their Marine Corps days to smuggle five pounds of heroin back into the states for him. Everything is all set up. Well it's not. A crooked narcotics agent Zerbe and a couple of his goons barge in and try to rip off the smack. Nolte escapes with Weld. The heavies capture Moriarty and demand to know where Nolte and Weld have taken this fortune's worth of heroin but he has no idea. They beat hell out of him shoot him full of drugs force him back on a red hot stove burner and dunk him in a bathtub but it's no use. Man does Moriarty do a great job of registering horror and pain. There follows a crosscountry pursuit from Oakland to Los Angeles to a barren mountain in New Mexico site of a longdeserted hippie commune and fair grounds. That's where the final shootout takes place with Nolte and Weld on the mountain and Zerbe his goons and the captive Moriarty down below.If this sounds a little confusing it's because I found the story itself a little confusing. At critical points in the story cause and effect seem to evaporate. I'll just give one example. Nolte and Weld in their Land Rover or whatever it is race across the Southwest with their stash and an M16. Weld asks where they are going. Nolte tells her that they're headed for this isolated hideaway in the great beyond of the New Mexico hills El Ojo Grande. For all purposes he seems to have improvised their destination on the spot. And yet after leaving the highway and crawling up a dirt road and driving through dry washes they finally pull up at their destination one of Zerbe's spies is watching them through binoculars and through his radio tells Zerbe They're here. I don't know either.Throughout the film follows the general idea layed out by Moriarty in his letter. Culture flying men destroy Nature elephants. And narcotics are the byproduct of this conflict. The cities we see are smoggy industrial Oakland and a Los Angeles in which rich people are ridiculed as stupid before being victimized for no reason. Zerbe the government man representing civilization is corrupt and treacherous. There are one or two references to Nietzsche the relevance of which eluded me but I guess philosophy is culture too even if its boiled down to a crib sheet. When he encounters danger the man of courage goes forward. You don't have to read Nietzsche to get the idea. You don't have to get past Hemingway in high school. Nolte basically a natural man could easily hand over the dope but he won't do it  out of pride. I swore I was never again going to let myself be ordered around by morons. That's his justification for endangering everyone's lives. Culture is despicable.Nolte is only really happy after he reaches the faded hippy hideout an unspoiled paradise now full of joyous memories for him. He plays Hank Snow's Golden Rocket and does an impromptu square dance with Weld on the delapidated bandstand. His friend a kind of caretaker of the place who lives in a tiny abandoned mission is a Mexican and a gardener and a caring avuncular figure. How natural can you get? Can you beat a Mexican gardener? Well I guess you could but at least we are spared the stereotypical Indian communing with the spirits and exercising second sight.Villains aside the characters are pretty complex not to say unformed. Nolte's role is the easiest  the heman who knows his business and is hard. Weld is required to change from a blithering housewife who works in a Berkeley bookstore to a druggedout frightened escapee from the bourgeois life who falls for Nolte and begins to share his dreams of owning a boat in Mexico. But who will be on the boat? she asks him dreamily. Where will the boat go? It must be some boat. The most complex character  and the best performance  is Moriarty's. He's a genuine philosopher. He commits an existential act at the beginning and follows its consequences through all the way. Whenever he's asked a question of any intricacy his answer is I don't know said simply the way a child might say it in a secondgrade class. He's bony and balding his face innocent and a bit bewildered and he feels real pain  but he faces threats with a gangling carelessness. A gun is put to his head and he's ordered to get down on his knees and pray. Instead he walks away and sits down carelessly. The performance is just short of marvelous.I'm not sure I've got a grasp around the whole movie. I'm not sure anyone does. It's vague enough to be interpreted a dozen different ways and sometimes seems meandering. But what's on screen is directed well by Karel Reisz my director in Weeds and if we can ignore the holes in the script it's an enjoyable and tense story. But do not look for a standardtypical action flick with people's heads getting regularly wrenched off by some Lyngbakr with an attitude. It's more than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Girl is one of those small treasures that on outward appearance seems like something it is not.  Any general synopsis of the film would lead most people including myself to excuse the film as a dineadozen comingofage drama with first kisses raging hormones and middle school bullies.The truth is My Girl has all of those elements except for the latter the film takes place during summertime.  It isn't the most original story and it doesn't try to be a masterpiece.  Its goal is to entertain the younger viewer and to remind the older viewer of the nostalgic days of innocence and the heartbreaking first encounters with the loss of it.Summer 1972.  Vada Sultenfuss Anna Chlumsky is a plucky 11yearold who spends her summer days with her best pal Thomas J. Macaulay Culkin who is far better here than anything else he's ever done.  She dotes on her father Harry Dan Aykroid who works as an inhouse mortician. Subsequently the Sultenfuss house a grand old Victorian naturally is filled with the stench of death made only worse by Vada's grandmother Ann Nelson whose only way of communicating is through her sporadic breaks into popular songs from the 1940s.  It's only natural that Vada is also a hypochondriac who often believes she is dying.This is of course the summer that Vada grows up.  Signs of change first begin when a new woman shows up.  Her name is Shelly De Voto Jamie Lee Curtis and she works as a makeup artist for the dead bodies.  At first she is discouraged by the fact that her clientele are deceased but when sees that Harry and Vada need an outlet she gladly takes the job They're dead. All they have are their looks' she cheerfully gleams.  Vada likes Shelly but when she sees that Harry has developed a crush on her she feels threatened.  She does not want Shelley to take the place of her late mother who died two days after Vada was born.  Her only outlet is Thomas J. with whom she rides her bike to the lake and discusses all of the Big Issues the meaning of life love death which 70s TV family they'd live with. The other momentous event of the summer is Vada developing her first crush. It isn't Thomas J. who idolizes her but her teacher Mr. Bixler Griffin Dunne.  He teaches a summer writing class at the local college and Vada enrolls.  Besides being the youngest in the class she is also the only one who hasn't been taken over by 1970s psychedelia one day the class takes part in a group meditation.  The strength of My Girl isn't its story but its little nuances of innocent bliss.  Vada willingly shows a group of glowing boys a dead body. As the ride their bikes Vada and Thomas J. sing The Name Game'.  When writing poems from the soul' Vada writes an ode to ice cream.  The relationship between Harry and Shelly is sweet too.  Before their first date Harry's womanizing brother points out that since Harry's last date a sexual revolution has occurred.  Of course Shelly only desires a proper and oldfashioned gentleman which very much complicates their first date.Well I loved this film.  As a viewer I try to watch for inconsistencies in the performances and the script but this film had none.  Dan Aykroid and Jamie Lee Curtis bring a lowkey charm to their roles.  Both have their flaws and it sometimes seems they have nothing in common.  But for some inexplicable reason they are brought together and their encounters are tactful witty and very real.As for Anna Chlumsky it can only be said that this young actress sets the standard for all child performances.  This is not a performance in a traditional manner  she eludes all cutesy standards of the traditional child performance and becomes a complex multidimensional person with true needs.  This little girl is extremely intelligent and when Chlumsky delivers lines beyond her years she doesn't do it with sarcasm or adorability but with the oblivious nature that 11yearolds find themselves in.  The world may be changing around her but she tries her hardest to maintain her sanity and cheerfulness.Though My Girl is advertised as a kid's film and kids would probably like it this film is for adults.  It isn't always a happy film and there is a major tragedy toward the end of the film.  But rather than sentimentalize the tragedy serves as a bridge for young Vada in between the realms of innocence and childhood and the real world of loss and sadness. And as dark as My Girl may sometimes be there is always a sense of charm and warmth brought to the screen by the characters.  This is a wonderful wonderful film.".

At first she is discouraged by the fact that her clientele are deceased but when sees that Harry and Vada need an outlet she gladly takes the job They're dead. All they have are their looks' she cheerfully gleams.  Vada likes Shelly but when she sees that Harry has developed a crush on her she feels threatened.  She does not want Shelley to take the place of her late mother who died two days after Vada was born.  Her only outlet is Thomas J. with whom she rides her bike to the lake and discusses all of the Big Issues the meaning of life love death which 70s TV family they'd live with. The other momentous event of the summer is Vada developing her first crush. It isn't Thomas J. who idolizes her but her teacher Mr. Bixler Griffin Dunne.  He teaches a summer writing class at the local college and Vada enrolls.  Besides being the youngest in the class she is also the only one who hasn't been taken over by 1970s psychedelia one day the class takes part in a group meditation.  The strength of My Girl isn't its story but its little nuances of innocent bliss.  Vada willingly shows a group of glowing boys a dead body. As the ride their bikes Vada and Thomas J. sing The Name Game'.  When writing poems from the soul' Vada writes an ode to ice cream.  The relationship between Harry and Shelly is sweet too.  Before their first date Harry's womanizing brother points out that since Harry's last date a sexual revolution has occurred.  Of course Shelly only desires a proper and oldfashioned gentleman which very much complicates their first date.Well I loved this film.  As a viewer I try to watch for inconsistencies in the performances and the script but this film had none.  Dan Aykroid and Jamie Lee Curtis bring a lowkey charm to their roles.  Both have their flaws and it sometimes seems they have nothing in common.  But for some inexplicable reason they are brought together and their encounters are tactful witty and very real.As for Anna Chlumsky it can only be said that this young actress sets the standard for all child performances.  This is not a performance in a traditional manner  she eludes all cutesy standards of the traditional child performance and becomes a complex multidimensional person with true needs.  This little girl is extremely intelligent and when Chlumsky delivers lines beyond her years she doesn't do it with sarcasm or adorability but with the oblivious nature that 11yearolds find themselves in.  The world may be changing around her but she tries her hardest to maintain her sanity and cheerfulness.Though My Girl is advertised as a kid's film and kids would probably like it this film is for adults.  It isn't always a happy film and there is a major tragedy toward the end of the film.  But rather than sentimentalize the tragedy serves as a bridge for young Vada in between the realms of innocence and childhood and the real world of loss and sadness. And as dark as My Girl may sometimes be there is always a sense of charm and warmth brought to the screen by the characters.  This is a wonderful wonderful film.";

It is a very bittersweet look at the joys and tears a girl faces when she stands on the cusp between childhood and adolescence.Set over the summer of 1972 the film centres on Vada Sultenfuss a motherless elevenyearold tomboy who has enough problems coping with impending adulthood on top of having to contend with her oblivious mortician father Harry and her senile grandmother Gramoo. And if things were not bad enough Harry hires an assistant in the form of the funky Shelly leaving Vada feeling her place in her father's life is threatens by this new woman. Thankfully she is not alone as seeing her through her troubles is her loyal best friend Thomas J.While Dan Anckroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis as Harry and Shelley respectively were great in their roles as two adults who both care for Vada and who have a growing attraction to each other it was the child actors who stole the show. Anna Chlumsky in this her film debut delivered a first class performance as Vada depicting the all the little nuances of the character from the confusion a tomboy feels as she tentatively embraces her girly side in deference to her first crush to the desolation of bereavement to the loneliness she feels due to her father's thoughtless neglect. She was excellent in showing Vada's childish innocence and rare maturity that comes when a child has dealt with the harsh side to life.Macaulay Culkin was another surprise as he portrayed the guileless Thomas J. It was a pleasant change to see him in a role other than the obnoxious kid he usually depicted in previous films such as 'Home Alone' and 'Uncle Buck' and he rose to the occasion with flare perfectly displaying the bumbling but sensitive and caring nature of his character. His performance here proves that had he chosen to he could have been one of the rare few who succeed in the seamless transition from being a child actor to a teenyoung adult actor.'My Girl' is so involving for a wide age group because it not only conjures up nostalgic memories of summers gone by in adults who occasionally long for the carefree bliss of childhood but it engages younger viewers into considering the lessons of loyalty love loss and growing up. It definitely strikes a cord in those who are eleven years old themselves I was eleven when I first saw this film and felt as if I could identify with Vada on many things. Most girls of eleven will probably empathise with Vada's views that nothing happens to boys! Highly recommended.".

This movie is typically revered as one more enjoyed by children but I think adults can get something out of it too from the psychological depth of the characters. The plot also is not very clich at all...so little that it stands out and is inimitable enough that no one has even tried to rip it off.The acting is also pristine. Lastly what tops off this movie is the music. As important as the movie itself is even a good movie can be dulled out a little if the music isn't good. James Newton Howard outdoes himself here. The 70s tunes complete the effect of forgetting you're in a relatively punked out society where you won't find as many friendly streets. Also several spots such as Vada walking on the tree branches late in the movie the music composed is an example of talent that few composers have to so fluently use music as a translation of emotions.The story is good and the execution which is equally important and often neglected in wouldbe awesome movies is next to flawless.

However judged on its own merits the movie scores as high a rating as 8 in my bookin terms of achieving its purpose pleasing the whole spectrum of possible viewers. The storyline is nicely balanced with just the right mixture of the human situation drama realism insight into child psychology and optimism. One might argue that in the film finale Veda is shown as having too quickly recovered from her supposedly terrible and tragic loss but children are indeed this way and the depth of her earlier suffering is sure evidence that this chapter of her life will be forever locked into her conscience. It is exactly the balance I want my daughter exposed to. The dialog is fine mature enough to show Veda's precociousness without overdoing it and to give the parents some intellectual pleasure and simple enough on the other hand for children to follow without losing themselves in its complexities. I regard myself as a poor judge of acting but having said that I find the acting in My Girl totally satisfying. If I may venture a guess I'd say that e.g. Jack Nickelson at his best would be to a large extent lost on the younger audience and would not be missed by adults who expected just to have great time with their kids together.

In reality it's neither. Though it's a family picture the characters are so wonderfully realized and the situations so easy to identify with that if you give this movie five minutes you WILL be sucked into watching it. AND you will enjoy it immensely. Anna Chlumsky  I cannot say enough about her performance. And she was 11 years old? She may be an adult by now but even as a kid she had talent out the wazoo. Great actress. Why she didn't have a prolific career in Hollywood is anyone's guess. Guys  you WILL cry. And there will be several points where you can't help getting mistyeyed. Again it has to do with the wonderful writing and the sweet performance by Miss Chlumsky. The script is wonderful. I kept waiting to see some phonyclichd Hollywood moment but all the scenes were touching and real Vada and Thomas J. learning how to kiss Vada first liking Shelly then feeling threatened as her dad falls in love with Shelly Shelly sitting Vada down and explaining the birds and the bees to her and Vada saying That should be illegal. There are laughs there are tears and there are the cute moments everyone enjoys in watching children grow up and people fall in love.".

It is everything the film promised to be and these were the reasons why I loved other movies like Stand By Me so much. My Girl is beautiful it is charming and it is poignant. I have been prone to cry in movies like the Elephant Man Fearless Camille and Stand By Me not to mention and you'll probably think me weird Harry Potter 6. Here especially the ending I bawled like a baby and I am not afraid to admit that. But what struck me most was the innocence of My Girl. The scenes with the two children are some of the most charming scenes in any film I have seen. The cinematography is beautiful and the scenery is breathtaking. The direction is next to faultless and the screenplay has a sense of subtlety and poignancy. The film's length is perfect and the romance between Harry and Shelley wasn't cloying at all. The music is truly beautiful and brings warmth and beauty to the proceedings. The performances were truly professional with charming lowkey performances from Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Aykroyd and Anna Chlumsky is wholly believable in a more complex child performance than one would expect from her. And Macaulay Culkin was so cute here even cuter than he was in the Home Alone movies. The film also has a sweet heart warming story that avoids becoming overly sentimental. I really hate how under appreciated this gem is. It isn't the best movie ever made but it doesn't try to be. It is essentially a charming and poignant film that I think critics have misunderstood in the past. It is more than a bittersweet kids movie it is simply a pleasant little gem. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " My Girl";
	schema:reviewBody "There were only four reasons I knew about this film the title the leading actress and leading child star and that there was a scene that made many people cry so I decided to try it from director Howard Zieff The Dream Team. Basically it is the summer of 1972 in Madison Pennsylvania eleven year old tomboy Vada Margaret Sultenfuss Anna Chlumsky is not your average young girl she is obsessed with death as her father Harry Sultenfuss Dan Aykroyd runs a funeral parlour in the house. She is also in love with her English teacher Mr. Jake Bixler Griffin Dunne and joins his poetry class to impress her and she is also best friends with unpopular school boy Thomas J. Sennett Macaulay Culkin who claims to be allergic to everything well chocolate and bee stings. Harry has hired a new assistant for the parlour in the form of makeup artist Shelly DeVoto Jamie Lee Curtis her job is to brighten up the corpses before they go in the coffins and are buried at first Vada really likes her. Soon enough though her opinion changes when Shelly and her father have a date and have fallen in love and the little girl tries a trick or two to split them up but nothing works and they get engaged. Vada still has a strong friendship with Thomas J. though they even get really close and have a kiss and he is happy to hear that if she doesn't get anywhere with Mr. Bixler she will think of him. Tragedy strikes however when Thomas J. walks towards a bees nest that was dropped onto the ground and opened up and being allergic to bee stings he was surrounded and he dies from his reaction. Vada is absolutely devastated by the news and of course Harry is responsible for giving the body a good sendoff and after running out of the funeral too upset she confesses her feelings for Mr. Bixler who obviously lets her down and says he is engaged. A little while after Thomas J.'s death Vada and her father have a real heart to heart talking about the death of her mother who died giving birth to her and in the end she has overcome everything emotionally. Also starring Richard Masur as Phil Sultenfuss Ann Nelson as Gramoo Sultenfuss Peter Michael Goetz as Dr. Welty Jane Hallaren as Nurse Randall Anthony R. Jones as Arthur Tom Villard as Justin and Lara Steinick as Ronda. I agree Culkin isn't on screen as much as he probably should have been but he is a lovable character in specks Chlumsky is actually a really good young female lead and Aykroyd and Curtis are likable as the older characters. The film has its amusing moments it has just enough charm it has the alright coming of age stuff it has the scene that will make a few people not really me cry and it has the good title song by The Temptations a quite nice romantic drama. It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers. Okay!".

The original is a lot better than the sequel but when is this ever not the case?My FAVOURITE quote from this movie and possibly any movie I've ever seen is when Vada first gets her period in her house and Thomas J asks if she can come out to play. This is vague though I am doing this from my memory of the scriptVada answers the door Thomas J Hi Vada. Can you come out to play?Vada Mm.. I don't know if my dad will let me... about to close doorThomas J I was thinking maybe we could go swimming or something? Vada GET OUTTA HERE! pushes Thomas J And don't come back for 5 to 7 days!!!My Girl is the perfect mix of everything a movie needs. It is very real to life and is a touching and heartwarming story.

Too much time went into warning parents that My Girl had a sad ending at the expense of a darned good surprise.The performances frankly stunk except for a few choice moments by Veda's uncle.

The film was SUPPOSED to end with the line My mother will take care of him! screamed from a distance when Thomas J's mother returns Veda's ring.  It was a heartbreaking emotional way to end a movie and might have saved it but someone chose to end My Girl with Veda and her new best friend getting on their twowheelers and riding away. This I presume was meant to reassure all those little kiddies out there watching the film that Veda was gonna be OK.  How insulting.  Those of us who have lost childhood sweethearts know better.  We never see Veda mourn.Other complaints  The filmmakers try too hard to make us see Veda's dad as a nice guy even though in the original script he was portrayed as a cold heartless man who ruined Veda's childhood which would have been much more believable.  Shelly was supposed to be about 20 years younger than she was portrayed in the film.The filmmakers also switch rapidly back and forth between how adult the children are and how childish the children are.  Some films do this artfully and realistically see Welcome To The Dollhouse for a good example however with Thomas J and Veda it felt like an utter lack of decisiveness  Should we cater to the kids who will watch because of Culkin or should we cater to the adults who will watch because of Curtis?  Oh well let's try and cater to both.This film could have been all kinds of things thoughtprovoking heartbreaking funny nostalgic . . .

Billy's father starts bringing him to work to help him adjust to his new situation and it is there that he discovers the chimp project. Billy's teacher wants him to do a paper on space flight and he chooses the chimps as a topic and he later gets to do important work in the program. Dr. McGuinness has an additional challenge to face besides getting the chimps ready for the potentially dangerous flight. She's a woman and female scientists are not being accepted by men the way they are today.Meanwhile Roger Thornhill wants his company to build the rockets and he doesn't appreciate the fact that Germans are the ones putting Americans in space.James Woods is very convincing but often stereotypical as a bythebook German scientist. Later on he shows a warm side which was hinted at when Billy first got in trouble at school. In fact he seems every bit as American as the other characters at times except for that accent. The other German characters unfortunately seem like they belong in Hogan's Heroes and don't exactly inspire confidence.Alex D. Linz does just fine as Billy who more than once gets the opportunity to save the day which is fine for the kids watching the movie but not particularly realistic. And the chimp who gets to go into space does quite a capable job I won't say which one it is. Mark Moses does a fine job as Alan Shepard who in real life ends up as the first American in space. And Annabeth Gish is likable as the scientist in charge of the chimps.William Devane is sometimes deliciously evil and at other times just plain evil as the executive who has devious plans for the space program. William Atherton is more stereotypical as the 'inside man' who helps Devane's character.What a appears to be a documentary on the space race starts the film and similar footage is shown at other times. This is interesting.Kennedy became president during the events of this film. This is okay even though the actual flight of the first chimp took place too soon for Kennedy to have been in office as long as he appeared to be here. People liked Kennedy and his comments in the inaugural speech add to the film. Another minor flaw 1962 Chevrolets were not introduced until much later in 1961.This movie isn't really a comedy but it is funny at times. There may have been some editing but overall it seemed clean enough for most kids to watch. There are some frightening scenes involving the training and the actual flight but this is to be expected with something as new as space travel was.This was pretty good.".

Billy's father starts bringing him to work to help him adjust to his new situation and it is there that he discovers the chimp project. Billy's teacher wants him to do a paper on space flight and he chooses the chimps as a topic and he later gets to do important work in the program.

I can live with inventing people for a historical story that never existed. I guess I can handle utterly obvious plot lines. I can definitely handle sweet VFX that was almost on par with Apollo13. What I cannot handle is for example these nice effects in stark contrast with old grainy stock footage used in the same manner. I cannot handle the total butchery of history. This film creates the impression that the first rocket the Americans built that didn't blow up was the one carrying the chimpanzee. The first space mission indeed. Explorer satellite? What's that? Of course the entire existence of the Houston launch facility was well ignored in this film. As usual the annoying lead brat saves the day more than once come on we've all seen films like this before of course he gets to show all the other kids who tormented him how cool he is by posing with Alan Sheppard. Of course even after living in the US for fifteen years the German engineers never eat anything else but Sauerkraut Bratwurst and Schnitzel. And they all drive Volkswagens. There never was a Werner von Braun. And there only were three German engineers throughout Nasa. Not to mention that a private company was trying to sell the US Government a rocket design of their own that looked suspiciously like something that the actual von Braun designed for a 1950s SciFi Film. The film is utterly predictable ridiculous in it's premise Woods wasted his talent here basically portraying an animated broomstick during the entire first half of the film. All the plot devices have been done a hundred times before and with much more style. Even though the shots of the launching rocket looked sweet enough on the TV screen they didn't loose much compared to Apollo13 in other shots you could literally see the edge of the blue screen. It's okay enough for kids under twelve but an abomination before celluloid and mental hemorrhage inducing for everybody else.".

I was hoping that this film would dramatize the meaty subject of exNazis working in the America's rocket program. Something that has had virtually no attention in film. Unfortunately it didn't.Children and animals and rockets? No it doesnt work. The mindset that brings together the first two for quick buck doesnt understand the latter. What happened to the live action kids movies? All they seem to know how to make is endless kids and animals films about animals who behave like spoiled brats and the kids who love them. Air Bud 1 2 and 3 Free Willy 1 2 and 3 M.V.P. Most Valuable Primate 1 2 and 3! How is a kid watching these films supposed to gain any insight into real animal behavior from all this stage production? It sickens me. It would be okay if they were actually entertaining but they are all derivative crap. Race To Space is just lucky its not sequel bound like it forebearers I hope.Though James Woods was fine in this film he is usually much better his accent was very poorly done.The meaningless subplot about a NASA supervisor William Atherton who is bribed by a rival rocket developer ? into wilful sabotage of a Redstone rocket was not only ridiculous it was sad. Is this ham fisted manipulation of  the plot supposed to explain away all the other meandering plot threads???? If so it didnt work. Sad. Poor William Atherton you probably know him from his arrogant and abrasive TV reporter role in the Die Hard movies he plays pompous and selfimportant characters so well he's become typecast in the worst way. I guess its a job but he can't be still having fun playing the same character over and over again in film after film.This film was ultimately a big disappointment it takes way too many liberties with the facts to be legitimately use the based on a truestory tag. The only facts from NASA history that this film keeps are that1. German scientistsengineers were instrumental in the space race and2. That a Chimpanzee was launched into space before a man was.The true story of the first Chimpanzee in space may not have made as good a Hollywood kids movie in the tradition of Free Willy but it certainly would have been a better film. This is ably supported by the mini documentary entitled Ham America's First Space Hero which is included on the DVD amongst a surprising number of ineffectual extras. Ham America's First Space Hero is the one bright spot in this otherwise shabby production.I don't think that children actually enjoy or learn from schmaltzy unrealistic animals movies let alone from based on a true story films that aren't! Perhaps I'm wrong perhaps you will really enjoy it if you are 11 years old I'm not I didnt.".

	schema:reviewBody "A family film designed for children seeing James Woods in this is almost odd has the son Alex Linz Home Alone 3 of German scientist Dr. Wilhelm von Huber Woods working an accent the best he knows how even reverting to German on occasion when under angst preparing the first Mercury capsule for space not only competing with the Soviets but also an American company also interested in sending men to the moon William Devane is presented as some Machiavellian business crook in suit planning dastardly deeds for the rival NASA program. Wilhelm doesn't realize that in NASA is corruption in the form of Ralph Stanton William Atherton doing what he does best playing an asshole and a scoundrel who is working in concert privately with Thornhill Devane to sabotage the current program cutting a fuel line so the capsule will turn into a ball of flame once under heat. Most of the film concerns Wilhelm's son Billy Linz and the kid's bonding with chimp Mac. Mac survives all the testing and becomes the first chimp to successfully take a flight into space and return to the Earth. Mac's behavioral problems just uncontrollable and hard to manage are put at ease when it finds a pal in Billy. This helps Billy because he has been the victim of bullying due to his German lineage and has a hard time dealing with the absence of his mother who died when he was very young. Wilhelm's tireless work on the NASA space project has left him little time for his son and the precious process he's missing out on is being filled by Air Force pilot Alan Sheppard the charismatic Mark Moses. Shepard plays pitch the baseball around with Billy listens to him and truly cares about the kid. Wilhelm's methods at holding his son accountable for his school work and not fighting back when ridiculed as a NAZI Kraut can be a bit frustrating for Billy and attempting to keep him from working with scientist Dr. Donni McGuinness Annabeth Gish and Mac Donni is in charge of choosing the chimp that will take the capsule flight. Ultimately Billy and Mac's bonding is the rescue of the program a ham radio capturing a particular conversation that leads to Wilhelm and his German associates finding a problem on the capsule with Billy assisting them in the fix and plays a major factor when the capsule enters space and the reentry. The film plays up the suspense of Mac surviving dangerous scenarios of the space capsule program with lots of family film music in the background to provoke the pounding of your heart and to enliven the sentimentality of Billy's friendship and affection with the chimp. The space program is handled with admiration and patriotic respect. Woods is Woods no matter the film he shows the appropriate reactions his character goes through except this time it isn't the kind of part that necessarily evokes his usual magnetism on screen. For all intensive purposes Woods is a nice guy going through a workaholic schedule that demands a lot of his time. Gish like Mac has a character Billy can confide in and she sympathizes for the kid. This is family fare that was made for kids with loving nods to the space program that is often attractive to adults.".

These excesses will cause serious problems for all adults and will likely degrade the enjoyment for any but the younger group of viewers I would guess 10 years old or less.  After all kids are pretty good at knowing when someone or something is not telling the truth.Young Billy Alex Linznicely chosen as the son of Wilhelm von Huber the lead scientist of the Mercury programis having a tough at school.  Billy is having problems with his new schoolmates because of his German background.  He also struggles with the remoteness of his father and the recent loss of his mother.  He makes friends with a chimpanzee being trained to go into space on the first Mercury rocket and the story goes from there. Bads guys pretty older and younger girls a strong soundtrack and comedic characters give this movie a lot of positives.  Add in the factual basis for the movie the strong nationalistic themes and the cute chimps and one would predict a winner of a family movie.Unfortunately there are a few serious flaws in this movie.  First is the movie's lack of depth about behavioral and rocket science.  Anyone might believe that a boy that for some unknown explained reason forms a strong bond with a chimpanzee might be able to assist in its training.  But this movie unfortunately provides no meaningful dialog or action along these lines.  Parents will be disappointed in the lack of truthfulness in the presentation of NASA security and engineering.  Billy discovers in a nice plot twist that the rocket is sabotaged the night before the launch.  He his father and two German scientists proceed to check the rocket themselves.  Billy ends up inside the rocket fixing a fuel line connection himself.  Parents will wonder why the plot took such a silly and potentially dangerous twist do we want our kids really thinking that they should be helping fix anything remotely close to this kind of problem?!!.  Kids will be left without any understanding of the effort that literally hundreds of engineers and scientists go through to make certain that everything is right with such launches.Worst are the later scenes of chaos in the mission control room with Billy saving the day by literally screaming into a headset for the chimp to flip a switch in the rocket.  I cringed at these unnecessary scenes no doubt Billy could have saved the day by talking to the chimp in a calm realistic mission control room.  Did the writers director and producers of this movie really think parentsand even the kids?would react positively to these ridiculous scenes?Oh well as I said above younger kids will like this movie.  Adults will go away wondering about the lack of intelligence in the movie industry. All said and done not a bad family movie just not a very good one. 6 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the unique pleasure to recently view Race to Space at the 2001 Marco Island Film Festival. I mention this because this is an excellent movie that somehow has escape getting picked up for distribution.Race to Space is loosely set against the early 60s NASA space effort as led by Wernher Von Braun who has been fictionalized in the movie as Von Hueber and played very well by James Woods. Von Hueber has a 9 year old son Billy who is the main character and who is excellently played by Alex D. Linz. Billy deals with several themes which are successfully interwoven. 1 Discrimination due to Billy being the son of a well known former German Nazi rocket scientist 2 Billy's relationship with his father the no nonsense rocket scientist as it evolves following the death of his mother 3 Billy's maturation and relationships as he becomes involved with the training of the chimpanzees for the space program. My only negative comment is that I found the seemingly mandatory Disneyesque villain theme somewhat hokey and predictable. This doesn't seem consistent with the high quality of the other well integrated parts of the film. Perhaps this was inserted to make the movie more kid friendly. I also have some concern that people will think this film is historically accurate when if fact it is a fictionalized depiction set against actual historical background. Despite the fact that the movie tends to seamlessly phase in and out of historical authenticity the themes are so well done it may be difficult for some to distinguish fact from fiction.Overall this is one of the best films you will ever find that is entertaining and enlightening for the whole family. I strongly recommend that you make the effort to do whatever it takes to see this movie and to demand to have this film widely distributed. I saw this movie with my wife and 9 year old son. We all agreed that this was an excellent movie with my son using superlatives totally awesome and excellent.  Find this movie and see it!!!  I give it 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems at the present time I can not help but watch movies that are based on a true story'. Perhaps it is all a coincidence but I have been richly rewarded for viewing such movies. Race to space is a family friendly' motion picture that has a great resemblance to the movie October sky'. If you have ever looked for a film about animals and why they are and can be an important part of someone's life then this film is it.Wilhelm is a NASA scientist who has recently located to Florida with his son Billy who aspires to be a hero like the young astronaut Alan Shepherd and it's not long before Billy gets his chance. Hired by Dr. McGuinness to help train the chimpanzees for the NASA space mission he begins to develop a close bond with one chimp in particular Mac. With Billy's help Mac is chosen to become the first chimp into space. It all seems a wonderful game until Billy realizes the risk associated with Mac going on this historic mission. Can Mac and his Dad pull together to make this mission fly?This a really enjoyable film. Considering that is based on a true story I like how it compels you to see what will happen between the main stars that being Billy and Mac. The director Sean McNamara does a great job in bringing out the wonderful relationship that a young boy has with the Chimpanzees. I also found the story interesting in how the bad men of launch wanted it to fail but never got their way. The credit for the story belongs to both Eric Gardner and Steven H. Wilson. They wrote both the script and the characters perfectly. Then what about the cast for this film. The main man of the show was Billy who was played by Alex D. Linz. I like how he showed such compassion for his animal friend Mac as that sentiment seemed real. This young fellow also appeared in films such as the Cable Guy and the starring role in the not so popular Home Alone 3. I liked the grown cast members of Race to Space'. Billy's Father the eccentric Dr. Wilhelm Von Huber was acted very well by James Wood. I especially enjoyed how his character turns from being a strict parent to a caring and understanding father. Then the role of Dr Donni McGuinness is also important. Her character was performed by Annabeth Gish. She was good in the role of the doctor who chooses the one Chimp to go into space. I also enjoyed her role in the film Double Jeopardy.There is also some different sort of stars that need to be recognised here. I am of course talking about the wonderful work by the Chimpanzees. They were very funny and well taught by their trainers. It was an amazing achievement to actually have an animal do what was being shown. To have it reenacted is priceless.  It is great to have animals being not only able to achieve great heights but to be used in a way that is not cruel but instead to the advantage of all to see.In conclusion I watched this film with a group of people who all thought it was pretty good. I would have to agree considering that it was funny touching sad and triumphant showing the heartfelt adventure of the first chimpanzee in space. This film also makes me a little envy of missing out such great achievements by man such as putting animals in space safely and a man on the moon. What an historic time the 60's must have been and how lucky we are that movies can are being made showing such events. Race to space is an inspirational story that should not be missed.CMRS gives Race to Space' 4.5 very good  brilliant film".

What an historic time the 60's must have been and how lucky we are that movies can are being made showing such events. Race to space is an inspirational story that should not be missed.CMRS gives Race to Space' 4.5 very good  brilliant film";

They played the school to be lame and plane but its really not. They did a good job in they gym. You can see that cocoa beach is the minutemen and that its cocoa beach. The hall way that he sits in while he is crying is exactly what it looks like. I have always thought that cocoa beach was a small town and it was lame excluding the fact that there is a RON JONS. the biggest and the first but i think that it was cool to have a movie done at our school and even more cool to have Barry Corbin in our town. I am a big fan expesally because he is in one tree hill. Hes great and very loving to the teens James Lafferty and Chad Michael Murray the opposite half brothers that don't get along and cares about them and there family. His acksent is great.

	schema:reviewBody "Tag der Idioten or Day of the Idiots is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1981 so it has its 35th anniversary this year. It is among the more known works by director Werner Schroeter and as always he also wrote the script here with the help of Dana Horakov. The film runs for over 100 minutes and takes place during an insane asylum from start to finish basically. The title indicates a slightly comedic note too and you may think the same when you read the title of my review but nope This is 100 drama occasionally thriller even. Schroeter's most known works including this one mostly focus on the female psyche and it is fitting that he has actresses Carole Bouquet Ingrid Caven and Christine Kaufmann play main characters in here. Marie Luise Marjan Lindenstrae is in it too. Of course there are also male characters in here but neither the male actors are known nor they play a role as big as the female ones.Schroeter won a German Film Award for his direction here and the movie was also nominated at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. I cannot share these awards bodies's support I have to say. It baffles me how it has a fairly good rating here on IMDb and received many strong reviews. I personally cannot say I enjoyed the watch at all. The first half hour was still somewhat decent but honestly I felt all the supporting characters were so uninteresting that I never managed to make a connection to any of them or the film in general. The best thing about the film? Certainly Bouquet's absolutely gorgeous looks and there is even full frontal nudity in here involving her actually in the very first seconds already which means basically that you can turn it off after minute 5. No surprise Bouquet starred in a Bond film the very same year this was made. She must have been among the most attractive people of the planet in the early 1980s. But her looks and somewhat decent performance alone cannot save this film from being ultimately very forgettable. Occasionally like Schroeter's works it has a touch of being too theatrical and more suitable for a stage play than a screen movie. Then again I am not impressed in general by what I have seen from the filmmaker so far. If you like Schroeter's works in general then maybe you may like this one too. It is certainly not his worst. I still give it a thumbsdown though. Not recommended.".

On a superficial level the movie deals with the perennial battle of new versus old both in love life as well as professional life. But deep down the movie is an attempt to differentiate between career  vocation. Everyone's born with some talent. It's what we do with that talent that makes all the difference. I found myself pondering on these extremely important issues upon watching the film. It takes an artistic genius like Andrzej Wajda to understand the world of another artist a musician in this case. That said some people may actually find the movie a bit dull and slow. But that's exactly the point it's not everyone's cup of tea! Needless to say that the music is excellent. A great movie for all music lovers  by extension for all the artists out there! Highly recommended!".

I found myself pondering on these extremely important issues upon watching the film. It takes an artistic genius like Andrzej Wajda to understand the world of another artist a musician in this case. That said some people may actually find the movie a bit dull and slow. But that's exactly the point it's not everyone's cup of tea! Needless to say that the music is excellent. A great movie for all music lovers  by extension for all the artists out there! Highly recommended!";

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that there has been developed a certain trend among the majority of critics and even Allen's fans regarding his work of the 1990  2000 period. With every new movie he's made there are complains that Woody lost it and would never create anything as great as some of his best films of the 70s and 80s. It is a good thing that Allen does not seem to care and keeps releasing year after year the films that are still among the best the industry has to offer. I've seen every picture Allen has made and I said in one of my reviews Woody Allen makes good very good and great movies. Even if I don't love all his movies equally they are all good there is something often  a lot to enjoy in every single one. His latest Cassandra's Dream is not an exception. This is a tale of two London brothers Ian Ewan McGregor and Terry Colin Farrell who are good friends and have been very close since their childhood. At one fateful moment of their lives they both would face an inevitable choice of how far they would go to get what they want and what price they would pay. I found both McGregor and Farrell terrific and they had a very believable chemistry together. Tom Wilkinson as the successful and wealthy American uncleMephistopolis who seduces the nephews with a terrifying yet promising offer is wonderful as always. I happened to read a few critical reviews before I watched the film and after I finished it I couldn't help thinking if it was the same movie we saw? Yes once again Allen meditates on the eternal subject of Crime and Punishment and he comes up with the superb script confident directing and as a result  a gripping and thrilling film that is as much a crime movie as it is about family values loyalty choices doubt guilt and regrets. The film is beautifully shot by great Vilmos Zsigmond McCabe  Mrs. Miller Close Encounters of the Third Kind The Deer Hunter The Black Dahlia Images The Long Goodbye and Melinda and Melinda and the original dramatic unsettling score is composed by Philip Glass. As you can see there is a lot to enjoy in the Allen's movie of 2007 which I see as one of the best of the last year. I personally can't wait for the next Allen's project to be released the new film set in Barcelona.".

The characters are transparent to the viewer but not to one another. In this regard the screen writing is brilliant.It is a story of two brothers who have character flaws. Each has dreams that require money and each seems intent on escaping the responsibilities of the family business to pursue what are patently foolish paths. At one point the brothers reminded me of some of Elmore Leonard's criminals who are both clever and foolish. The outcome of the film was from the beginning selfevident why could they not see it coming? Yet people do these kinds of things all the time. The music track alone tells you this is a tragedy and going to have a bad ending.I did have a problem with the Phillip Glass soundtrack on one level. Yes it worked well in this film but for me it evoked The Illusionist. If someone pointed this out and someone must have I can picture Allen saying That'll work. Not that many people will have seen both films. Or something to that effect.That may be the one weakness of the film not the music but the decision to not push something to another level. Mr. Allen's philosophy of film making is not to produce great art. It is to get the stories out. He is undoubtedly filled with stories and simply doesn't waste time on time consuming details. Or so it seems.For this reason despite the fabulous acting and great dialogue crisp character development and tight story the movie might not receive its share of critical acclaim. But then in reading his book Woody Allen on Woody Allen he owns up to the fact that he is not striving to be Bergman or Fellini. He does not wish the comparison to be even made. He is simply a man who loved the movies and who has lived out his dream of being able to make movies. Ultimately he probably doesn't really care what the critics think which is a nice place to be if you can get there.In the end I would have reshot at least two or three moments in the film that should have been reshot get it right. Though maybe in the grand scheme of things it didn't matter. There is much to like here with its echoes of Greek tragedy and other classic moments in literature. The scene in the bedroom felt eerily close to the problem Raskalnikov encountered in Crime  Punishment undoubtedly intentional. The film has sensuousness as a theme with almost none of the usual Hollywood demonstrativeness. It hints rather than reveals.The title for the film comes from the name of a boat which the brothers buy. The name for the boat is taken from mythical Greek tragedy. Cassandra was loved by Apollo but ended up being cursed by him when she did not return his love. Her gift of being able to foresee the future was forever a source of pain and frustration for her. The viewer of this film like Cassandra knows from the first that things will turn out bad but can do nothing to stop it.As is often the case The best laid plans of mice and men do often go awry.

Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell are totally believable as brothersand they work really well together. Colin Farrell does some of his best work to date as the brother with a gambling problem whose moral compass sends him on a downward spiral.It's almost an identical plot to Woody Allens earlier film Crimes  Misdemeanors but he makes it work with a few new twists. It's rare for a filmmaker to be equally adept with comedy and drama or a meshing of the two. Woody Allen proves once again to be one of our finest filmmakers.".

	onyx:emotionText "Getting out of New York did Woody Allen a world of good and Cassandra's Dream continued a trend of suspenseful films with great dialogue and interesting character development. Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell are totally believable as brothersand they work really well together. Colin Farrell does some of his best work to date as the brother with a gambling problem whose moral compass sends him on a downward spiral.It's almost an identical plot to Woody Allens earlier film Crimes  Misdemeanors but he makes it work with a few new twists. It's rare for a filmmaker to be equally adept with comedy and drama or a meshing of the two. Woody Allen proves once again to be one of our finest filmmakers.";

Nothing will come out of it and shame on you for wanting it. Colin Farrell and Ewan McGregor are wonderful in performances without frills or shine. Strangely enough Allen shows a bit of compassion for his characters but no respect. He seems to despise them. It is merit of the two actors that we manage to stay with them without falling in love with them without even like them very much. The ending I felt was a bit of a cope out. Woody got to the gates of hell but didn't venture in. He leaves to us the details of all that darkness. The film however bears Woody Allen's name but could have been a film by Basil Dearden or J Lee Thompson and I mean that as a compliment.".

All I knew was it was a new Woody Allen movie with Collin Farrell Ewan McGregor and Tom Wilkinson and supposedly rather dark.Dark it was but not overwhelmingly so. Farrell and McGregor play London brothers who are hardup for cash both with love interests that they're looking to take care of. Their rich Uncle Howard Wilkinson agrees to help them out as usual if they do him a favor and get rid of a business relation who poses a threat to his finances. Despite many doubts their situations are pressing and the young men agree. The story then follows the different ways they deal with the factual immorality of what they have done.It's not exactly a cheery film but it isn't quite an intense ominous drama either like the somewhat similar brothersintrouble based melodrama 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' that was recently released. In 'Dream' there's a thin layer of dark humor that adds a refreshing twist here and there.Everything was good on the acting end though not mindblowing both McGregor and especially Farrell gave strong performances. The story though rather predictable is still enjoyable. Nice use of London and the British countryside on Allen's part. Overall it's a solid film that will entertain but that's about it.".

Ewan McGregor is a rising star with great plans for the future while Colin Farrell is a messed up guy who drinks and gambles excessively. Both of these brothers are convincingly introduced and portrayed. Their bond with each other their past childhood hopes and dreams are presented making them very believable and real as people. When they are faced with a moral dilemma the role seems to be reversed. As a result of this well written and executed plot I find this film engaging and suspenseful.I particularly like the moral struggle and the contrast between the two brothers that play against their stereotype. Colin Farrell is particularly great in this film his portrayal of a depressed person is convincing and moving.It is also striking that Woody Allen has very much toned down the paranoia in Cassandra's Dream. I miss the comedic paranoia such as Anything Else. However Cassandra's Dream is still very much a Woody Allen film with the same witty and crisp dialogs and right to the point scenes.I find Cassandra's Dream very entertaining and gripping.".

	schema:reviewBody "Last Friday was finally released the most recent film of Woody Allen in Mexico City. Since Woody Allen's films have never been very successful in Mexico I doesn't missed the chance to watch it in the theater because I think it will be out of theaters the next week.I really enjoyed this film about two brothers who aren't happy with their lives and are looking for more. Terry Colin Farrell and Ian Ewan McGregor are the brothers. They live in London and are trying to start a successful live Terry with a store and Ian with hotels in California. When they have a big opportunity to get those dreams they must take a decision that will change their lives.Woody Allen follows the same line of his 2005 success Match Point showing a story about crime decisions dreams luck social classes and family set in England. The main subject of this film is the family showing how a regular family that lives in a very good way can be destroyed by the greed and the desires for be someone who you can't be. This family has their own representation of what is real success in the uncle Howard Tom Wilkinson who is millionaire and is a kind of idol or envy for the family. The two brothers want to be like their uncle Howard and both have their own ways. And here we can see the different personalities of both brothers and how since their desires to their acts after the crime are very different from each other. I love two scenes with the same dialog and how the meaning change after the crime. Isn't life grand? says Terry to Ian and the girls making a reference to what Bonnie and Clyde said. Yeah but look what happened to them says Ian and everybody laughs. Later after the crime goes as they want is Ian who says to Terry Isn't life grand? but Terry looks worry after all he knows what happened to Bonnie and Clyde. Also the irony of their boat named Cassandra's Dream in which they start to dream about a better life but in which the tragedy happened.About the cast I like both performances. Ewan McGregor is great again after some blockbusters and Collin Farrell is surprisingly great for me his performance is the best of the film and the best of his entire career. The support cast is just good.Conclusion Cassandra's Dream is another great film of Allen definitely underrated but that's not a surprise since most of Allen's recent films are underrated. Anyway I enjoyed a lot this film and left desires to rewatch Match Point. 9 out of 10".

Ian and Terry have to decide whether they shall cross the line and help family or face the lack the money to resolve their issues.Cassandra's Dream is a tragic thriller where the plot point is the moral decision of two simple but honest brothers whether they should cross the line commit murder and live with that later. Colin Farrell and Ewan McGregor have great performances and their characters are perfectly developed Hayley Atwell is extremely gorgeous. However Martin Burns is not welldeveloped maybe intentionally by the writer and director Woody Allen to keep a distance from the viewer the same way Ian and Terry do in the story. The tension in the plot is limited actually prevailing the dramatic moral fight of Terry and Ian later in this engaging movie. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Sonho de Cassandra The Cassandra's Dream".

Cassandra's Dream might reminisce you of Shakespeare's play Macbeth where the protagonist is as well manipulated by his own desires. In both cases ambition overcomes the characters' moral values and the murders they have committed hunts them throughout the story they can neither sleep nor trust anyone and are pushed towards isolationism.

	schema:headline " TIFF07 review 5 Being rescued is one of my wicked dreamsCassandra's Dream";
	schema:reviewBody "I went into the Toronto Film Fest screening of Woody Allen's latest movie Cassandra's Dream completely void of knowing anything about it. With no other preconception besides the fact that I really enjoyed Match Point I sat down to see what was in store this time around. Would it be a comedy or a drama? Since his last entry Scoop was a comic one which I have not yet seen I was ready to be enthralled with a mystery of dramatic proportions. What a surprise though when around a quarter of the way through this one turned from serious to amusing. I need to believe that the laughs are intentional because of the way in which the performers start to ham it up for the camera. No way would Woody allow that to happen if he didn't really want it to. Upon exiting the cinemathe glorious Elgin Theatre that reminded me a lot of Buffalo's own Shea'smany audience members seemed to be buzzing about whether they were laughing at good comedy or bad overthetop theatrics. I never secondguessed myself that the laughs were genuine and by doing so I found that I loved this film.Some of you may be aware that Allen had cast and started preproduction on a film directly before beginning Cassandra's Dream. For some reason the production fell through and was ultimately scrapped. No one knows if it was somehow reworked into the movie we see now but I would guess that it was not. My first impression once we discover the true impetus of the movie was that this is Match Point with comedy. The plots of both follow a very similar path and the murder and guilt accompanied with it are one and the same. In the end the only real difference between the two besides the superficial supporting characters that are switched around is the way in which both conclude. Whereas Match Point stays calm and methodical Cassandra becomes very much a comedy of errors. It will really depend on your personal taste for which you feel succeeds more. Also if you liked the first you should like this new spin but if you disliked the first you may find yourself enjoying this one because it seems to rectify a lot of what people criticized Match Point for.Our entry point into the tale is with two brothers played by Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell. The two come from a modest family whose father is a restaurant owner attempting to get McGregor's character to take over the business for him while Farrell works at a garage fixing cars when not betting at the neighborhood track. Allen does a wonderful thing with these characters as he casts both against type. McGregor is usually the heart on his sleeve type and sympathetic in nature while Farrell generally plays the ladiesman lothario who is not afraid of a little scrap. Both are completely flipped on their heads here with Ewan getting ample opportunity to be cool under pressure seeing the big picture at all times and Colin showing some real nice range as the depressed and conflicted one unable to wrestle with his conscience. Much like Terry Gilliam's Brothers Grimm with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger cast as opposites I believe this change of pace helps build up the atmosphere needed for the laughs to work. Farrell's facial expressions are priceless and McGregor's attempts to stay afloat while the world falls apart around him is topnotch.The story itself is straightforward much like Match Point. Both brothers find themselves in trouble financially one for gambling debts and the other for a woman the beautiful Hayley Atwell. Only their rich uncle will be able to save them both however the time has finally come where his charity will need to be exchanged for something he desperately needs. It is the proposition from Uncle Howard a wonderful acting job by Tom Wilkinson which really sets into motion the underlying plot point that props up the rest of the film. What he asks is impossible yet after some persuading and bouts with ego both brothers take the plunge and find they can't deal with the pressure it causes.Even though I found a few of Woody's metaphors a bit too heavyhandedwhat's your favorite Greek tragedy? and the interpretations of dreams occurring left and rightI found the acting and plot progression to be spoton. Both leads carry the film on their backs and without those performances would have left the whole thing behind to drown. While it could seem a tad lazy that Allen would pretty much rehash what he did two years ago it is different enough to succeed on its own. Cassandra's Dream could be looked on as a very capable companion piece to Match Point I may even go so far as saying I liked it better but it also shows that a little comedy can go a long way. Hopefully Woody will delve more into this mixture of theatre's two faces and show how working together can create some wonderful art as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once again Allen in England for the third and possibly final time as a filmmaker treads into the waters of crime and agony where 'ordinary' people commit acts of nature that leave them into a complete existential upheaval. Cassandra's Dream might not be the best of the lot that Allen has carved out his two most notable examples being Match Point and Crimes  Misdemeanors but it's still a damn good story with characters to care about as they descend into the depths of their own making. To say that it isn't what the critics have been saying which is shallow shadow of Match Point and especially Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is an understatement even if it's less than a masterpiece.Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell who should likely bring even more lessthanseniorcitizenaged audiences to see the movie than did Match Point's cast star as middleclass blokes who have their own financial woes which grow exponentially for Farrell's Terry after he has gambling debts up to his ears. They get into a deal with their wealthy uncle played by Tom Wilkinson don't we all have one not quite like this one of course where he'll help them start over for McGregor's Ian a whole new start with a hot Hayley Atwell in California but on one condition a hit on a man who may testify on the uncle and put him in jail till the end of his days.Then begins the downhill slope of the characters with the whole maybe obvious but effective idea that there's no going back after getting rid of somebody innocent. Allen has a pretty basic premise to work with and it does have the one similarity of twobrothersintroubleanddoacrime but that's as far as it goes really. While to be sure Allen is no Sidney Lumet in getting the harshest dramatic vibe possible out of his genre piece he still garners some affecting stuff here though in a different form with the crimeandpunishment angle which is more then like a redux of M.P.What makes it work a lot better than just an average genre piece with quintessential Philip Glass music in towan unusual good bit for Allen who always uses old jazz and classical is the dynamic of the brothers and how they each want to get out of where they're at in life. They can't stand being in their solid middle class roots Ian at his father's restaurant and Terry as an auto mechanic and want more for themselves and for their respective love interests. But there's also a personality split Ian is more shifty out for himself a much truer criminal mind who justifies everything he does chiefly the homicide as doing better for himself and as well using that against Terry later on with him and Uncle going down with him while Terry has complete guilt if not fortitude in his conscience for what he will do and later does.It helps that McGregor and Farrell are very good in their roles particularly Farrell who's had less than stellar days as an actor lately as they just dig deep into the problem they face or try not to face as case might be. Wilkinson for the few scenes he appears is as usual brilliant. And Allen actually pumps up the suspense and tragedy with some slices of dark comedy like an accidental meeting of Mr. Burns the intended hit and the brothers at a bar which gives some further life to his material. At the end of the day Cassandra's Dream doesn't hit it out of the park but it's a lot better than you might have heard the story of a crime tearing up two distinct personalities.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw Woody Allen's latest movie at the Toronto Film Festival. Any who watch this expecting a flatout comedy are likely to be disappointed. The movie is far more dramatic than comedic. Essentially the movie is about two brothers who decide to commit a murder one to get himself out of debt the other to help his brother and also for his own monetary profit. Woody involves us in their thoughts in deciding to do it during the murder and afterwards. I found it psychologically believable and found myself very involved with the story. If anything is weak it's the ending. It's simply too abrupt and unemotional. Woody has made us care about these two brothers and then ends it suddenly with no sense of grief except for a brief shot of one of the brother's fianc. Colin Farrell in incredible and is the highlight of the movie. Whatever real humour comes from his character. You feel for his moral struggle which is of comedic proportions. He delivers the best line in the movie when the two brothers are hiding in a car waiting to kill their intended victim as he visits his mother. When they finally see him walking to the house Colin's character says to his brother Ewan McGregor as he starts to get out of the car to shoot him Let him visit his mother one last time.I should add I saw this movie the second night it played and not at the premier. The audience I was with was reacting to this movie as if it was a blackcomedy. However they were also laughing at anything that moved. But if they were right and I'm wrong and this was intended as a comedy I'm not sure it's very successful. I have to think that if Woody meant to make a black comedy it would have been far funnier.As a drama with comedy elements I would heartily recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "An intriguing thing about Woody Allen's CASSANDRA'S DREAM is the presence of actor Phil Davis. The movie deals with a plot to kill Martin Burns the character played by Davis. The character isn't particularly interesting and the reasons for wanting him dead remain mostly unclear but as Burns  if you don't look too closely and from a distance  Davis bears a vague resemblance to Woody same thinning gray hair prominent eyeglasses gaunt face skinny physique and taste in casual sport coats. The character gets precious little screen time and Davis gets very little opportunity to give Burns anything suggesting a personality so the similarities are purely superficial  but then the resemblance CASSANDRA'S DREAM has to a Woody Allen movie is also vague and superficial.It is admittedly unfair to criticize a filmmaker for not making a movie that fits neatly into a previously constructed mold to try to do something different. And Woody has two established styles  absurdist comedy and dark ohso serious melodrama. In his prolific career he has managed to run the gamut between the extremes occasionally mixing tones yet still creating films that have a distinctly Woody Allen quality. But as was the case with the equally banal and vastly overrated MATCH POINT the problem with CASSANDRA'S DREAM is that it is not only devoid of Woody's style but of any style. As always the film is technically proficient and slickly done but there is a coldness a lack of purpose behind CASSANDRA. Like many of his films it is essentially a dramatized short story but it lacks either his rambling cynical sense of humor or a pointed moral that makes its serious tone have a bite. Even his tired trademark rant about the futility of life due to the absence of a benevolent god is given only slight attention.The story is relatively simple In London two close workingclass brothers find themselves strapped for cash and seek to borrow money from their wealthy uncle. Uncle Howard is more than willing to oblige but there is a catch the boys have to earn the money by killing one of Uncle's business associates the aforementioned Mr. Burns. From there the story could go in two directions a comedy of errors as the two hapless amateurs try to commit the crime or a suspenseful drama as the two get drawn deeper and deeper into a dark world that neither wants nor is prepared for. Allen takes the story in the latter direction though unfortunately as he has shown previously he has no skill for creating suspense or directing scenes of violence.CASSANDRA'S DREAM isn't a bad movie but rather an inadequate one  or more accurately an incomplete one. The performances are just fine with Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell as the brothers Ian and Terry doing their best to flesh out thinly drawn characters. Indeed the actors could easily carry the material were it not for the weakness of Allen's poorly contrived narrative. Even accepting as a given that Ian and Terry are amateurs their plan to kill Burns is embarrassingly simpleminded and illogical If Uncle Howard is the one most likely to want Burns dead wouldn't his poor nephews' sudden display of unaccountable wealth seem suspiciously convenient? The story needs to be fleshed out with believable complications and should build to an ironic twist that delivers a bang and not a mere whimper.The screenplay that Allen offers is not without its merits. The two men played by McGregor and Farrell are basically decent blokes but their need for money and the way Uncle Howard Tom Wilkinson manipulates them to go bad in the name of family loyalty pushes them to rationalize their behavior. Further Ian is ambitious and Terry is a gambler and Allen subtly defines Uncle Howard as an ambitious gambler in his own right. But the story also shows that Ian and Terry have parallels to Burns as well similarities the script would have done better to explore with much greater interest. As is the battle between good and evil as Allen lays it out is exceedingly lame the wecan'tdothis  wehavetodothis dialogue is not backed up  or hyped up  with any dramatic tension. When the boys actually meet Burns and they and we find him to be a nice friendly man who seems undeserving of his fate the dramatic tension should be kicked up a notch. We are barely allowed to care for Terry and Ian to the point where we don't want them to commit the crime but we should certainly care as well whether their innocent victim dies. As in MATCH POINT and CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS and to some degree even MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY Allen can't seem to muster up much interest let alone sympathy for the victims of the crimes he concocts. A recurring theme in so many of his films is characters who rant and rave about how unjust and cruel our supposedly godless world is yet when Woody creates little worlds for his movies the god he plays isn't any more compassionate or caring. What's missing  and I know it is a tired complaint  is Woody's sharp wit that not only blesses his best characters with the quirks and charm that make them humorous but humane as well. When Woody defines his characters through wit they come alive when he defines them by their bitterness and discontent they remain stagnant and uninteresting and worse largely onedimensional. All of Woody's laborious moralizing dialogue never has as much power as one of his well constructed pieces of casual sarcasm.".

As in MATCH POINT and CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS and to some degree even MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY Allen can't seem to muster up much interest let alone sympathy for the victims of the crimes he concocts. A recurring theme in so many of his films is characters who rant and rave about how unjust and cruel our supposedly godless world is yet when Woody creates little worlds for his movies the god he plays isn't any more compassionate or caring. What's missing  and I know it is a tired complaint  is Woody's sharp wit that not only blesses his best characters with the quirks and charm that make them humorous but humane as well. When Woody defines his characters through wit they come alive when he defines them by their bitterness and discontent they remain stagnant and uninteresting and worse largely onedimensional. All of Woody's laborious moralizing dialogue never has as much power as one of his well constructed pieces of casual sarcasm.";

Then I saw that Woody Allen had directed and my expectations went down. I halfexpected another whiny selfabsorbed midlife crisis treatment but I was very pleasantly surprised. If I hadn't seen his name I would never have guessed Allen directed this movie.McGregor and Farrell start out as two happygolucky brothers living in London but soon one gets deep into gambling debt and they both turn in desperation to their rich uncle. His solution is to ask his nephews to do something horrible for him in return for the bailout. Meanwhile both young men are attempting to have normal relationships with their significant others. The actual crime itself and the very different effects it has on each brother occupy the rest of the film. It's a dark film nowhere near as glib as most Allen films and the character development of the two brothers is excellent. Both McGregor and Farrell turn in excellent performances. It's nice to see Woody Allen step outside his traditional boundaries and come up with such an engaging film.".

	schema:headline " BlackSailed Ships  Crossing Moral Lines";
	schema:reviewBody "Cassandra's Dream 2007 explores a favorite Woody Allen conundrum whether there really exists a moral line that when crossed causes the transgressor to suffer intolerable pangs of guilt  and if so whether those pangs originate from a watchful JudeoChristian God the fateful Furies of classic tragedy or simply the chance structure of an individual psyche. The film presents us with two such transgressors the brothers Ian and Terry Blaine Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell who for various reasons agree to commit a murder of convenience against a man they know only as a threat to their rich Uncle Howard Tom Wilkinson whose goodwill and largess they covet. One brother  good looking smooth talking Ian  seems quite capable of rationalizing the crime and reaping its benefits which for him include the funding of his latest getrichquick scheme and the successful wooing of a beautiful aspiring actress Hayley Atwell he must social climb to attain. But the other brother  underachieving goodhearted Terry  motivated by huge gambling debts a girl friend with domestic inclinations and a weak mind made even weaker by a growing addiction to alcohol and painkillers begins to unravel almost as soon as the murder is committed. As Terry's guiltridden torment begins to threaten both Ian and Uncle Howard with exposure Uncle Howard  the ultimate amoral sleaze ball  proposes that Ian knock off his brother too. Thus the stakes in the crossingtheline plot are raised to the ultimate Biblical crime fratricide. Can Ian having gone a long way down the slippery slope to utter nihilism complete the job? That is the last moral question Allen raises in Cassandra's Dream and I'll leave it to his small cadre of faithful viewers to find out the answer for themselves. I will however divulge the verbal playfulness in the film's title. On a literal level Cassandra's Dream is the name the brothers give a sailboat they purchase in the film's opening sequence. It is named in honor of a 601 shot that came through for Terry during his initial lucky streak at the dog races. Symbolically  and some might say heavyhandedly  the sailboat Cassandra's Dream evokes the world of Greek tragedy and specifically Homer's Cassandra daughter of King Priam of Troy who is blessedcursed by Apollo with the gift of prophecy that no one heeds. Cassandra foresees the tragic doom of Troy but it powerless to stop it. Allen's film has a similar sense of inexorable doom and the sailboat that symbolizes tragic vision also frames the film's action physically in its opening central turning point and climactic scenes. Since the boat was acquired by seeming luck yet like Oedipus' crown is really a harbinger of unforeseen but quickly arriving tragic fate it neatly encapsulates the film's central theme as well. On top of this is a broader play on the metaphorical use of ships to express luck good or ill. Ian ironically assumes that his ship has finally come in but as his father like a oneman Greek chorus reminds him The only ship certain to come in has black sails. Like most of Allen's films in the past decade Cassandra's Dream reworks territory familiar to those who have followed his career since the beginning. Many of the same moral issues were raised and explored in one of Allen's greatest films Crimes and Misdemeanors whose title in turn revealed the literary sources of the theme Dostoyevski's Crime and Punishment. Allusions to Greek myth and tragedy were extensively laced  albeit comically  throughout Mighty Aphrodite and in the opening of Allen's preceding film Scoop. Cassandra's Dream is not as good as any of these or perhaps not even as good as the last example of serious Woody Match Point but it's not a bad film. Its plot has a stark stagelike melodramatic quality that is compelling even if entirely humorless and mostly predictable. The pairing of two fine young actors like Farrell and McGregor creates a fascinating chemistry and the rest of the cast particularly Wilkinson and the gorgeous Atwell has its moments. Vilmos Zsigmund's cinematography highlighting London and the English countryside is stunning and Philip Glass's score adds a powerful emotional dimension as well. I've gone back and forth on my feelings about this latest effort from Allen but I've finally veered toward a qualified thumbs up. For devotees of funny Woody I'd suggest a pass but his die hard fans  of whom I am certainly one  will find much of interest in Cassandra's Dream.".

Whenever Tom Wilkinson coerces Ewan McGregor andor Colin Farrell to commit murder or something equally heinous people began to cackle as if Woody Allen meant it as black humor. When the lights came up I found that the theater was full of middleaged social circles. The very affected man behind me said to his wife That was a funny movie. No sir it wasn't. Do not let insecure pseudointellectuals influence your perception of Cassandra's Dream. It is perhaps the darkest of Woody's forays into drama. It even references Greek tragedy in dialogue as its narrative structure concurs with it.McGregor Farrell and Wilkinson turn in absolutely astounding performances among the best of their careers thus far. Farrell drains himself emotionally and Wilkinson plays possibly the most twisted and disturbed character Woody's ever created a sort of role for which Wilkinson is highly capable. McGregor while not quite as strong as the other two is a formidable lead amongst them the one of two brothers whose sense of self is capable of hiding behind itself more comfortably than Farrell.Cassandra's Dream is as some of Woody's earlier dramatic efforts have been an exercise. He's flexing his wings but the story is not personal as ironically are nearly every comedy he's done and even Match Point. It is a plot classically ordered with one central character's wants and needs augmenting or diminishing depending on the prearranged moral message. This is not a problem at all with the movie except that it makes it more detached than his best films. The ending portrays the forensic efficiency of London police as capable of discovering deaths before there being any way of reporting them as well as determining things only determinable by lab tests however the film is still just as enthralling wellmade and intelligent as every one of his movies from the best to the least.One of the highlights of the film is Philip Glass's musical score which is almost reminiscent of Jonny Greenwood's score for There Will Be Blood only much more pulsating and much less dissonant.".

Many of the situations play allinone as funny sad and realistic.The bottom line is that the BreakUp is solid film built with Hollywood money and stars that chooses a route its benefactors rarely allow to be taken. This fact alone makes the movie worth viewing.";

But when the DVD was released I snatched it up in a hurry because my wife loves romantic comedies. And that's exactly what we thought we were going to get. Instead we got a poignant heartfelt and almost painfully realistic piece of insight into the psychology and calamity of two people struggling to hold onto something they never had ahold of in the first place love.First of all I must say that Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston were absolutely fantastic. I'm a huge fan of Vince's and I've enjoyed Jennifer in most of the films I've seen her in but I've never appreciated either of them as much as I did in The Breakup. Their acting was directly ontarget. The initial fight scene when the breakup actually occurs was so phenomenal I actually paused the movie when it was over just to take it all in. I've never seen two people on screen portray a 'lovers quarrel' so accurately and realistically. Hats off to Jen and Vince for an outstanding performance.The movie definitely has its funny moments. Vince brings his usual fasttalking wit to the screen and that's an instant recipe for comedy in my book. But what I really took from this movie as someone who is in a committed relationship and understands as well as the average person can the complexities of love was its underlying message. Love is not all moonlight and roses it's not always romantic it's not always fun and it's sure as hell not always easy. But hard work dedication and a solid foundation of love and respect can bring two people through just about anything together. This movie is absolutely brilliant and I'd recommend it to anyone but especially married couples or people in committed relationships.".

I happen to think that this movie is excellent! True the movie has many scenes where you will burst out laughing but there are also scenes which will touch you or even make you cry. What I like about this movie is that it's very realistic on how it portrays relationships especially when it's on the brink of dissolution. Because isn't that how life and relationships really are? It isn't always rosy there has to be a mix of gray and blue or it would be pretty boring.Jen and Vince did an awesome job in this movie as well as all the supporting casts. My only comment is on the script which may be a bit lacking in character development.

	schema:reviewBody "As mama used to say The extent of the nourishment you get from your  entertainment water is directly related to how deep your well of  expectations runs. I always thought mama was a bit too verbose in her  metaphorical philosophizing but there's truth in them there words!  Thanks to Hollywood's constant desire to market films based on what  they feel they have to trick people into thinking they're about some  audiences will likely go to see The BreakUp ignore the insinuations  of the movie's title and expect something cute and fluffy. As such  the movie is unfairly saddled with expectations that it can't possibly  meet for no other reason than the simple fact that this is NOT a  conventional chick flick romantic comedy that will warm those little  heart cockles and send you floating out of the theater on a cotton  candy cloud.  After a chance meeting at a CubsWhite Sox baseball game an opening  credit relationship photo montage creatively establishes that Jennifer  Aniston and Vince Vaughn are a couple. Just not for much longer. You  see Jennifer is busy cooking for a family dinner. Vince's only  responsibility is to bring home 12 lemons so that she can create a  centerpiece for the dinner table. So what does he do? Brings home  three. Jen's understandably agitated.  Rather than dutifully go get the extra lemons Vince tries to find  alternatives that will allow him to just sit on the couch and play  video games until everybody arrives. Perhaps use the lemons to flavor  the chicken since he tasted it and thought it was a little too spicy  anyway? Maybe place them in a glass and create a smaller centerpiece?  Yeah it's fairly clear which three letters he puts in class.   This leads to his lack of desire to help with the dishes later that  evening. Oh he'll help with them in the morning but Jen really wants  them done tonight. Fifteen minutes of work won't kill the guy right?  When Jen expresses her disdain for the lack of appreciation he shows  her he goes into a characterexposing rant and declares his desire to  just be left alone. Jen's had enough and decides to grant him his wish.  Commence with the breakup and the emotional tugofwar that carries  the majority of the movie.  This is where some audiences might get lost. Why? Probably because it  feels so real and sometimes reality doesn't always sell. People still  love fairy tales you know? The arguments and hardfeelings that slowly  develop will likely hit home with anybody who has gone through a break  up and I have no doubt that many if not most guys will fill a little  discomfort when they see some of themselves in Vince.  The thing I appreciated the most is despite his penchant for being a  jerk Vince isn't adorned with a black hat and presented to us for our  jeering. It's just the way he is. He likes doing things his way. He  treats his friends and brothers in the same manner but they still love  the guy and like hanging out with him he just needs to learn to accept  doing things he might not want to for the people he loves. He's likable  and funny enough that we root for him to learn the lesson.  Likewise Jennifer isn't placed on a pedestal with a golden halo on her  head. Though she's the more sympathetic of the two she still resorts  to playing dirty and isn't allowed to come off completely innocent.  Perhaps the character flaws won't play well with the give me  idealistic characters! crowd but I found them refreshingly realistic.  The movie's focal point is the often volatile chemistry between Vince  and Jennifer which I thought was great but the supporting characters  are also very effective albeit underused. Vince has some showstealing  scenes with Jason Bateman and particularly one with Jon Favreau and  his everincreasing girth that are so good that you can't help but be  disappointed that there aren't more to savor.  Speaking of disappointment go ahead and prepare yourself for the  potential of more as the closing credits begin to scroll. I admit that  I wanted a little more closure than I was given and that seemed to be  the audience consensus. I suppose we should admire the screenwriters  for sticking by their guns and refusing to tie all the loose ends as  tightly as test audiences have demanded but that doesn't mean we have  to be happy about it. I could have handled it better had it not felt so  abrupt and left me feeling a little incomplete.  But it certainly doesn't ruin the movie. You just need to check your  expectations and give the film a fair chance. Don't be a pawn of the  marketing team's efforts to mislead audiences into the door.  If you're a Vince fan I would also advise you not to expect the Johnny  JumpUp zaniness of The Wedding Crashers or Dodgeball. The BreakUp is  a movie of a different breed. Abandoning the temptation to deliver a  consistently uproarious comedy romp The BreakUp deliberately balances  itself with dramatic conflict and gives us something a little  different than what Hollywood has forced us to become accustomed to.  It doesn't do it flawlessly but at least it makes the attempt.".

That is definitely true.Aside from that however it is a poorlymade movie. The timing is off comic and otherwise the editing is off pace and the writing is clunky. I've read a lot of user comments that mention the fantastic depth of character. Let me just say that having characters that act like immature jerks instead of typical movie star characters does not automatically qualify as character developmentit's just different and new not real character development. There are many characters that we get to know a little and are left with NO wrapup for. The main characters are the only ones we get closure for but even they are not people we really care about by the end of the movie. I felt when we left the theater that Aniston and Vaughn had so little chemistry it's hard to believe they developed a romance off the set.The biggest problem is consistency. If you're going to make Vaughn's character a beyond believable inconsiderate jerk this same character would not make a 180 degree turn around after a short erudite pep talk from his bartender friend. By the same token if you're going to make Aniston's character the kind of person who would put up with this behavior for so long she would NOT in real life totally change her mind about him a few days after sobbing in her bedroom about their relationship when he finally makes the list of changes she wants minus the bowl of lemons and ballet tickets he should have had on that table with the dinner.As an aside I know that I am probably the only one who feels this way but the language was much rougher than I was expecting. If you go to see Lethal Weapon 18 you expect F's and GD's galore but it really took me by surprise in a romantic comedy especially since there are so many GD's in the first 15 minutes of the movie. I just mention it for the record.All in all I would pay another 15 just to have that two hours of my life back. And while we're at it I am really sick of the marketing geniuses advertising movies in such a way that you have no idea what you're walking into. It makes the viewer give it even worse wordofmouth than they would have otherwise. You can bet I've already written an email to all my friends telling them what a huge disappointment this movie was and to avoid it.To sum up Sloppy execution poor characters inconsistent followthrough and a really crappy ending. Save this one for DVD and even then wait for it to be taken off the new releases wall so you don't have to pay as much for it or better yet maybe you'll get lucky and your library will carry it and you will be able to pay NOTHING for it which is basically what it's worth.".

But light hearted it was not. We have a very peaceful life in our home and I was unprepared for the amount of yelling that was dressed up as dialog. There wasn't anything funny about it. Probably 70 of the dialog consisted of people yelling at each other.We were probably taken in by the trailers which made the movie appear a bit humorous. The only problem is that all the funny parts were in the trailer. Nothing else was a bit humorous.The only good parts were the first and last songs.

	schema:headline " Another disappointment in Aniston's oeuvre";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a moment in The BreakUp when art gallery owner Marilyn Dean Judy Davis turns to Brooke Jennifer Aniston and says This isn't surrealism. This isn't cubism. This is paintbynumbers. Marilyn's referring to Brooke's relationship crisis with Gary Vince Vaughn but she very well could have been talking about the film. Of course I doubt the writers Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavendar have that much of a sense of irony.I realize there are loads of disappointed moviegoers who went in expecting a romantic comedy  and the film's trailers are to blame for that I suppose  and instead found a bleakly dark film about the breakup of a relationship. Frankly that's the only refreshing thing about this film.This isn't a pat romantic comedy. However it has all the trappings and clichs of one down to the obligatory best friend for each main character. In Brooke's case it is Addie played by Joey Lauren Adams who still has the cutest husky voice on film. And for Gary there's Johnny O played by Jon Favreau what a shock!.I have no problem sitting through a film that recounts a couple's breakup and the lengths to which they go to make the other miserable andor jealous. However in The BreakUp neither Gary nor Brooke is all that interesting a person. And  talk about suspension of disbelief  it's incredibly tough to swallow that these two would ever have found each other even vaguely interesting.Both Brooke and Gary are pedestrian people. Their arguments are to quote Marilyn paintbynumbers. He's immature and accuses her of always nagging him she complains he never listens to her and takes her for granted.So we get to see these two bicker and yell about nothing their methods to make each other jealous are neither inventive nor humorous. Watching this movie I remembered how much I enjoyed The War of the Roses 1989 a superb dark comedy about a disintegrating relationship. But that film was smart had passion and Oliver and Barbara Rose's revenge was gleefully funny. There was something perversely delightful about that film. And we understood why Oliver and Barbara Rose liked each other so much thanks to terrific chemistry between Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. I have no idea whether Aniston and Vaughn have any onscreen chemistry. Because in The BreakUp we never ever get a sense of why Brooke and Gary are together or what brought them together. The film would've been well served had Garelick and Lavendar thought to give us a glimpse of these two people in love so that we could then understand and sympathize when we saw their relationship crumbling. Instead the writers resort to lazy storytelling. The film is peopled with dull andor typical characters. The only pleasant surprise is Jason Bateman turning an underwritten role of a rather slimy real estate agent into something that at least makes one smile. The alwaysterrific Vincent D'Onofrio's sparse scenes only make us yearn for more of him in this movie.The others are true tossaways. What AnnMargret is doing in this movie as Brooke's mom is beyond me. They couldn't have plucked any middleaged woman off the street for this thankless role? AnnMargret's only purpose seems to be to provide some sort of musical background for a dinnertable scene that just strains to be funny. Apparently we continue paying the price for My Best Friend's Wedding 1997.There's nothing wrong about watching a movie about the breakup of a relationship. Francois Ozon handled the subject matter beautifully in 5X2 2004 and just before I saw The BreakUp I watched another the French film Clara et Moi 2004. Now there was a film dealing with real issues gave us characters we cared about and with whom we sympathized because we knew what brought them together and why they loved each other. Compared to those two films The BreakUp seems downright mediocre and superficial which is exactly what it is.".

He did the monotoned funny monologue. The exposition of the movie is pretty amusing as you are introduced to everyone.Vince Vaughn works with his 2 brothers on a tour guide bus and Jennifer Anniston works in an art gallery with a strange but funny boss and a gay semidragqueen co worker played by Justin Long from Dodgeball in this movie he has long straight black hair and looks like a Chinese woman. Towards the beginning there is a scene where Anniston and Vaughn's families meet at dinner and you realize how Vaughn and Anniston's relationship is slowly declining...that is where it lost its spunk.  that scene is about 20 minutes the rest is boring and not funny.As soon as they start fighting the rest is them just whining and being mad at each other and thinking of ways to make each other jealous with Anniston going on dates and Vaughn having parties with his friends.From there there is the occasional amusing line and the scene where you see Jennifer Anniston's butt.Even after breaking up they still live together in their apartment because they need a place to live and they have continuous disputes about whose room belongs to who annoying. Jennifer Anniston starts to realize that she wants him back and invites him to a concert for a casual date. He does not show up and she goes home and cries and whines. He explains to her that he wanted to go but blah blah blah. She tells him while crying that all she ever wanted from him was a little appreciation. This hits Vince Vaughn and he shows his appreciation.While she goes out one day he cleans the house and makes dinner for her and he does the I love you I'm never going to hurt you clich speech and she has the nonclich reaction she tells him that she does not love him and they wind up selling their apartment. They both go their separate ways he continues his tour guide business and she travels for a while. They meet a few months after and do the it's good to see you! you look great! how you been? conversation. You can definitely see that they are hiding their emotions behind their smiles and that they still want to be together. Then the best part of the movie happened. . . IT ENDED!

	schema:reviewBody "I was expecting a romantic comedy. Although there were some comedic elements The Break Up was too shrill and combative to qualify as a romantic comedy. Several scenes were uncomfortable to watch. Jennifer Anniston lacked her usual spark. Vince Vaughn's performance was lackluster. One of my favorite actors Jason Bateman I hate to say it sucked. One can only blame the director for taking such good actors and having them turn out such mediocre performances. The minor characters were not well developed and even the major characters lacked a third dimension or likeability. The script was also lacking. I would recommend that you not waste your money on this tripe. If you are looking for a lighthearted feelgood romantic comedy The BreakUp is to be avoided. Go look for something British instead.".

His scenes are decent amusing quirky as his fans have come to expect from him but nothing particularly outstanding in his long career of solid performances. There's no rush to lay out 510 to see 'The BreakUp' just have NetFlix ship it to you in a couple of months.Jason Bateman is fantastic as Riggleman the real estate agent. He's perfectly smarmy and subtle and amusing. Too bad there isn't more of him in this film Everyone else is pretty much a disappointment...what I want to know is if you're not allowed to connect to the alleged romance you never really see any PDA physical display of affection or signs of affection and tenderness between them until it's a foregone conclusion that their 'relationship' is history between Brooke and Gary how could you possibly care about their breaking up? Vince Vaughn's a huge disappointment he was great in 'Thumbsucker' so if you're not familiar with that film go rent it instead. As always Jennifer Aniston did nada for me  I still don't get her appeal so I can't recommend something else she's done sorry you're on your own here Jen fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "The BreakUp 2006 Directed By Peyton Reed Starring Vince Vaughn Jennifer Aniston Joey Lauren Adams Jon Favreau Jason Bateman Judy Davis  Justin Long MPAA Rating PG13 for sexual content some nudity and language The BreakUp is probably most famous for sparking the famous relationship of Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn. Think about it as the Mr. and Mrs. Smith for the couple. The only difference is that Mr. and Mrs. Smith was a fun entertaining movie and The BreakUp is anything but. In fact this is one of the least entertaining and joyless movies I have seen this year. We all know how hard and awkward breakups can be. The BreakUp analyzes this with very little compromise. In fact it puts this failing couple into one of most awkward situations imaginablehaving them share a condo until they can sell it. The real question though is not how they will handle this situationbut why should we really want to see it? Why do we want to see two people bicker and complain for an hour and forty or so minutes? Why do we want to experience all of the awkward moments that come with this scenario? The answer is that of course we don't want to do anything of these things. Herein lays the problem with The BreakUp. It is a movie that we just don't want to see filled with characters we don't really care about.Gary Grobowski Vaughn and Brooke Meyers Aniston were once a loving couple who had everything they thought they needed each other a wonderful condo and jobs that were certain to propel them to bigger and better things. But now the relationship is over and neither of them can afford to pay for the mortgage without each otherand so they are having to sell but until they find a buyer they must live together. Both still bitter over the difficult breakup decide to make each other miserable by flirting with other people inviting loud friends over quartering the condo up into different compartments and more. But will they realize that they really do love each other and reconcileor is this breakup for good? If you have ever watched a romantic comedy you know that the entire movie circles around you wanting desperately for the couple to be happy and together at the end. I didn't feel that way at all about the couple in The BreakUp. In fact I only wanted them to go their separate ways and to stop the annoying arguing and the backstabbing. Vince Vaughn's character Gary in particular was horribly annoying whenever Aniston's character Brooke was around and while Brooke was at least likable many of her actions seemed mean and reprehensible. How could anyone want these two to get together? The relationship was just bothersome and aggravating.How could The BreakUp not work? It had a great cast and the director of Down with Love a bitter yet hilarious romantic comedy and Bring It On a hip edgy teen comedy behind it? This movie seemed like a sure bet and yet it just doesn't work. It isn't romantic. It isn't funny. It is awkward and the constant arguing gets old very quickly. The characters themselves are indeed very strangealmost like parodies of real people but the movie takes itself far too seriously to allow them to seem realistic. The two main characters are not made out to be people we can really care about. Gary especially is despicable for the majority of the movie and Brooke though the only main character with which we can sympathize does her fair share of mean things. On top of all of this where was the humor? Was this supposed to be a comedy? If so then it is one of the least effective comedies of the year. On a warmer note Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn give great performances and the actual breakup and ensuing arguments are handled realistically. The only problem is why would anyone really want to see them? Final Thought Despite good performances from the leads The BreakUp is an awkward unfunny movie that fails to engage its audience.Overall Rating 410 C".

The Break Up is essentially the same film aside from the fact that Vaughn and Anniston are not married.Some of the biggest problems with this movie are that its advertised as a comedy but fails miserably. The theater was full of uncomfortable chuckles and forced laughter where genuine laughter came maybe one or twice. Another problem is the cast. Jon Faveru plays Vaughns buddy no surprise there since they have featured in more then a few movies Vincent D'Onofrio and Cole Hauser play unlikely siblings then you have Joey Lauren Adams Jason Bateman Justin Long Waiting and Peter Billingsley Elf Christmas Story whose celebrity and in some cases talent fall moot in this lacking script. Lastly the film feels incomplete when it abruptly ends and maybe thats giving it to much credit. It seemed to me and to other audience members that the writers of this film simply realized what a horrible mistake they have made penning this film and then just up and quit on it. To describe this film would be all to easy. It is as if a couple you have known long enough to be considered friends invited you to their home and then began to argue making everything uncomfortable and then you realize their is no door in the room in which to escape the akwardness of it all.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie would have been good if it wasn't so pathetic. After a brief introduction to a premise the movie gets into full gear with a bunch of tried and tested and by now irritating onslaught of clichs. The ending turns out to be the now standard for all clich movies a complete twist or turn around. I mean you spend 70 mins of the movie watching something so predictable and in the very end you watch something that is a complete turnaround which is illogical all so that some producer or director can say that the movie is not clich. It would have refreshing if this itself  ironically hadnt been turning into a clich. Vaughn and Aniston do not share an onscreen chemistry and all they can achieve are bids to out do each other. As usual the trailer of the movie is very well done and gives the impression of a great movie but if all you wanted to see what was the best bits of the movie just stick with the trailer.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie would have been good if it wasn't so pathetic. After a brief introduction to a premise the movie gets into full gear with a bunch of tried and tested and by now irritating onslaught of clichs. The ending turns out to be the now standard for all clich movies a complete twist or turn around. I mean you spend 70 mins of the movie watching something so predictable and in the very end you watch something that is a complete turnaround which is illogical all so that some producer or director can say that the movie is not clich. It would have refreshing if this itself  ironically hadnt been turning into a clich. Vaughn and Aniston do not share an onscreen chemistry and all they can achieve are bids to out do each other. As usual the trailer of the movie is very well done and gives the impression of a great movie but if all you wanted to see what was the best bits of the movie just stick with the trailer. I would say this movie is recommended only for fans of Vaughn or Aniston who would rather get pleasure watching the actors rather the actual movie itself.";

It runs for slightly under 100 minutes and was written and directed by Kurt Maetzig. The original novel the film is based on is by Hans Schweikart. This is the story of a married couple and how the Nazis' rise to power and ideology makes more and more of a dangerous impact on their marriage. They are both actor but as the woman is Jewish her career quickly goes south because of her religion and origins. The interesting thing is how it all unfolds. Initially we hear for example that the characters think it's nothing serious or that the husband says he will easily use his popularity to protect her but they clearly underestimated the situation. Unfortunately they absolutely did not make the most of this premise. There are moments when it is an okay little film but there are also many lengths and almost all the supporting character are pretty bland and uninteresting so every time the story moves away for a second directly from the couple it's just not worth seeing at all. This is especially disappointing as Maetzig who by the way lived for over a hundred years had quite a few pretty talented actors at his disposal such as Paul Klinger Ilse Steppat who is most known today for playing a Bond villain shortly before her untimely death or Hans Leibelt and actually some others you may recognize if you have an interest in German films from an era long gone. You can find the entire cast list here on IMDb. All in all all the heartbreak and emotion inside this film did not really manage to get to me and touch me in a way I hoped it would. This is one of the early German films dealing with the years of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust but it is far from the best and does not really deserve any of the praise or accolades it has been getting. I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

This film stands out from the standard murder mystery in that it presents a nonstandard view of Jews who immigrated to the US.  To divulge more would spoil the film.  Roy Scheider is perfect and Janet Margolin is beautiful.  In addition  now  nearly 25 years later  it is fun watching Chris Walken John Glover and Mandy Patinkin early in their careers.  It is funny to realize that Margolin Walken and Glover were all in Annie Hall two years earlier.".

	schema:headline " Last Embrace When Harry Met Ellie";
	schema:reviewBody "Although Jonathan Demme's 1992 Oscarwinner THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was his first major suspense thriller it wasn't the first film he'd ever made in that genre. That honor goes to Demme's 1979 thriller LAST EMBRACE LE which I first saw and loved during its original theatrical run. At the time LE was touted as a romantic Hitchcockian thriller. While LE definitely has strong elements of VERTIGO and other Hitchcock classics I've always considered it to be more of a paranoia thriller with film noir touches which I guess makes LE what might be called film shachor.  Cool craggy yet suave Roy Scheider had long been one of our family's favorite toughguy actors to many fans. At first glance he might not seem vulnerable enough to be convincing as a beleaguered paranoia film hero. However Scheider proved to be perfect casting as Harry Hannan a government agent with more baggage than Louis Vuitton. Harry is still heartbroken and guiltridden about his beloved wife getting killed while she accompanied him as cover on one of his assignments. After he spends time in a Connecticut sanitarium recovering from his nervous breakdown Harry has barely had a chance to lose his institutional pallor when he's almost shoved in front of an express train. When he returns to his spy agency in New York City his slippery spymaster Eckart Christopher Walken keeps him at arm's length maybe Eckart thinks Harry's sharp creamcolored suit makes him too conspicuous for undercover work. Worst of all Harry discovers he's one of several Jewish men getting death threats written in Biblical Hebrew from an unknown Avenger of Bloodand so far he's the only one still alive.Everyone scoffs at poor Harry's jitters. Who can he trust? Certainly not his brotherinlaw Charles Napier a fellow spook who blames Harry for his sister's violent death You're careless with people Harry. Our hero eventually joins forces with Ellie Fabian Janet Margolin a pretty New York graduate student who sublet his apartment while he was in the sanitarium. But the vulnerable Ellie seems to have her own issues and secrets. Will that spell doom for both Ellie and Harry? And how does a turnofthe20thcentury Jewish brothel figure in the sinister fix Harry has found himself in? Scheider and Margolin had fine chemistry together their characters' sensitivity and wariness made me feel for them and they even had playful moments along the way. Ms. Margolin was at her loveliest too. Sadly she died of ovarian cancer in 1993 at the age of 50. Janet we hardly knew ye. Scheider Margolin and Walken are aided and abetted by a rogues' gallery of stellar New York character actors including John Glover as Ellie's insecure professor boyfriend Marcia Rodd as Harry's nervous agency contact David Margulies as a rabbi with connections Joe Spinell and Jim McBride as thugs Captain Arthur Haggerty as a bouncer waiting to use the phone Mandy Patinkin and Max Wright in bit parts as commuters who may or may not have some 'splainin' to do scenestealer Sam Levene as the crotchety but likable head of a secret Jewish society and director Demme himself cameoing as a stranger on a train.Some critics complained that despite Demme's obvious affection for the Hitchcockian material LE could have used more of The Master of Suspense's zest and verve. I won't deny that the pace slows down at times but with Roy Scheider at his peak and Janet Margolin's touching multifaceted performance I was willing to be patient. Demme and screenwriter David Shaber adapting Murray Teigh Bloom's novel The 13th Man make up for the film's flaws with plenty of appealingly quirky Demmestyle characterization. Judaism's key role in LE's plot was fresh and intriguing as well as making excellent use of an elaborate wellcrafted red herring. The settings contribute to the film's Demmeness his ace Director of Photography Tak Fujimoto really makes the New York City and Princeton NJ locations integral to the plot and its Hitchcockian motifs especially the bell tower sequence and an exciting climax at Niagara Falls I can hear you making lewd jokes . The film brims with onlyinNewYork characters and situations for instance the competition for living space in Manhattan provides amusing undertones to Harry's first awkward encounters with Ellie. Miklos Rozsa's swooningly romantic yet foreboding score pulls together the film's emotional undercurrents beautifully. Between LAST EMBRACE and STILL OF THE NIGHT if I'd been Roy Scheider I'd have stayed out of Central Park and environs for fear of elusive assailants! LAST EMBRACE is also available on DVD httpwww.mgm.comviewmovie1084LastEmbrace".

The plot could be seen as a little convoluted but Jonathan Demmes' direction is masterful the use of locations is excellent the cast is amazing and the finale is quite gripping. Even if the viewer figures out where the story is headed getting to the conclusion is an enjoyable journey.Making a difference is the ever personable Roy Scheider playing Harry Hannan a CIA agent who has to watch while his wife is assassinated in a cantina. One of the goons is played by Joe Spinell in a very brief cameo. He becomes paranoid and spends the balance of the film wondering if he will die next. Certainly it seems that somebody has marked him as he is receiving cryptic death streets printed in Aramaic.Scheider is extremely well supported by a lovely young actress Janet Margolin who plays the role of Ellie Fabian. Ellie is an anthropologist who through circumstance comes to stay in Harry's residence. Watching her one will likely regret the fact that she didn't have a more visible film career and mourn her untimely passing. John Glover as always is a real hoot as the uppity professor who is dating Ellie. The endearing Sam Levene makes the most of his screen time as private investigator Sam Urdell. Demme regular Charles Napier is good as Dave Quittle the brother of Harry's late wife. Christopher Walken like Glover is typically fun in an amusing turn as Harry's weaselly young superior. Other familiar faces appear in the supporting cast Jacqueline Brookes David Margulies the mayor from Ghost Busters Andrew Duncan and Marcia Rodd. Look for Mandy Patinkin and Max Wright in bits as commuters and for Demme himself in an uncredited blinkandyoumightmissit part as a man on a train. Scheider has one particularly fine monologue scene.The score by Miklos Rozsa is absolutely perfect and the story based on a novel by Murray Teigh Bloom is well told and reasonably absorbing. Niagara Falls provides a stunning backdrop for the climactic action. While there's no epilogue one feels a certain sadness at the outcome.This is a good film to check out so it's appreciated that Kino Lorber finally released it to Blu ray.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having watched an interesting documentary recently Dial H for Hitchcock it's clear to see how Jonathan Demme was influenced by the master himself. His admiration for the master is evident yet in spite of everything Mr. Demme's Last Embrace was a surprise nonetheless. Last Embrace was one of his first films and it sort of showed the trajectory of Jonathan Demme as a film director would follow. If you haven't seen the film please stop reading here.When Harry Hannan's wife is tragically killed his life begins to unravel. Harry spends some time in a sanatorium trying to get himself together. Unfortunately whoever wanted him put away is still much in evidence as his presence is felt right at the station where Harry is trying to board the train back home to Manhattan.Harry is taken aback to find Ellie living in his apartment something he had no idea was happening. It's only fitting with films of this genre that Harry will fall for the beautiful young woman who apparently seems to be trying to help him solve the puzzle about a cryptic death threat he has received at home.Harry with the help of Sam Urdell starts investigating about the meaning of the strange message he got. Urdell's connection within the Jewish community also unravels another conspiracy that Harry knew nothing about. The final episode involves going through the tunnels where visitors must enter in order to see real close the Falls at Niagara. Even before that there's also a great scene involving Harry's former brotherinlaw in a tower at Princeton which kept reminding us of Vertigo.Roy Scheider makes an intense Harry. In fact Mr. Scheider at the time this film was made was at the height of his career and he clearly shows why he was an excellent actor. The beautiful Janet Margolin plays Ellie a woman who is too good to be true when we first meet her but we have no clue as to what she is capable of doing.

	onyx:emotionText "Having watched an interesting documentary recently Dial H for Hitchcock it's clear to see how Jonathan Demme was influenced by the master himself. His admiration for the master is evident yet in spite of everything Mr. Demme's Last Embrace was a surprise nonetheless. Last Embrace was one of his first films and it sort of showed the trajectory of Jonathan Demme as a film director would follow. If you haven't seen the film please stop reading here.When Harry Hannan's wife is tragically killed his life begins to unravel. Harry spends some time in a sanatorium trying to get himself together. Unfortunately whoever wanted him put away is still much in evidence as his presence is felt right at the station where Harry is trying to board the train back home to Manhattan.Harry is taken aback to find Ellie living in his apartment something he had no idea was happening. It's only fitting with films of this genre that Harry will fall for the beautiful young woman who apparently seems to be trying to help him solve the puzzle about a cryptic death threat he has received at home.Harry with the help of Sam Urdell starts investigating about the meaning of the strange message he got. Urdell's connection within the Jewish community also unravels another conspiracy that Harry knew nothing about. The final episode involves going through the tunnels where visitors must enter in order to see real close the Falls at Niagara. Even before that there's also a great scene involving Harry's former brotherinlaw in a tower at Princeton which kept reminding us of Vertigo.Roy Scheider makes an intense Harry. In fact Mr. Scheider at the time this film was made was at the height of his career and he clearly shows why he was an excellent actor. The beautiful Janet Margolin plays Ellie a woman who is too good to be true when we first meet her but we have no clue as to what she is capable of doing. The great Sam Levene is seen as Sam Urdell who befriends Harry and is instrumental in getting to the bottom of this mystery. In supporting roles some familiar faces who went to do much better work later. Christopher Walken Mandy Patinkin Jacqueline Brookes Marcia Rodd Charles Napier among others are seen in the film.Jonathan Demme proved he was a talent that would go to bigger and better things even then.";

It's always stuck with me even though it has been a long time since I've seen the movie. I've been waiting for this to be released on DVD so I can see it again but as of now it's only available in Region 2.It might be fun again just to see veteran actors Christopher Walken Mandy Patinkin and John Glover in a film made 30 years ago. Director Jonathan Demme has done some interesting films since then too.Most of the story involves mysterious people chasing others and if I went into it in any detail it would ruin things for anyone who hasn't seen it. That's especially true because there are so many twists and turns in this story. However to be frank I think Hollywood has overdone conspiracy theory movies of which this is one. I also think the profanity could have been lowered in here especially by Roy Scheider's character Harry and the film would still have been just as intense.What I really appreciated more than the actors or story frankly was the photography and Demme's direction. There were a lot of really interesting camera angles shots that zoomed in an out and other gimmicks that I usually fall for. There were enough of them to carry the first hour at least. Living not too far from Niagara Falls I was glad to see that in the climactic finale.".

Has all the trappings of a bubblegum thriller and when you scrape away all the flashiness that is really all you get.Not that it isn't entertaining.  The camera movements and angles are downright dazzling. I especially liked those frantic zoom shots that look like it's shot from a camera put on a roller coaster car.  There is also some interesting use of lighting and framing.  Not to mention some terrific on location shooting especially the Niagara Falls finale.  The story is very fast paced with a new twist coming with literally every scene.  There is also a wide assortment of other gimmicks used that on a nonthink level can be fun especially during the first hour.  The haunting music score is good too although it gets played a bit too much.The problem really comes with the fact that all these twists and turns really add up to a lot of nothing.  Too much is left unexplained and the final revelation seems farfetched.  There is a wide segment of other loopholes and there is just the plain old fact that you have probably seen a lot of this before.  It also becomes very cliched and even kind of annoying at the end.  The film expects you to become close to characters that on the whole are very poorly fleshed out.The movie does offer a great opportunity to see Janet Margolin who is a very uniquely and naturally beautiful woman.  Even when she is made to look frumpy she is beautiful.  She has a face that looks like it never got past 21.  She closely resembles 80's porn stars Kelly Nichols or Jennifer Noxt.Scheider does not fare as well.  He looks alright but his presence is very transparent.  He just doesn't seem to have a strong enough personality or acting ability to really create a memorable or forceful impression. Also that white suit he wears all the time has really got to go.Overall despite it's best efforts it is still just a poor man's Hitchcock.  The real thing is still better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many directors have tried their hand at a Hitchcock  that unique blend of romance glamour and suspense combined with great stars and shaped by a distinctive directorial style. Of all the efforts I have always liked Jonathan Demme's Last Embrace best. Did he get the mix right? Well not exactly and critics at the time were quick to point out where he had missed the mark. However instead of just being a flawed Hitchcock homage I think Last Embrace stands up well as an enjoyable movie in its own right.Harry Hannan a secret service agent has fallen foul of both the government agency he works for and a mysterious killer who leaves notes for intended victims written in ancient Aramaic. He receives help from a woman Ellie Fabian who he initially finds annoying and intrusive but later his feelings for her change. The plot is complex and contains many layers. It features an ending at Niagara Falls that has strong echoes of Hitchcock's classic North By Northwest.It seems Demme had doubts about the finished film. He felt he had tried so hard to get the Hitchcock style that he had neglected content. But surely he is too hard on himself as he made up for any shortcomings by delivering a film of considerable style and mood. Based on a novel The 13th Man by Murray Teigh Bloom Demme and his team created a new story around the basic plot with the result that the film in my opinion emerged as the superior work.Demme called on the services of Miklos Rozsa for the music. Rozsa scored only one movie for Hitchcock  Spellbound  but his style was distinctive and the score for Last Embrace brings to mind that famous romantic thriller. Where Last Embrace lost out in comparison to the great Hitchcock films such as Spellbound Notorious North by Northwest and Vertigo was not only in the absence of a little more humour but also in the weight of its stars. Hitchcock's best films featured stars that were already Hollywood icons  James Stewart Cary Grant Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly. Although Roy Scheider was a fine actor he was never an icon. On the other hand Janet Margolin is so little known that comparisons with Bergman Kelly or even Kim Novak are superfluous she also projected a more neurotic edge than Hitchcock's cool blondes. But she was beautiful and talented. I still remember in 1993 being shocked to see her name on Premiere's list of actors who had died that year  she was only 50. I think she brought a lot to this movie especially when it is seen simply as an intriguing and wellmade thriller.Demme has not repeated the Hitchcock homage but has gone on to hone his own distinctive directorial style  Silence of the Lambs gained him an Academy Award  one prize Hitchcock never received. Last Embrace is not easy to find these days but let's hope that right now somewhere in a studio warehouse the masters are being dusted off ready for a belated but welldeserved DVD release.".

Gripping from start to finish Last Embrace is one of those forgotten films by the moviegoing public that over the years since it's release back in 1979 that when rediscovered it has the Hitchcock thrillers compared to it instead of the other way around. Surviving an assassination attempt that took his wife's Dorothy Sandy McLoad life government agent Harry Hannan Roy Scheider suffered a nervous breakdown from holding himself responsible for his wife's death by taking her to the restaurant where she was killed. Harry ends up being hospitalized for over three months in a Connecticut sanitarium. Harry needs to get back to work to get his life together again and be normal but the head of the agency that Harry works for Mr. Eckert Christopher Walken has doubts about Harry's ability to do his job. Later Mr.Eckart comes to the conclusion to terminate Harrys services as well as Harry himself. The movie Last Embrace is much deeper and more interesting then you at first would have thought. Harry is being shadowed by an unseen killer who already murdered five people a sixth person is later murdered in a Niagara Falls hotel. The only connection that the victims have with each other is a chilling note that they including Harry received written in ancient Hebrew and Aramaic. With a quote from the book of Deuteronomy stating Avenger of the Blood. Based on the Murrary Teigh Bloom novel thriller The 13th Man the film Last Embrace is a well thought out story that keeps you guessing to just where it's taking you until the very end. It's then where all at once you begin to realize all the clues that you and Harry missed that were right in front of you. But are so well hidden it would have taken a Det.Columbo or Sherlock Holmes to spot them. Roy Scheider gives one of his best performances as the troubled and guiltridden Harry Hannan. The beautiful Janet Margolin was never better as Ellie Fabian the young women with a past and secret that was the key to what was the real reason behind all those shocking and ritualisticlike murders in the movie. The late Sam Levene in what I think was his last film was very effective as the private detective Sam Urdell working for a Jewish group who were concerned about the murders and the connection that they had to a deadly and mysterious Hebrew death threat. As well as all of the murder victims being Jewish.The ending of the movie is a real shocker even though by that time you have an idea of just what it's going to be. Last Embrace is easily one of the best thrillers of the 1970's 80's 90's or of any other decade of great movie thrillers that you can think of and undoubtedly one of the ten best of all times. The film has so many memorable scenes in it that it's hard to pick which one was the best. The two that I especially liked are first the one where Harry has a shootout with Dave QuittleCharles Napler his wife Dorothy's brother who was sent by Eckert to kill Harry at a Princeton NJ bell tower Where Dave ends up not only dead but stone deaf as well. And of course the final scene between Harry and Ellie at Niagara Falls that even the great Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of making.".

The Miklos Rozsa score does sometimes intrude even though he often wrote film noir scores and a famous score for Mr. Hitchcock that the director did not like. Sometimes the score works extraordinarily well. Well this is not a Hitchcock film but still I like this movie. It imitates but also foreshadows director Demme's later great terror oriented mysteries.Mr. Demme is not mechanical or rigid in his use of Hitchcock devices and themes. This film narrative engages one on its own terms.The casting is particularly effective. The late Janet Margolin enriches the film and counts in part for my high score.Roy Scheider as always has immense presence Locations in New York encase a time when the city looked particularly rundown and that somehow defines an effective iconography though I have no idea why. This movie deserves closer analysis than this but others probably could do that more effectively than I can at the moment. I very much appreciate the review here by Dorian TenoreBartilucci.".

Having seen this particular child  I mean... thriller  I understand why reviewers refer to it as a hitchcockian thriller they might as well have called it idiotic for that's what hitchcockian means in the movie dictionary look it up if you don't believe me. Even the soundtrack is oldschool Hollywood which is a mistake it doesn't fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony. Besides how dare they steal De Palma's idea of stealing from Hitchcock?! The story is absurd. Scheider's wife is killed and her killers are never an issue. Instead first his former employers follow him around and later decide to kill him. Why do they decide to kill him? No explanation. Perhaps because the FBI is a dark dark organization XFiles which is very triggerhappy about knocking off its former employees for pensionfunds reasons. Or perhaps because it's fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie everyone seems to be after him. And while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major conspiracy in reality the killer is... Janet Margolin! Yes the woman occupying Scheider's living quarters the one that briefly hinted she was depraved. Why does she go after Scheider at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid  and followed by his own exemployers  and not a few years earlier or few years after the wife's murder? A pure hitchcockian look it up again in the dictionary in case you forgot what it means coincidence. And how about that brilliant motive of hers...! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a freshofftheboat 15 yearold virgin in NY and then syphilisized by a bunch of horny Jewish men one of whom  tahdah!  is Scheider's grandfather. As a result Margolin has been playing a hooker in her spare time among other things in order to kill off all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilisized her oncevirginal grandmother. How hitchcockian look it up is that? The finale then shamelessly rips off the Mount Rushmore scene from North By Northwest except that the loveinterest is a killer and she doesn't get saved.The movie also offers some dubiousoffkilter dialog and some notso great acting. Check out the silly and obvious way in which Napier follows Scheider at the cemetery. Let's also not forget the moronic plotdevice of Napier reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very suspiciously  but it wasn't a gun! How brilliant! Napier in the tower now there's another string of illogical behavioural patterns. J. Demme was is and always will be a director without style without flair and the man who directed Philadelphia. Let's give him another Oscar!".

Well for those who just long to see a more modern movie Last Embrace might be a good compromis. Some folks just cant stand to watch the old movies anymore because they look old and dont connect to the modern world anymore. The story and the acting in itself is rather good and full of great suspense. The movie is about a man who fears for his life. Somebody is out trying to kill him but he doesnt know wny. He tries to decipher a mysterious letter that is sent to him written in an unknown language in the hope to find out who is trying to kill him.Sometimes the acting by the supporting actors is somewhat overdramatic deliberatedly done to again copy the original Hitchcock style in which characters often performed with large gestures. Nowadays that is unheard of and it would look a bit silly but it was one of those Hitchcock characteristics that was badly copied into Last Embrace as well.As a soundtrack fan I must admit that I disliked the use of a fake old soundtrack score in MONO. The score in itself was beautiful but it didnt blend well with this modern version of a hitchcock story. I dont mind remakes of good movies but at least make them in a modern way. Now the deliberatedly old sounding music score constantly clashes with the modern settings. But most people probably wont mind this at all this is just a personal irritant of mine because I like music so much in movies... To conclude if you never have seen a Hitchcock movie and even if you dont know Roy Scheider either Last Embrace is still a good suspense thriller. It has stood the test of time nicely. It could have been better but I have watched it several times over the years and I still get thrilled by it.".

It's well directed by Demme especially a great tracking shot at a train station has an overstated if good music score has an innocent man involved in murder and has direct references to other Hitchcock thrillers especially Vertigo and Psycho.It has an excellent performance by Scheider and early small role for Christopher Walken!But it doesn't entirely succeed. The plot gets too convoluted for it's own good the Hitchcock references get tiresome and Margolin is pretty bad in a key role though she improves towards the end.

Even the plot outline suggests a Hitchcock film with someone like James Stewart carrying the lead.But here it's ROY SCHEIDER a very intense Scheider even more so than in JAWS because he never recovered from a nervous breakdown after his wife's sudden demise. And little does he know that he's a part of a plan of vengeance when he starts receiving threatening notesnor does he know who to trust and when. Naturally in a story of this sort we have to have a femme fatale and in this case it's JANET MARGOLIN as someone who tells him she wants to help solve his dilemma.There are some tricky camera shots odd angled and always interesting and Scheider really does carry the film with an extra intense portrayal of a hunted man who doesn't know who his enemies are.Add to this the somber score fashioned by none other than Miklos Rozsa who did that wonderful SPELLBOUND score for Hitch and you have all the elements of a firstrate crime story.Unfortunately there are a couple of drawbacks. The tale is a bit too leisurely in building up to the suspenseful momentsand only Scheider and Margolin are seen to advantage. CHRISTOPHER WALKEN has what amounts to a cameo role and most of the other members of the cast are unfamiliar faces.But it is suspenseful in a calculated contrived sort of way and does build to a terrific climax at Niagara Falls.".

The ensemble cast has wonderful chemistry including great performances by Alan Cumming Nick Nolte Tuesday Weld Robin Tunney and Neve Campbell. Though the film might seem farfetched it is actually based on real events and I especially enjoyed Robin Tunney's performance as a woman with a refreshingly healthy attitude towards sex. Neither a virgin nor whore she has slept with a few men knows what she wants and how to get it and rather than begging the man she goes to bed with to love her and marry her she simply asks him not to analyze it to anyone whether it lasts or not.  Another special treat is a series of filmswithinthefilm shot in black and white and made apparently through a very complicated process to look as they would have looked in the 1920's. A lovely characterdriven film that is quite different from most things you will see these days. Go see this if you get the chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "My usually reliable TV guide gave this only one and a half out of five stars and judging from the lurid title I expected either 1 a dated rehash of The Vagina Monologues or 2 the sort of trashy and episodic softcore porn that is commonly seen under titles like Sex Games in Cancun and Women Who Love Horses. Actually it was better than that  funnier nicely acted and directed and edited and thoughtfully written.Its chief disadvantage is that it's going to come across as a stage play which I was amazed to find is not how it started out. That it began as a French novel was a lot less surprising. It's stagy. And as in most plays there's not a heck of a lot of action and little change of location. It mostly depends on talk and teamwork for its success and thus it's likely to seem boring to anyone with barbedwire tattoos anticipating a series of violent rapes.Basically it's a story of a research group of half a dozen or so university students in the 1920s who have been funded by Nick Nolte to have serious frank discussions of human sexual behavior with an eye on psychoanalytic interpretations. The original participants include a superpolite black kid in evening dress a Brit with squinty eyes and a monumental jaw a nerd who finger paints and whose hair reaches straight towards heaven from his scalp a young stern German and Dermot Mulroney never a fave of mine as the deadly intense leader. They agree that only sex will be discussed  no love or philosophy or joking around  and they hire two stenographers blond Zoe who later reveals animal impulses and dark Alice who wears wirerimmed glasses and begins and ends as innocent as her namesake.The first one or two discussions are about what you'd expect from a class of intent young students. All the words are as Latin as Havelock Ellis's except I suppose the little man in the boat is mostly Germanic. At first the two stenographers are ignored. They're initially flustered and embarrassed. Zoe occasionally throws a smutty glance or smirk in Alice's general direction.Then I'm forced to admit the play or the movie or whatever it is begins to lose its focus its organization. Nolte shows up a huffing growling ancient wreck with wild straw hair dragging along his wife Tuesday Weld whose accent touches bases with both Omsk and Canarsie. Other characters show up halfway through. We watch an avant guard film by one of them  Sentenced to Life with blurry images of jail cells shackles and a winged seraph doing a fan dance before absorbing a man the way an amoeba engulfs a food particle. Nolte gets drunk and begins crawling all over the chuckling body of Weld like a giant hairy tarantula. One couple don pigeon masks and bill and coo behind the drapes. Things fall apart. The center does not hold. The dramatic climax comes when Mulroney and Neve Campbell who is Alice feel a glandular attraction to each other but he sends her on her way preferring the ideal figure of his masturbatory fantasies.Alan Rudolph has done a good job of directing this jumble of incidents. There may not be much action in the plot though there is some  a copulation and a fist fight  but there's plenty of liveliness in the cutting and reaction shots enough to maintain our interest. There are some very interesting lines in the screenplay too. Weld carelessly throws out Sex is always the same. Love is my delusion that one man is different from another. And there is a reference to Billy the Kid gloves which someone must have had fun writing.The production designer and set dresser must have had a jolly time too. You have never seen such surrealism. The decor is a radical collection of mutually repulsive junk more radical than that of Dicken's The Old Curiosity Shop. The plastic elephant trunk rising chinhigh in desolation out of the floor kind of leaps out at you in phallic fashion. An ordinary arm chair is wrapped and tied with stuffed burlap so that it resembles a human figure with a head. Well I'm not sure that's surrealism. Maybe it's dadaism. I don't know the difference. I think Man Ray was a leader of one movement while Ray Man led the other.Sometimes the film prances along and sometimes it mopes. And it's mostly those with a taste for the slightly bizarre that will get the most out of it. But it's worth more than one and a half stars.".

And it's mostly those with a taste for the slightly bizarre that will get the most out of it. But it's worth more than one and a half stars.";

Him. That's right. His character professes to be an equalopportunity bestiality master who is married to Tuesday Weld who talks with a ridiculous sort of German accent part of the time and sounds like she's from the Bronx for the rest.Alan Cumming who is always fun to watch is fun here as well relieving himself of his shirt every chance he gets and posing like a Greek god around the room these clowns are supposedly 'investigating' sex in.By the end it means absolutely nothing of course except that you wasted a little time hoping for some clever titillation at the very least and some possible insight on the subject.

	schema:reviewBody "If a pretentious softcore pornographer took a single college class in human sexuality and got a D in it that sort of person might enjoy Intimate Affairs.Set in 1929 this movie purports to tell the story of a group of friends and acquaintances who set out to explore human sexuality by talking about it until they're blue in the face. And while it's made to a standard of professional competence this is a very silly and poorly written film. It's filled with twodimensional characters engaging in some of the least provocative and least erotic sex talk you've ever heard. It's visually pedestrian and there's little plot or real character development even attempted let alone achieved.For all that though there's some fairly good acting here. Nick Nolte plays Faldo the rich man funding the sex research of disgraced college professor Edgar Dermot Mulroney and whatever you though of Nolte before you'll admire his ability to take this film's ridiculous dialog and overwrought direction and create a believable human being out of it. Tuesday Weld manages to take the onenote character of Faldo's wife and turn her mixed up Russian and Brooklyn accents into the mark of a woman who's being trying to make herself into something else so long she no longer remembers what she started out as. Alan Cumming as a frustrated artist whose sexuality is far more deviant than the rest of the conventionally minded group is also having a blast in every scene. Robin Tunney is also appealing in her simple but nuanced performance as a woman who thinks she's more sexually liberated than she really is.But there's also some really bad acting as well. Mulroney appears genuinely flustered at his inability to do anything with the poorly conceived character of Edgar. He's more like a man tied up in a straitjacket than an actor playing a role just trying to find some way to connect all the things about Edgar that don't fit together. Neve Campbell gives perhaps her worst performance as the shy virgin hired to be a stenographer to the story's flat and disconnected sexual discussions. If you didn't know any better you'd think she'd never really acted before and got the job because she was banging a producer. And even though the other actors do adequate work their characters are either so slight or so amateurishly calculated for affect that it's impossible to take them seriously.I really can't imagine what most of the fine actors in this cast were thinking when they took this job. They can't have been paid very much and they can't have actually thought these roles would do anything for their craft or their careers. Maybe they owed writerdirector Alan Rudolph money or maybe he has a ping pong table in his basement they all wanted to use.You do get to see Julie Delpy and Robin Tunney topless in this film as well as viewing Dermot Mulroney's behind and getting a furtive glance at his exposed package. But if none of that trips your trigger I'm not sure there's any reason to watch Intimate Affairs. You can certainly find these actors doing good work in much better films.".

	schema:headline " The cast had a lot more fun than you will";
	schema:reviewBody "Alan Rudolph is a poor man's Robert Altman with a Henry Jaglom production valueand yet he manages to entice excellent talent to his projects. His films have never fared well at the box office and only two Mrs. Parker and the followup Afterglow received much critical acclaim. So how he managed to spend eight million dollars on this mess is anyone's guess. It was obviously shot predominantly in a single location and the wardrobe and set decoration is hardly extravagant to have merited high budgeting. While likely scripted it has all the discipline of a free community improv class. It's perhaps apt that a movie about masturbation should prove so masturbatory in its inception the cast are allowed free reign to overreach in almost every scene. There is no sense that the characters are true to the time frame portrayed on screen and yet it is not completely pointless. Some of the improvisations work and most don't but there is some comedy to be had in the less overwrought interactions. When it tries it fails but when it fails it sometimes triumphs. I only wish there had been more happy accidentslike the camera being in the right place to capitalize on the focus of the scene. It is sadly rarely so.For a much better take on a similar subject see Joaquin Oristrell's Unconscious instead. For a better use of an ensemble cast in a barely scripted acting exercise see Nicholas Roeg's Insignificance. The only honest performance is Neve Campbell's and the only subtlety is that of Terrence Howard. Nick Nolte seems like he's acting in two different movies Alan Cumming deserves more camera time and Jeremy Davies is completely against type.Rudolph's greatest success is that this film released in 2002 looks like a 1970s European skin flic. I am probably overcrediting him here. But the film has its moments. It's probably best to run in the background while you do something else and cross it off your list.".

	onyx:emotionText "Alan Rudolph is a poor man's Robert Altman with a Henry Jaglom production valueand yet he manages to entice excellent talent to his projects. His films have never fared well at the box office and only two Mrs. Parker and the followup Afterglow received much critical acclaim. So how he managed to spend eight million dollars on this mess is anyone's guess. It was obviously shot predominantly in a single location and the wardrobe and set decoration is hardly extravagant to have merited high budgeting. While likely scripted it has all the discipline of a free community improv class. It's perhaps apt that a movie about masturbation should prove so masturbatory in its inception the cast are allowed free reign to overreach in almost every scene. There is no sense that the characters are true to the time frame portrayed on screen and yet it is not completely pointless. Some of the improvisations work and most don't but there is some comedy to be had in the less overwrought interactions. When it tries it fails but when it fails it sometimes triumphs. I only wish there had been more happy accidentslike the camera being in the right place to capitalize on the focus of the scene. It is sadly rarely so.For a much better take on a similar subject see Joaquin Oristrell's Unconscious instead. For a better use of an ensemble cast in a barely scripted acting exercise see Nicholas Roeg's Insignificance. The only honest performance is Neve Campbell's and the only subtlety is that of Terrence Howard. Nick Nolte seems like he's acting in two different movies Alan Cumming deserves more camera time and Jeremy Davies is completely against type.Rudolph's greatest success is that this film released in 2002 looks like a 1970s European skin flic.

	schema:reviewBody "Why does this film get's so much hate? Why do I keep hearing that Robocop 3 is better than this that Robocop 2014 remake is better than this. I don't understand that and I never will. I mean is this good as the first film? no of course not is it worthy sequel? yes it is! This is an entertaining action film yes. It R rated blast it is yes. I do wish that this movie would come out over the summer I do really miss this kind of action films. Robocop 3 and Robocop remake are not and will never be better than this sequel. I grew up watching this movie it defines my childhood. This was really my first film of the trilogy before I even watched the original. I was entertained in here we have RoboCop VS RoboCain monstrous robot who is addicted to drugs has mass a machine guns annihilation people blowing up cop cars killing cops van's ambulances. Killing news people this big battle between Robocop and RoboCain fantastic.RoboCop 2 1990 is rated R! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR not PG13 It Is violent action gore adrenaline scifi flick not for kids. I am defending my favorite sequel that has Peter Weller and Nancy Allen in it! I don't wan't to see Robert John Burke or even Joel Kinnaman who suck dicks in the whole movies! I love this movie to death the end is the best at all. In this movie RoboCop jumps on a back of a monsters addicted robot rips his brain out smashes in to the ground to the pulp. Plot RoboCop 2 is the 1990 sequel to RoboCop. Peter Weller returns as the cybernetic law enforcement officer who now battles an even more sadistic gang led by a deranged killer known as Cain Tom Noonan while megacorporation Omni Consumer Products prepares to take private ownership of Detroit and unveil a new more powerful law enforcement unit. This is a prototypical good action movie  intense perfectly executed original action shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.I am giving an 810  an outstanding score. And the gunplay is delivered in perfect Miller style as opposed to the slomo John Woostyle  you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons and you'll see them used well. The film is bloody you can see how the gang cut's Robocop to pieces and it is bloody. There was a kid Hob in the film and no he wasn't annoying he did a good job playing the bad guy. Not annoying kid and I think he did a good job. Robocop shot a guy in the eye. Nancy Allen as Lewis has much to do like she drives an armored SWAT van the one they used in Die Hard and smashes in to RoboCain she shots three bad guys she kicks ass. RoboCop saves a baby.I don't mind the music score everyone complains about Leonard Rosenman and his music score. I know they should use Basil Poledouris music score but they used different music score and I never mind it I thought it was an okay song. The film was directed by Irvin Kershner The Empire Strikes Back and Never Say Never Again from a story written by noted graphic novelist Frank Miller. Irvin Kershner did an excellent job directing this sequel I know that Paul Verhoeven suppose to direct this movie but he never direct sequels before and he wasn't sure if he should do it Hollywood needed a sequel so Irvin Kershner went to directing it. This is his last movie and it is really a shame he is no longer with us anymore R.I.P. Irvin Kershner.They don't make movies like this one today! I wish I would had scifi action movies like are this one today!! I really wish! This is a solid damn sequel that has an action scenes while RoboCock 2014 has no action scenes they can't effort it it is a PG13 rated family film. I have this movie on Bluray screw Robocop 3 and the remake I will watch this movie. I love action movies this is an action movie that's how they do it right! Is Tom Noonan better bad guy than Kurtwood Smith no. But he does an excellent job as the evil bad guy and he is a cult leader.I know Peter Weller and Nancy Allen were disappointed with how the movie come out and they don't care for this movie. But honestly it was a pretty damn good entertainment I wasn't bored with it. I would be proud on this movie. Rambo III 1988 Missing in Action 1984 Cobra 1986 Predator 2 1990 Blade Trinity 2004 The Matrix Revolutions 2003 are so fun underrated action films that are getting so much hate and bashed this days for it that is horrible. I still love them all. RoboCop 2 is a 1990 American cyberpunk action film directed by Irvin Kershner. Set in the near future in a dystopian metropolitan Detroit Michigan it is the sequel to the 1987 film RoboCop.It's a good continuation of RoboCop story. There is nothing new here  but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. They do there own stuff they don't copy the original film just like Predator 2 they do their own stuff and i love that. Sue me I love RoboCop 2! I give it 810 it doesn't deserve the hate!".

	schema:reviewBody "RoboCop 2 is probably the most underrated and most harshly criticized sequel in history tying with Predator 2 which came out the same year. Because of a few missing elements from the first and a slightly more cartoonish approach to the violence the critics and public alike were not pleased and opinions and feelings toward the franchise nosedived with the just plain awful RoboCop 3.Don't con yourself out of a good movie though. RoboCop 2 still has the same savage sense of humor cynical social commentary and character pathos of the first film. It's a hyperrealistic vision of an America populated by gunloving psychos a democracy owned by big business and the povertystricken addicted to drugs dealt to them by peddlers believing themselves to be the second coming of Christ.Farfetched could be the typical way of describing it. Completelyoverthetop would be more appropriate. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kershner chucks in as much sadistic violence deafening gunfire endless destruction and loss of human life that the film just begs you not to take it so seriously.Some of the blame was placed on writer Frank Miller for the film being more cartoonish than the original. I don't think this is very fair. I read Miller's original script when I was in high school and it is rather different and dare I say unfilmable. RoboCop 2 himself was not Nuke Lord Caine the psychotic hippie with delusions of Godhood. He was called Kong a psychotic cop who pretty much killed everybody he came across. Sgt. Reed and the Old Man died too and there wasn't much humor. Screenwriter Walon Green was hired to doctor the script and much of what appears on screen is actually his work. Frank Miller's original ideas are pretty much just left as the framework for the whole movie and some of his story was recycled into RoboCop 3 don't blame him for that one either. Miller was obviously upset with this but was still a good enough sport to appear in the film keep a lookout for him playing Doctor Frank though he vowed not to work in Hollywood again for fear of being taken advantage of. Until Robert Rodriguez promised to make good on his Sin City graphic novels.Verhoven may be gone but Irvin Kershner tries hard to deliver the same mix of mirth and magic and actually does get it right. Basil Poledouris' brooding score is also gone it returns in RoboCop 3 but new composer Leonard Rosenman creates a wonderfully heroic and upbeat theme that suits the film more than Poledouris' moody tormented score to the first.There have also been many complaints that the humanity of RoboCop and his relationship with Lewis was neutered along with too many other ideas fighting for screen time. I get why most would be annoyed by this but you have to remember that films need to be economic when it comes to length. If every single idea was fully explored and fleshedout RoboCop 2 would have been 4 hours long. In my opinion each thread has just enough for keen viewers and fans to appreciate. Lazy viewers only see what they want to see and I feel that this has led to many of the negative reviews the film has been met with which usually comment on how offensive the character of Hob issheesh gimme a break. And don't give me that the humanity of the first film is gone. Murphy has not resigned to being a machine. He lies to pacify OCP. Pay attention to the very last line of dialogue in the film if you want proof.Filmed once again in Texas Houston this time you really have to feel for Peter Weller walking around in that Robosuit. It must have weighed a ton and he'd be sweating bucketloads inside. There is a particular scene in the film where Murphy is tortured into neardeathdestruction that is very hard to watch. But it does lead to him getting a brandnew makeover and those crazy new directives put into his head. The bit where he lectures the Little League kids and scolds the youngsters playing by the leaky fire hydrant after quoting some very suspicious philosophy is hilarious.RoboCop 2 is a great movie. Despite harsh critisisms of the script and story and some slightly dated stopmotion effects it's a brilliant sequel that lives up to expectations. Do listen to the naysayers. I don't know what kind of film they were expecting.And thank you for not smoking!".

Miller was obviously upset with this but was still a good enough sport to appear in the film keep a lookout for him playing Doctor Frank though he vowed not to work in Hollywood again for fear of being taken advantage of. Until Robert Rodriguez promised to make good on his Sin City graphic novels.Verhoven may be gone but Irvin Kershner tries hard to deliver the same mix of mirth and magic and actually does get it right. Basil Poledouris' brooding score is also gone it returns in RoboCop 3 but new composer Leonard Rosenman creates a wonderfully heroic and upbeat theme that suits the film more than Poledouris' moody tormented score to the first.There have also been many complaints that the humanity of RoboCop and his relationship with Lewis was neutered along with too many other ideas fighting for screen time. I get why most would be annoyed by this but you have to remember that films need to be economic when it comes to length. If every single idea was fully explored and fleshedout RoboCop 2 would have been 4 hours long. In my opinion each thread has just enough for keen viewers and fans to appreciate. Lazy viewers only see what they want to see and I feel that this has led to many of the negative reviews the film has been met with which usually comment on how offensive the character of Hob issheesh gimme a break. And don't give me that the humanity of the first film is gone. Murphy has not resigned to being a machine. He lies to pacify OCP. Pay attention to the very last line of dialogue in the film if you want proof.Filmed once again in Texas Houston this time you really have to feel for Peter Weller walking around in that Robosuit. It must have weighed a ton and he'd be sweating bucketloads inside. There is a particular scene in the film where Murphy is tortured into neardeathdestruction that is very hard to watch. But it does lead to him getting a brandnew makeover and those crazy new directives put into his head. The bit where he lectures the Little League kids and scolds the youngsters playing by the leaky fire hydrant after quoting some very suspicious philosophy is hilarious.RoboCop 2 is a great movie. Despite harsh critisisms of the script and story and some slightly dated stopmotion effects it's a brilliant sequel that lives up to expectations. Do listen to the naysayers. I don't know what kind of film they were expecting.And thank you for not smoking!";

I just don't understand why though.In many ways Robocop 2 is better than its predecessor. For instance the many subplots. We have the subplot involving Robocop getting put back together the subplot of Robocop 2 itself the subplot of whether or not Robocop is human or machine the subplot of nukeCain and his thugs and the subplot of overall power and corruption.The mix of dark satire and graphic violence are once again showcased in Robocop 2 and in grander fashion. We get lots of jokes and lots of gore mixed together flawlessly. All the performances are good. Peter Weller once again does a great job as Murphy and Tom Noonan makes his Cain character a threedimensional psychopath.The score is much different from the score of the original. Instead of the dramaticsad theme from Robocop we get a much more heroicdynamic theme from Robocop 2 and it works quite well with the movie.Another thing I have got to comment on is the usage of stop motion. Once Cain is transformed into the monstrous Robocop 2  the title character  we get an explosion of stop motion special effects that look fantastic! Stop motion doesn't get any better than this.All in all this is one of the best sequels of all time but got a bad reputation because it was 'too violent'. Don't listen to some of the naysayers. Robocop 2 is a masterfully done film from the director of Empire Strikes Back and shouldn't be missed by any scifi buff out there. Check it out now on Widescreen for the DVD.4 stars out of 4  reviewed by Scott Beams ".

RoboCop is simply one of the best films ever made and it brought me much relief from a very sorrowful childhood. Which brings me to the point I am trying to make here anything was going to be something of a letdown. Another rebuke I would like to make of other critics of this film lies with their complaint that the movie was too meanspirited and had too much violence. Let me quote Paul Verhoeven's commentary about the original the whole style of the movie is 'too much'.The real failing of this sequel lies in the story which is full of threads that are either resolved badly the attempt to reprogram RoboCop with new directives or not resolved at all RoboCop's memories of his wife. Considering that not a single second in the original was wasted when it came to drawing the viewer into the hero's mind or building some emotional connection the lack of sympathy one feels with even Lewis or the Sergeant is worrying. Then there's the villian. A film with a superhero like Robocop or the Bond series is only as effective as its main villian. Cain is not an effective villian and gets very little development in the bargain the exact opposite of the situation with Clarence Boddicker in the original.The mock commercials are something of a hit and miss affair. The OCP Communications commercial was hilarious but the Sunblock 5000 commercial was just plain tasteless. The use of children in RoboCop 2 also counts against it. There were no children in the original reflecting the fact that the film just wasn't made with children in mind. The use of children in RoboCop 2 smacks of a cheap attempt to appeal to the children who are allowed by their parents or whomever to see the film. It doesn't work because the writers are trying to transplant adult dialogue into a child's mouth. Similarly the attempt to transplant the manner in which the Christian Coalition think children talk into Robocop fails.All in all RoboCop 2 is a passable sequel but it pales in comparison to the harsh perfection that is the original. Give it a chance because it does have some entertainment value.".

	schema:reviewBody "RoboCop 2  the sequel to 1987's ultraviolent RoboCop is not quite up to par with its predecessor.  The film still manages to entertain on a large level.  I know that a lot of people do not like this movie but I personally think it is still pretty good.  I'm not writing a review of this movie I am just expressing my thoughts on it.First off this movie is a lot more violent than the first RoboCop.  You get scenes of bloody shootings grisly scenes of torture and a surgery which I'd rather let you see for yourself than describe here.  Paul Verhoeven does not return to shock his audience with graphic violence and ultra dark humor which has since become trademark in his films.  The director this time is Irvin Kershner who made The Empire Strikes Back nearly ten years before this movie.  Kershner seems to focus a lot more on action rather than story.   Second the movie's villain Cain Tom Noonan to me is a direct opposite of Clarence Boddicker the villain from the first film who was played by Kurtwood Smith.  Cain enjoys giving people pleasure through his highly addictive designer drug called Nuke while Boddicker was a sadist who took pleasure in the death and suffering of others.  Though after Cain's transformation none of this really matters. Lastly this movie does not exploit children.  The kid in this movie Hob played by Garbriel Damon is Cain's twelve yearold side kick.  He is a violent foulmouthed little child who runs errands for Cain.  The writers for this movie did this intentionally to show that crime holds no age barrier.  Regardless of age crime is crime. Like I said RoboCop 2 is not trying to be better than its predecessor it's just trying to be something different.810".

The characters are pretty much the same as the first film nothing terribly new there.  The special effects are absolutely superb and the action is done rather well throughout the film.Like any film this film has some flaws.  One thing that really bothered me is that they made Robocop more of a Blueish color instead of a silver or grey color it would looked better if they had stuck to the original color. Also there are a few scenes that are meant to be comedic but just didn't pull through.  Other than that I thought the film was rather good.The new cyborg in this film aptly named Robocop 2 is astonishing in every way.  I thought it was a phenomenal design and beautifully done!  The weaponry on this cyborg was quite impressive as well.The actors in this film did a fine job I can't think of any that I disliked and the direction of Irvin Kershner The Empire Strikes Back was quite good as well.Even though I liked this film a great deal I still wouldn't recommend it to everyone.  If you saw and liked the original RoboCop then I think you really ought to see this one I'm not saying you'll like it I would hope that you do but you still may not as many reviewers on this site have made clear.

There is no spark of humanity to be found in the character here. A true disappointment when one considers that his soul had returned by the end of the first movie. Here his attitude shows no human side and makes him hard to sympathise with.Caine is a poor villain. OK I know Boddiker from the first film was better than the average mainly thanks to Kurtwood Smith's performance but the usually solid Tom Noonan creates a character who you couldn't care less about one way or the other.What's happened to the Old Man????. I appreciate that he didn't get to where he is by being nice but the change in his character here is nothing short of dumbfounding. In the first movie it's made clear he despises Dick Jone's tactics and attitude and yet here he's no better than Jones. It makes no sense.Doctor Faxx is a poor replacement for Bob Morton's charismatic if unpleasant OCP resident genius.The action sequences save the sequence where Murphy is stuck to the side of Caine's truck are harsh and nasty and repel rather than entertain.And finally. What is with the musical score?. Don't tell me Poledouris couldn't have done it simply because he was working on Total Recall at the time. A series TV or Movie soundtrack is part of its personality. Part of its character. When you remove that it harms the familiarity of the characters we're watching. So it's bad enough but shame on Leonard Rosenman. His score here is lurid camp and downright cringe worthy.The story has its moments to be fair. There's a lot of originality in here. But it tries too many new things to take in with one film. Hob is a well realised villain and the only truly dis likable villian in the move Thumbs up to Gabriel Damon there.The final showdown between Robocop and Robocop 2 is fun as well.But for the vast majority of its overlong running time this is a serious disappointment.".

How awful. Possible Spoilers ahead  though anything that could spoil this is beyond me.Irvin Kershner is not the director for this type of film. He clearly did not understand the humor of the original and as a result the massive overthetop senseless violence looks really bad  and worse is very distasteful. Even worse is the musical score. Leonard Rosenman was an old man from another era and the heroic light music does not match the images on the screen at all! What was he scoring?! The Great American Hero?! Worst of all he completely eliminated Robocop's theme from the first film which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a Superman film without John Williams' fanfare or Indiana Jones etc.? How could he do that?!!The plot is just a collection of ideas that don't gel. In beginning we see Robo stalking his old wife. Fine good idea. But they completely drop it after that. Then there is this a stupid idea of the company reprogramming Robo to be nice. That's thrown in for 10 minutes and then is immediately dropped. Or the silly idea that the repulsive 10 yearold drug lord reminds Robo of his son  Once again a weak motif that is shown briefly twice and dropped. This may work in a comic book but not on film and Frank Miller was unfortunately too inexperienced at the time and threw every idea in along with the kitchen sink. It doesn't work as a whole.Some people here seem to be praising the corporate bashing in this film and the privatization of the police. That is the best part of the film that is consistent with the first. However in the original the old man was a tough business man out for a profit but ultimately fair in the end. In this film he is just pure evil in his lust for money and power. You can't just change characters like that for no reason. And Nancy Allen's character is useless in this film whereas in the first she was essential to Robo's search for himself. She is as gratuitous as the violence in this film.And the violence yes the violence. I enjoy many violent bloody films when they serve purposes and are meant to tell a story. Irvin Kershner seems to get off on human beings being blown to bits shot to pieces children lusting for death and torture and peoples' desire for drugs. He doesn't know when to stop. Do we really need to see every last innocent bystander even people trying to help others get shot up???? It is inferred when we see the bad Robocop shooting repeatedly! Instead Mr. Kershner proves he has very little taste for this type of work and creates an abominable mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and worse a disgusting message of violence for any young person watching this film.No this film isn't meant to be messagey and I certainly don't watch Robocop movies or Alien or Predator movies for that reason. However when you go too far and cross the line much of what you do must be put into question. And as for this film in the words of the evil kid drug dealer's last words as he lay dying It still sucks.".

And Nancy Allen's character is useless in this film whereas in the first she was essential to Robo's search for himself. She is as gratuitous as the violence in this film.And the violence yes the violence. I enjoy many violent bloody films when they serve purposes and are meant to tell a story. Irvin Kershner seems to get off on human beings being blown to bits shot to pieces children lusting for death and torture and peoples' desire for drugs. He doesn't know when to stop. Do we really need to see every last innocent bystander even people trying to help others get shot up???? It is inferred when we see the bad Robocop shooting repeatedly! Instead Mr. Kershner proves he has very little taste for this type of work and creates an abominable mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and worse a disgusting message of violence for any young person watching this film.No this film isn't meant to be messagey and I certainly don't watch Robocop movies or Alien or Predator movies for that reason. However when you go too far and cross the line much of what you do must be put into question. And as for this film in the words of the evil kid drug dealer's last words as he lay dying It still sucks.";

	schema:reviewBody "Robocop 2 is a very amusing movie that is often times unfairly criticized. It is obviously not as good as the first film but its still a darn good sequel. This movie just like the first always gets made fun of and I can't see why. I think these movies are just so entertaining. Here's my two cents.I am a huge fan of these SciFiAction movies and Robocop is definitely one of the coolest in the genre. The first film is a classic but most people don't seem too fond of it's sequel. Robocop 2 is dark cruel and gruesome but it never misses it's chance to fit in a joke. The humor in this movie is just as good as the first's if not better. The acting is a little poor at times but you can't expect too much out of a film like this. Robocop 2's story is less diverting but the special effects are superior to the first. This movie has a much better climax than the original and the final moments of violence at the ending have some of the best special effects I have ever seenwithout the use of cgiin a movie.My problem is that people always accuse films like this of not being realistic enough. What should you expect from a title like 'Robocop 2? People need to just sit back and suspend disbelief for a movie like this. The Robocop movies are pure bloody fun that's all. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes violent 'machine vs. machine' warfare and being a fan of the first movie couldn't hurt either.".

	schema:reviewBody "For most people RoboCop 3 is the film that really is the big disgrace for the Robo series. It has few fans and most people hate it for it's shameless commercial PG13 approach. Now I'm not going to say that RoboCop 3 is any good. Frankly it pretty much sucks. But as far as being a properly shot and executed film it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos. Yes the truth of the matter is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels to a nearmasterpiece. So what if RoboCop 3 turns Robo into a cartoonish super hero in a ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy  at least it's doing it openly. I don't know where RoboCop 2 begins and ends I don't know what or whom it's about I don't understand what's going on in it I don't understand which jokes are deliberate and which aren't I will go insane if I try to understand the characters I see nothing of any value in anything anybody is saying I can't believe anybody looked at the shooting script and figured it would work and I can't believe that Irvin Kirshner saw the finished result and figured that he liked what he see. He probably didn't by the way neither Miller nor Weller nor Allen did. It's not hard to see why.Now RoboCop 2 has it's fans I know this. Mostly they belong to this league of absolute antipretensions dismissing anybody who expected any depth or subject matter from the first film as academic Roger Ebert Sith apprentices. It's just a lot of fun a good piece of action and great entertainment the argument goes. Yeah well I guess if you just don't listen to what any of the characters are saying you could fool yourself that we might as well have Arnold in the suit instead of Weller. Don't get me wrong I like a good action film with pure entertainment value as it's only  most satisfying  virtue. But RoboCop 2 sir ain't no such thing.Look at the first couple of scenes. This horrible actor makes Robo repeat that he's just a machine and then goes into this operatic speech about how he could never be a man whereafter Murphy's wife who's suing OCP for robotstalkings walks in out of the blue and have this sad little moment with him and then is never heard of again! I surely would like to go in to this film scene by scene because every one has these kind of absurdities in them. It's like a twelve year old fan boy has done the screenplay the characters act totally random and first say this then say that. OCP wants to stop crime with a new Robo especially this drug called nuke but then it seems they really just want to become this big capitalist empire and control the entire city  politics are abandoned I guess understandable given the comic relief mayor The villain played by Tom Noonan who did a better version of this in Last Action Hero and that's saying a lot is an addict but is still used for this machine. The woman behind it all has an agenda which is impossible to understand.Speaking of twelve year olds this film has the infamous role of Hub this mad kid who swears and kills people played by a child actor. I'm not going to be all moral about it it's a free world and if you want a psycho kid in your action movie go for it. I don't know how much of Frank Miller's original vision was put into this but the credits at least acknowledge him as conceiver of the story. And if I zoom out I could see this as being quite a cool character. It's grim for sure to have a maniac killer kid but then again this is the world of RoboCop and who would be surprised? This whole business with the OCP trying to become this giant monopoly over everything is properly dystopian and good as well. Also the idea of RoboCop getting in touch with his wife and kid having them embedded into the story somehow  would also be great and as far as I can see a natural and logical step if they now had to make a RoboCop sequel.But of course these are just ideas. As many people have already said the screenplay is 100 mess. The kid has one scene the torture scene where it's hinted that he in fact is just a stereotype messed up kid and then we have this unimaginable scene where he is dying and gets all soft and friendly towards ol' tin head. Why doesn't he just take up his uzi and try to take him down with his last breath? Isn't that what his character would do? Does he give his life a little second thought there on his death bed? Not necessarily given that his last words are it sucks so why? It really makes no sense and this can be said about everybody no everything in this film. IS there a strike in the police force? IS RoboCop machine or man? What's the deal with turning Robo into this community service machine for 10 minutes? I mean sure it's pretty funny I wouldn't deny that. But why build it up and then discard it? And why the hell is Allen so criminally underused? and what is it Weller has an obvious urge to express with his character and yeah well the threads are many and the mess is enormous.This review is just as messed up as the film. The only reason I give an extra star up there is because of the actors from the first film I'm sure they had good intentions with it. I mean it's something somewhat stable some kind of anchor in this sea of bad movie making.".

Gone is Paul Verhoeven at the helm of the film and filling in for his absence is Irvin Kershner The Empire Strikes Back.

My suggestion is that in RoboCop 4 they should create a cyborg called RoboCop XP and he can have lightningfast reflexes and a builtin wireless broadband modem so he can check his emails and surf the 'Net while he's on the go.And putting a homicidal drug dealer's brain inside a giantsized robot law enforcer with machine gun capabilities and weapons of mass destruction probably isn't a very good idea but the thought never crosses the minds of Omni Corp. The chairman of Omni Corp Daniel O'Herlihy produces RoboCop 2 to the public but RoboCop already realizes RoboCop 2 is dangerous and so he appears at the unveiling armed with a huge gun.RoboCop 2 goes haywire and kills everyone. The entire sequence is done in cheesy Godzilla animation but to be quite honest it didn't look all that bad. He and RoboCop duke it out on top of buildings and in elevator shafts and on the ground outside Omni Corp where an uncountable number of police officers hey weren't they on strike? are left firing at this indestructibleand very bulletproofmachine that unfortunately does not have an OFF switch in sight. Turn it off! he says. I can't! she says. You idiots! I say.So many loose threads are left dangling in RoboCop 2 and so many subject matters that I wanted sorting out after seeing the first film. But there isn't any hope in sight. After a brief moment that hints towards the central idea that RoboCop may still be human after all wasn't that sorta established in the original? everything is dropped for the action set pieces to move in such as a car chase with RoboCop and Cain or the end finale that goes on too long. But RoboCop is seen spying on his wife in the beginning and we find out that she has gone through serious trauma over this whole thing. She confronts him at the police station and out of decency he insists her husband is dead. But we see the look of remembrance and remorse in his eyes.That's the storyline I would like to follow. I'd like to follow RoboCop's journey to find himself again to recover lost memories floating around in that big brain of his. To confront his wife and tell her that he remembers her to add a human element to the story that was so clearly demonstrated in the original but completely lost here. Kershner obviously wants to mimic Verhoeven. But Verhoeven knows how to equally balance action and excessive gore with social satire and the ongoing human battles relevant to the action battles. Remember in the first film when RoboCop went through his house and his eyes started to flood with past images and faded memories? Nothing like that is done here. We simply get some cheesy flashback in the beginning when Alex preRoboCop is laughing with his wife in a very noncandid and dubious sort of way. As I saw this sequence I just sat in my seat waiting for the word Hallmark to appear in gold font across the screen.As for all the loose threads left open in this film and supposedly not touched in the third movie...let's all hope that when Paul Verhoeven said he wishes to return to the series he wasn't lying. I'd love to see this franchise closed in a more honorable fashion. RoboCop 2 is an OK movie for a Friday night crowd but in comparison with the original it's about as cold as RoboCop's facial tissue and as cloudy as RoboCop's memory.2.55 stars.John Ulmer".

The film is full of violence but it's mainly of the longrange bulletshitbadguys type the only thing close to the original's overthetop nature was the brain removal and the stomachslicing.Phil Tippett is on hand luckily to deliver some entertaining stopmotion action scenes which really liven up the final scenes of carnage.Sadly the bad guys never come across as meanly as Clarence Boddicker did in the first OCP seem unnecessarily annoying and the little kid is just annoying.

Peter Weller comes back playing the title character yet again. And their is more body count. The look of it is very outstanding and and the story was very well done. This time around Robocopis trying to stop a drug lord and bring him to justice for the manufacture of a very addictive narcotic nuke. I thought the new cyborg in this film looked absolutely amazing. The best part of this movie is when Robocop and Caine as the cyborg are battling each other towards the end of the movie. I do not understand why this movie has the rating it has. One of the most underrated sequels of all time along with Predator 2 which I also enjoyed. Although I did not like this movie as much as the first movie I like it for what it is. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes action. Their is enough action to keep you excited from beginning to end. This movie is not to be missed.".

The production values are fairly slick the action scenes are shot with an enjoyable bloodthirstiness and there are some funny scenes early on including some malfunctioning 'Robocop 2' prototypes and a couple of satirical commercials. I also like the scenes in which Robocop becomes an eccentric pacifist. But as the film clunks into the main story it starts to come apart and fast.There is absolutely no heart and no energy and one dull scene bumbles into the next like a drunkard trying to string a sentence together. The violence which starts out cheerfully enough eventually becomes quite nasty and sadistic. The graphic violence of the original film was used to great satirical effect and was often sardonically humorous such as ED209 blowing a company exec to bits at a board meeting or it had a real point Clarence Boddicker's biblical execution of Murphy. Here though the violence is just gratuitous a bit weird and has absolutely nowhere to go  one particular scene comes to mind in which a child mobster is forced to watch the bodily dissection of a crooked cop. In fact the entire child villain thing was irritating and ludicrous from the jump concluding in a scene in which Robocop takes pity on the little stinker. Don't make me laugh.Weller does everything he can to breath some life into his character and bags most of the funniest or most memorable moments but like many things in this film I have no idea what Nancy Allen was doing the whole time what a waste. She does nothing but point guns at people and frown this only touches upon the many profound problems with the script and direction.In the end Robocop 2 doesn't just suffer from the absence of Verhoeven but also from an uneven script humming with unfinished ideas narrative deadends and a serious lack of humour doing nothing whatsoever to build upon its predecessor's greatness. I have to disagree with some of the more optimistic reviews here this film isn't trying to do something different it doesn't appear to know what it's trying to do at all.I will say this for it though the stop motion effects were great and it is at least a better film than Robocop 3.410".

This sequel beyond letting us know the people behind these movies are obviously trying to make a working franchise tells us how hard it is to duplicate success on those rare instances where a science fiction movie breaks the mold and follow it up with something just as good or better. It's a weird trait that many sequels to successful movies succumb to but then again when the original does so many things right some level of disappointment or failings seem almost guaranteed. Dreary atmosphere a workable story sprinkles of dark humor satisfying action pieces and some real emotion. The original had it all. It'd be a fantasy to think we were going to get this and more in a sequel.We don't. This outing finds less of the dark humor and less of Murphy's humanity as he's tasked with going up against a new underground drug taking over New Detroit. Of course things will come to a violent head and once again it will be Robocop's prime directive to make things right. Tom Noonan who starts as the main villain is perhaps the best and the worse. A good actor can take an underwritten part farther than it was supposed to go but only so far. Hence a key problem. Like most drug barons especially in movie land the one he plays is paranoid and prone to using violence. Which means the pursuit of clich set pieces and scenarios like an obvious showdown between him and Robocop before the end in some form. What maybe you don't expect is when halfway through the movie the main villainy force becomes a 14 year old successor to a drug empire.The premise is simple enough. Part man mostly machine. He's not prone to annoyances normal human beings have to deal with like being shot bleeding dying... that sort of thing. He can be as detached from the world as he wants to be because let's face it he is detached. Peter Weller reprises as Robocop. Nancy Allen is again along for the ride as his partner. OCP is still OCP. The headquarters for a faceless mega corporation built on greed. Those things haven't changed but other more intimate story and atmosphere elements have.Robocop 2 ends up not being a horrible outing. It is still very much entertaining and in due part to memories established by the original but give me back more of that dark trashy New Detroit atmosphere as seen in the original. Give me less throwaway action scenes 14year old boy villains and mediocre stop motion effects. Most of all give me back the feeling that Robocop was fresh.

It's in their interest to let the city go to pot whilst this happens so they can play white knight to the public when they privatise and so they withdraw their warranty on RoboCop and provoke the police to strike. RoboCop meanwhile is intent on dishing out justice to Cain the kingpin of an organisation which distributes new designer drug Nuke in handy plastic cassettes.Trauma and helplessness are big themes in this movie and there are two points in the movie where already physically traumatised individuals are systematically butchereddisassembledtortured in a helpless state. In terms of general suffering whilst helpless I think you could probably raise that to five incidents if you count three scenes when RoboCop is helpless aides memoire magnet microshocks and I type it you think it once with a store keeper plagued by kids and also Officer Duffy.The OCP shyster points out to RoboCop that he will never be able to go out dancing and fall in love again and I think that statement lays bare his traumatic situation which is a fundamentally hopeless one. The only solution he can find for his pain is to go out and murder criminals. This he manages to accomplish with lan and flourish. To show off at one point he steps into a shot whilst turning his head backwards kind of like a pool player using their other hand or closing their eyes just before they take a pot. Whereas in the first movie his flourish when holstering is something that keeps alive the memory of his son here his antics are genuinely psychotic.The movie is pitch black at times for example when the Old Man and corporate flunkeys watch film footage of various fatal failures in the RoboCop 2 program I was reminded of the hideous real life footage the Nazis took of their V2 rocket tests including one where various scientists and Reich underlings are wiped out by a boomeranging missile. Another particularly pernicious element is the corruption of childhood one of the main baddies is small boy.Dr. Juliette Faxx comes in as the main OCP baddie a powerdressing maneating sexual sadist. She is an alarming paranoid sexist nightmare that plays on anxieties of the era where men felt threatened by the first generation of emancipated and competitive women in the workplace. I think that the sexist nightmare of the 90s which perhaps is still around is of the aggressive and yet impeccable female colleague which actually is all about helplessness as well! As with the first movie there are newsclips hinting of the helplessness of the time where environmental catastrophes come one straight after another holes multiplying in the dam with not enough fingers and toes to stop up them all.This movie gets a bad rap maybe because it is not as flawless as the original RoboCop for example the baddie Cain Tom Noonan is pretty listless compared to Clarence Boddiker from the first movie and it's genuinely a nastier piece of work however it contains its fair share of iconic moments and ends up closer to being a horror movie than anything else just absolutely haunting.".

Robocop 2 takes place not to long after Robocop with most of the police on strike the city addicted a to new drug called nuke and OCP trying to buy out what's left of the police force and then city for there own corrupt corporate schemes. Robocop's main enemy in this one is a deranged hippie aren't they all Cain Tom Noonan who is the leader of a gang who uses a drug called nuke to make money and control the underworld of crime. Robocop in typical great violent fashion takes out most of the scum but ends up being dismembered by the gang. Robocop is repaired but the female corporate villain Dr. Faxx Bauer of course wants to hinder his ability while she works on her own project Robocop 2. In a great moment in the movie a bunch of men and soccer mom types give there opinions on how Robocop should be reprogramed to be a typical politically correct wimp think Al Gore and Tipper programing someone. Talk things out rather then waving that big gun of his. Hahahahha! This obviously fails Robocop fry's his circuits and goes back to nail Cain and the gang. Cain's brain is taken by Dr. Faxx for the new Robocop 2. Well eventually Robocop faces Cain now in a new body in a great climatic battle in Detroit that ends with his brain smashed all over the ground.Overall a great movie. The special effects I cant emphasize enough are incredible. How did we go from this to the CGI crap that is so popular now? The stop motion and models are amazing. Not flat as with most of even the most high tech CGI that's out there. To bad it so much money to do that now. The story is OK I don't think it was as good as part ones but the edition of the Robocop 2 is a great machine that is well worth the wait. Cain the villain I was not real impressed with. Clarence Boddicker from part one was much better. Look out for Ed Lauter with his stupid outfit always the man. The action keeps up and you are never board along with a fair amount of extreme violence although not as bad as I had thought when I saw it as a kid in the movie theaters. Maybe a bit tame by today. As with the first movie watch for all the great in jokes about corporate greed the future skin lotion commercial are all funny. Like OCP's Flag? Some familiar characters return including The Old Man and Nancy Allen returning as Anne Lewis as the strong female role that works. There not much to say about Peter Weller he walks around in his costume most of the time nuff said. One and 2 are great movies however skip the stupid part three that was obviously taken over by a bunch of soccer Mom losers who ruined it. Overall the story is a little weak but Robocop 2 gets a 10 out of 10 stars great sci fi action movie. See it just for the special effects if nothing else.".

Instead the film deals with the dehumanizing effects of living in a very violent dangerous place like urban South Africa. Even if you're not a victim you're still affected. Characters respond in very different ways some try to honor the victims of violent crime some try to grasp onto anything that will make them feel more valuable or important and some become criminals themselves. At one point a character wonders what it would be like to be proud of being from a certain area instead of ashamed of the problems associated with it.

BECKY SHARP was one of those poor orphaned films whose copyrights have expired and now live in the public domain. The quality of the video cassette and the color was astonishingly bad and gave no hint of the pleasures the original TECHNICOLOR photography must have contained.A sad story to be sure but fortunately UCLA performed a massive restoration effort on the film in the late 1980's literally scouring the world for available film elements. Unfortunately the restored BECKY SHARP has never been commercially released in any format. It was shown during AMC's first Film Preservation Festival back in 1993 however and luckily I recorded it to cherish for all time or at least until the tape wears out. It has never aired since.The restored BECKY SHARP is a revelation!! The film starts with barely any color at all then pleasant pastels are introduced followed eventually by the striking red coats of the British military. Full of color and deliciously overripe tints this was primarily an experiment to see how color plays out in a feature film. The cast and drama takes a backseat to the real star of the show glorious TECHNICOLOR. The film itself is somewhat plodding and overplayed but a lot of fun to be sure!!I'm not sure what legal red tape is responsible for there being no commercial release of this beautiful restoration but none has appeared and this is a shame.".

	schema:headline " Great Victorian Novel becomes Interesting Looking But Weak Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Because of the overwhelming success of his novels people still read Charles Dickens. If you poled people who like to read classic novels you would find most people read Dickens Emily and Charlotte Bronte and Anthony Trollope most among the high Victorian novelists those from 1830  1882. This cuts out a large number of fine novelists like George Eliot George Meredith Elizabeth Gaskell and Benjamin Disraeli yes the Prime Minister or even William Wilkie Collins the first great mysterydetective novelist. But the one that is particularly odd is William Makepeace Thackeray. In his day he was a prominent novelist from 1839 to 1863 when he died Thackeray was actually the leading rival of Dickens as the leading novelist. Dickens was capable of a wider variety of social class types in his fiction and could show wilder humor and greater tragedy in his novels. But Thackeray was more gifted at subtle characterization and clever social satire of the upper class. He was a member of that class and knew what he was talking about when he wrote about them. George Orwell noted that when Dickens did an aristocrat in like Sir Mulberry Hawk in Nicholas Nickleby the resulting character was a type from Victorian melodrama whereas Thackeray or Trollope made more realistic figures.He also was willing to experiment in odd ways. Occasionally Dickens did too  he did first person narrative novels like David Copperfield and once did one with a female narrator Bleak House. But in 1846 Thackeray wrote Vanity Fair A Novel Without A Hero. The title was a pun. The two leading characters Rebecca Becky Sharp and Amelia Sedley are women so it suggests the novel has a heroine. But both women are quite faulty. Becky is a fortune hunter who won't let anyone or anything keep her from becoming rich. Amelia is a nice person. In fact she is too nice. She has to go through an 800 page story before she stops being friendly to her school friend Becky and only after Becky reveals what a bad person she has been to Amelia. None of the characters in Vanity Fair is flawless. The closest to a hero in the story William Dobbin adores Amelia  but won't push himself as a suitor he wants her to notice his adoration by herself. Becky vamps members of the Crawley family where she is the family governess and marries the second son Rawdon in expectation of a generous aunt's largesse to support them. But that fails to work out. So she tags along with Rawdon accompanying him on the Waterloo campaign and makes a play for George Osbourne Amelia's selfish husband. Eventually she and Rawdon become social figures living well on nothing a year by cheating merchants of payments for their food clothes etc. She also becomes the mistress of the powerful Marquis of Steyne pronounced stain.How the events of this novel without a hero end I leave to the reader to read the novel the best way or to see either this version by Rouben Mamoulian the recent one with Reese Witherspoon or a modern dress version from 1932 with Myrna Loy as Becky. Mamoulian's version reduces the story to 90 minutes of film and so much is thrown out. In particular the antics of Amelia's cowardly pompous brother Joseph Sedley Nigel Bruce in Mamoulian's film. Hopkins does very well as Becky  garnering her best film performance. She is supported by Alan Mowbray as Rawdon who may be raffish in some ways but gains our respect as he sees the woman he loves for what she is. Francis Dee is adequate if not memorable as Amelia. Cedric Hardwicke is sinister and powerful as Steyne. Allison Skipworth gives one a taste of the selfcentered pampered aunt of Rawdon Miss Crawley.So what went right and wrong. It is a great novel my opinion but I admit this film leaves me cold. So much was cut out the film is just a synopsis of the main plot. But then Thackeray's greatest strength as a satirist was as a subtle writer. Somehow subtlety on his printed page is not well translated onto the silver screen. On the other hand Mamoulian did make great strides in terms of elegant cinematography with the then new three tone color film system. The best moment is at the scene of the great last ball given to Wellington's staff and men at Brussels in June 1815 which ends as a cannon blast in the distance is heard the opening shot of Waterloo. The moment that the blast is heard a blast of air causes a red curtain to blow looking like a wave of blood. Mamoulian was able to squeeze out of the process some idea of what to do with it. For that reason the film is worth seeing. But I urge the interested viewer to take the time to read Thackeray's novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "You see it's not so much the stories that count it's the way they're told. Becky Sharp the motion picture came to be by a convoluted route. William Makepeace Thackeray's mid19th century novel Vanity Fair was used as the basis for Langdon Mitchell's late 19th century stage play which was in turn adapted for this 1935 movie. What have we lost and what have we gained? Of course books plays and pictures are very different things and certain changes have had to be made so that each adaptation works for its particular medium. Becky Sharp bears all the hallmarks of a lengthy novel reworked for the stage. A play can't be over a certain length because it has to be seen in a whole evening and yet individual scenes tend to be fairly long because of the disruption of having to change sets. Becky Sharp perhaps surprisingly changes very little of the basic plot but it condenses the entire 900 page tome into a series of dramatic vignettes. Because the novel tends to tell of many important events in a bytheby fashion Mitchell was also forced to come up with a lot of his own dialogue. Finally the play differs from the novel in that every episode is told from Becky's pointofview whereas Thackeray's narrative travels with a range of characters.So far so disappointing perhaps. But what was most important here was not that the story survived intact but that the tone of Thackeray's masterpiece carried through. What is so special about Vanity Fair is the author's cynical sarcastic tone which makes a comedy out of these unpleasant goingson. This is not an easy task in a motion picture unless you were to resort to voiceover narration with passages from the novel not especially en vogue in the 30s. But as it happens this motion picture does not do a bad job.Firstly we have the right cast. Miriam Hopkins's Oscar nomination has raised a few eyebrows here and there and it's true her performance is hysterically hammy. But that is Becky Sharp a cheat and a liar whose entire life was an act. When she breaks down in false tears over her late mother's possessions the moment seems silly but it is supposed to be funny. The bulk of the cast are overblown caricatures but again this is faithful to the novel. Thackeray wasn't subtle. Look at those names  Pitt Crawley Lord Steyne even a minor character who didn't make it to this version called Sir HuddlestonFuddleston. And most of the players are spoton. Nigel Bruce simply is Jos Sedley and George Hassell is perfect in his unfortunately brief appearance as Sir Pitt.Then there is Rouben Mamoulian's direction. His flamboyant visual style could be disastrous in the wrong picture but here all his extroverted camera moves and trick shots pay off. With the condensed storyline the overt technique helps to keep the flow. We are brought closer to the spirit of the original text by the fact that we are constantly aware of the director's touch just as Thackeray constantly addresses his reader with a sly wink. This again highlights the fact that Becky Sharp is more enjoyable if it is taken as a comedy not as a drama. It's just as well  Mamoulian let loose on a pure drama could be awful.This was famously the first picture in threestrip Technicolor and as the use of colour here is especially good I'll devote a few lines to that too. Whereas some early colour pictures used blaring shades Becky Sharp is filled with subtler tones  for example those rusty browns and greyish blues in the opening scene much more effective than bold blue and red. And rather than simply colourcoding a character's costume or a set we here see the tones flowing on and off the screen. To again take that opening scene we begin with the warmer hues of Amelia and her friends and then slowly move via various different shades of dress and the growing amount of the stark wall that can be seen to the cold bluegrey of Becky. Later in the first scene at the Crawley residence all the colours are very plain which gives more impact when Rawdon walks in in his bright red uniform. It's hard to say who is responsible for this smart handling of colour. Production designer Robert Edmond Jones is the celebrated inventor of simplified realism whereby sets complement action but Mamoulian appears to have done a very similar job with the colour on the 1941's Blood and Sand. We'll assume it was a joint effort.Really the only major flaw in Becky Sharp and it is I'm sorry to say a very major one is that the paring down of the narrative to 84 minutes without actually cutting much of the plot makes for somewhat confusing viewing. It's difficult to keep up with time and place and the novel's legion of characters pop up then disappear before they have made an impression. Personally I found Becky Sharp fun to watch because I am familiar with the novel and it was nice to see these figures brought to life so accurately. However I first saw it before I read the book and recall finding it bizarre and boring as I suppose would the majority of viewers. For this reason it fails in itself as a motion picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Becky Sharp seems to have consistently attracted unfair comments. Whilst it may not be as subtle as many of its contemporary counterparts the story provides a fun basis for a glorious use of Technicolor.  As the first feature length movie to be shot in full colour the film is a wonderful example of cinema as spectacle.  Though admittedly at times the viewer may almost be sent crosseyed by the vibrancy of the colour its use is interesting in so far as one can see the attempts made at one level to exhibit the colour whilst also trying in vain not to distract from the narrative.  Also from the beginning of the opening sequence the status of the film as a stage adaptation is clear and in this way the idea of the now overlooked tradition of cinema as spectacle is further enhanced.The plot itself is slightly reminiscent of a Gainsborough melodrama although it precedes them and yet it is refreshing in many ways that Becky is not the subject of the traditional narrative retribution and resolution.  The overthetop nature of some of the narrative action does provide moments which may cause an audience member to cringe however if the film is not taken too seriously it remains enjoyable.Becky Sharp has too often been overlooked in the history of film.  It may not have been widely popular at the time of its release and it may not be seen within a high cinematic cannon but it is definitely worth viewing if only to appreciate the emergence of three colour film as the new advancement in film technology.".

She is playing a very unlikable character but she's so beautiful in some shots she takes your breath away and full of life that you can't help but root for her. The second thing is the groundbreaking use of color photography. I believe this is the first fulllength feature to be filmed entirely in color. Director Rouben Mamoulian uses color creatively to express mood or show what a person is feeling or doing. I saw the restored print which has rich beautiful colors. Even when the story was boring which is often with that lousy dialogue the colors and use of light and shadow kept me watching. With this film and the 1932 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Mamoulian created new rules in how to direct sequences and use settings light and shadow. Sadly he's forgotten today.So this is worth seeing only for Hopkins and the color. Don't watch it for the story or you'll be sadly disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Becky Sharp of historical interest for film buffs";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1935 film Becky Sharp remains important chiefly for being the first major movie shot in Technicolor. The story is an abridged version of William Makepeace Thackeray's 19th Century novel Vanity Fair. Becky Sharp is the main character of the book and is a socialclimbing hussy with few redeeming qualities except for her goodlooks. Thackeray didn't judge her too harshly however. He was more interested in satirizing British society in general. Vanity Fair was indeed his greatest work although he's also known for writing The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon which Stanley Kubrick brought to the screen in the mid1970's. Miriam Hopkins may have been a bit old to be playing the conniving Becky Sharp but she gives it her best shot. Unlike the novel Hopkins' character is at least somewhat justified in her decisionmaking process even while retaining the frivolous part of her personality. The key scene in the film is near the end when director Rouben Mamoulian reenacts the famous Duchess of Richmond's ball at her Brussels estate on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo. It's done with a definite flair for the dramatic along with some wellplaced historical references. The ominous sounds of war are heard in the distance as the great ball comes to a premature end its frightened participants running off into an uncertain future.The cast is filled with some familiar faces from the past. Beautiful Frances Dee livens up the screen as Becky's good pal Amelia. Nigel Bruce best remembered for playing Doctor Watson alongside Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes does some adequate work as one of Becky's admirers. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is also around as a British aristocrat with a roving eye for the ladies. Recently Reese Witherspoon tried her luck in the role of Becky Sharp in the 2004 film version of Vanity Fair with mixed results. At least she was young enough for the part.".

Mrs. Mary Madden Fiske was Becky Maurice Barrymore was her luckless gambling fool of a husband the part that Alan Mowbray has here and as the aristocratic rake that Hopkins is ready to give all to to square Mowbray's debts is played by Cedric Hardwicke in the film. On Broadway the role originated with Tyrone Power Sr.Thackerey's novel was a critique of the class system in Great Britain but really offers no solutions. It's also a story of how much more difficult it was to be a woman and poor with so many fewer options open to them.Becky Sharp is such a woman. She's been given a good education attending school with the rich aristocratic Frances Dee. By education I mean finishing school. How she got there we're not sure but having been exposed to how the other half lives she wants to be part of it.Her friend Frances Dee invites her to live with her family and Hopkins starts seizing her opportunities. The rest of the story is about what happens to her and the various schemes she concocts. She's not afraid to use sex to obtain what she wants riches and respectability.Besides those I've already mentioned there's a really nice performance by Nigel Bruce as Frances Dee's Colonel Blimp like brother. In the end he proves to be Hopkins's salvation.As a film Becky Sharp has come down in history to us as the first film using the modern technicolor process. It was a novelty but as a story it definitely has merit.And it is so much better than the version with Myrna Loy updated to the Roaring Twenties that came out under the original title of Vanity Fair a few years earlier.".

	schema:reviewBody "... Director Rouben Mamoulian did a remarkable job with color experimentation. He decided to use color thematically to express character mood and added more and more color as the film progresses and the plot thickens. Every shot looks colorcoordinated. The most famous sequence is the panicky exit of the quests at the Duchess of Richmond's gala in Belgium on the eve of the battle of Waterloo ... Mamoulian had quests leave according to their color group so only the one in red remained in the ballroom. Danny Peary in GUIDE FOR THE FILM FANATIC 1986.I have decided to entail this long quotation at the beginning of my review because I think that it best reflects the multiple significance of the feature film BECKY SHARP which won the color prize at the third Venice Film Festival. While discovering the uniqueness of Rouben Mamoulian a pure follower of Moscow Art Theatre a great admirer of Konstantin Stanislavsky 18631938 and a follower of the famous Stanislavski's system I have found out how truthful he was to the emotions in cinema and how much focused on every single detail of images and acting techniques. Who could better introduce cinema to the three strip Technicolor in the 1930s than him? Mamoulian with his unbelievable flair for artistry on screen and sophisticated experimentation with the camera could effectively capture the essence of color.Here it is necessary to mention some unforgettable scenes from this movie that for long remain in one's memory. Except for the aforementioned ball scene that constitutes a sort of 'special pearl' on its own the film entails a striking image of Napoleon's shadow over the map of Europe. What impact it has on the vision in a color feature film! What impact it must have had those days! The costumes with a special emphasis on red which Mamoulian considered the most exciting color a sort of climax constitute another merit of the film's visual significance. The interiors appear to be lavish as well.Yet BECKY SHARP was quite neglected for years and available on weak copies. Although it was considered an important movie in the history of cinema being the first feature in threecolor Technicolor process  the period which lasted till 1953 it was forgotten for years and in no way considered a mustsee. Fortunately the film has been recently restored and is growing in popularity among classic buffs. Strange phenomenon...yet it is not the color experimentation that makes it exciting nowadays it is neither the source novel VANITY FAIR by one of the most respected British novelists William Makepeace Thackeray. It is unfortunately not Mamoulian whose name is today associated with totally different titles. I think it is Miriam Hopkins in the lead who still amuses our imagination rouses our senses and has the power to make the film enjoyable. Having had experience with the director and his special treatment of actors' techniques part of psychological realism in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE a few years earlier she does an almost flawless job here. Let me broaden this point a little bit.Ms Hopkins nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress crafts her role very well with a heartfelt attitude towards her audience. She has quite a difficult role to portray the role of the foxy young lady who climbs up to the highest ranks of the society using pretty unconventional means deceitful means. Nevertheless she catches the glimpse of the 'unreachable' for many. A bad tempered girl to face the world a sort of woman no one knows what she is about a chitchatting maiden for whom war is amusing a ruthless Becky who does not give up her plans. Many scenes from the beginning scene when she leaves school through various moments including her witty role of a governess her serious role of a wife and a delicious role of a mistress. Miriam Hopkins is unforgettable and stands out from the supporting cast some very good actors of the period including the distinguished Cedric Hardwicke as Marquis of Steyne.In all the analysis of the first three strip Technicolor movie the following adjectives will best describe it after all these decades innovative memorable significant rousing. INNOVATIVE color experimentation MEMORABLE production in the history of cinema SIGNIFICANT direction by Rouben Mamoulian and ROUSING performance by Miriam Hopkins. Worth seeing!".

Many scenes from the beginning scene when she leaves school through various moments including her witty role of a governess her serious role of a wife and a delicious role of a mistress. Miriam Hopkins is unforgettable and stands out from the supporting cast some very good actors of the period including the distinguished Cedric Hardwicke as Marquis of Steyne.In all the analysis of the first three strip Technicolor movie the following adjectives will best describe it after all these decades innovative memorable significant rousing. INNOVATIVE color experimentation MEMORABLE production in the history of cinema SIGNIFICANT direction by Rouben Mamoulian and ROUSING performance by Miriam Hopkins. Worth seeing!";

Becky for her part feels the same and unlike the demure ladies of the time she tells the headmistress where she can put her school!! But like a cat she lands on her feetbeing taken in by a rich classmate. After wrangling this invitation to stay with this rich lady Becky then works hard to snag a rich husband.

Eventually he tires of her whorelike ways and divorces her.Becky now broke is forced to work in the lower quarters of society. But once again she manages to find a rich guy Nigel Bruce to bail her out and once again she begins scheming her way to the top. And by the end of the film Becky hasn't learned any lesson about life other than look out for number one! This film is the Thackery novel Vanity Fair and it's been made several times. What makes this one of some importance is that this was the first fulllength film made in ThreeColor Technicolorthe first true color process for movies. While TwoColor movies had been made since the early 1920s they lacked full color as the color strips were bluegreen and orangeredresulting in a film that tended to actually look more orange and green than anything else though there were a few exceptions where the colors actually looked pretty goodsuch as in the color segment in THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. Despite the major technical improvement with BECKY SHARP it too looked rather muddy and orange. This is NOT due to the age of the print as people at the time commented on its rather limited color palate. But the process was roughly that of future fullcolor films and it is the first of its kind.The story features the shallow but scheming Becky Miriam Hopkins working her way through society in order to further her great ambitions. To do so she lies and plots continuously and she's quite good at it! However entertaining this is it is also the biggest problem with the film. Because Becky is generally a selfish jerk though not always so it's hard to care about her and the film rests mostly on its costumes and fullcolor. As for Hopkins' acting it's one of her best performancesthough it is a tad twodimensionalmostly due to the writing not her acting. Had they made Becky either MORE evil and conniving like Bette Davis in JEZEBEL or THE LETTER or LESS it would have improved the film immensely.Overall a rather forgettable costumer whose sole reason to watch it is the use of ThreeColor film. Other than that fans of Miriam Hopkins both of them might want to see it as it's among her best performancesmostly because it doesn't call for a lot of restraint or subtlety.".

Perhaps it's just that the Hays code won't let the screenplay even suggest an exchange of sexual favours for support and this means that the glossing over of Becky Sharp's vicious streak turns the story into a costume drama featuring a determined and gay in the old sense young woman taking on the snobs for her own advantage. And settling on bumbling Jos Sedley Nigel Bruce in the end to escape with him to India or somewhere. Or perhaps it's just Miriam Hopkins probably miscast.

Though Thackeray's Becky Sharp did get produced to the motion picture screen all as Vanity Fair in the silent era 1915 1923 and an early sound moderndress adaptation for Allied Studios 1932 starring nonother than Myrna Loy of all people this latest edition may be the best known but one that should have been an another surefire hit to the studio's earlier success of LITTLE WOMEN 1933. At 83 minutes this screen comedydrama centering upon Becky Sharp and her scheming ways of winning affections of wealthy men does have its good points especially when Becky lies cheats and cries convincingly to those listening her sob stories while all the while she's laughing from inside thinking what a bunch of fools they are. There's a couple of instances where she lets her victims know she's made fools of them and happy about her accomplishment. At one point Becky does make amends to the hurt she's done Amelia but throughout Becky retains her ambition as a social climber no matter what the odds.Set in 19th Century England and basic Virtue is its own reward theme the story opens with Amelia Sedley Frances Dee a popular student among classmates and teachers leaving the boarding school of Miss Pinkerton's Academy. Also at that school is her closest friend Becky Sharp Miriam Hopkins a notsopopular girl boarding there as a charity case. As Miss Pinkerton Elspeth Dudgeon offers Amelia a going away gift of Doctor Johnson's Dictionary as a token of her affection Amelia surprises everybody by having Becky come home and remain with her until she able to support herself. During the course of time Becky flirts with Amelia's buffoonish brother Joseph Nigel Bruce. When things begin to look serious in their relationship his father sends him away to India. As Amelia finds herself with two childhood suitors Captain William Dobbins Colin Tapley and George Osborne G.P. Huntley Jr. and decision which one to marry Becky soon lands a position as governess for Pitt Crawley William Stack and his unruly children. She agrees to the position upon meeting Captain Random Crawley Alan Mowbray of the British Army who then offers her a new position caring for his rich aunt Julia Alison Skipworth and later another position as his wife. During a society ball hosted by the snobbish Lady Barreacres Billie Burke Becky attracts the attention of the Marquis of Steyne Cedric Hardwicke who becomes fascinated by her. The function is interrupted by cannon sounds at a distance where soldiers including Random immediately take off to what's to become Napoleon Bonaparte's battle at Waterloo. After the war problems arise for Becky as Random meets with 500 pound gambling debt and her husband's suspicions as to how she acquired the large sum of money to help pay off his debts. Other members of the cast include William Faversham Duke of Wellington Charles Richman General Tufts Doris Lloyd Duchess of Richmond Leonard Mudie Lloyd Tarquin among others.A public domain title BECKY SHARP began circulation on video cassette starting in the early 1980s about the same time when broadcast on cable television stations as Arts and Entertainment AE. It wasn't until March 1993 that the fully restored Technicolor BECKY SHARP with RKO Radio logo intact aired on American Movie Classics as part of its film preservation festival and then a decade later on Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere December 2 2002 and availability onto DVD from various media sources.BECKY SHARP appears to contain only small passages to famous pieces of both book and play which explains why such notable performers as Alison Skipworth and Billie Burke appearing ever so briefly. Had the movie followed the book closely chances are BECKY SHASRP might have been close to two hour mark or further in its storytelling. Though Hopkins handles her characterization well it's a wonder how a natural born British actress like Elsa Lanchester in a rare starring role might have handled it?

It took only four years for every movie to have sound but it took thirty years for every movie to have color! You can tell that this is the first color movie. I think there are a few transition scenes that look black and white or at least in low quality. It's weird because there isn't much else to say about the movie. I guess the good technically outweighs the bad in this but I wouldn't quite recommend it.I think the film's problem is that it's too short. It shows the title character becoming more cynical but the transition seems too fast. There should have been more time to flesh out her personality. I had no idea that this took place during the Napoleonic era. It was really nice to see how those historical events affected the actual story here. It seems to be a part of history that hasn't been depicted in film that many times before.Weird I heard this was in public domain but I don't see it listed on Wikipedia's list. I guess I can't quite recommend it as the story isn't that memorable but it's still wonderful to see the earliest use of full color. There were in fact earlier movies like The King Of Kings that had some color sequences and that is in fact a much better movie. Still a must for really historians of any kind. 12 out of .".

The writers here have cut the story down to less than an hour and a half and the result is a kind of Classic Comics version that I doubt loses much in the transposition.The nice girl Amelia brings home a guest for Christmas her school chum Becky Sharp Myrna Loy. It's apparent in the first few minutes that Becky is pretty sharp alright although pitiless might be a more apt modifier. She can smell money and aristocracy. She puts the moves on just about all the men  old young married engaged to Amelia  it doesn't make any difference.And that basically is the whole of this dismal tale. The men of course grovel at her dainty feet the moment she glances at them. Although to be honest unless these guys are complete dolts they must realize that she's a piece of hazardous material throwing her perils before swains.By borrowing cheating and seducing she works her way close to the top before everything falls apart. She's even cheated her loyal housekeeper Polly. Becky winds up alone and debauched in a dingy apartment.None of the performances are memorable and Myrna Loy though a fine actress is limited by the technology of the time. It has to be admitted though that the attraction she has for men is understandable especially when we see her modeling this backless gown cut almost to her sacral dimple. Her figure blends glowing ivory flesh with vulnerability. Yum.The director is Chester Franklin and he's put some thought into the job not startling by today's upsidedown standards but a novelty in 1932. Myrna Loy is at a dressing table looking into a mirror at the end. Her face is that of a spent whore. She remarks that it's odd how sometimes one can look as young as she once was and her features brighten the dark circles fade and she's young and beautiful again before the present reasserts itself.And again she's looking down from her window at the departing Amelia ex friend who climbs into an open carriage with her fianc who tenderly lays a robe over her lap. The scene is shot from directly overhead. There are a couple of nicely seamed visual transitions from one scene to the next. A running kitchen faucet dissolves into a filling bath tub for instance.But it's hard to overcome the oldfashioned soap opera aspects of the story. Frankly it's a little dull.".

This review is for the UCLA Restoration Print which is what AMC played the day I recorded it. The first halfhour or so seems very fuzzy and occasionally out of focus and the colors are so glaring that I often felt as though I was viewing a black and white movie that had been colorizedthe yellows are especially offputting. After this period of discomfort the color seemed to stabilize and I was able to actually get into the plot of the film which truth be told is pretty predictable once you realize that it basically involves a woman who uses whatever means necessary to advance her station in life. Miriam Hopkins is actually very good in a broad humorous sort of way and if you look at this as a star vehicle for her the movie succeeds. I also noticed that closeups were consistently beautiful so maybe the inconsistent color issues were related to the difficulty in shooting color scenes in longshot.".

Although the direction is a little staged and awkward the experienced cast do help to keep this film watchable. This was the first full length three strip technicolor feature film so kudos to the studio for taking the gamble with making it. It is no great surprise it is studio bound because of the amount of lighting that was needed on early technicolor. Also the technicolor cameras were bulky too making the directors job pretty difficult too. The Art department must shoulder some of the blame for the mixed results though. I seem to remember their colour scheme was really uninspired. They could have used nice bright primary colours to show off the system but they erred on a colour set up that made you feel was lacking in courage. However on a critical note Becky Sharpe was a decently made costume drama that was fairly average with good performances. However its is interesting to note how quickly technicolor improved after 1935. Check out 'Wings of The Morning' from 1937 to see a film that may have had a bad script but made excellent use of external location filming and the colours were a lot more naturalistic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fans of motor racing will appreciate this semidocumentary film based on the legendary 24hour French road race. The film is set during a period in motor sports just prior to its almost total usurpation by corporate culture in this case 1970 when there was still a tolerable balance between sponsorship and the particular form of nobility that pervaded racing. As a film LeMans is remarkable for a sense of restraint that is so unwavering that even the incomparable Steve McQueen seems almost normal inside its cool envelope. No movie on the subject has ever equaled its transparency and authenticity. Motor sports have become so sophisticated and bigtime that if you cut the average driver with a knife he might bleed only contact cleaner or Mello Yello. Modern drivers are still courageous and skilled but something essential has been lost to the hype and the inevitability of high technology. In LeMans you can almost smell the 100 octane Supershell and the hot Castrol. People look at one another not at computer displays. They converse directly over the rasp of tightlywound 12cylinder engines not through headsets and mikes. It's a human thing. Overwrought genre siblings like Days of Thunder are ludicrous and crass compared to LeMans' pure almost ascetic spirit. Tom Cruise's Cole Trickle could not buy a pit pass into its world.LeMans is essentially about racing. But as a film in the American narrative style it must have at least some back story and in this case that story is romantic. As a safeguard against terminal mushiness the back story is duplexed into a pair of similar boygirl situations thereby keeping each from acquiring excessive density while satisfying the needs of the form. In one a European driver and his tres charmant preternaturally understanding wife work through to a conclusion that it is time for him to walk away while he is still able. The other focuses on the hesitating and mutual attraction between McQueen's American racing star and the widow of an Italian driver who died in the previous year's LeMans race. The nighttime accident that claimed her husband also involved McQueen's character a nofault event. It was just racing. The lady who still misses her late husband but is ready to move on desperately needs someone to talk to someone who fully understands the nature of her loss and who might possibly to some discernible degree justify it. Steve McQueen thrived on characters who required no external validation from women or men but who were never arrogant about it. He was the real deal. Few of us have the courage or motivation to be as authentic or to weather the storms that can result from being so though I think we should still try. McQueen's racing driver carries this same authenticity and he sutures the widow's aching heart with it during a meal break LeMans cars were driven around the clock by twodriver teams while sitting across the table from the lady. She is resisting a strong desire to run and protect herself from her own feelings. But McQueen's character is so selfeffacing and contained yet so completely and unthreateningly there that she cannot pull away from him. Only part of the dialog is audible. The rest of the scene is viewed from outside the dining area as the camera pulls back through its window. It's a brief scene but excellently acted adding itself into the film's humanity a quality that is never lost against the backdrop of hurtling cars and screaming engines.The racing sequences are beautifully staged. The final seconds before the race starts drivers in the cars fidgeting with shifters one by one switching ignitions on as the countdown closes against a stethoscopic heartbeat sound puts you right in the cockpits. Atspeed scenes were driven by actual racing luminaries of the time including McQueen himself and they go as fast camera mounts will allow. A couple of spectacular crashes take place both filmed in an interwoven stopaction style that lets you watch every rivet pop as the cars unpeel like grapes. Near the end entirely plausible circumstance pits McQueen and his main rival a great German driver in a gripping lastlap duel. the German driver played by Sigfried Rauch also played the wily Wehrmacht Sergeant in Sam Fuller's The Big Red One. These two characters meet briefly during mutual downtime early in the race and establish the obvious respect and fraternal affection they hold for one another. The camaraderie established here underpins the entire film from that point and also transforms their lastlap duel into pure contest. And the cars. openclass LeMans machines of this period still sourced much of the sinuous design style of the preceding decade and they are gorgeous to the appreciative eye especially McQueen's ride the Gulf Porsche 917 possibly the most charismatic car ever raced. Interestingly one of the cars used in the film a Lola as I recall was recently discovered languishing in a German barn sans motor and transmission. Both had been loaned by Porsche for the production.Fire up LeMans on a system with decent audio capabilities EQ a bit toward the bass to compensate for accurate but slightly raspy 70's recording technology and crank it up. You may not feel the burn but you'll definitely hear it. Only the somewhat too RatPack score detracts from this super little film and that only slightly. Otherwise it's as timeproof as one of those molded spoons you get in Chinese restaurants. Any true fan of the sport certainly as it was in the film's timeset should collect it. If you appreciate the compact characterdriven semidocumentary style try Downhill Racer. Released the year before LeMans it's about skiing. Robert Redford's KissMyAss ski god isn't remotely noble but is entirely believable as are Gene Hackman and Dabney Coleman as his coaches. It was one of the late John Simon's favorite films and for good reason.".

McQueen's racing driver carries this same authenticity and he sutures the widow's aching heart with it during a meal break LeMans cars were driven around the clock by twodriver teams while sitting across the table from the lady. She is resisting a strong desire to run and protect herself from her own feelings. But McQueen's character is so selfeffacing and contained yet so completely and unthreateningly there that she cannot pull away from him. Only part of the dialog is audible. The rest of the scene is viewed from outside the dining area as the camera pulls back through its window. It's a brief scene but excellently acted adding itself into the film's humanity a quality that is never lost against the backdrop of hurtling cars and screaming engines.The racing sequences are beautifully staged. The final seconds before the race starts drivers in the cars fidgeting with shifters one by one switching ignitions on as the countdown closes against a stethoscopic heartbeat sound puts you right in the cockpits. Atspeed scenes were driven by actual racing luminaries of the time including McQueen himself and they go as fast camera mounts will allow. A couple of spectacular crashes take place both filmed in an interwoven stopaction style that lets you watch every rivet pop as the cars unpeel like grapes. Near the end entirely plausible circumstance pits McQueen and his main rival a great German driver in a gripping lastlap duel. the German driver played by Sigfried Rauch also played the wily Wehrmacht Sergeant in Sam Fuller's The Big Red One. These two characters meet briefly during mutual downtime early in the race and establish the obvious respect and fraternal affection they hold for one another. The camaraderie established here underpins the entire film from that point and also transforms their lastlap duel into pure contest. And the cars. openclass LeMans machines of this period still sourced much of the sinuous design style of the preceding decade and they are gorgeous to the appreciative eye especially McQueen's ride the Gulf Porsche 917 possibly the most charismatic car ever raced. Interestingly one of the cars used in the film a Lola as I recall was recently discovered languishing in a German barn sans motor and transmission. Both had been loaned by Porsche for the production.Fire up LeMans on a system with decent audio capabilities EQ a bit toward the bass to compensate for accurate but slightly raspy 70's recording technology and crank it up. You may not feel the burn but you'll definitely hear it. Only the somewhat too RatPack score detracts from this super little film and that only slightly. Otherwise it's as timeproof as one of those molded spoons you get in Chinese restaurants. Any true fan of the sport certainly as it was in the film's timeset should collect it. If you appreciate the compact characterdriven semidocumentary style try Downhill Racer. Released the year before LeMans it's about skiing. Robert Redford's KissMyAss ski god isn't remotely noble but is entirely believable as are Gene Hackman and Dabney Coleman as his coaches. It was one of the late John Simon's favorite films and for good reason.";

The sound of the 917 blast down the Mulsanne at full throttle is well worth the time to watch this movie. Sadly this is probably the last of the true racing movies. The world today is impossible to make a movie out of real racing carevery single race car in Le Mans is real. The Porsche 917 the Ferrari 512S The Lola T70.

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this film many a time plus I've had to put it on many more times for my son even though he's only 2 years old! This is because he loves the sound of the cars.In the film although I like listening to the cars myself and how realistic the film is it could have done with just a little bit more dialogue although I do understand it's very difficult to have a dialogue when you're racing.The bits I found the funniest were first of all when a tyre on the leading Ferarri car went flat. My opinion of this was either the mechanics didn't think to put air in the tyre first general wear and tear of the tyre or was the tyre punctured? I would've loved to have found out. The other was Steve McQueen's twofingered salute right at the end. I was surprised at the German driver's reaction to this. I thought he would be getting ready to punch him.If I was selected to do a profile of the characters in this film I would have to praise Steve McQueen's character for his honesty in one scene of the film where he's admitting he's at fault for his own accident although the type of accident he had was very common in any Le Mans race. This scene really stuck out because drivers of this day and age particularly F1 drivers seem to blame each other for any accidents they have rather than accept liability themselves.It's also good to see the characters being friendly with each other rather than behaving like enemies which is what racing drivers these days tend to do.All in all it's a very good film despite the lack of dialogue. I would personally like to visit Le Mans to see the course for real and even drive on it. But I would probably be rather scared to be a passenger in a car with Steve McQueen driving as I read that he drove like a maniac off film sets as well as on them. Ironically I loved watching him drive in his films particularly this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw Le Mans all the way through for the first time and I was very impressed. The film has often been called 'documentarylike' for its attention to detail and the feel of the film but it is much more than that. The film is more about making you feel as if you are actually there  as if you are one of the drivers taking part in this 24 hour endurance race. Compared to an average film Le Mans has very little dialogue. What there is mostly comes from the Race Track Commentator who gives us some background and takes us through what is happening on the track and in the pits. Some of the cars in the race are similar models but you never lose track of who is who thanks to his updating. To be honest the film doesn't need much dialogue  and Steve McQueen's presence does enough talking. In fact many of the character's exchanges take place with just looks.However the ontrack action  and there's plenty of it  is the reason to watch this film. You'd think that with the percentage of the film that's made up of racing it would get boring after a while but director Lee Katzin keeps the footage fresh playing with speeds camera techniques and racing conditions to keep our attention. It's a testament to him and the editing and cinematography of the film that we're still as fired up at the end of the race as we are at the beginning. And what a beginning it is. The film brings you in slowly from the dawning of the morning and the individual drivers arriving to the crowds settling down and finally into the buildup to the roaring race start. It's great stuff.I saw about 15 minutes of this film on TV when I was quite young and remember getting annoyed at some of the filming techniques  particularly the occasional periods of silence through the crashes. However coming back and watching the film again I can plainly see why it was done. The crashes are some of the most powerful parts of the film and the way they're filmed blew me away. I would take this kind of thing over similar moments in almost any racing film made since.MINIMAL SPOILER I also liked the fact that the 'romance' between the malefemale leads was not rushed at all almost just hinted at  the race is the star here not the people. I can see why the time taken between them may be frustrating to some people but I found it to be fairly realistic. It's not likely that they would just fall into bed  especially given the character's unusual relationship. END SPOILERIf you're looking for a racing film give this one a try. It's a little different and it is all the better for it.".

Days of Thunder? Driven? Talladega Nights? All Hollywood B.S. that embarrasses me as a racing fan and diminishes our beloved sport.So McQueen goes back out after a devastating crash and nearly kills himself again in the best racing of the movie ONLY TO BLOCK the Ferrari from passing his Porsche teammate. Not to win the race mind you for he is not ordered to pass the other Porsche...and he surely could have because he is faster and better than him. Instead he drafts him...That's the heartbreak but reality of racing. Much of the race scenes were shot during the actual 1970 24 Hours of Lemans race. They are fantastic. The camera car itself entered by Solar Productions finished 9th overall!!! What a flick during a golden age of racing. It truly captures a racing experience from spectator to driver.

He was originally going to make it for Warner Bros in 1968 but with the selling in the studio to Kinney National Services his contract was terminated.McQueen has said him self that it was one of his most personal films that he had ever made and was determined to get it made he convinced famous action director John Sturges to take the wheel and direct it.

The absurdly melodramatic soapopera style character drama that usually dominates racing films is kept to a reasonable level here and the racing itself is the focus. Some of the camera footage is brilliant the dialog is appropriate and occasionally spoton as in the famous life is racing everything before or after is just waiting quote and the demands of endurance racing on drivers machines spectators and teams is portrayed quite well. Grand Prix also had some brilliant racing footage but focused a bit much on sensationalism and on a silly soapopera plot about the lives and affairs of the drivers and their wives and girlfriends. Other films such as Days of Thunder usually are sidesplittingly hilarious due to all the inaccuracies about racing forced into the film. Overall Le Mans is very well done and well worth seeing.".

No this visual masterpiece gives an accurate account of the most famous car race in the world. Many have tried to capture the excitement of motor sport in a film but only this one truly offers you the full high octane package. Steve McQueen was not only one of the highest paid actors at the time but also a very talented racing driverhe understood what it would take to make this film the real deal and only he was qualified to do so. The action sequences of approaching cars are the best you will ever see indeed McQueen was forced to take control of the camera himself on occasions when the camera crew thought it too dangerous to be so close to cars approaching at 200 mph. The high speed shunts are nothing short of spectacular and will encourage you to press the rewind button more than once. The story although not the most imaginative doesn't distract from the battle on the circuit between the Porsche and Ferrari teams. You don't have to be the proverbial Petrolhead to enjoy this McQueen jewel in the crown but if you watch it there's a reasonable chance you'll become one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Le Mans is a well made semi documentary about the famous 24 hours race on the Le Mans circuit in France with a much laid back star performance by Steve McQueen. He really was a man with style as this elegant movie plainly shows. In my opinion it is one of those flicks that become better the older they get.The year is 1971 and the motto shut up and race. May happen what happens. I detected a philosophical overtone Steve McQueen seems to be quite himself as the taciturn lonely existentialist and manly man who is addicted to high octane excitement behind a steering wheel. He lives from race to race from lap to lap and it's curious how that prospect of endless repetition is dreary and fascinating at the same time. Incidentially the title sequence showing the main character's approach to the race track through the almost deserted old town of Le Mans very early in the morning in a vintage Porsche 911 is first rate and sets the tone of the whole movie perfectly.The racing cars and their colors are beautiful  they look like giant cockroaches in carnival mood. They roar through sunlit groves along herds of grazing cattle through rain and darkness. The landscape changes continually the cars remain the same and the drivers in them are quite detached from what happens around them. The movie shows this very successfully. 24 hours are a long time for nonstop entertainment so there are many distractions for the spectators around the circuit  even a real carnival with a ferris wheel and everything. There is also a children's race on a mini circuit with a traditional Le Mans start running across the track jumping into the cars and then driving off while the real race is in progress a few paces away.Motor racing is noisy it stinks is unecological and often boring as far as fights and real competition are concerned. There are many reasons to rant about it  but I expect so ranted people against tournaments in the Middle Ages. It seems people just need this element of irrationality of organized madness where technical progress meets the animal instincts. This movie pays tribute to this fact in a well measured and accomplished way.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only negative comment I could make about this superbly crafted and casted movie gem would be the movie's title DINNER RUSH. If I was the producer I would have retitled the picture A TABLE JUST FOR YOU. Why this title name change? Because I actually felt like I was sitting in the New York Tribeca area restaurant named Gigino's. What a fantastic job by Director Bob Giraldi to make everyone feel as if they were actually having a meal at this fine Italian eatery. Apparently Bob Giraldi actually owns the restaurant where the film was shot. So what makes this movie rate a 9 out of 10? Heck I would have given it a 10 but the only thing Giraldi could not pull off was to provide me with just one of the hundreds of beautiful meals prepared throughout the movie. I could almost smell and taste the authenticity of the food all the cooks were preparing in the kitchen. mmmmmmmmAs for the acting I can't say enough about this all star cast. Danny Aiello a personal thank you for bringing the character of Louis Cropa to life. As the owner of Gigino's Louis Cropa loses his business partner early in the movie as a result of a cold blooded murder. Thus setting the stage for the criminal element to demand a table at Gigino's with the intent to extort a big piece of the ownership away from Louis Cropa the sole survivor owner.Also wonderfully cast as Louis's son and his head chef Udo is Edoardo Ballerini. Controversy and tension between father and son plays out due to the head chef's menu choices. Udo prefers to wow his dinner guests with flare and presentation whereas Udo's father Louis recognizes the traditional fare of tomato sauce and meatballs which made his restaurant a mainstay in the Tribeca area. Also coming between Udo and his father Louis is the Sous Chef named Duncan who is a habitual gambler played to perfection by Kirk Acevedo. His performance stands out because of the challenges he faces between mentoring some of the new chefs preparing the fabulous meals he is known for his relationship with the hostess who he loves and the demons that keep him gambling well above his means to pay his debt to the gangsters who are sitting upstairs waiting to devour more than just their freebie nine course dinner.There are so many great characters in this film too many to mention. The ending of the film is one of the best I have seen. I would hate it if someone spoiled it for me so suffice to say the ending is a dessert best served cold. This movie rates a 9 out of 10 but if Giraldi brings me a meal I will give it a 10. Bon appetite! Enjoy!".

It all looks very contrived at first and you wish for a more demure and simple atmosphere the same way Louis Cropa played by Danny Aiello disapproved of his son's fussy cuisine asking for something more nourishing something that simply smells and tastes good. And that's exactly what you could ask from Bob Giraldi the director of Dinner Rush'. But once you get inside Cropa's restaurant you're drawn to the warmth of the place the rush of the night the relationships among the staff and the show that some of the patrons put on Sandra Bernhard is extremely funny as a wigwearing food critic and the actor who plays the obnoxious art manager is hysterical. You become fond of characters such as Marti the waitressartist great performance by Summer Phoenix Duncan the souschefchronic gambler the English barman with whose cultural knowledge the customers bet and loose their money on but most of all Louis Croppa alias Gigi the owner of the restaurants who's thinking of quitting both the restaurant and his bookmaking business. Danny Aiello is an amazing and underused actor and with this performance he really hits the mark. He's cool subtle wise tough and gentle. It's simply impossible no to succumb to the charm of this unpretentious film and all you want to do when you leave the cinema is fly to New York and have a true Italian dinner experience in lower Manhattan.".

This is the type of movie when the work of figurant is worthwhile eating those delicious meals and deserts.

	schema:reviewBody "Dinner Rush is a 2000 film starring Danny Aiello Edoardo Ballerini John Corbett Polly Draper Kirk Acevedo and Sandra Bernhard directed by Bob Giraldi and written by Rick Shaughnessy and Brian Kalata.The story concerns a very trendy Soho restaurant owned by Louis Cropa his son Udo Ballerini is the popular chef who makes nouvelle cuisine with an Italian slant. The place is packed to the rafters every night though Louis doesn't really approve of these dishes which are not straight down the line Italian. Udo wants to take over the restaurant but so far his father is resistant.We learn the history of the place early on  Louis and his partner were lowlevel bookies using the restaurant as a front and when some thugs from Queens wanted a partnership in the restaurant Louis' partner refused them and is later killed on the street. Louis no longer takes bets and has turned legitimate. However he can't control Duncan Acevedo who works at the restaurant and is a compulsive gambler now into these same guys for 13000. On this particular night the queens thugs come into the restaurant on the invitation of Louis but he has also invited a police detective Walt MacPherson and his wife to be his guests for dinner.What makes this film is the atmosphere a very typical one for an upscale restaurant with repeat high profile clientle. The wait staff is incredibly gracious to some very demanding customers and there are many perks if you had to wait too long in line or if the boss knows you.The kitchen however is like the wild west with all kinds of screaming and throwing things and Udo losing his temper. It's all absolutely perfect and really makes you feel as if you're there.The performances are excellent from Aiello's underplayed honest performance to John Corbett relaxing at the bar and talking to a woman there to meet someone who doesn't show to Ballerini's intense artistic Udo proud of his accomplishments and finally to Aceveda's messed up Duncan working and trying to listen to a race at the same time realizing it's another bad bet and meeting his girlfriend for stolen moments on the fire escape.The end of the film though I expected some of it changes the atmosphere drastically in seconds.Truly fantastic film that took me through something I experienced many times while living in New York. Highly recommended.".

We have successful Tribeca restaurateur Louis Carpo Danney Aiello being hassled by these two mobsters from Queens Carmen  Paolo Mike McGlone  Alex Corrado who are trying to muscle their way into Louis' five star Italian Restaurant The Trattoria which has been in the Carpo family for some three generations. These two murderous thugs go so far as offing in a mob hit Louis' good friend and partner in the Trattoria Enrico Coventie Fran Borgiorno just to show him that they mean business. The business that they want is to become part owners of the eatery even though they despite stuffing their faces with fine Italian food and wines know nothing at all about the restaurant business!The two mobster have an ace up their sleeves in getting Louis to go along with their efforts to get part and later all of his business by having his compulsive gambler son and second or 2 chef at the Trattoria Ducan Kirk Acevedo in their hip pockets for 13000.00 in gambling debts. By Paolo  Carmen using Ducan's gambling as a way to get to Louis has them feel he'll pay them off in making them partners in his eating establishment. This all backfires on them with Louis taking the 13 grand out of the till and paying them off in order to get the two mobsters off his and Duncan's back.It's obvious right from the start that Poalo  Carmen only want to get hold of Louis' restaurant which is knocking them the customers dead with the mind boggling dishes put out by Louis' 1 son and top chef in the joint Udo Edwardo Ballerini a man who loves cooking his dishes as much as Paolo and Carmen love eating them. Running the kitchen like a hard as nails US Marine Drill Sergeant Udo won't tolerate the slightest infraction of the Culinary Code of Ethics! We see earlier in the movie Udo can one of his cooks on the spot in him dicing  a major violation of the Code instead of chopping chives. Udo for his part feels that he's being short changed by his dad in not being made a partner in the restaurant which both Paolo  Carmen want to be even though his dad thinks that his dishes are just out of this world and are filling the place to capacity every night!MAJOR SPOILERS Louis being the man of peace and having superhuman self restraint that he is was more then willing to give up his bookie operation to Paolo  Carmen in order to keep them out of his life and restaurant but when they hit his best friend Enrico and then shook down 2 son Duncon that's when they went too far much too far with him. And that's when Louis decided to pay them off big time using his beloved restaurant The Trattoria as a trap in luring those two rats to their deaths!Very probably the very best of the many Mafia restaurant mob hitjobs movies that's a lot like the real hit on gangster Dutch The Dutchman Schultz back in October 1935 in a Newark New Jersey spaghetti joint. Louis Carpo at first tries to reason with the smug and arrogant Queens thugs who seemed to have greatly underestimated him in his non violent attitude towards them. All Louis wanted was to talk things over and come to some reasonable decision with Paolo and Carmen but the two thought that they had him boxed into a corner. They didn't realize that he set them up right from the start and in the process had them stuff themselves like a last meal for a convict about to be executed before he had the boom lowered on them!".

The flick maybe be limited in its appeal to dare I say NYC yuppies with a sense of humor. Within its context though it works very well. So you can give it an 8 or a 3 depending on where you come from. The flick's characters' behavior is not to far from what I knew and appreciated back then. The movie captures a slice of life from a time and place in our recent past. Personally I highly recommend it with the caveats stated above.".

Professionally it is demonstrated by the fact that he is sextorting a parolee named Ruth Lanier who feeds him information in return for him not sending her back to prison for some trumped up parole violation. With his new partner John Vukovich Chance is more determined than ever based on recent circumstances to nab known longtime counterfeiter Ric Masters who is more than willing to use violence against and kill anyone who crosses him. Masters is well aware that the Secret Service is after him.

The viewer learns that 1 not every law enforcement agent always has the public good in mind 2 real people generally aren't either 'good' or 'evil' all the time 3 if a cop or in this case Secret Service agent takes the law into his own hands he WILL pay for it one way or another and 4 whether you're a cop or a criminal things usually don't go according to plan.This information is directly opposed to what we've learned from countless action movies of the 1980s. Watching the Lethal Weapon movies or anything with Schwarznegger Stallone or Seagal suggests that it's fun and entertaining when cops take the law into their own hands. Notice that no matter how much damage Riggs  Murtaugh cause they can laugh about it with the captain later and the world is always a better place for it. And no matter how many people's civil rights are trampled and no matter how illegal the cops' activities are everything always works out in the end and the only people who get hurt are the bad people.To Live and Die in L.A. shows what would happen if Riggs  Murtaugh tried their antics in the real world. While Martin Riggs' arrogant recklessness is heroic and hilarious Richard Chance's arrogant recklessness ruins a lot of lives not least his own. When it's over justice has hardly been served and even though the bad guys are dead there's no hint that L.A. is a better place for it.With all these Lethal Weapon comparisons I should make it clear that To Live and Die in L.A. came out in 1985 two years before the first LW movie.All that stuff aside this is one rocksolid movie. Willem Dafoe uses his character's eccentricities to create for my money one of the best villains in cinematic history even if the movie doesn't see Rick Masters quite that way. William Peterson is incredible and brings a lot of depth to his performance I'm not one to critique someone else's opinion but I don't understand the users who complained that he's wooden. Chance is an egomaniacal scheming nutjob with a death wish he really believes that he's above life and death and it never crosses his mind that he might be wrong. Peterson brings this all out.Dean Stockwell is in his element playing a scumbag who knows everything about everyone. John Pankow was a wonderful surprise bringing all sorts of conflicting and confused ideas to Vukovich which is perfectly appropriate. When things really go wrong he goes to pieces. Again some users complained that he was overacting but ask yourself how YOU'D behave. Nobody ever gives Darlanne Fleugel much credit but she's terrific here. There's a whole lot going on in Ruth's head and in many ways she's the central character to this whole play. Pay attention. And I'd be remiss in my duties if I didn't point out Steve James and Jack Hoar as two of Masters' criminal associates. They're both tough intimidating and surprisingly multidimensional.And I haven't even mentioned 1 the car chase to end all car chases 2 the copious amount of nudity 3 the perfect fit of Wang Chung's soundtrack with the dayglo L.A. look even as all hell breaks loose and men confront the dark depths of their souls huh? and 4 a climactic shock that WILL knock you for a loop.".

I thought then it had the potential to eventually become regarded as one of the best cop films ever. Recently I watched it again on DVD. It absolutely holds up in every respect to its original verity and impact and it undeniably should be regarded as one of the top ten movies of its genre and in my opinion one of the top two or three. What is so remarkable about William Friedkin's film is the uniformly excellent level of the performances of his cast. There is not a single portrayal on screen that is not from first scene to last dead on target. William Petersen as Richard Chance an ambitious adrenalinecharged treasury agent who becomes totally obsessed with avenging his partner's murder and Willem Dafoe as Rick Masters a fabulously wealthy yet sleazy and violent counterfeiter form the nucleus around which the film unfolds. Both actors are superb in their roles but no less impressive is John Pankow as the new partner who approaches emotional meltdown as he gets drawn deeper and deeper into a web of illegality and violence stemming from Chance's singleminded pursuit of Masters. Also Dean Stockwell as a cynical mob lawyer in his glass tower office and John Turturro as a lowlife excon each in their own way a lackey to Masters deliver taut finelyetched portrayals that linger in the mind with their subtle impact all the more remarkable for the relatively brief time they appear on screen. And the same can be said about Debra Feuer and Steve James in even briefer roles Feuer as Masters' longtime girlfriend and James as a ghetto crime lord totally dependent on a constant supply of counterfeit twenty dollar bills from Masters. The richly detailed location shots within which the film's action flows from Masters' BelAir mansion to the barrios of East Los Angeles from Hollywood Boulevard performance art theaters to federal prison exercise yards is unflinchingly authentic but never intrusive. And as a bonus to all this is a car chase that at least equals if not surpasses the one Friedkin directed in 1971's Best Picture Oscar winner The French Connection.".

	schema:reviewBody "Somehow I just love the feel and styles of the '80's. The music the fashion statements the hair styles and the movies. Maybe it's just because I was a kid in the Eighties and the days of your childhood are mostly what you have a longing for.So the other day when I started to watch 'To Live and Die in LA' I knew there was a very small chance that I would dislike the movie. And I liked it. From the opening sequence soundtrack to the style and swagger of the lead character to the ladies. The movie is about a daredevil cop Chance who likes a bit of BASE jumping along with his job. His partner is about to retire from duty in a few days but gets killed while trying to track down a lead on counterfeit money being produced in LA. The counterfeiter Rick Masters William Dafoe in a wonderfully wild and wicked role shoots him down and leaves him to the dead. Chance decides he wants to track down the killer no matter what the methods used. He gets assigned with the seemingly by the book nervous Vukovich. However as Vukovich starts to work with Chance and trusts him he slowly begins to come around to his way of thinking. The rest of the movie deals with how Chance and Vukovich with the help of Chance's ultra sexy informer tracks down Masters. The climax is something worth waiting for as it hits the viewer unexpectedly and suddenly.The acting is good enough though not great. The look and feel of the movie reminded me a bit of Michael Mann's Miami Vice TV series in the eighties. Though William Peterson was good as Chance I did wonder how it would have been if the more suave and sophisticated Don Johnson had played the lead. Oh and there a pretty explicit sex scene between Chance and his informer as well.All in all a pretty good watch for anyone who likes cop movies and a must watch for the fans of the eighties.".

Maybe it's just because I was a kid in the Eighties and the days of your childhood are mostly what you have a longing for.So the other day when I started to watch 'To Live and Die in LA' I knew there was a very small chance that I would dislike the movie. And I liked it. From the opening sequence soundtrack to the style and swagger of the lead character to the ladies. The movie is about a daredevil cop Chance who likes a bit of BASE jumping along with his job. His partner is about to retire from duty in a few days but gets killed while trying to track down a lead on counterfeit money being produced in LA. The counterfeiter Rick Masters William Dafoe in a wonderfully wild and wicked role shoots him down and leaves him to the dead. Chance decides he wants to track down the killer no matter what the methods used. He gets assigned with the seemingly by the book nervous Vukovich. However as Vukovich starts to work with Chance and trusts him he slowly begins to come around to his way of thinking.

	schema:reviewBody "To Live and Die in L.A is one of my favorite movies of all time and one of the best ActionThrillers ever made. Darkunforgettable and uncompromising To Live and Die in L.A is an underrated classic and one William Friedkin's best films.To Live and Die in L.A tells the story of a secret service agent named Richard ChanceWilliam Petersen who is apart of a secret service unit that takes down counterfeit money and counterfeiters in Los Angeles. When Chance's retired partner Jim HartMichael Greene decides to investigate a master counterfeiter named Rick MastersWillem Dafoebut Masters kills Jim Hart in the process. Now looking for revenge Richard Chance will do anything to get Rick Masters even if it means breaking the law.To Live and Die in L.A is an amazing film from beginning to end that was so dark and uncompromising in the 80's it's not a surprise the film wasn't a hit in 1985. Action films at the time were dominatedto a great deal by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Slyvester Stallone where the characters in Arnold and Sly's films were likableinvincible and heroic. But in To Live and Die in L.A the characters in this film are unlikeable and unheroic and that is one of the things I love about the film. TLADLA while a ActionThrillerthe charactersespecially the two main characters are rooted in the attitudes and spirit of FilmNoir where the characters and their attitudes are pessimistic and dark. The city of L.A. while still showing palm trees and sunlight is told with a dark lightgiving viewers an L.A That wasn't seen at the time during the 1980s. L.A at that time and now often associated with Hollywood and glamourbut this film shows the other side L.A as a uglydirty and dark place. TLADA is an ActionThriller that pulls no punches and gives viewers a film that is unpredictable and done with a nihilistic mean streak where you never know what's going to happen or when and you as a viewer are put in a since of uneasiness and dread. What I also love about TLADLA is the way it takes the genre of the Cop film and turns the genre on it's head giving viewers a Cop film that takes the conventions and trademarks of Cop movies and goes the opposite direction because you think is going to go one way but goes another way making TLADLA a surprising film that has a lot of twists you won't see coming. The two main characters Richard Chance and Rick Masterswhile on opposite sides of the laware mirrors of each other because both are obsessive with what they want to do whether it's Chance taking risks with his life in the secret service trying to catch Rick Masters or Masters making counterfeit money or Masters being a painter. Both are living on the edge doing what they do and you have the feeling that their lifestyles are going catch up with them. TLADLA is I think one of the few films to show what counterfeiting money is and how it worksespecially how Rick Masters makes the money and how people in the film except counterfeit money as real money and the secret service wants to bust people carry the fake money. Friedkin also shows not only the counterfeit world in the moneybut in the people too with the secret servicecharacters emotions and their motivations. The Action scenes are so greatraw and brutal that you feel that no character in the film is safe and they're not done with a joke or a pun like in the Schwarzenegger or Stallone filmsbut with danger and surprise. The car chase scene is in the film is one of the greatest Action and car chase sequences in movie history. Well directed and fastpacedthe car chase is one of the alltime great Action scenes and a classic scene that's up there with The French Connection. The ending is one of the most shocking and surprising endings in film history and literally made my jaw drop. I think the reason the ending is so shocking is because it was something you rarely saw in 80s films or in most ActionThrillers then and now where everything works out in the end. The ending fits in with the dark and gritty tone of the film and is one of the reasons TLADLA is a classic.The cast is great. William Petersen is excellent as Richard Chance bringing an intensity and toughness to the role as the agent who wants to bring Rick Masters down. Willem Dafoe is brilliant as counterfeiter Rick Masters who in my opinion is one of the best villains in movie history. Dafoe is frightening and totally believable. John Pankow is wonderful as John VukovichChance's new partner who's torn between his loyalty to the secret service and Chance. Debra Feuer is fantastic and sexy as BiancaMasters' girlfriend. John Turturro does a great job as Carl Masters' associate. Darlanne Fluegal is great and beautiful as Ruth Chance's informant and sex partner. Dean Stockwell does a great job as Bob Grimes Masters' lawyer. Steve JamesJeff and Robert Downey SRThomas BatemanMichael GreeneJim HartChristopher AllportMax WaxmanJack HoarJack and Val DeVargasJudge Filo Cediloalso do good jobs in their roles.William Friedkin's direction is excellentgrittydark and stylish showing the city of Los Angeles that wasn't seen at the time in the 80s from the freewaysdirty streetscornersvibrant colors and palm trees. Great moviemaking from Friedkin.The score and soundtrack by Wang Chung is excellent and fits with the film perfectly with the title theme song To Live and Die in L.A being my favorite. The only film that i think that can match the soundtrack in To Live and Die in L.A is ManhunterAnother great underrated classic thriller.In final word if you love ActionThrillers or films in general I suggest you check out To Live and Die in L.A one of the best Action Thrillers ever made and a excellent underrated classic. Highly Recommended. 1010.".

The way he does everything buy the book its hilarious.Sure there are a few flaws in this film but these can be brushed aside because of the genius of the movie. In particular just before Chance goes into the wrong side of the freeway I find it pretty inplausible that with all those FBI's cornering Chance and Vukovic they just let him accelerate away. I also do not understand why Masters agreed to do business with Chance even though he knew he was US Secret Service. But this film is far to classy to worry about those minor details. THis film has some great moments and superb lines. Watch it yourself and you will see what I mean. But I recommend you watch it at least 2 times to fully appreciate the quality of this film.

	schema:headline " An Underrated Crime Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "William Friedkin of The Exorcist fame went back to his crime film roots with this well executed action thriller based on a former LAPD agent's book of the same name. The story is relatively simple at the start as the film has two officers William Petersen and John Pankow of the U.S. Secret Service out to catch a notorious counterfeiter Willem Dafoe who killed the partner of one of the agents. The narrative takes several twists and turns as the agents race to take down their target but keep learning along the way that it won't be an easy task to catch a smart criminal mastermind without prices being paid for their dedication.As the heroes or in Petersen's character's case an antihero Petersen and Pankow display a unique chemistry that keeps their characters on opposite sides of the same case Petersen's Chance will go beyond the law to catch their counterfeiter prey while Pankow's Vukovich is the bythebooks agent who soon learns he must go outside the rules to get the man they are after. The show primarily belongs to William Petersen's Chance as he is the driving force for the action since he is the one whose partner is killed early in the film. Petersen oozes a brash personality that counters the more reserved and just Vukovich that John Pankow plays.Playing the film's villain in one of his earliest starring roles is the ever charismatic and talented Willem Dafoe as the calculating and brutal Rick Masters. He is the counterfeiting mastermind Chance and Vukovich are desperately chasing but Masters is always a step ahead. From brutally executing Chance's first partner Jim Hart to his masterful counterfeiting operation to even more crueler slayings for anyone who doublecrosses him Dafoe keeps a sinister charm to his portrayal of Masters and conveys his quiet intelligence with his trademark softspoken voice. Friedkin helped write the film's screenplay with some assistance from source writer Gerald Petevich and Petevich's brother. The director quite easily has control of their script which is clear from what is shown onscreen. However this does not dumb down the tension of the film as the clock ticks down the days and time of the action. If you want a potboiling action film that will have on the edge of your seat I recommend this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "To Live and Die in L.A. is one of those underrated gems that could easily get lost but then resurface every once in a while. Based on a novel by former Secret Service Agent Gerald Petievich this action packed crime caper moves at a frenetic pace thanks to director William Friedkin The French Connection and it is also notable for featuring a cast of almost unknowns who later find stardom.Los Angeles Secret Service Agent Richard Chance William L. Petersen CSI Crime Scene Investigation is a reckless daredevil who vows to take down the brilliant but murderous counterfeiter Rick Masters Willem Dafoe Platoon following the brutal murder of Chance's partner Jimmy Hart Michael Greene who was due to retire in less than three days. Chance makes it very clear to his new partner John Vukovich John Pankow Mad About You that he will break the law and throw all the rules and ethics out the window to catch Masters no matter the cost. Chance also relies on his informant Ruth Darlanne Fluegel Lock Up to provide him relevant tips with whom he is also having a sexual relationship with as well. Vukovich also contacts Master's lawyer Bob Grimes Dean Stockwell Blue Velvet to try and get close to Masters. Chance and Vukovich continue to tear up the streets of Los Angeles hot on the heels of Masters but for everyone the price may come at high cost.William L. Petersen who made his big break here turns in an excellent performance as the thrill seeking daredevil Secret Service Agent Richard Chance who is breaking every rule in the book no matter the cost to avenge the death of his partner. Willem Dafoe shows that he is always reliable no matter what role he plays and as the murderous counterfeiter Rick Masters Dafoe is almost flawless. John Pankow who is later well known for comedic roles does a fine job as straight laced John Vukovich who finds himself in a moral dilemma taking down Masters with his partner Chance.The soundtrack by pop band Wang Chun gives the film a neonoir feeling reminiscent to Miami Vice although the same mood is transferred to Los Angeles. Everything about To Live and Die in L.A. is unashamedly 80's.What makes To Live and Die in L.A. enjoyable is that the movie is not just the same clichd crime caper. The good guys might have their strengths but their flaws prove to be their downfall. Richard Chance is definitely more of an antihero who sees things as the end justifies the means. The bad guys are also three dimensional. While they are criminals they are also human without sympathizing with them or glamorising their lifestyle. Rick Masters might be brilliant with his methodical attention to detail with counterfeiting dollar bills but he is also ruthless and is not afraid to commit murder should anyone cross him. His personal life also shows his eccentric behaviour.To Live and Die in L.A. is also made even more memorable featuring one of the most thrilling car chases in cinematic history.Keep an eye out for John Turturro The Big Lebowski Robert Downey Sr. Robert Downey Jr's father and Steve James American Ninja in small roles.Over 30 years later To Live and Die in L.A. is still an underrated gem that is still enjoyable and well worth checking out. It's also fantastic to see a majority of the cast including William L. Petersen and Willem Dafoe move onto bigger and better things with their career.910.".

It stars William Petersen Wiiliam Dafoe John Pankow Debra Feuer John Turturo Darlanne Fluegel and Dean Stockwell. Music is by Wang Chung and cinematography by Robby Muller.Secret Service agent Richard Chance Petersen swears to bring down those responsible for the death of his partner...Critics of the time were very divided on the quality of Friedkin's movie with some being way off the mark by trying to put it in the same ball park as TV show Miami Vice! On reflection you like to think that many of those critics view it now and see just how damn down and gritty it actually is. A common misconception is that the film wasn't supported by the paying public with some quarters suggesting it flopped not so since it cleared 10 million in profit in North America alone.The story is set over 41 days in December and January but forget any notion that this has any hint of the Christmas holidays for there is no joy here. This trawls the unglamourous side of Los Angeles crime and corruption dwells here in a world of strip joints and working class graft locales. There are no heroes either all characters are either flawed or trapped by their situation alienation figures prominently as does fatal obsession and Robby Muller's photography dovetails with the character's mental health by way of colour and composition. In short this is classic neonoir.As an action film it also scores high with the brutal violence handled with kinetic assurance by Friedkin while the famous car chase that precedes the finale is worthy of all the praise thrown its way over the years. Taking six weeks to shoot and with Friedkin challenging himself to trump the car chase in The French Connection it's a dizzying array of accelerated thrusts spins and nail biting breathlessness one of the finest car chases in cinematic history for sure. That finale that follows also proves to be a throat grabber no copouts here as Friedkin sneakily put in the ending that the studio didn't want. The script stings with snide asides and moody exchanges and a splendid cast are led by Petersen and Dafoe turning in classical noir protagonistantagonist portrayals.It's very 80s Wang Chung's electro synth musical score ensures that is the case as do the garish reds and greens that adorn the opening credits but this is a good thing for it's not a film of god awful mullets and spangle dressage. A moody and miserable film it is and thankfully so. 810".

I was with friends and we sort of got into it but anytime you have friends over to watch a movie unless they understand getting completely into a story shuttingup and watchinglistening forget it. I missed little bits and parts of it. So later when I saw it and remembered I talked the rental manager into selling it to me that copy wasn't for sale and I didn't own a laser disc player yet back then. I knew that I wanted it however. I bought the movie on laser disc. The last discontinued disc for 45.00 out of a small 'Wherehouse Music and video' in Santa Barbara California.When I bought a laser player finally watching it alone this time I was set back at what I had missed. The music was this Erie undeniable character all it's own. The various depths of emotional darkness and mixing colors of the city scape. The grittiest parts of 'industrial' Los Angeles. The differing tones and moods the build up of sudden frantic flight of action and then...the calm silence. The underworld players and polarization between the ranksof the players from great to mediumlevel to small timers and yet blending. It was strangeness however I couldn't break away. There was also a man in the film Rick Master's the counterfeiter right arm man the muscle named Jack Played by Jack Hoar now this man I had never seen before but I knew this guy was too good to be nothing or just some actor with a character to play named 'Jack'. No offense to actors but this guy seemed totally real. He was big and imposing solid in mass huge hands. When Jack pushed Peterson's character 'Richard' up against the wall by his throat I almost peed my pants!! I got scared. I knew in real life that guy is too big to just push out of the way. Hell he's as big as a wall. Probably as solid too!!! I found out he was in fact not a career actor but now in 2006 he is a retired officerL.A. with quite an impressive credited resume. Special weapons explosives on the AntiGang Unit etc etc. This man was the perfect choice for an underworld character's 'Enforcement Department'. He played in a couple other things a few years later but not much since. You know this man's 'rolls' are not going to be the 18 year old love sick kid 'parts'. He is more like a Big BadAss John Wayne than anything else. Hey and that's cool he doesn't even have to act to pull it off. Because it's real for him. Enjoy the Film and the special features on the Special Edition D.V.D. And to jack I say Be safe. Keep on trucking!!!".

Now it's personal and the hotheaded Chance is doing anything possible to nail down Masters. In doing so Chance is putting his and new partner's John Pankow career on the line by stretching the law to suit his own agenda.Now this incredible flick doesn't hold back on its searing material and it lays it down thick and fast! William Friedkin's To Live and Die in L.A. is a sophisticatedly hardboiled crime thriller adapted from the novel of Gerald Petievich a former Secret Service agent that has a plethora of unexpected turns and a very trance like appeal within its powerful makeup. For me I don't care what anybody thinks but this is one my favourite flicks and IMO wait wait Friedkin's best. It might start off like a generic crime flick but the symbolic themes running throughout the feature smacks you hard and are very important to the story's success in building an authentically grimy and hysterical edge amongst the highly flashy direction. There's such a strong realistic tone belted out because of the way director Friedkin captures the explosively gritty terribly relentless and deceitful cloud that puts you right into this hazy situation on who's really batting for the good side. Where the fine line between cop and criminal merges into one in this artificial counterfeit world.There are a lot of fine theatrical touches and the main striking one really goes for the extraordinary hurtling car chase that's purely dynamite and excitingly executed because of its risky setup. Precise handling and considerable skill makes this outing visually appealing and plenty staples of beautiful photography shots gives it an hypnotic pull and a sweeping motion that carries you along for one really pressure filled ride. Definitely screaming at you is a very 80s feel thanks largely to Wang Chong's energy packed score that always on the move with it's biting flair. Sure people are going to complain about it but I didn't mind it actually.The film's intense levels and sincerity is raised above the bar because of pictureperfect acting from a wellensemble cast. William Dafoe kicks in with an impressive performance as the sly weasel Eric 'Rick' Masters. Making their big debuts are William Peterson and John Pankow. Peterson puts the boot in to give an excellently raw and hardedge performance as secret service agent Richard Chance and Pankow equally so as the very alert new partner John Vukovich. Brilliant support roles in the shape of John Turturro as the slimy Carl Cody one of Master's runners. Dean Stockwell plays the sneaky lawyer Bob Grimes Darlanne Fluegel as the naturally stunning parolee Bianca Torres being used by Chance and Debra Feuer is manipulative piercing as Master's flame Ruth Lanier.What's makes this pounding flick inventively wicked and far from contrived is the way the film's material goes about its character's relationships with devious twists and deceptions making way for a great showstopper of an ending.A wellcrafted and quite established crime thriller with explosive bursts interwoven into its glitzy but also roughly cold embrace.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a genre movie but the director William Friedkin knows how to put them together effectively.We have two Secret Service agents. One Peterson is a reckless ruledefying loose cannon his partner Pankow is more principled or uptight if you like. Peterson bungee jumps from high bridges. During a chase when Peterson is laughing Pankow is grimacing with anxiety.Their prey is a master counterfeiter DaFoe. DaFoe is like neither of the cops. He's extremely organized. He tells the truth and fulfills his promises. He's an artist not only with engraved plates but with a paint brush. A man of his word. He really only has one kink  he's a remorseless coldblooded killer when it's in his interests to be one. And when he gets burned up he REALLY gets burned up. DaFoe loses in the end but then everyone loses one way or another.The bestknown scene justifiably is the car chase that takes place in the wrong direction against traffic on the Long Beach Freeway. It is gripping precisely choreographed and must have been dangerous to shoot. These are not computergenerated images either. That eighteen wheeler we see jackknifing among dozens of whirling cars is a real eighteen wheeler jackknifing among dozens of whirling cars. No exciting music during the pursuit only the sound of engines in overdrive and vehicle horns shrieking alarms in the key of F. The highspeed pursuit by this time though was not an original idea. It was original with Bullitt 1968 and that's still the best example. After Bullitt this car chase  ALL car chases  were variations on a theme of director Peter Yates a former racing car driver himself and Philip D'Antonio.Friedkin has directed with a maximum of speed and action scenes none of them gratuitous. Lots of shots of people running full tilt along city streets. Plenty of violence although it isn't wallowed in. It's not a Bruce Willis actioncomedy. There are few dull moments to bore the kids. Really this is one of the better efforts of Friedkin and his editor. For instance there is a shot between DaFoe's burning the funny money and Peterson's meeting with the judge. It's simply a highangle shot of a dozen pedestrians walking through the plaza in front of a government building. But Friedkin frames it so that from this distance the equidistant palm trees loom over the people and throw lengthy shadows across the tiles of the pavement. The composition is impressive. If the performances don't shoot out the lights they get the job done in a most professional manner. Peterson is physically nimble and obviously does most of his own stunts. He played football at school and it shows. And the parts are complex too. The bad guys don't fit easily into any stereotypes except one hamhanded heavy who spits on his victims after blowing their heads off. The good guys are hardly saintly. Peterson's character has a snitch working for him Darlanne Fluegel a tall thin sexy blond. He's keeping her out of jail and in return she feeds him information and certain other perquisites. When she turns to him for comfort or understanding he is off on some other planet frantically chattering on about basketball while she weeps. What would you do if I STOPPED giving you information? she asks Peterson at one point. I'd revoke your parole and send you back to the joint he answers tonelessly. Would you do that? Would you REALLY do that? He turns and walks out the door without a word. He's really a mean guy. Mean to everyone including his new partner Pankow.Three particularly enjoyable features of the film. The location shooting and photography by Robby Muller is great. He manages to make smoggy San Pedro look almost artistic with its oil refineries and its multitude of distant floodlights providing patterns of globular glow. The stars are God's eyes says Fluegel to Peterson who disagrees with her. One advantage of living in San Pedro is access to Papadakis Tavern. Great Greek food. Tell Nick I sent you.Wang Chung's theme music is simple but it zaps you with its percussion and its simple pounding succession of four electronic notes. Carl Orff with syncopation. A distant train rushing through a flat landscape is introduced by a passage for what sounds like Peruvian nose flutes or shakuhachis.Then there is the performance of Dean Stockwell as an expensive and expert criminal defense lawyer. He underplays the part but he's just fine. Our two heroes have just stolen fifty thousand dollars from the FBI and Pankow explains the situation to Stockwell who gives him a few words of advice and adds Of course I can't be directly involved in this. How much would it cost for you to be indirectly involved? asks Pankow. Stockwell looks up at him puffs a cigar and answers smoothly Fifty thousand dollars. Nobody laughs. Friedkin knows how to lay out a funny line.".

My vote is five.Title Brazil Not Available";

	schema:reviewBody "Italian horror legend Lucio Fulci 19271996 did a great amount of atmospheric and wonderful Spaghetti horrors during his prolific career his masterpieces being Zombie FleshEaters 1979 The Beyond 1981 The House by the Cemetery 1982 and Don't Torture a Duckling 1972 among many other more or less interesting and noteworthy films from the horror or other genres. His masterpieces have wonderful soundtracks by composer Fabio Frizzi great cinematography by Sergio Salvati and the kind of surreal and infernal ultra gory imagery that will stay inside the mind especially when experience for the first time. But his career has the other side too these ultra braindead cheapies that are so painful to watch especially if one appreciates the director at all.Demonia is Fulci's attempt in the nunsploitation genre at least kind of. It has a historical background as a bunch of Sicilian nuns were brutally killed in the convent as they had practised something the others judged as evil and satanic. This is shown as a flashback just like in his The Beyond but so much less effectively and it comes clear in this very beginning that even the gore effects are very bad and stupid in the film. Then we jump to the present day as some group of archeologists search for treasures from the historic times if I'm correct the mentioned nun killing took place in the sixteenth century and naturally neither the villagers nor the raising evil spirits like this too much and soon the bloody killings begin...as well as all the possible errors and negative sides a film can have.There are hardly any positive things to be said about this piece of cinematic garbage. None of the Fulci magic is left. Some of the dream sequences and closeups of frightened eyes remind me distantly of Lucio Fulci but still there's nothing in the imagery that would save the film. The ending has some nightmarish scenes and images as the nuns return from the beyond but The Beyond shows how great that kind of scenes can be. The music is also horrible and probably taken from a commercial or something like that. It doesn't create atmosphere and terror as Frizzi did but is there in order to make the silent scenes not to look so dull which they still are as well as the whole film. What's there is the graphic gore and very boring 80 minutes.The film almost gives a new meaning to the phrase dead boring as it has some laughably long dialogue sequences which almost force to stop the viewing. The characters are uninteresting but fortunately don't overact too much the plot is nothing too special but could have been interesting if made by Fulci ten years earlier and every single element in the piece screams in tired pain as does the viewer too. The film also looks very amateurish as if done by a bunch of amateurs and it is no wonder this didn't even have a theatrical run in Italy.The gore scenes are also very bad and the effects don't even look real as they did in the classics created by Gianneto de Rossi. They are quite sadistic and graphic at times the body splitting and tongue impaling being the most memorable examples but still they are not as haunting as in the earlier films that were also effected by the soundtrack and visuals. Now there's plenty of gore but hardly any impact. They show more than Deodato did in Cut and Run for example but as everything around the scenes sucks it is hard to take the horror shocks too seriously. The butcher house sequence however is a pretty nasty as an idea and has some interest in it too and that is also easily among the film's most interesting parts. And the guy really has a tongue that makes Gene Simmons look green in comparison.Demonia is a very very bad film even as a fan of Lucio Fulci. It has practically nothing to make it worth recommending only those very few distant things mentioned above and I think it is rather impossible to watch this film again. It is so bad as unfortunately was the state of Fulci's career when he was forced to make films like these. 210 and very barely so.".

The picture quality just was off as if I were to pick which Fulci film was the oldest between The Beyond City of the Living Dead House By the Cemetery and Zombie I would say this one was the oldest. There was also something very weird about the bedroom the one character was in when she was taken there by her professor. The story has said professor with said student going to Sicily to do an archaeological dig to try and uncover some Greek relics. Unfortunately there is a monastery nearby that the female student is drawn too and it turns out it is the site of a nun crucifixion. You will follow the woman as she tries to unravel its mysteries as she is very much drawn to the place. Along the way we have some good kills and some rather pointless subplots such as the professor being questioned about the murder of one of the people killed. You will also see a very strange death as a man chases after his son in one scene boy gets away and dad is somehow staked in the ground his legs in the air and let me just say good death that may have had a bit more impact if said character had been established. I did not even know until then he was the boy's father. The ending makes me wonder what the point the film was trying to get across too. Just not up there with earlier Fulci horrors it is nice that he did not focus on the eyes every five seconds but that still does not make up for the general mayhem at the end. He was actually putting forth a good plot then it kind of falls apart. Better than Manhattan Baby a film I saw by him a couple of days earlier but this one too suffers from this need of the man to just shoot random things at times. This one also did not have the atmosphere of earlier films by him. Had its moments but just not as fun as some of his other work.".

Yet the film is interesting in its Fulcitypical style and atmosphere and features several truly creepy moments as well as some spectacular gorescenes. What also makes the film worth checking out is the fact that the master himself has a role  Fulci plays a police Inspector. The storyline is actually very promising Horrormaterial In 15th century Sicily a Covent of nuns who are suspected of conspiring with the devil are lynched by angry villagers. Five centuries later Canadian archaeologists come to the area and are met with hostility by the superstitious locals. The locals fear that the strangers and their archaeological work might raise the demons of the past and their worries are not entirely unfounded... Overall the film has a promising premise but the execution is too messy. Yet it is recommendable to Fulci fans as it does include many moments of pure creepiness. The master does show his talent for haunting atmosphere and once again proves that his moniker The Godfather of Gore is justified. While Demonia should entertain many of my fellow Italian Horror buffs it might make others roll their eyes. My advice to fellow Fulcifans check it out! Others never mind.".

I think it was because of the special effects director was changed or something I'm not sure. But the one I remember was the one scene where the guy is caught upon a trap while trying to get his son from one of the nuns or whatever and the guy is split apart from his son tripping upon a rope or something. The effects looked terrible I'm sorry.Otherwise the movie was weird to me. Not saying that the movie is a piece of crap though it could be better. The music was... well I think it could be better. I liked the intro music plus the music following the intro scene.So final verdict? Well Demonia is a mixed bag of good and bad. If you're a true Fulci fan like me then this is your movie. If not then... I guess you should give it a try. Demonia the 'What the Babuguganosh!?' moment of Fulci's career.Also Al Cliver Zombi 2 actually is in this movie though he is credited as Al Clever... clever I must say eh? Ha ha ha... ha???".

But the one I remember was the one scene where the guy is caught upon a trap while trying to get his son from one of the nuns or whatever and the guy is split apart from his son tripping upon a rope or something. The effects looked terrible I'm sorry.Otherwise the movie was weird to me. Not saying that the movie is a piece of crap though it could be better. The music was... well I think it could be better. I liked the intro music plus the music following the intro scene.So final verdict? Well Demonia is a mixed bag of good and bad. If you're a true Fulci fan like me then this is your movie. If not then... I guess you should give it a try. Demonia the 'What the Babuguganosh!?' moment of Fulci's career.Also Al Cliver Zombi 2 actually is in this movie though he is credited as Al Clever... clever I must say eh? Ha ha ha... ha???";

Although this film is a bit of a snoozer and is downright boring in parts I would not say that this is unwatchable. This film has Canadian archaeologists come to Italy to check out some GrecoRoman stuff but leading lady Meg Register is more interested in the ruins of an old monastery that involved a Satanic nun coven that haunts the small town of Santa Ria. Meg Register is pretty wooden and bland as the lead in the film and with the micro budget and poor directing job from Fulci Demonia is not such an easy watch. I must confess I myself tried to watch this multiple times without falling asleep and through out the course of a week and I could'nt do it. I did watch the complete film in pieces at a time though and it does deliver on having an atmosphere of dread set on location at a real monastery with a tomb of real dead corpses. Although there is a lot less of it the gore scenes are extremely vicious and brutal complete with a guy who gets drawn and quartered and scenes where tongues and throats get hammered. There is some nudity but also not nearly enough. Demonia is a very very flawed film but at its core is still a half way decent horror movie with great ambiance and gore.".

Liza is at a seance where she sees the crucified nuns and collapses screaming on the floor.

And even after Professor Evans warns Liza to stay away from the unknown after the way she reacted to the seance she enters the crypt within the ruins.Using a pickaxe she breaks into the wall and finds the remains of the nuns angering the Professor and setting off a series of murders like Porter being killed by a nun with a harpoon gun and two members of the team being killed by metal spikes.Ignoring Turi's angry rebuke Liza enters the monastery crypt. Convinced that there is another chamber behind a wall she uses a pickaxe to break into the cavern containing the charred remains of the five nuns. But when Liza tells Professor Evans what she has found he angrily tells her to forget she saw anything.Liza meets with a medium named Lilla who tells her all about the witches. They'd invite young people to partake in orgies and kill them at the moment of orgasm drinking their blood and going insane. If they ever got pregnant they'd have the baby and throw it into a fire. Suffice to say these are very evil nuns we're dealing with. The kind of evil nuns that make Lille's cats eat her the moment Fulci leaves. If you're wondering do they eat her eyeballs then the answer is yes. Obviously you know Fulci like I know Fulci.Everyone suspects Turi but he dies too. A nun comes into the butcher shop and impales him on a hook then stabs him in the neck then nails his tongue to a block then freezes him. Fulci you scamp!Inspector Carter Fulci starts to suspect the Professor who decides to get out of town. Liza is going crazy and she refuses to leave even when the townsfolk attack the ruins. Robby a young boy gets kidnapped by a white nun with no face but he escapes just in time to watch his father get torn in half. Fulci strikes again!Liza then stabs the Professor and disappears. The townsfolk charge into her chamber where she foams at the mouth as she hangs on a cross. They set the crosses on fire again and everyone is destroyed leaving the Professor to stagger in bloodied where he sees Liza's dead body.There are some great shots in the open here with the camera wildly swinging through the seance and the nuns being executed. And the film looks so much better than Touch of Death. The city feels like Lizard in a Woman's Skin. It starts like City of the Living Dead. And Fulci has done possession before with Manhattan Baby. But this isn't a greatest hits collection  we still need to watch A Cat in the Brain.Read more at httpbit.ly2kc1d7l".

The story is simple satanic nuns from the 15th century orgies blood drinking burning at the cross then present day possession and more killings. No big deal.What's great about this is the Cinematography lighting and the locations. The acting was OK. The female lead was decent but not great. She needed a bit more to make this work. The music was good audio sounds were good the dialogue and all audio mixed well. Professionally edited. All this helps move the film along. It was a bit slow paced but with the camera work locations and audio mix it's a please to watch.I enjoyed the campfire drunken tune. They also sang it in English. Good tune. Two of the drunks later get killed one after the other in the same exact way falling down a pit and getting impaled. Fun stuff. Another guy is tied upside down between two trees and when his little son tries to help him the kid trips a rope and tears his father apart. A woman is attacked by her cats ripping her eyes off. In the beginning 5 nuns are tied and nailed to crosses nails through the hand and chest. You will not see this in anything other than a Fulci film.My rating is a C or 5 stars. It's on youtube so can be seen for the price of your time and internet connection. If I understood what the hell they were talking about the rating may go up.After watching many movies in the past few years here are a few more comments that elevate this film. I just rewatched the original Alien film. I was disappointed with the film before and again disappointed. Crappy audio dialogue characters actors direction killings gore etc. I think people may be blinded by all the cool props and sets. They love the alien look so much that they dismiss the totally garbage dialoguecharacters and actors. Similar crap happening with Star Wars VII Farce Awakens. Look at all the cool bright lights forget about the content or art. I have a special hatred for Suspiria and anything produced by Argento. Fulci and Argento have only one thing in common. They are both Italian. Fulci was a professional film maker. The stories were not great but good but you can tell while watching a Fulci film that the guy actually thought about the scenecinematography lighting editing. His editing is great. We do not get long unnecessary fillers in a scene. When the nuns get nailed to the cross. We see the 5 nuns dragged to the crosses. Then they get tied down nail through the hand nail through the heart then the we see all of them dead on the cross. There were 5 nuns we don't get to see all 5 nuns getting nailed through the hand and heart. We get the point. An amateur filmmaker like Argento would show each and every nun getting nailed.More I watch Fulci films more I appreciate his work. My favorite of his is Don't Torture a Duckling. I liked Zombie a lot. Zombie is miles ahead of Dawn of the Dead. Dawn of the Dead is a pile of garbage. Dawn has the worst acting worst zombie makeup and is just a mix bag of bad comedy and killings. It is a failure. Now on the other hand Night of the Living Dead is a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is such an unimpressive movie from Lucio Fulci. It's one of the more difficult to find being somewhere after his golden years but before his TV series flops but it's not worth hunting down a copy.The plot concerns atrocities that happen in a convent many years ago in which some seemingly evil nuns are brutally executed and crucified. These past horrors come to light again in modern times when a long sealed ancient church vault is opened up by a young researcher.The film has a very slight plot and doesn't do well with it. The film is shot almost entirely in soft fuzzy focus with light leaking all over the place which is very annoying even if it is presumably intentional. The story seems to vaguely show it's lead heroine played by Meg Register being possessed by the long dead evil nuns and taking revenge on various members of the village but none of this is clear. The sealed chamber of crucified nuns looks good when first glimpsed but the rotting bodies appear and disappear sporadically and Meg Register briefly flits between looking like herself and transforming into one of the evil nuns all of which is presumably intended to generate fear but which fails miserably.Various murders take place. Because this is a Fulci film and people want to know I am going to tell you what happens  but this obviously means SPOILERS... One guy gets stabbed and his head ends up being pulled out of the water on an anchor ? Another lady a sort of psychic get's attacked by her own cats who pull her eyes out. Looks very fake. Another man is attacked by slabs of meat hanging in a freezer. He only had to leave the freezer but he doesn't. After some meat bashing he collapses onto a table and someone pulls out his tongue and nails it to the table. as you do. The final murder is the best worst and most bizarre at the same time. A young couple lose their son and the father searches a forest for him. he catches a glimpse of the boy being dragged off by a nun! Then suddenly  the father is strung upside down in a kind of trap! How? The son trips on a wire and the father's whole body is split into two halves! This is REALLY badly done the fakeness is extremely obvious. It's still rather disgusting though. That's it for the main gore.Eventually the film limps to a close as the villagers invade the sealed up crypt and in a feeble ending they confront the ancient evil. Boring boring boring. Please don't be encouraged to seek this out based on the descriptions of gore I have detailed above. They are all laughable and do not rescue the film from being extremely lame. A sad entry in the late career of Fulci. Not as bad as his TV efforts but worse than Manhattan Baby and that's saying something".

	schema:reviewBody "I had never seen this film by Fulci until I got this DVD from Media Blasters  Shriek Show. I must say it's taken me 3 days to get just 55 minutes through the movie  that's how involving it is. Not to trash the maestro but this has to be his most uninteresting film even mores than White Fang. I'll sit through anything and usually can be entertained somehow one way or another but on this one so far  Nada. From the reviews I've read here and elsewhere things pick up in the last half hour and there's supposedly some gore so I'm assuming the movie will at least have a bit of a payoff and I'm sure it won't be a total loss. But still that first hour is grueling. The WORST part of this DVD however is the poor digital mastering  it is absolutely one of the worst I've ever seen on a DVD with digital artifact going on constantly. Pictures on the wall move around character's faces morph hair bleeds and I'm not talking gore! and the image just won't stay still. Very poor mastering! It's a shame because the source material looks great  but the mastering ruins it. You know it's bad when you're paying more attention to the shoddy mosaic artifact than the movie itself. Someone compared this to Anchor Bay quality  there's absolutely no comparison unless you mean their early stuff like the atrocious transfer on Zombie. I sure hope SHRIEK SHOW  MEDIA BLASTERS upgrade their mastering for their upcoming releases because they are acquiring some very cool titles like LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN. And if they don't they will be known as the Madacy for eurohorror titles in my opinion. What a shame!".

I must say it's taken me 3 days to get just 55 minutes through the movie  that's how involving it is. Not to trash the maestro but this has to be his most uninteresting film even mores than White Fang. I'll sit through anything and usually can be entertained somehow one way or another but on this one so far  Nada. From the reviews I've read here and elsewhere things pick up in the last half hour and there's supposedly some gore so I'm assuming the movie will at least have a bit of a payoff and I'm sure it won't be a total loss. But still that first hour is grueling. The WORST part of this DVD however is the poor digital mastering  it is absolutely one of the worst I've ever seen on a DVD with digital artifact going on constantly. Pictures on the wall move around character's faces morph hair bleeds and I'm not talking gore! and the image just won't stay still. Very poor mastering! It's a shame because the source material looks great  but the mastering ruins it. You know it's bad when you're paying more attention to the shoddy mosaic artifact than the movie itself. Someone compared this to Anchor Bay quality  there's absolutely no comparison unless you mean their early stuff like the atrocious transfer on Zombie. I sure hope SHRIEK SHOW  MEDIA BLASTERS upgrade their mastering for their upcoming releases because they are acquiring some very cool titles like LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN. And if they don't they will be known as the Madacy for eurohorror titles in my opinion. What a shame!";

	schema:reviewBody "With Demonia Fulci offers us again a supernatural horror movie. This time Fulci's vision is not as apocalyptic as in The Gates of Hell or The Beyond. Instead Fulci presents a more straightforward horror story about the return of some satanic nuns.The opening is typical Fulci style. It depicts the crucifixion of the satanic nuns in graphic details. What follows is a very uneven film lacking the pace of Fulci's previous horror movies. In an interview Fulci stated that he wanted to create a dreamlike atmosphere. He succeeds when he shows us how Liza gets into contact with the satanic nuns. But on the other hand the movie is filled with minutes and minutes of completely boring dialogue and other uninteresting scenes like people dancing around a campfire just to stretch the movie to the required 80 plus minutes. Finally the ending is abrupt and completely disappointing.Nevertheless the movie is still enjoyable at least for Fulci fans. It is occasionally atmospheric and still has the Fulci touch. Fulci recalls many of his motives from previous work. The movie also contains some reasonably well executed gore scenes such as a feline attack a tongue impalement and a body torn apart.Finally it is fun to watch Fulci play the part of a police inspector for budgetary reasons as Helsey explains in an interview. However as good as he was as a director as bad he was as an actor. Like in Nightmare Concert he just wanders around appearing totally unaffected by what is going on.".

It seems a local Medieval nunnery was once the site of devil worship flagrant carnality and ritualistic murder  until the locals banded together to exorcise the evil by crucifying the nuns depicted in the film's prologue. Turning a deaf ear to the warnings of the village leader and the local butcher the archeologists carry on digging and ultimately loosing the hounds of Hell Fulcistyle.DEMONIA is a largely uninteresting affair sluggishly paced and directed with apparent indifference by Fulci. Everything seems a bit tame artfully placed blankets throw cold water on the orgy scenes and second hand from Giovanni Cristiani's corny tympaniheavy score to the use of such hoary spookcinema devices as double exposures to suggest ghostly apparitions and echoey dream voices has anyone in your dreams ever spoken with an echoey voice?. Fulci stumbles further by having his heroine plagued by nightmares that offer no information beyond what we already saw in the prologue.Fulci himself turns up late in the film as an inspector from Scotland Yard only to turn up clues to a mystery that is no mystery to us worse yet Fulci's Inspector Carter's last scene finds him eyeballing a piece of cloth torn from the habit of one of the murderous ghostnuns identifying it as centuries old and then disappearing from the film entirely. Al Cliver aka Pier Luigi Conti appears as Porter a fellow archeologist who meets an untimely end at the hands of a transparent headless spearguntoting haint Fulci regular Cliver is billed in the credits as Al Clever.The film perks up a bit halfway through when the local medium a character similar to one played by Rada Rassimov in Mario Bava's BARON BLOOD meets her predetermined demise by dint of half a dozen cat hand puppets but DEMONIA is still slow going. A third act disemboweling of one of the dig members is gross but unconvincing and the film climaxes on an ambiguous note that fails to satisfy or justify the investment of an hour and a half.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fulci was in the twilight of his career at this juncture. As saddening as it is great talents can hit a wall sometimes. Kinda like Dario Argento these days. Fulci made a few stinkers near the end of his career and this may be his worst. This movie is endlessly talky providing no scares or thrills what so ever. Even at 85 minutes or so this feels unbearable to watch. For an exploitation movie there is very little nun action or anything that controversial. I'm used to incoherency when it comes to Fulci plots but he's usually able to overcome it with his style and vision here he can't. That surrealistic feel is there but there is nothing interesting going on. Not only is the dialog insipid but it feels really cheap as well. I wasn't that impressed by the ruins and I had no idea what was going on in Fulci's head to make such drivel. The typical Fulci obsessions are there! Seances cats death involving eyes. There is gore but it's not a gore fest. Two drunks randomly stumble and impale themselves on spikes !!  eyes are clawed and ripped out by cats a nun is staked a tongue is staked. We also get a hook in the neck and a spear in the chest. Not bad but pretty tame for Fulci's standards. The acting is hard to judge because of the dubbing. Meg Register is gorgeous but that's about it. We also get a twist at the end I saw coming a mile away. Al Cliver A Fulci favorite shows up briefly. Lucio Fulci has a glorified cameo as a detective. If you're looking for nunsploitation and debauchery expect very little. This is one of Fulci's worst movies if not his worst! It's a chore to sit through. I'd avoid it like Ebola210".

The movie its story also most definitely isn't helped with its dialog. You know it's the kind of dialog that is so bad that it will make you laugh. The actors that have to deliver the lines also obviously aren't among the best in their profession.No matter how hard the movie tries it just never gets real scary or mysterious. The movie is often more dull and a drag. Besides some of the moments are just too ridicules. For instance an archaeologist that is being scared by a couple of bones? That really doesn't sound likely. It also doesn't help that the movie doesn't feature an awful lot of gore or monsterskillers in it. At least not some good gore. The gore that is in the movie looks quite amateur like. It makes this a rather disappointing and below average genre movie.The movie spends more than halve of its time figuring out a mystery while we as the viewers already knew what happened because it was showed in the beginning of the movie. The how's and why's of it all is little interesting.

Besides aren't all the enjoyable romantic comedies a bit mushy...don't most of them end with the guy getting the girl? Isn't that the point? This film is so romantic and sooo sweet. It brightened my day.It's got a lot going for it. A great cast though I thought Parker Posey was way over the top in her role as the grieving widow. Charles Dance was fantastic as always and James Frain  Natascha McElhone have beautiful chemistry together. I'd love to see them act together again. Their scenes are the most enjoyable in a movie full of enjoyable scenes. Also it was lotsa fun to get a glimpse into the British Legal system...my but they do have some strange customs. Though I did find the black flowing robes and stiff white collars rather appealing  It was a VERY British movie with a very British cast doing extremely British things and for me that was another big plus. I love all things British and oddly enough Irish as well.But the biggest plus for me was James Frain. Ever since I saw him in Where the Heart Is  Nothing Personal I've been a huge fan. It was so delightful to see him in English mode. I've seen him play so many characters from American to Spanish to Irish...but very few with his true native accent.If you love romance and witty humor you'll adore this movie.".

James Frain and Natascha McElhone shine as the two leads  Frain is witty and charismatic while McElhone makes her character endearing and wonderful to watch. This talented duo manage to hold their own even against a dazzling supporting cast which does not have a single weak link. The script is well written impeccably acted and British humour at its best yet it doesn't exclude anyone from outside our little island from the jokes. There is only one thing wrong with this film and it is not the fault of the director writer or cast  that it has been seen by so few people! I only got the chance to see it when in a fit of insomnia I stayed awake all night watching film channels and stumbled across it at about 3am. I am dying to buy a copy of it yet despite thorough searching on the net I can't find one anywhere. If anybody ever happens to read this  I know the odds are against me  and happens to know where I might get one from please write to me and tell me. It is a brilliant little Britflick that deserves more recognition and an example of what our film industry is capable of.".

	schema:reviewBody "Instead of resolving the thematic content of the television series which is the nature and role of justice Eiga Kurosagi takes several steps backwards.We see no discussion of Tsurara's incentive to make a choice upon whether to change her vision of justice nor do we see Kurosaki evolving in his senses. Indeed it seems at times as if Episode 11 of the series has not even taken place. For example Kurosaki calls Yoshikawa Yoshida when in the final episode he has recognizes her respectfully and stops deliberately getting her name wrong. In the movie he is back to treating her like a nuisance.Indeed Maki Horikita as Tsurara Yoshikawa is extremely underused in this film. She is resigned to the role of observer and has no bearing on the outcome of the plot. This is part of why the movie suffers. The series was built around the contrast of vigilante justice or revenge vs the legal system as the arbiter of justice. Tsurara and Kurosaki are contrasts with Katsuragi and Detective Kashima Masaru as the extreme examples on both sides. Instead the film focuses on only one side the relationship between Kurosaki and Katsuragi. While it is important that this relationship is resolved at some point it is only compelling as a subplot in the T.V series and doesn't work as the main story focus of a movie Eiga Kurosagi uses a revolving contrast to the death of Julius Caesar with Katsuragi and Kurosaki discussing Brutus' betrayal of the ancient Roman emperor. However it is foggy as to what the relationship of this metaphor is to the characters. Katsuragi says Then you tell me how would you respond if a person you trusted betrayed you? when at this point we have no reason to believe Kurosaki trusts Katsuragi. He doesn't actually show sympathy for the old man until the end of the film after he has obtained certain knowledge about his past. Until that point Kurosaki is only using Kat to thin the ranks of swindlers until he can defeat Mikimoto which is main plot of the whole television series.Complicating matters is a drawn out introduction that lacks motivation. It is designed to be fun but is not entertaining. I understand that some people may watch the movie that have not watched the series and perhaps that is helpful for them but a literal explanation of Kurosaki's role and relationship to other characters would have been best explained by action and events and not talk. As it is shown it only seems to slow the pacing of movie and the whole film suffers for it. It is also difficult to imagine watching the film as removed from the jdorama series anyway so this effort seems wasted. Time spent on the introduction could have been better used solidifying the roles of other characters. For example a simple meeting between Kashima and Kurosaki at the beginning of the film would have made more sense.The main plot revolves around a little girl who needs a heart transplant and her mothers efforts to get the money needed to pay for it. Somehow a swindler has gotten his hands on her savings and she is now unable to pay for for the operation. Obviously Kurosaki gets involved and comes to recognize that the mother is only one of many victims of the same swindler.The film updates a clock layover towards the end as if to as if to update the audience of a countdown to a plot event. However the clock is a cheap device to create suspense and it backfires. This is also the case for a dreamsequencecommercial Kurosaki gives to explain how his moneycard system works to other swindlers. That kind of stuff can fly on television but not on the big screen.There are a few positives in the film. Takenaka Naoto is great as white swindler Ishigaki doing his best film work since 2002's Ping Pong. When Maki does get screen time she steals every moment of it. It's amusing to see that Kurosaki has a car in the film and can actually drive instead of walking everywhere like he does in the television series.It's also nice to see Katsuragi someplace other than inside his bar for once. Yamapi is acceptable as Kurosaki effectively playing down his catchphrases and idol status taking the role more seriously instead of reverting to nervously gulping over and over again as he does in his other roles.I could go on but the question remains If you are not going to bring the story to a thematic conclusion or at least add logically to the course of events why bother making the film? The ending attempts to refocus things back to the main story arc but you can't deny what came in the two hours before was confusing poorly edited and not compelling. The swindled mother and daughter are not given enough screen time so when we finally reach the wouldbe tearful climax of the movie it lacks the appropriate emotional impact.The reality is that any episode of Kurosagi would have served as a better bigscreen basis than this idea. Overall this film is an embarrassment to the solid original manga and especially to the exceptional television series. Unfortunately for those who liked the jdorama you have no choice but to watch the film anyway a door is left open again for a sequel or second season.".

And the rule of thumb of course is to snag a heartthrob in your leading role and you more or less have it made. In today's screening Tomohisa Tamashita's popularity in the titular role got measured by the audible shrieks and wistful sighs each time he comes on screen even in the nerdiest of disguises.Tomohisa Yamashita plays Kurosaki a man whose family was destroyed by swindlers hence his deep hatred for the group. He follows in the steps of Bruce Wayne though more focused in his vigilantism targeting only con artists in a bid to do his own Robin Hood work conning them back and reimbursing the respective victims. There are various categories of conmen such as white for those out for riches red for those out to steal hearts and black for those who con other con artists.For someone who hasn't read the manga or followed the television series this movie was quite a challenge for me to follow. Granted there was an origin flashback worked into it but it served to confuse the current entanglement with its chief villain Ishigaki Tetsu played by Naoto Takenaka whom most will recognize as the sensei character in Waterboys or Swing Girls. Being a standalone movie it tells of the despicable acts that Ishigaki commits in creating bankruptcy fraud and how Kurosaki has him set in his sights for some black swindling with a hunter after an extremely cunning prey.Those without background knowledge will find adequate scenes in which a lot of questions will be asked. For starters almost all the female characters here were treated second class and not enough despite its slightly more than 2 hours runtime being focused on them. They come and go and frankly speaking could be done without as they don't hurt the plot an iota. Next and I'm guessing here is the lovehate relationship that Kurosaki has for his informerconmaster Katsuragi. While they exchange frequent notes on Shakespeare's Julius Caesar it's hardly linked to nor presents itself as a proper metaphor on the issue of trust which they're harping on either that or the essence of it got lost in translation.Scenes such as those mentioned which require a lot more background knowledge tend to overindulge themselves hence alienating severely first time visitors to The Black Swindler's role. Some like Bayside Shakedown obviously makes it easy for nonfansseries followers to grasp and enjoy the ride but The Black Swindler seems to have stamped itself strictly for those in the know only or fans of Tomohisa Tamashita. Unless of course we decide to pick up the pieces from the established television series.".

	schema:headline " Fails To Create Needed Tension.";
	schema:reviewBody "This work is grounded closely upon a popular 2006 Japanese television series KUROSAGI and casts its lead actor from the series Tomohisa Yamashita for his initial feature starring role. It is a somewhat stolid transcription from the source set that in turn is based upon a successful manga also named Kurosagi created by Takeshi Natsuhara designer of many similar cartoonish melodramas. Three types of confidence swindlers are defined at the beginning of the narrative Shirosagi or white whose greedy quarries are targeted fully for monetary purposes Akasagi red those who lure their marks through blandishments of the opposite sex and Kurosagi black who feast upon the other two categories. Yamashita plays as Kurosaki a young man who has joined the ranks of kurosagi in order to victimize other black swindlers as means of completing symbolic acts of revenge. His desire for retribution is due to the ruination of his family by kurosagi only a few years prior. After being reduced financially by a kurosagi scam Kurosaki's father killed his wife daughter and himself. As result Kurosaki has spared no efforts toward the swindling of other kurosagi along with the subsequent return of all monies to the prey. One particularly ironic element that dominates the story has Kurosaki purchasing information that he requires for the manipulation of his kurosagi victims from a master con man known as The Fixer Toshio Katsuragi Tsutomo Yamazaki in return for a thin percentage of the profits. Katsuragi is also the planner behind many of Kurosaki's capers additionally becoming a father figure of sorts to the young man bizarre by and large as the same Toshio is the man responsible for the destruction of his family! As might be expected other characters are retained from the single season television series including Masaru Kashima Sh Aikawa an assistant police inspector of Eastern Tokyo's Intellectual Crimes Division who is fixated upon bringing Kurosaki to justice and several from the distaff side markedly a youthful law student Tsurara Yoshikawa Maki Horikita with whom Kurosaki plainly is enthralled. A large segment of the film depicts Kurosaki in his endeavours to entrap an adroit corporate fraud artist Tetsu Ishigaki Naoto Takenaka whose usual scamming method involves the cunning usage of a counterfeit corporate seal along with promissory notes and who has actually damaged the nation's international financial standing with one of his ploys.

	onyx:emotionText "This work is grounded closely upon a popular 2006 Japanese television series KUROSAGI and casts its lead actor from the series Tomohisa Yamashita for his initial feature starring role. It is a somewhat stolid transcription from the source set that in turn is based upon a successful manga also named Kurosagi created by Takeshi Natsuhara designer of many similar cartoonish melodramas. Three types of confidence swindlers are defined at the beginning of the narrative Shirosagi or white whose greedy quarries are targeted fully for monetary purposes Akasagi red those who lure their marks through blandishments of the opposite sex and Kurosagi black who feast upon the other two categories. Yamashita plays as Kurosaki a young man who has joined the ranks of kurosagi in order to victimize other black swindlers as means of completing symbolic acts of revenge. His desire for retribution is due to the ruination of his family by kurosagi only a few years prior. After being reduced financially by a kurosagi scam Kurosaki's father killed his wife daughter and himself. As result Kurosaki has spared no efforts toward the swindling of other kurosagi along with the subsequent return of all monies to the prey. One particularly ironic element that dominates the story has Kurosaki purchasing information that he requires for the manipulation of his kurosagi victims from a master con man known as The Fixer Toshio Katsuragi Tsutomo Yamazaki in return for a thin percentage of the profits. Katsuragi is also the planner behind many of Kurosaki's capers additionally becoming a father figure of sorts to the young man bizarre by and large as the same Toshio is the man responsible for the destruction of his family! As might be expected other characters are retained from the single season television series including Masaru Kashima Sh Aikawa an assistant police inspector of Eastern Tokyo's Intellectual Crimes Division who is fixated upon bringing Kurosaki to justice and several from the distaff side markedly a youthful law student Tsurara Yoshikawa Maki Horikita with whom Kurosaki plainly is enthralled. A large segment of the film depicts Kurosaki in his endeavours to entrap an adroit corporate fraud artist Tetsu Ishigaki Naoto Takenaka whose usual scamming method involves the cunning usage of a counterfeit corporate seal along with promissory notes and who has actually damaged the nation's international financial standing with one of his ploys. At the same time that he is stalking Ishigaki he becomes aware that Katsuragi is the one who is culpable for his family's tragedy. He must then determine whether or not to slay a man who has become a type of surrogate father to him. The film opens with a text frame that displays lines from Act 5 Scene 5 of Macbeth Life's but a walking shadow.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie really is an underrated gem. Somehow most critics have become totally unable to accept Woody Allen's work for what it is and compare it only to other movies from the same years.Woody Allen has said many times that he has no interest in looking back to his old work and in my opinion it really shows. From someone who has often raved about the 'Radio Days' of his youth and adores prewar Jazz he has steadily developed into a director who has no trouble catching the modern every day lives of the people around him. Recreating the atmosphere from his older movies would only show the inability to move on along with the rest of the world.Anything Else is proof of that. It's a modern movie with a typical Woody Allen style dialogue that works on several levels. Between the jokes and witty remarks and often great replies lie the worries of any young guy or girl that has to learn to deal with life's fears and frustrations. Anything Else also has a really nice atmosphere and a great pace  the movie at almost 2 hours never feels like it's stalling or going nowhere. The story moves forward constantly. Biggs really is the star here and is a perfect Young Woody Allen. Ricci is only a supporting character but both she and the rest of the cast really make this into a believable relaxed and enjoyable experience.For those who are willing to learn a little this movie does make a simple but very true point about learning to deal with life.Photography directing editing and writing is really first class work  nothing less than what you get in other top Woody Allen movies. Beautiful locations great camera work and typical Woody style jazz really make this into a perfect 1010.The lack of awards and negative reviews are just like Dobel Woody Allen says in this movie You know....it's just like anything else.Go see it for yourselves!".

Christina Ricci is excellent as ever and Woody does a great job playing the eccentric old man a role that is much more appropriate to his age than many he has attempted to play since he became middle aged 20 years ago!.This is packed with interesting views on life great jokes not Woody's usual repetition of the same jokes like the polymorphously perverse line and touching reflections on relationships.Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen steps back from himself in ANYTHING ELSE and turns center stage over to a couple of young protagonists who are allowed to thrash around and make their own mistakes with only a little kibitzing from the side by Woody. In the process the film tackles all of the larger issues of life love ethics and the loneliness of man in the universe that Woody has grappled with in varying degrees of clarity in so many of his earlier films but does it in a way that charms and tickles the audience and ultimately reassures them. While Woody's character has a dark paranoid streak to him the film is nowhere near as bitter and acidic nor as profound as DECONSTRUCTING HARRY 1997 the last film of Allen's to address these issues headon.Woody plays a sagementor to a young comedy writer who's trying to write a dark existential novel. The writer Jerry Falk played by Jason Biggs of AMERICAN PIE fame is saddled with a clinging manager Danny DeVito who keeps using inappropriate but amusing Garment Center metaphors and is mired in a hopeless relationship with Amanda a whirlwind of a young woman who sucks people into her life and then treats them badly. Played to perfection by Christina Ricci Amanda is smart seductive and clearly exciting to be around but is a bundle of deadly neuroses that will take a lifetime to untangle. We see her future self reflected in her narcissistic childlike mother Stockard Channing in a wonderful comic supporting performance who comes to stay with the couple early in the film.It's all about Jerry coming to grips with who he is what he wants to do and what it will take for him to get there. And it's Woody playing a schoolteacher near retirement age who wants to tackle a comedy writing career late in life for himself who serves as the catalyst for Jerry. Thus the movie encapsulates in perhaps an overly tidy fashion the broad advice Woody wants to dispense to the younger members of his audience. While it's occasionally cartoonish and sometimes veers narrowly toward the heavyhanded it also gives us a more confident and lively Woody one who is freed from the selfimposed demands of being the romantic lead. Overall it's a delightful charming funny and genuinely touching film which not only makes very good use of its young stars but also of its writerdirectorcostarturned elder statesman.".

I've always found the latter to have great promise...As a child in Adams Family Values when she verbally attacked the somewhat up his own arse Summer Camp leader over what she perceived to be the hypocrisy of Thanks Giving I stood up in the cinema in ovation...Note that talking or shouting or clapping in a British cinema I'm British is strictly forbidden except during showings of Star Wars...However with the sole exception of Buffalo 66 Christina has flopped over recent years and I hope for her sake that Woody Allen has now helped to relight the fire inside.Jason Biggs is another quantity altogether. The only film I've ever seen him before this one was American Pie. American Shte more like! But all actors are obviously talented people and deserve the opportunity to show what they can really do at some stage or other...Like Bruce Willis's coming of age and quality in Pulp Fiction or Jim Carey's in The Truman Show Jason Biggs may now have turned a corner and opened the doors onto a new level in his Hollywood career.The film particularly struck a raw nerve with me as after breaking up recently with the love of my life I saw the exactor at least very similar thing happen to Bigg's character in this film. Allen's brilliant characterisation and understanding of even the most insane people and situations helped me a little to come to terms with some things which in my own life are causing me a lot of pain at the moment. Girls like Ricci's character do exist surely in abundance and more more or less normal guys like myself and Biggs in 21st Century city life really do find that getting it right as our parents' generation did much more easily in love is like looking for a needle in a haystack...My search needless to say goes on.

	schema:headline " A return to the Allen of old";
	schema:reviewBody "IRRITATING? Heck yeah. Selfindulgent? For sure. A rehash of virtually every movie its creator has done in past years? Probably. Nevertheless Anything Else also happens to be the most enjoyable Woody Allen flick since . . . well take your pick.Admittedly it doesn't entirely work on every level but it's a movie that does enough to suggest that Allen is back to something like his best form.With Anything Else the much maligned moviemaker is clearly pitching for a younger audience. And it's about time too. Allen himself takes a supporting role and in comes Jason Biggs American Pie as the neurotic Jewish Manhattanite while Christina Ricci gets the nod as the love interest.Biggs is Jerry Falk a young Allenesquire comedy writer looking to make it big and Ricci is Amanda a chainsmoking neurotically selfobsessed Beatnik who drives men wild with her huge eyes and button nose.At the beginning the pair fall for each other instantly then spend the duration of the film trying to work out their complex and complicated relationship  especially after Amanda's equally neurotic narcissistic mother Stockard Channing moves in to their small apartment to live with them.Allen himself stars as David Dobel an ageing comedy writer who mentors Jerry during their daily stroll through Central Park. But it soon becomes apparent that Dobel has a bit of a problem controlling his temper and this works as a neat diversion from the romantic comedy aspect of the movie.And Allen seems finally to have twigged that it's no longer plausible for him to make flicks in which he plays the character involved with some young girl. Who after all wants to see him at 64 snuggling up to the freshfaced likes of Ricci? Like any Allen flick Anything Else is nothing if not wordy. As always the conversations go on a lot longer than they should but the script is at least scattered with killer oneliners. Such a moment arrives when Amanda attempts to reassure the sexuallystarved Jerry.Just because I pull away every time you touch me doesn't mean I don't love you she quips. In another scene there's an entertaining exchange between the mismatched couple who are reminiscing about when they first met.Amanda I had a crush on you. Couldn't you tell by the way I was ignoring you? and Jerry There was something compelling about your apathy. The picture looks great too with some neat cinematography by Darius Khondji that shows off Central Park to good effect  not you understand that anyone's gone to a Woody Allen movie for the scenery. It's the dialogue that matters most of all  and even by Allen's standards this features a staggering amount.On the negative side is the casting of Biggs. All those who remember Kenneth Branagh's excellent turn in Celebrity will cringe while watching this guy stutter his way through the traditional Woody role.Ricci though is perfectly cast as an actress with an eating disorder which reflects her own anorexia when she was 14. There is also a stellar supporting role from Danny DeVito.".

Woody Allen can claim for himself his kind of movies and nobody else does them like he does. So when you see a Woody Allen movie you know precisely what you are going to get the difference being sometimes more surprised and sometimes less. Well here there's no surprise except the way that Allen seeks new talent and awards them with the typical alter ego role. It's up to them to prove that they can handle it. Kenneth Branagh did it John Cusack did it and now Jason Biggs is the nervous new yorker who goes to psycho analysis. Well it works but the truth is that Biggs' character behaves like a 35yearold trapped in a 21yearold body. And the fact that some of the movie doesn't make much sense you can never forget that this is the realm of Woody Allen and even if it doesn't make sense it's always funny and you'll always laugh. Everybody remembers the plotless Everybody Says I Love You but no one cared for the plot. It was entertaining. Same here. Sometimes I'd wish that Woody Allen tried a little harder to make movies with a thicker plot  remember Bullets Over Broadway. But anyway this movie is a permanent joy to watch thanks to the great actors great comedy even with a nonexistent story and a great photography from Darius Khondji.".

I also love the way he always depicts real life in his movies so accurately. I got turned on to Christina Ricci in this movie she plays the part so well. The one thing I really did not like in the movie is how the conversations between Woody and Jason Biggs kept going on and on.

	schema:reviewBody "At around 6.5. From what I've seen the gist of an IMDb Woody Allen rating is that you can add two points to the film if you're a fan and subtract two points if you're not.My first time seeing this on the small screen through a sequential reviewing of the entire works most of which I'd seen before but not this one. Of course it has some great lines deep existential truths and some perfectly observed moments. This is why I would watch any Woody film you never leave empty. On the other hand Allen's tendency to ventriloquise any protagonist that isn't him is in full effect with Biggs not really up to the character's dialogue as written whether this is a problem with writing acting or casting doesn't really matter. Also the early script often drags as Allen's tendency to hammer home a relationship dynamic in the character setup makes for a lot of work in the first part of the film. I guess nonfans might be turned off by the lack of likable characters.In the end though this one contained some gems in the writing and insight into the way the world provides you with plenty of impetus to conform to a bad situation but very little to move to a better one. Don't usually like to write a spoiler but for me the obvious twist left undone in Allen's assault on authority is that HE should have ended up dating Ricci's character while sending Falk off for 'his own good'. As it is Allen gave himself the easy out. He's a prick like that. But also one of the best filmmakers that ever lived.".

Allen also has a way of changing genres as the movie goes. Like with my favorite Allen film Match point. It starts off as a romance then turns into a drama then a suspense. Well he doesn't exactly do that here but he still does a good film. I am not that fond of Jason Biggs. That is the main reason why I didn't believe that this would be a good film. The only reason. Allen usually does great movies. Usually I can't give any of his movies less than a 9. Cause they are usually that good. What's weird is that I think that his newer stuff is a little better.Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed Annie Hall but I have to say that it's a little overrated. Manhattan was terrific. I really enjoyed Broadway Danny Rose too. I also really liked Mighty Aphrodite too. But Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Match point are one of my top three favorites.Anything else is the story of a man named Jerry Faulkplayed by Jason Biggs. He writes skits for comedians. Him and his crazy friendplayed by Woody Allen.Allen is funny as usual. Jerry one day meets his friends girlfriendplayed by Christina Ricci and the two fall madly in love.His problem is that he can't say no to anyone or end it with them. But he's together with her for a while. They both cheated on their lovers from the past. And eventually he realizes that he has made a mistake.I really liked this movie. I don't really like Jason Biggs but here he's actually not that bad. But he isn't a good person. Christina Ricci is actually a bit of a bitch which is a little different. I forgot to mention another great actor in this movie. Danny Devito is very funny as Jerry's manager who he doesn't need or like but can't get rid of him. Allen is a great director. After only seeing ten of billions of his films I am very convinced. Alright he might be an atheist pervert but he's a genius actor and director. And like all of his films you've got to see this one.Note I actually have two accounts. The other automatically logged me out and I didn't remember the password. My other account is also Sirus the virus. But really I don't know who cares.".

But I was pleasantly floored this is probably Allen's best movie since 1988's Crimes and Misdemeanors though the tone is rather different and a strong throwback to the kind of film that Allen does best  the vaguely bittersweet wistful oddly hopeful gorgeously shot dramatic comedy a la Annie Hall and arguably Allen's very best film Manhattan. Allen has been of course one of America's leading cinematic talents for the past several decades  perhaps America's only legitimate auteur  but he remains either an acquired taste' though I know many people who simply cannot acquire it or simply a marginalized figure for mass audiences despite taking three Academy Awards including Best Director and Best Picture in 1977 for Annie Hall.  Given this Anything Else isn't be for everyone  there are no explosions no martial arts showdowns no superfluous breastbarings no scenes of bestiality or pastryloving. Perhaps not so strangely in fact the studio virtually hid Allen's roles in the film from audiences in previews so that when it hit theaters and I suggested to friends that we go see the new Woody Allen' movie they knew nothing about it  though they had heard of the new Jason BiggsChristina Ricci movie.. But for those who appreciate Woody Allen and intelligent even thoughtprovoking comedy Anything Else is a gem.  The classic Woody Allen staples are of course present the neurotic troubled protagonist the fickle and maddening girlfriend New York..  In fact many of the lines are if not exactly selfplagiarized very very familiar to Allen fans.  Yet somehow Allen  without resorting to gimmicks brings to the same triedandtrue material a freshness that has been lacking.  The dialogue is still snappy and incredulously witty the acting is still anchored in what me?' gestures and stuttering monologues the cinematography is still lush and beautiful the music is still old but then these are the things we love aren't they?  but there are some new twists on some old themes. Allen's character for instance is almost a revelation  though obsessed with the antiSemitism and the Holocaust as all good Woody characters' are he departs from the typical Woody' persona in some striking ways  his disdain for psychoanalysis coming not from overfamiliarity but from conviction his ability to drive a car and to drive it well enough that at no point is driving a joke in the film his desire to leave New York !.. Some have seen in Anything Else a symbolic passing of the torch' from Allen to Biggs whose character is much more the traditional Woody' type than Allen's own here  but these are the same people who see such gestures everywhere.  There certainly was no torch passed to Kenneth Branagh who played the Woody' character in Celebrity and who nailed the mannerisms but not the manner.  The truth is that nobody can take Allen's place and this film only proves it.  Aside from demonstrating that he's still got it' it also reminds me how sorely missed he will one day be  but not for a while yet.  Meanwhile I have more excitement than usual at the prospect of a new Woody Allen film coming soon..".

It argues for loving yourself over loving others because others will only disrespect you anyway. It shows us where complete narcissism can lead in both positive and negative ways. But it is also very funny and intelligent. The writing and direction are poetic and Woody makes good use of Europeanstyle film techniquesthe same sort of stuff Truffaut would still be using if he was still alive. Annie Hall was not the only movie where a character talked to the audience. People who think this is a remake have not seen many other movies apparently. Also there is an important visual moment in this movie that shows that having a connection with another can only last so long. Woody literally freezes that moment and it is very bittersweet. I really liked this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This expertly done film has the marketed trappings of a romantic comedy but as usual the advertising is misleading. Anything Else is not a light romp or a gentle farce like some may expect. This is a dark and funny look at today's selfish chaotic and often violent world. It's about the uncertainty of intention it's about trusting one's instincts over the words and appearances of others and it's about learning to survive on one's own. Woody Allen pulls no punches and follows things through to their inevitable end even allowing his own supporting character to rage blindly and possibly wrongly against the allencompassing hatred he sees everywhere he goes. Soaked in fecund greens New York City stands in for the unknown wild and indifferent jungle with Central Park as its heart. So it is no coincidence that Woody drives a bright red Porsche that roars like an animal and it is particularly apt that the car he demolishes out of rage and a sense of justice is green.Yet the filmmaker allows this kind of paranoia to be suspect. He challenges the fruition of distrusting everyoneeven though in many cases throughout the film the bitterness rejection and anger are warranted.Many critics dismiss Anything Else as old jokes rehashed or even unwatchable. I'm not sure what film they saw. I wanted to go back in the moment it ended. Yes Woody revisits the themes of his previous films. He is an artist. Love and death infidelity and sex are his motifs. Nobody throws out Hitchcock's later films because they were once again about the wrong man or some guy with a crazy mother. This is a cerebral subversive movie. It has its oneliners and its rhythm of performance complete with incredulous stuttering by Jason Biggs and a whiny Christina Ricci as an inscrutable actress. But the film is fresh and strong andas typical of original artcompletely underrated.".

Jerry should have known in the first place to break off the relationship with her but no he has to go along with her game. David's character is a mirror image of the master himself. The storyline of the movie is an exact duplicate of New York life itself it was wellmade the scenery is absolute perfect and the characters of the movie are amazing. I agree with some of the things David says about what's going on in the world. And Jerry ended up going solo to the West Coast because of David's own problems.

Like say a later film of Laurel and Hardy or a later film of Clark Gable this is of interest because it's Woody Allen. It has its charms. The casting is greatbeyond Biggs and Ricci Stockard Channing is hilarious of Ricci's mother and both Jimmy Fallon and Danny DeVito neither of whom I usually like are wellcast in supporting roles. There is a lot of wellwritten literate dialogue. Allen's insights into human nature are occasionally insightful. Allen is actually playing a character that IS NOT COMPLETELY his usual persona.

	schema:reviewBody "Is there anything worse in the movie world than a comedy that is completely unfunny?  If comedy is not accomplished what exactly is the point of the picture?  The end result is a two hour experience that feels like five hours.I'm wondering if this was a bad movie to get introduced to Woody Allen. I've never watched a Woody Allen comedy before and I know he's quite different from other comedic directors but after watching Anything Else I just don't get it.  They were a few chuckles here and there but for the most part the movie was just boring unfunny and depressing a depressing comedy?  What an oxymoron!I just could not relate to the characters at all.  Jason Biggs supposedly plays a comedian who falls in love with Christina Ricci's character.  Both characters are just annoying especially the one played by Christina Ricci. I guess her instability and constant complaining was supposed to be funny. It just dragged the movie on even longer.Two other minor characters played by Jimmy Fallon and Danny DeVito were completely dispensable.  Jimmy Fallon showed up for one scene but is billed on the DVD cover and Danny DeVito's character was just plain annoying as a groveling unsuccessful agent.  Maybe the point of the movie was to create so many annoying characters that we can laugh at them.  Lastly Woody Allen played a character in this movie and he was really the only somewhat bright spot for the whole picture.  He had some funny lines and gave the story a little extra pep but definitely not enough.Overall I'd say this is not a movie for the recreational moviegoer.  I think you have to be a diehard Woody Allen fan to appreciate droning chitchat as comedic gold.  Just give me great fun comedies like Old School or School of Rock any day.My IMDb Rating 210.  My Yahoo! Grade D Truly Awful".
