But those gigs are declining so he jumps at the chance to write a song and record it with reigning teen idol Cora Corman. Trouble is he's good at melodies but needs a lyricist and has less than a week to finish. Enter Sophie Fisher subbing for a friend who waters Alex's plants she's a pretty good poet quick witted and could do it if she'd agree. But there's some sort of shadow over her head that Alex may not be able to charm his way past. And what if they do get a song written what then?";

	schema:reviewBody "Let's face it often we go to the cinema for a bit of inconsequential fun. In case you were in any doubt Music and Lyrics kicks off with an 80sstyle Whamlike video of a band called as 'PoP'. Firmly tongue in retrochic Hugh Grant is Alex Fletcher the washedup hasbeen now playing the nostalgia circuit for middleaged housewives. He meets bubbly Sophie Fisher Drew Barrymore who waters the plants in his apartment but has a knack for writing lyrics. This saves his day when current popdiva princess Cora asks him to write and record a duet with her.Chances are you are now reaching for the vomit bag or saying that maybe sounds like quite a giggle. If you can stomach the idea of Hugh Grant singing his own songs and staging a come back then rest assured this is a very polished and unsubstantial romcom. He and Drew Barrymore propel the movie with energy wit and a warm lovable enthusiasm. While perhaps doing little more than playing new aspects of themselves it is a delightful performance and one backed up with catchy songs a fabulous debut by Haley Bennett Cora and a heartfelt realistic script.Cora is a sort of teenage megastar somewhere between Shakira Britney Spears and a youthful Madonna. Her elaborate stageshows have a 'Buddhism  thong'mysticism and sex philosophy. Here as with Alex and Sophie the echelons of the music world seem realistically portrayed. While the matches seem unbelievable at first by the end of the film we want Hugh and Drew to continue their romance offstage just as with classic romance films of the 30s so by any mainstream yardstick Music and Lyrics is a success. The film is as unpretentious as its two lead actors makes no great claims and satisfies Valentine's Day release requirements with a sincerity that takes it a notch above the average cheese. Casting is spoton even down to Sophie's older and much larger sister who has similar characteristics and mannerisms. It's easy viewing and even contains nothing unsuitable for older children. If you want more sophisticated and substantial fare you probably don't need film reviews to find your way to the nearest arthouse cinema or Oscar blockbuster. But for straight enjoyment Music and Lyrics slides down like a very reasonable glass of rich chardonnay. Silly formulaic but rather well done.".

It's a chick flick. And besides it's got Hugh Grant in it. Those are two really big strikes against it. However and remember my fondness for longshots the movie also casts Drew Barrymore in the other lead role. I couldn't resist.To my complete surprise both actors were excellent and Hugh Grant doesn't have a bad singing voice. To be honest if he and Drew Barrymore wanted to record an album of pop songs I think it could do quite well. Her strength is that she is perky and funny and that compensates for lack of trained vocal talent. Sometimes you DON'T want to hear Barbra Streisand.Here's the quickie plot summary Hugh Grant was in a popular band of the 1980s and now he's reduced to playing for embarrassing venues like shopping malls amusement parks and High School reunions. When a Britney Spearstype singer wants him to write her new single his life changes completely but only due to Drew Barrymore's help.I now judge movies in part by how my European friends would react to them. I have to admit that some American movies are a little corny but this movie passed the test with flying colors. A friend from Slovakia not only loved the movie he insisted on watching the trailers and special scenes.... twice! It was a welcome relief to actually be proud of a Hollywood movie.I now have newfound respect for Hugh Grant and my admiration for Drew Barrymore is higher than ever. She sure has a lot of talent for playing someone with pluck and a little bit of endearing wackiness.".

Since I'm not so familiar with the music industry I enjoyed the behind the scenes with the trial and error of coming up with lyrics at least in the way the movie portrays it.

Cue the dizzy plantgirl do people really have a plantgirl?? Drew Barrymore who can throw lyrics together without a problem. The relationship between Drew and Hugh is built well  especially when you remember that Drew is 31 and Hugh is 47. There's nothing wrong with such a gap I'm simply saying the chemistry is there or they would have looked a little creepy.Haley Bennett plays Cora a BritneyChristinaShakira mishmash who is looking to do a duet with Hugh's character. She is brilliant at the shallow superficial teennymphette and it's a surprise to see that it's her first feature. And check out her costumes! The soundtrack is good fun  pretend 80s songs mix with Cora's modern pop and the HughDrew demo track is nice too. One of the songs sounds a bit like The Whitlams. The spoken section at the very start of the film sounded awful but the rest was fine  maybe the cinema's problem but I was in the Odeon Leicester Square....The editing seemed a tiny bit er clunky at times  scenes cut into each other messily and dialogue at one point seemed to be cut short. It hadn't been but it just sounded that way at the time.I didn't expect to like the film that much  I only went as I fancy Drew to bits and having seen her close up I'm right to! but both my girlfriend and I came out laughing and humming the main song. It's genuinely as good as any other Hugh Grant film and is another great performance from Drew though it doesn't get near Wedding Singer or Doppelganger joking about Doppelganger. It's well worth going to see at the cinema and is a proper feel good romcom. There's no shame in it for us fellas as Drew is nice to look at as is Haley. My girlfriend loved it.".

Hugh grant may have been in his usual role of self depreciating charming English Gent who is living on his past pop star glory but the dialogue and one liners gave his role substance. He more than gave justice to them by his superb timing. Drew Barrimore also fell into the part as a woman who comes to feed the plants and ends up feeding ideas to him for a song in which he cant complete. The acting was spot on the one liners witty but I think it was the music added joy to the film. As he said in the film don't quote me on this but something like  there is nothing like a good song for lifting your spirits in a second. I left this film feeling happy not only for the characters but in myself.!".

I really liked the chemistry between Grant and Barrymore. They played well against each other. I could do without the woman from Third Rock From the Sun. I find that she acts a tad too cartoonish in her showfilms and this one is no exception. Nice to see Brad Garrett in a straight role. I love the fact that actors and actresses are doing their own singing. I like movies that don't stop at the end of the movie but have fun things to watch during the closing credits.

The age gap isn't an issue when you watch the movie because it just seems right that these two characters should get together.What sets Music  Lyrics apart from other romcoms is the music. The music is woven seamlessly into the fabric of the movie. There are three main characters in Music  Lyrics Grant's Alex Barrymore's Sophie and the soundtrack which is enjoyable and deceptively catchy.

It's a little cheesy but who can't resist the sappiness and charm of the film which works thanks to the two irresistible stars and an excellent soundtrack. As a fan of 80's music I know a thing or two about washedup musicians so I enjoyed the film even more. I'm one of those people who believe in this sort of love so I was even more interested. Finally I also love the inside joke this movie makes about modern pop music. Those who like 70's80's music know what I'm talking about.Marc Lawrence's film is about a man named Alex Fletcher who is a hasbeen star of the 80's hit band POP!. When a young famous musician in the style of Lady Gaga asks him to write a song he needs to find a lyricist fast. When he learns how talented his plant lady is with words they become an unexpected pair with an unexpected romance.This film really works because of Hugh Grant's charm and Drew Barrymore's sweetness. I never knew that Grant could sing but does he ever have a good voice! And as usual he is good at being funny. Drew Barrymore has always been a respectable actress and that continues her as the flawed plant girl who is afraid to stand up for herself. Haley Bennett does a good job portraying the typical modern pop star in the vein of Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift.Overall Music and Lyrics is a sweet though unusual romcom. This film is almost like a musical and it works big time. The soundtrack is very catchy and honestly the songs sung in the film will be a good addition to my expansive collection of songs on my Ipod. It's wellwritten which it should be since a good portion of the plot is based around writing. Now this is the kind of smart romcom I want to see on Valentine's Day. I rate this film 910.".

The characters were both lovable the humor especially Alex's quick wit and one liners were clever and funny and in the end the movie was a slightly different but none the less enjoyable love story.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I actually give this a 9.5 and I have ALWAYS been a HUGE Hugh Grant fan. He may not be Jack Nicholson Harrison Ford Richard Gere Morgan Freeman or the ever amazing Liam Neeson or the never disappointing Tom Hanks. But Hugh Grant is the type of actor that makes you feel good is extremely entertaining not to mention SO easy on the eyes. He's believable in any role he plays and he makes everything feel so effortless and can anyone deny his natural sexy charisma and boy charm with spews out humour in the most seamless way. And dear God if he ever get's rid of that accent to take on an American one I'll die. His British accent just sets him right off! OK so that being said about Hugh....he was the perfect pick for this movie. Drew Barrymore whom I also love I grew up with her she's in a class all by herself and really cannot be compared to anyone. She has her own charm and genuine spirit that shines in her eyes and her adorable smile and she brings a light and warmth to anything she is in. She's gorgeous beautiful confident adorable funny and has a sweet voice. No she's not Julia Roberts Sandra Bullock Diane Keaton Susan Sarrondon or Meryl Streep and neither does she have to be. All that being said those two Hugh and Drew were perfectly matched for this type of movie. You couldn't put anyone else together and come out with a better marriage of two characters. If you put anyone else together the movie would have been a huge disappointment and painful to watch. Those two together make it absolutely worth it and a very sweet charming and playful choice that has been on my list of favourites for many years now. PS If nothing else even if you don't particularly care for another music business storyline Be Cool Glitter Crossroads Burlesequeand any other ones I'm forgetting this movie showcases a hidden talent that Hugh and Drew both possess and that alone is worth it. Those two could sing their ABC's and it would still be lovely just like they could both read out the phone book and we'd watch it over and over just because it's Hugh and Drew. Choosing them for Music and Lyrics was definitely genius for such a feel good movie that will have you humming your way back into love and popping your heart at the same time. ".

But in Music and Lyrics I had lots of accompanying laughs! I suggest you see this. It is perfect for your valentine's date...which is conveniently the date of it's arrival in theaters near you! It had us laughing from the very opening scene. And let me tell you Hugh Grant does some amazing dance moves! D I can not wait to go buy the Music and Lyrics soundtrack! I was humming songs from it the rest of the night!";

Kristen Johnston was however the one who stole every single scene she was in a bit like Jack Black did in High Fidelity only she was not quite as good.What's best about Music and Lyrics are the songs though. From the opening number PoP! Goes My Heart a perfect homage to the 80's both visually and acoustically to the hit song Grant and Barrymore are writing during the movie the Soundtrack was catchy and lovable. You won't be able to get those songs out of your head even days after you've left the cinema.Sure Music and Lyrics does have its cringeworthy moments but they're rare. Mostly the story of an 80's hasbeen who gets another shot at both love and fame was realized with a lot of witty dialog and funny scenes. The mild satire on the current pop business as well as 80's nostalgia was dead on and very welcome.Music and Lyrics is a lighthearted romantic comedy that will put a smile on your face the rare case of a chick flick that guys can enjoy too... if you're prepared to sing PoP!

The music is poppy and fun like the film and the message is clear entertainment doesn't need to be Shakespeare to be worth your time.

Initially the notion of watching Hugh Grant in any sort of movie would fill me with deepest fear.However my guard was down one night in popped the DVD and there I found myself hooked.As has often been the notion whenever you have the very beautiful Drew Barrymore in a movie more often than not you would be guaranteed some modicum of entertainment.Just ask Adam Sandler whenever he needed a romantic comedy to fly at the box office a simple call to Drew would more or less bring multiplex cinemas to their collective knees.Beyond anything else that Mr Sandler has made before or since both 'The Wedding Singer'  '50 First Dates' will always rank highly for me as pure romantic comedy entertainment.Perhaps such a notion also entered into the mind of writerdirector Marc Lawrence when it came time to cast this very fine movie.Granted not all of the movies mentioned will have made mega bucks but their legions of fans will have guaranteed that the DVD sales would have wanted similar parings.If we were to be honest Hugh Grant's acting talent is pretty much focused on that one character trait that of the foppish cad and as long as the project suits the actor then the movie will always be given the green light.Now I haven't watched 'Two Weeks Notice' Or 'Miss Congeniality' but during my video shop days both these titles always flew off the shelves.As has been mentioned many times previous writerdirector Marc Lawrence certainly has a way with the written word and this is certainly on display here.Both Hugh Grant  Drew Barrymore work very well together Drew as ever showing that slight glimmer of vulnerability which is always endearing in movie of this type.Couple their performances with the witty script as well as the very excellent soundtrack which I have since purchased and cannot stop playing especially the main track 'Way Back Into Love' this movie in my humble opinion is truly a wonderful experience that really makes you feel spot on inside.The additional performers in the movie also add a touch of class to the proceedings especially Brad Garrett and the very sexy Kristen Johnston.More often than not certain films can withstand the test of time and become true classics of their respective genre okay so this movie might not reach the fevered heights of acclaim of 'Gone With The Wind' or 'The Wizard Of Oz'.However for me this movie could possibly be the 'Citizen Kane' of romantic comedies but the again I'm the guy who loves his horror movies but as my wife often says 'Give it time my love'.My rating for this movie is 1010".

I guess they did in Europe. But so does David Hasselhoff.Hugh Grant is actually a pretty good singer. Way better than Andrew Ridgeley.".

	schema:headline " Minor WAI with interesting commentary on genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Ballata per un pistolero 1967 which I saw under the title Pistoleros at first appears to be a rather unremarkable if decently executed Western alla'italiana. As is the case with most of this genre and perhaps any genre this film is largely a rehearsal of narrative elements form earlier films that proved resonant with audiences. Here story elements from Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy especially For A Few Dollars More 1965 are the sources for most the entire film. However while directorscreenwriteractor Alfio Catalbiano failed to create much emotional resonance with this movie his movie provides an interesting and surprisingly selfconsciousness commentary on the genre and Leone's films in particular which makes this movie of real interest for fans of the genre.Catalbiano was not a very prolific director and this was his first effort which must explain the selfconscious imitation of Leone that is evident through the movie. This awareness of the conventions and phases of the western was nothing new in the WAI in and of itself. The early examples all have a strangely surreal feel to them they are familiar but something is off in the prominence of certain features or their arrangements. Leone Tessari and a few others successfully used this awareness in their ironic rearrangements. Were the focus had previously been on the American western in Catalbiano's case the focus seems to have turned to the WAI itself. This would explain the increasing amount of slapstick as well as the outright commentary on the world created in other films of the time. Along with films like Vado... l'ammazzo e torno 1967 this may mark a turning point from the sincerity if ironic style of the best WAI to the often unwatchable slapstick westerns that came to dominate the genre after Lo chiamavano Trinit 1970.Most of the story is a based on For A few Dollars More with an older mentor character Rocco Anthony Ghidra competingcooperating with a younger man Blackie Angelo Infanti. Costume and style are switched with the younger man in black with a Colonel Mortimer look while the older man is closer to the Man with no name. Catalbiano himself plays an IndioRamon Rojotype character complete with rifle and amoral detachment. Numerous other elements from the final showdown to the Allentown bank robbery all have a suspicious similarity to sequences in FAFDM. The comic barroom brawl in the middle of the movie and the funny prospector Explosion all point to other sources however and are a little out of step with the rest of the plot. However there is a character who bears a little resemblance to the Clint Eastwood of the Dollars films who is repeatedly beaten and outshot in what had to have been a deliberate injoke.Catalbiano made good use of arches depth and lighting in a manner which betrays his reliance on Leone's style. The first sequences in the film also have the flowing camera movements associated with Leone and they help make what might have been an otherwise dull opening into something a little more interesting.The most interesting aspect to the film and one that should have been more fully developed by Catalbiano was the attitude of the older man Rocco to the younger bounty hunter Blackie. It evolves from disgust to curiosity to concern. Both are traveling the same road and this correspondence has the same strange fated quasireligious character of other WAI such as Requiescant 1967 where it was used to great satirical effect. The resolution of this element to the relationship is something of a rejection of the surreal comic cynicism of Leone's first two westerns. This is further emphasized by the continued focus on the 'collateral damage of the violence in the film as at the ranch or the strange street funeral service that Rocco watches. In fact there was a great deal of concern with the bystanders in Leone's westerns especially the later ones but Catalbiano's focus is much more explicit and has to be understood as a reaction to perceptions of the genre. Blackie's first gunfight recalls Mortimer's in FAFDM but the ending is very different very cynical and funny in light of the earlier film.Overall the Ballata per un pistolero is not very emotionally involving but it has several sequences which are definitely popwestern cool. Rocco's first gunfight followed by his use of a piano as a flight of stairs is unexpected and fun. The usual WAI elements are in place complete with the hidden symmetries and Gothic family western distortions which are an important if not often noticed element of the genre. In particular the relationships between fatherson and brotherbrother recurs again and again in these movies. Finally the movie follows the same liminal plot as most WAI with the neardeath and resurrection of the main character Rocco. As in many WAI this involves a literal crucifixion of Rocco on a bizarre spinning target which the outlaws use for guns knives and harpoons In a mine?. For genre fans this film is recommended. Other viewers would probably be not be interested.Top spaghetti western list httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849907Average SWs httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849889For completists only bottom of the barrel httpimdb.commymovieslist?l21849890".

In the main role we find an actor of old Yugoslavia here under the name 'Anthony Guidra' who made a good work as an aging gunman in a hunt against two criminals. By his side goes a young bounty hunter played by Angelo Infanti in an infamous wooden performance and the ending will bring the revelation of a secret between these two different men.Not a great movie to be sure.

	schema:reviewBody "To compare Wild Hogs to comedic greats and classic movies about midlife crisis would be absolutely foolish. Sitting back and enjoying the wild ride is your best choice in getting the full enjoyment out of this flick. Containing a diverse cast that works quite well a handful of funny cameos tons of predictable yet enjoyable scenarios and a rather surprising amount of physical humor Wild Hogs is a startlingly delightful comedy that isn't afraid to reach low for a laugh. Coming off as more than just a guilty pleasure we have good acting running the show as our longtime cinema veterans mesh together and bring out their best comedic skills to deliver a nice trip through the United States.Wild Hogs follows four middleaged men losing excitement among other things in their daily aspects of life. Doug Tim Allen isn't the fun guy he used to be Bobby Martin Lawrence is not able to run his own home Woody John Travolta has lost pretty much everything and Dudley William H. Macy has nothing to begin with. The four of them decide to take their boring lives out for a spin and try to relive the glory days of college ride off in their motorbikes across the country. The main conflict is whether or not they can unleash the Wild Hogs in them and be able to reach California in one piece. The other problem arises when the wellknown tough biker gang Del Fuegos crosses paths with them.The premise is something we've all seen before yet it can still be done well with the right group of people. Mixing John Travolta Martin Lawrence Tim Allen and William H. Macy is something that truly would not and could not have been predicted by anybody. Nonetheless this unique quartet does a fantastic job. Not one actor is overused or overacting and we see each of the actors' talents brought to life. Tim Allen puts his physical humor to the test and succeeds. John Travolta brings his comedic chops and also is shockingly hilarious. Martin Lawrence has his good movies Nothing to Lose and his really bad movies Black Night Big Momma's House 2 but in here he doesn't go too far doesn't attempt too hard and holds his own as the uncertain Bobby. Topping them all is William H. Macy whose physical comedy tops all the others in this movie. Rounding out the cast is an assortment of cameos and short roles that despite being good were quite underused Marisa Tomei Stephen Tobolowsky Ray Liotta John C. McGinley Peter Fonda.The laughs in here are present pretty much throughout the film and it ranges from funny little oneliners to physical comedy to lowbrow comedy to even a bit of absurdity. A bit of it is predictable yet some of it comes flying out of nowhere literally and figuratively. We have a nice bit of cinematography to capture some of it including a nice shot of death taking a liking to William H. Macy and a brilliant game of Bullslapping. The director Walt Becker knows better and lets the camera roll and the actors take control of what is going on. He was fortunate enough to capture the fun and silliness with little effort.We don't have Oscar material in the least bit but we have material that will spark laughing riots from the audience time and time again. Like most decent comedies of this decade its best not to be taken seriously because analyzing and nitpicking would distract from the overall experience. Like what the characters in the film originally wanted it was a trip with no rules no barriers and no remorse. Wild Hogs does just that it was a raw strong PG13 ride with the violence sex profanity and lookaway moments that anyone on the open road would witness. Also supporting this movie is a nice soundtrack cleverly adding some good Southern rock Bon Jovi ACDC and even White Zombie. Try to catch some subtle Disney humor involving the actors and character's names.Bottom Line So what if the script isn't groundbreaking? So what if the direction didn't enhance anything? So what if the story became a bit predictable? We have four veteran actors making fools of themselves for almost two hours on the open road and with very little time in between potential laughs. It was just pure popcorn entertainment and isn't that what you want on a Friday night? Wild Hogs will not inspire you to do something but it will inspire some conversations and maybe even a second viewing. Besides it is rare to see Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence provide a slew of funny moments. While this movie could have benefited from fewer clichs and more unpredictability it stands tall as the first good comedy of 2007.".

I have lately been happy if a movie has at least one good laugh to feel like my admission fee was worth spending. And in today's movie world most movies are one joke wonders. Wild Hogs is a throw back to the days of My Cousin Vinny Airplane and Young Frankenstein. This movie was filled with laughs and good gags. The movie starts off slow and is reminiscent of a couple of failed Tim Allen projects Shaggy Dog and Zoom but after about 15 minutes it shifts gear and becomes a wonderful comedy well worth spending the admission fee.

The film's theme is a roadtrip across America on HarleyDavidson's with leather jackets Wild Hogs is what they call themselves and all the other paraphernalia. The whole movie is littered with stereotypes and clichd characters and plots and this lends an air of predictability to it. Some people might say that it's closer to an animation given the generous helpings of crashes and falls but then I didn't find it to be a putoff because it doesn't pretend to be an action film. You fall you look funny you get back up and story moves on.At the outset I thought that there might be a resemblance to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas with it's concept of two tired guys out to discover the American Dream but it isn't so. The humour is ribtickling at times and mostly slapstick. Among individual performances nobody really steals the screen but the overall chemistry between the Wild Hogs is good. Ray Liotta plays the bad guy with an overdose of menace and Marisa Tomei did a good job of looking pretty. Some of the cinematography is breathtaking but for a road trip across America there was very little of variety in location.I won't advise spending 15 on it in a theater but it'll be a fun watch with friends when the DVD comes out much like how I would judge Eurotrip.".

	schema:headline " Absolute Garbage";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers Wild Hogs was your typical quasifunny movie that flames out at the end. This movie started off decently hovering at least in the 5  6 area of scoring. The first half was decent but was nothing to be proud of. The only funny parts are really in the beginning such as when Macy's computer accidentally goes onto porn. After that the movie started to go downhill a little and still delivered. I can admit that for a movie that has a guy crapping into a plastic bag I did laugh at parts in the beginning. Then the Wild Hogs met the other bikers and it was all over. The freaking explosion in back of them looked like a nuclear bomb. I was hoping that the Del Fuego idiots were being roasted just to get rid of their bad over the top acting. Instead they of course have to come back and torture us some more. After this the movie became dry and boring you will look at the clock every 2 seconds. John Travolta becomes unbelievably annoying and stock characters jump out of the woods like a Vietnamese ambush. In review Wild Hogs was more like a G movie. The Wild West town that they went to was more like a cartoon where Yosemite Sam would jump out and fire his revolvers into the air.Ending  The ending was absolute garbage. It wasn't even remotely interesting and the fact that both of the mens' families found them without even knowing where they were is the same black hole that ate Tim Allen and John Travolta's careers. Of course this is one of those stupid movies where the characters find themselves at the end. Lawrence finds his grapes Tim Allen feels good about himself Travolta's life still sucks and Macy gets the girl who he promptly leaves to never return. Wild Hogs is a horrible movie that should be stuffed into your local incinerator and set to a fast burn.3  10  Somewhat funny but boring in the second half. I wouldn't recommend it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers Wild Hogs was your typical quasifunny movie that flames out at the end. This movie started off decently hovering at least in the 5  6 area of scoring. The first half was decent but was nothing to be proud of. The only funny parts are really in the beginning such as when Macy's computer accidentally goes onto porn. After that the movie started to go downhill a little and still delivered. I can admit that for a movie that has a guy crapping into a plastic bag I did laugh at parts in the beginning. Then the Wild Hogs met the other bikers and it was all over. The freaking explosion in back of them looked like a nuclear bomb. I was hoping that the Del Fuego idiots were being roasted just to get rid of their bad over the top acting. Instead they of course have to come back and torture us some more. After this the movie became dry and boring you will look at the clock every 2 seconds. John Travolta becomes unbelievably annoying and stock characters jump out of the woods like a Vietnamese ambush.

Same goes for my mother who in her laughter accidentally spit soda all over the man in front of her to my 11 year old brother. I would warn you if you are considering taking kids under the age of 8 there is a surprising amount of profanity when i went i thought it was a kids movie and sexual humor. I would say go see it in theaters it is one of the funniest mainstream comedies i have seen in a while.".

The characters portray every stereotype of men in middle age wives that boss them around kids who think they are lame not being allowed to eat anything but lettuce etc etc etc. The script seemed like it was written by a 12 year old and the jokes were very stale and unfunny. The fact that this movie has been 1 in the country for several weeks running only illustrates the lack of anything decent in theaters. The movie did feature a great cast including a few nice cameos but even that couldn't save this film. If you're looking for mindless humor and a predicable script go and see this mess.

	schema:headline " Macy is good but the movie falls flat";
	schema:reviewBody "William H. Macy is the kind of actor who can brighten up just about any film he appears in. He's got a certain charm and likability that he brings to just about every performance. It is perhaps no surprise that Macy is not only the best thing about Wild Hogs but is also the film's sole highlight. I wanted to see his character appear in a better movie. The movie that surrounds the performance is a plot less and pointless exercise in tired slapstick and homophobic humor. Light as a feather and dumb as a brick Wild Hogs flounders about lifelessly whenever Macy isn't on the screen.The paper thin plot which exists simply to hook a series of sight gags and skits onto centers around four lifelong friends who are all suffering different midlife crisis. Doug Tim Allen is a dentist who is losing respect in his preteen son's eyes. Bobby Martin Lawrence has lost respect from everyone in his family and is struggling to find work. Woody John Travolta has just gone through a messy divorce with his model wife and has wound up losing all of his money in the process. And Dudley William H. Macy is a 40yearold virgin who has devoted his whole life to computers and technology and therefore has no idea how to act around women. The four have always had a passion for motorcycles and Woody hatches a plan that they should all just hop on their bikes and explore the open road together. The friends go through a series of misadventures as they try to add some excitement to their dreary lives and ultimately wind up running afoul of a vicious biker gang led by the dangerous Jack Ray Liotta cashing a paycheck in a throwaway role after one of the four guys accidentally blows up the gang's biker bar. Wild Hogs is the kind of movie that the people who design trailers dream about. That's because the movie is simply a series of loosely connected gags and scenes tied together by a loose plot. The trailer can't ruin the plot because there is none to speak of. There isn't a single scene that helps develop the characters or supply us with any real dialogue or emotions. It's just an endless build up of gags that often wind up falling on their face more than hitting their target. The movie relies far too heavily on outdated slapstick where people are hit in the head or fall over so frequently we start waiting for it to happen and we're usually right in our predictions. Equally outdated is the film's numerous unfunny jokes involving gays. There are a number of instances where the four friends find themselves in a situation where they are mistaken for being gay or scenes where the movie simply uses a feminine man for laughs for no reason whatsoever. The film's screenwriter is Brad Copeland who has written many very funny TV shows such as My Name is Earl Arrested Development and NewsRadio. Maybe he got nervous writing his first fulllength screenplay but the humor on display here is far below the quality his TV shows usually possess.Because of the lame and uninspired script the usually talented cast are not able to escape from its banality and wind up becoming victims to it. Tim Allen John Travolta and Martin Lawrence merely disappear into the background not really creating anything resembling a character nor getting any memorable lines. Instead only William H. Macy is able to break through of the clichd geek character he's stuck with and make himself stand out. He makes the character work because of his performance. It's a shame that the movie doesn't give him anything truly interesting to do with that performance. He does have a romantic subplot with a sweet small town waitress Marisa Tomei but the movie forgets to give them a reason to fall in love or anything resembling a real relationship since Tomei's character maybe has four minutes worth of dialogue in the entire film. Likewise Ray Liotta is given very little to work with as the villain but at least he seems to be having fun with the role. Not even a last minute cameo by Peter Fonda earns its laugh because the movie makes the fatal mistake of thinking that the star of Easy Rider playing a legendary biker is funny by itself instead of giving him something actually funny to go along with his role.I have no problem with respectable actors like Macy and Liotta appearing in silly movies like this as long as the film itself is up to their talents. Wild Hogs casts them adrift in an aimless screenplay where they're forced to survive merely on their screen presence alone. They manage to stay afloat but the movie itself sinks faster with each passing uninspired moment. This movie could have been made by anyone and did not need to involve such strong talent. The entire movie itself winds up being a bust even as a buddy road trip comedy as we never truly believe that the four main characters are friends to begin with. They have no real chemistry together and never get to create a strong bond with one another necessary for this kind of film. Wild Hogs seems to just want to make us laugh and show us a good time. If this is true the filmmakers should have rethought their strategy before the actors went before the cameras.".

There was really no point to this film. It's a few funny bits stretched out into a feature length movie. We only get a tiny taste of the protagonists' lives before they set upon their journey so we don't really care nor does the film ever bother to foreshadow what is to become of them when it's over. In the meantime we are expected to sit through lots of tedious dialogue involving midlife crises and speculation on where their lives took those mundane turns. There are also severalmake that WAY TOO MANYreferences which to me were not so much homophobic as just plain well let's call them homostupid.What really ticked me off was that even in a comedy there apparently was a drastic need to have all the characters at some point throw and receive violent punches and somehow show the experience to be rewarding. For those who thought The Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood was a pandering chickflick this is the male version Exhibit A.".

	schema:headline " Much better than most caper films";
	schema:reviewBody "I accidently came upon this film on the Starz Mystery Channel while channel surfing yesterday. I'm so very glad that I did. I found it to be a fast paced suspenseful sometimes humorous caper flick. IMHO the entire cast of International actors is excellent. Telly Savalas and Robert Culp do a great job as two American WW2 military veterans who join forces with an ex German officer nicely played by James Mason to spearhead an attempt to retrieve 6 million in gold ingots hidden beneath a German air raid shelter during the war. To do so they must manage to get a German war criminal out of a top security prison where he is the only prisoner. Then after getting the needed information concerning the whereabouts of the gold from him they must get him back into his cell as if nothing had ever happened. Aldo Ray does a great job as the head noncom of the US contingent guarding the prisoner who fortunately is an old war buddy of Savalas and for a price agrees to aid in the caper. As the plot twists unfold the suspense builds to a very satisfying conclusion. Near the end of the film there is a great scene of an exchange between Savalas as a bogus Army Major and the US Colonel who is in charge of the prison whenever the Americans are on watch. The conversation between Savalas and the Colonel is wonderful. The Colonel is extremely hostile but Savalas bluffs him with a classic conversational style containing a not too subtle threat to inform the proper authorities of the Colonel's noncooperation. I found those few minutes to be priceless. For the most part I found this movie to be free of the cliches that normally are found in a caper film. Also the conclusion of the film is different than that of most other films of this type. If you watch this film I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did.".

A very typical outing from the 1970s  international production and cast location shooting throwaway soundtrack  and thankfully one whose mind is simply set on providing easygoing entertainment often the central premise in this type of film gets lost amid fastidious technique and other showy trimmings  conversely here we get an ingeniouslyplotted if admittedly improbable heist that one's able to follow thus generating the requisite amount of suspense and surprise via a plethora of entertaining twists.The narrative is set in motion by exNazi Concentration Camp Commandant James Mason! paying a visit to one of his former prisoners exAmerican Major Telly Savalas presenting him with a scheme to retrieve a cache' of gold that once belonged to the Fuehrer himself hence the film's subsequent retitling as HITLER'S GOLD the catch is that the only one still alive who knows its whereabouts is a Nazi war criminal undergoing life imprisonment in a West German fortress! Thankfully though Savalas happens to be chummy with one of the American sergeants on duty there Aldo Ray  and he brings along for the ride explosives expert Robert Culp. Along the way they recruit a whole slew of other associates from one of the soldiers in charge of the original transportation to a female nurse  who eventually hitches up with Culp  to a homosexual doctor  played by Adrian Hoven  to a Russian officer based in East Germany  where it transpires the gold is located which makes one wonder just how much they'd actually be making individually of the proposed loot of 6 million! The elaborate plan involves the exNazi official being drugged and replaced by Hoven for a day  while our heroes having turned a vacated building into a simulacra of the Nazi headquarters circa 1944 complete with the exdriver now impersonating Hitler! try to nudge his memory bank about the coveted gold cache'. As I said the turnofevents see them crossing over to East Germany dressed as American officers and with the help of the aforementioned Russian they evacuate the building which now stands on the site where the gold is hidden so that they work at their leisure to recover it. Unsurprisingly with so much money at stake and so many fingers in the proverbial pot the number is reduced when the German soldier loses his nerve and the Russian becomes too greedy for his own good. At long last the Nazi is placed back in his cell and the gang can take a deep sigh of relief again typical of the time in which the film was made they manage to get away with itGripping packed with incident but essentially lighthearted with the actors clearly enjoying themselves and good to look at the cinematography is by the renowned  and Sam Peckinpah regular  John Coquillon the film emerges as the perfect antidote to one's dreary work routine and the equally inconvenient summer heat.".

The momentum is maintained right up to the very end. The characterisation is unusually original each character having distinctive quirks with the exception that the German plotter is portrayed somewhat stereotypically as entirely lacking a sense of humour or remorse. The dialogue is sharp and witty with special effects relegated to a minimum making a welcome change from the 1990s films which can be overreliant on such devices. For those with an interest in retrochic the 1970s clothes  cars will add a further pleasure. Also of interest is the depiction of Berlin at the height of its Cold War division.

	schema:reviewBody "Former German officer Ernst Furben comes to American wideboy Harry Morgan with a story of stolen Nazi gold that has been hidden somewhere. The only man who actually knows where it is hidden is one Reinhard Holtz who unfortunately is being held in prison for the rest of his life. Employing the services of Sly Wells Aldo Ray and Hans Schmidt Harry comes up with a plan to break Holtz out of the maximum security prison get the location and recover the gold for themselves.The plot summary makes it sound like a great caper movie with elements of Kelly's Heroes thrown in its tongue in its cheek and a nice twisty plot. However from the faltering first steps with a clumsy flashback setup the film fails to really ignite and although parts are enjoyable and toformula it has too many bits thrown in that slow it down. The best bits are the parts where they must execute their plan and often it is so ludicrous that you have no option but to go along with it. These bits just about provide the caper feel that I was expecting but other times it takes itself too seriously and limits the sheer sense of fun that things like this need to survive.This isn't helped by the visual style of the whole thing  or rather lack of style. Parts of it look like it has been shot in an English northern town in the 1970's and to the eye it comes over as rather dull and dead. The horrible use of music is a real downer as well. Problems associated with the period perhaps but the overall impression is that the film generally lacked effort. On paper the cast seems to suggest that this is not true but in practice the lacklustre collection of performances just enforces the impression. Savalas just about turns up and although he is a solid enough presence to almost get away with it you can't help but feel like he is just taking the money and running. Mason is just as poor and turns in a rather dull performance that is far down the list in terms of his career. Culp is soso Ray is OK and the fact that Meisner stuck in my mind was probably more to do with the lack of competition as opposed to him being any good himself.Overall then a fairly dull caper movie that will do little for fans of the genre or even those looking for entertainment. The plot is OK in parts but it generally lacks the fun and energy such a film needs to get by. It looks quite cheap and generally the impression given is a film made without a lot of effort or imagination which is probably a fair summary of it all told.".

Parts of it look like it has been shot in an English northern town in the 1970's and to the eye it comes over as rather dull and dead. The horrible use of music is a real downer as well. Problems associated with the period perhaps but the overall impression is that the film generally lacked effort. On paper the cast seems to suggest that this is not true but in practice the lacklustre collection of performances just enforces the impression. Savalas just about turns up and although he is a solid enough presence to almost get away with it you can't help but feel like he is just taking the money and running. Mason is just as poor and turns in a rather dull performance that is far down the list in terms of his career. Culp is soso Ray is OK and the fact that Meisner stuck in my mind was probably more to do with the lack of competition as opposed to him being any good himself.Overall then a fairly dull caper movie that will do little for fans of the genre or even those looking for entertainment. The plot is OK in parts but it generally lacks the fun and energy such a film needs to get by. It looks quite cheap and generally the impression given is a film made without a lot of effort or imagination which is probably a fair summary of it all told.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mord ist mein Geschft Liebling or Killing Is My Business Honey is a German comedy movie from 7 years ago. The cast includes quite a few famous actors at least here in Germany and this does not only include Rick Kavanian and Nora Tschirner who play the main characters. The most spectacular inclusions are surely Franco Nero in a very small role and Bud Spencer in a slightly bigger role two acting legends in their own right when it comes to Italian cinema. And even if the cast does not really include any really Italian actors then there are many German actors playing Italians. The reason is that the entire movie is about organized crime and Mafia. But it is still a comedy which poses a challenge to writer and director Sebastian Niemann that is almost impossible to master. Crime and comedy is a mixup that is extremely difficult to succeed and it apparently needs a more gifted filmmaker than Niemann to make it work. By the way I found the Erdinger promo in there really unfunny repetitive and embarrassing. I wonder how much they paid for every ringtone we had to listen to.And apart from the crime and comedy there is also a fair share of romance in here. So it was definitely a great challenge but the outcome is fairly disappointing. Kavanian brings nothing really to the role that exceeds the expected mediocrity and Tschirner who I usually like felt over the top on too many occasions. It was also a bit cringeworthy how they tried to include her usual goofiness and clumsiness even if it did not fit the character at all. I cannot really blame them for the crimerelated stuff as they decided to pick the safe route and not make this a violent or really aggressive movie in terms of depth when it comes to the mafia. But the negative deal breaker for the film is the failed attempt at comedy from start to finish. I was almost never laughing and it's not a short film by any means almost makes it to 110 minutes. Sure it was nice to see Spencer who I really love but his character also offered nothing and it basically felt only included because they got him to play the part. All in all as you know by now I did not like this one. Thumbs down and I do not recommend checking it out. The only thing I liked here was the music the songs and of course this was not even an original aspect of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rasputin and the Empress shouldn't be used as a lesson of preSoviet Russia. Names have been changed and that didn't prevent MGM from law suits and a lot of the information we now know about this period of Russian history  was not known in 1932.As other people have commented about this being the only film that Ethel John and Lionel Barrymore appeared together this movie doesn't show why the Barrymores have the reputation that they have. John Barrymore's career started going downhill after the introduction of sound. Lionel Barrymore wearing one of the phoniest fake beards tries to capture the charisma and sense of control that Rasputin had over Czarina Alexandra and the Czarevitch. Ethel Barrymore gives an understated performance  too understated at times. When her only son seems to be close to possible death she doesn't seem all that bothered.C. Henry Gordon is a great Grand Duke Igor Ralph Morgan is a convincing Czar Nicholas II but they don't appear that frequently. Don't expect anyone to speak with a Russian accent or even attempting and accent.Rasputin is one of the most interesting people in the world during the early 20th Century. He was also one of the most enigmatic and contradictory. A holy man who was accused of raping a nun excessive drinking and being power hungry. Barrymore's portrayal of Rasputin plays this up plus making claims that he will be Russia. He seems almost like Charles Manson at times in the way he can make someone especially the Czarevitch behave like they are totally different people compared to the way they acted before meeting Rasputin.It is best to watch this movie as just that  a fictional representation of various accounts of what happened in the royal court of Russia in its final days. The writers included Charles MacArthur Ben Hecht Robert Sherwood Mercedes de Acosta and Lenore Coffee  some of the best writers of the period.It's worth a view  don't expect historical accuracy but it is an interesting film that tries to show a much different world than what Americans would have known.".

Lionel Barrymore wearing one of the phoniest fake beards tries to capture the charisma and sense of control that Rasputin had over Czarina Alexandra and the Czarevitch. Ethel Barrymore gives an understated performance  too understated at times. When her only son seems to be close to possible death she doesn't seem all that bothered.C. Henry Gordon is a great Grand Duke Igor Ralph Morgan is a convincing Czar Nicholas II but they don't appear that frequently. Don't expect anyone to speak with a Russian accent or even attempting and accent.Rasputin is one of the most interesting people in the world during the early 20th Century. He was also one of the most enigmatic and contradictory. A holy man who was accused of raping a nun excessive drinking and being power hungry. Barrymore's portrayal of Rasputin plays this up plus making claims that he will be Russia. He seems almost like Charles Manson at times in the way he can make someone especially the Czarevitch behave like they are totally different people compared to the way they acted before meeting Rasputin.It is best to watch this movie as just that  a fictional representation of various accounts of what happened in the royal court of Russia in its final days. The writers included Charles MacArthur Ben Hecht Robert Sherwood Mercedes de Acosta and Lenore Coffee  some of the best writers of the period.It's worth a view  don't expect historical accuracy but it is an interesting film that tries to show a much different world than what Americans would have known.";

	schema:reviewBody "By now everyone  but everyone  has commented on what bad history this movie is. Fine I won't argue the point. But what about it as drama? In my opinion this is one of the most powerful tales of tragedy of it's time.  This is particularly noteworthy given MGM's later penchant for frivolousness.  Part of it has do do with the sincerity and conviction of the story.  Alhough Charles MacArtur and others are given credit for the screenplay I believe the original story  I have read a copy of the book  was written by a Russian migr who fled the revolution. Unfortunately I am presently unable to locate my copy.  Nonetheless this would go a long way towards explaining the movie's passion. As for the acting it features an outstanding cast including the three Barrymores as well as an assemblage of first rate supporting actors of the time.  Anyone notice Edwarld Arnold as Dr. Remezov?  Of course much of it seems dated by today's standards.  This was 1932 after all.  Keep in mind that this is high melodrama. In that context Lionel Barrymore exudes pure evil as the scheming mad monk. He also brings out the crudity and vulgarity of the man which generally jibes with historical accounts. Just try not to dwell on the fake beard. John is fine and properly earnest as Prince Chegodieff although his performance does seem a bit oldfashioned next to Lionel's. He really lets it all hang out in the murder scene however. Ethel seems a trifle stiff but Ralph Morgan is just right as Nicholas. In fact sincerity and seriousness of purpose seem to be the hallmarks of the entire ensemble. And through it all there is this sense of tragic inevitability of events that once set in motion cannot be reversed.One other thing that warrants a mention is the music. The Russian Orthodox liturgical music used in the celebratory scene near the beginning is moving and powerful. It could well put one in mind of the the wedding scene in Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter  1978 . Later there is a medley of martial music accompanied by historical footage as Russia mobilizes for The Great War. Here we hear God Save the Tsar a tune which Mikhail Glinka featured in his opera A Life for the Tsar but which was routinely banned during Soviet performances. All in all exciting stuff. This is a movie well worth watching historical accuracy notwithstanding.".

More truth than humor there.John's drinking and self destruction from same are well known. Lionel was on all kinds of pain killing medication which Louis B. Mayer kept him supplied with in return for being the fifth column of management whenever his contract players started getting ideas. For Ethel however this was her first venture into sound films and she was one who took the title of First Lady of the American Theater quite seriously with all the royal prerogatives of same.Somehow this retelling of the last days of the Romanovs did get made and in it Lionel Barrymore who had the most colorful part of the film takes the acting honors. His Rasputin the malevolent monk who held sway over the Tsar and Tsarina because of his ability to control the symptoms of the Tsaretch's hemophilia is a classic study in evil. Ethel is properly regal and John is the noble prince who eventually does something about the curse over the Romanovs though too late.Rasputin was bad enough in history though here the writers went a bit overboard. There's no accusation against him of having designs on the royal princesses yet we see Lionel casting a lascivious eye on the Princess Anastasia.Though the name was changed for the film the real assassin of Rasputin Prince Felix Yousapov did sue MGM and collect a bundle from them. Personally I think he robbed the lion studio because if anything John Barrymore's portrayal was far more noble than Yousapov was in real life. To add insult to injury though another guy with the name of Chegodieff which was John's name in the film also sued MGM and claimed he was defamed and won.The biggest historical error I find though was the fact that Rasputin was urging Tsar Nicholas to enter World War I. In fact the opposite was the case. Speaking of the Tsar he's played here as the nebbish he was in real life by Ralph Morgan.For reasons I don't understand the film did not end with Rasputin's demise. Dramatically speaking it should have. But the film continued on until the execution of the royal family by the Bolsheviks. No proper dramatic foundation was laid for that event. There is some mention of revolution in the air but nothing in the story suggests what will take place.Rasputin and the Empress is bad history and mediocre drama. But it is a chance to see the Barrymore siblings all in the same film and shouldn't be missed for that.".

What I didn't expect is how weird it would be to watch a film in which John Barrymore is the shining hero and Lionel Barrymore is a truly diabolical villain and each are spectacularly convincing in their portrayals. Lionel is really the center of attention here as he plays the evil Rasputin whose ability to sidestep assassination attempts is legendary and here a few logical explanations are given to some of his alleged abilities.

In fact Nicholas was autocratic in his outlook and distrusted any attempt to give the people more say in their government. This sets up one of the great ironic struggles in the film  that of aristocrat Prince Paul Chegodieff John Barrymore wanting more for the peasants in the way of both bread and democracy and that of peasant mystic Rasputin Lionel Barrymore saying that it was God's will that the peasants were poor and powerless.

In fact one of the things that turned the Russian people against the royal family  besides the fact that they were starving during WWI  was that the people assumed that Rasputin's hold over the empress was because they were lovers. The Romanovs did not want it to be known that the only son in the family and heir to the throne had a serious disease  in this case hemophilia  that kept him in very delicate health and would likely lead to a greatly shortened lifespan. They felt it would leave them vulnerable to the overthrowing of their rule. Ironically hiding the truth and leaving Rasputin's relationship to the empress unexplained also led to exactly that.Watch this one for the high production values and compelling performances by the members of Hollywood's royal family during its golden age but as for a Russian history lesson look elsewhere.".

Lionel Barrymore was a very good actor but for reasons I will explain his performance was way overwrought and overdone. The part called for him to play Rasputin as if he had the cunning and the outright intelligence to maneuver state heads to do his bidding. The movie was made in 1932 which was just 15 years from the actual Russian Revolution and so the people that made the movie really did not know what we know now. Even so the actual facts of the death of Rasputin were known and to my mind the truth was far more dramatic than the way this movie portrayed Rasputin's killing. Even then they knew that The Empress never did figure out what a scoundrel Rasputin was whereas in the movie she finally sees through him and calls on John Barrymore to save the throne by getting rid of him. I guess MGM wanted Ethel and John Barrymore to seem heroic. Knowing what we know now just makes Lionel's performance of Rasputin seem completely off the mark and throws the whole movie out of whack.".

The acting is more than a bit overdone a carryover perhaps from the silent days when double takes and facial quirks had to tell the story. Rasputin's death is inaccurate. He was probably not poisoned at all as an ascetic he did not eat sweets poisoned or otherwise and he was shot several times not hit over the head with a poker. And the deaths of the Romanovs was not outside in a courtyard but in a closed dingy cellar. Their doctor died with themhe didn't escape to London. However in defense of the screenwriter many of the details of the RasputinRomanov disaster were unknown until after the fall of the Soviet Union. Several books published since including photographs of Rasputin's dead body for example do much to fill out the real story.".

	onyx:emotionText "While this film may be of interest to film purists because of the three Barrymores together for the only time the movie is lousy history. The acting is more than a bit overdone a carryover perhaps from the silent days when double takes and facial quirks had to tell the story. Rasputin's death is inaccurate. He was probably not poisoned at all as an ascetic he did not eat sweets poisoned or otherwise and he was shot several times not hit over the head with a poker. And the deaths of the Romanovs was not outside in a courtyard but in a closed dingy cellar. Their doctor died with themhe didn't escape to London. However in defense of the screenwriter many of the details of the RasputinRomanov disaster were unknown until after the fall of the Soviet Union. Several books published since including photographs of Rasputin's dead body for example do much to fill out the real story.";

Certainly Lionel is the biggest ham looking like Alec Guinness in Oliver Twist and rolling his eyes laughing maniacally and all but twirling his cape as the contemptible goingmad Rasputin. By contrast Ethel is stately as the Empress Alexandra but also rather uninteresting mainly emphasizing womanly dignity and reserve as she so often did. Often she and Diana Wynyard seem to be in a contest to see who can employ a more highfalutin pronunciation style. So it falls to John to give the best performance He's comparatively naturalistic and understated and seems most comfortable in front of a camera. The director Richard Boleslawski goes in for needlessly arty compositions and drags out the playing time and Herbert Stothart the composer seems the hardest worker so much Russianclich music and so loud. Charles MacArthur's screenplay is literate but wordy and inaccurate and resulted in an expensive lawsuit against MGM. But as a distillation of the Barrymore acting style in miniature it's a valuable artifact and pretty entertaining on its own terms.".

	schema:headline " The great Barrymores portray a fascinating piece of history";
	schema:reviewBody "Rasputin and the Empress belongs in any good collection of movies for three reasons. First it is the only movie with all three siblings of the great stage and screen family of Barrymore. Second it is a reasonable portrayal with facts and fiction of the last years of the Russian czars and the infamous Rasputin. And third the film production is excellent. The acting by the entire cast is first rate. The sets capture the splendor of the place and the turmoil of the time. The filming is superb under Polishborn director Richard Boleslawski as Boleslavsky who studied at the Moscow Art Theater. And the plot and screenplay tell an interesting and bizarre story. Ethel Barrymore plays the Czarina Alexandra wife of Czar Nicholas II ruler of Russia. John Barrymore plays a fictitious character Prince Chegodleff. His role is based on the real Prince Felix Yusupov. Lionel Barrymore has the largest role. He plays the diabolical Grigori Rasputin the mad monk who mesmerized the Romanov family their last three years. His influence may have altered the history of Russia. It doubtless contributed to the end of the Romanov rule after three centuries. The detailed history of the time and events covered by this film makes fascinating reading. This movie was made just 14 years after the execution of the Czar and his family by the Bolsheviks in July of 1918. The film follows closely the events of the Romanovs and Rasputin from 1914 to1918. It begins with the arrival of Rasputin as a healer of the young Alexei who was a hemophiliac. Rasputin wasn't a religious monk but had a reputation as a mystical faith healer. After Alexei's recovery Rasputin's influence with the royal family grew especially through the Czarina. In time his power was so great that some considered him the ruler of Russia. The film captures this situation very well. It also shows the royal family's faithful adherence to the Orthodox Church. In Hollywood fashion and of necessity for the film's length and subject matter much of the earliest years of the reign of Nicholas II is condensed into no more than some general references about the past. Nicholas was a timid man and a weak ruler with no stomach for governance. After he ascended the throne in 1896 he and Alexandra enjoyed a period of favor with the populace. They were well liked as rulers. But the czar's poor skills of leadership in time led to many problems. He soon lost face with the people. And when Rasputin came on the scene public distrust further fanned the flames of rebellion. Besides the Barrymores the film has a number of other fine actors. Ralph Morgan plays the weak Czar Nicholas perfectly. Diana Wynyard is superb as Natasha whose character was based on Irina Yusupov. Edward Arnold plays Doctor Remezov. C. Henry Gordon is the Grand Duke Igor. And Tad Alexander is The Czarevitch. Again this is a fine film on all accounts. In 1917 there were 65 members in the Romanov dynasty. The Bolshevik's killed 18 of them and the 47 remaining either fled Russia or were exiled. Most went to Western Europe. A number of movies have been made about pretenders to the Romanov line. Sometimes those ruses were for prestige but more often they were efforts to lay claim to some of the jewels of Russia. In 1934 Princess Irina Alexandrovna sued MGM in London over this film. She was a niece of Czar Nicholas and the wife of Prince Felix Yusupov who is the person who killed Rasputin. Earlier MGM made some changes and deleted some scenes. But the princess still took issue with the fictitious character that John Barrymore plays. She also said that Rasputin didn't urge the Czar to go to war with Germany. Another matter of contention was the death of Rasputin. The film shows the gathering at the Molka Palace which took place. But in the end it shows Barrymore's character dragging Rasputin's body to the river and pushing him under the ice. In the February 28 1934 court case in London Prince Yusupov testified on the killing. When Rasputin disclosed what he was doing for Germany I determined that he must die in the interests of Russia. I secured poison from a doctor and accompanied Rasputin to the cellar where I gave him poisoned cakes and wine and shot him. He revived whereupon another man thrice shot him but not fatally. I then battered him to death with a loaded stick. Three friends removed the body and threw it in the river. I was arrested next morning and the Tsar banished me. Other evidence in time found that the men who disposed of Rasputin's body threw him from a bridge into the river. This trial account under a dateline London appeared in the Brisbane Australia CourierMail newspaper of March 2 1934 page 15. Princess Yusupov won some damages for libel in England and MGM settled with her out of court in the U.S. That apparently led to the standard disclaimer now used for most films based on fiction All characters appearing in this work are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons living or dead is purely coincidental. Several reviewers have said this film is very bad history. Perhaps some are reading too much into it. The film covers less than four years in time and mostly focuses on the Romanov family and Rasputin. A lot about the previous years is condensed in a couple of general observations as noted above. But for the usual Hollywood license in writing for screenplay dialog this film portrays well the events and subjects it encompasses.".

Saving her son the monk soon finds himself gaining power inside the government but this doesn't sit well with Prince Chegodieff John who will stop at nothing to prove the monk is mad. Apparently MGM was sued due to how inaccurate the story is here so if you want a history lesson you should go read a book but if you want to see all three Barrymore's together then this is the only film out there that will suit you. The film should have been a lot better than it is but the thing drags at several points and I'm sure fifteen or so minutes could have been trimmed from the 123minute running time although apparently the film ran longer when originally released. The performances aren't what you'd expect but it's certainly fun seeing the three Barrymore's working together. Lionel actually goes way over the top which is something you'd expect from John but he actually manages to be quite calm and cool throughout the film. John certainly gives the best performance but it's Lionel who steals the film with his fake beard and over the top antics. Ethel is good in her role as is the supporting work from Ralph Morgan. The costumes and set design are wonderful and I really enjoyed the made up ending which contains some pretty strong violence.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie commences in March 1913 amid festivities including the Russian Orthodox ritual the tercentenary 300th anniversary of the Romanov rule in Russia. Foreign dignitaries attend including Archduke Francis Ferdinand of AustriaHungary. The Archduke was destined to be assassinated by a Serbian national in June 1914 an event that would trigger World War I. The ceremony is interrupted by news of Prince Paul Chegodieff John Barrymore that Sergei the czar's uncle and brother of Grand Duke Igor C. Henry Gordon and the father of Princess Natasha Diana Wynyard has been assassinated. The czar Ralph Morgan orders the suspects to be shot immediately without trial. Chegodieff urges moderation he is also concerned about negative publicity.Three months later the Czarevitch Alyosha Tad Alexander the young son of Czar Nicholas II and a hemophiliac suffers from a bleeding attack. His life is in danger his vital signs are posted for public viewing. Enter Grigory Rasputin Lionel Barrymore not a priest but a hypnotist and mystic. As he does a better job than the court doctors and appears to heal the boy  at least the symptoms of hemophilia  he gains the favor of Czarina Alexandra Ethel Barrymore. Because his status rises he has influence over high appointments even when the candidate is incompetent. Rasputin happens to enjoy the company of younger women. Paul dislikes this crude and vulgar eccentric and refers to him as a charlatan a Holy Leech. Rasputin in turn develops extreme megalomania I will be Russia he utters. He urges the czar to continue his mobilization and stand up to the German Kaiser and defend Serbia even if these actions lead to war. As usual Chegodieff urges moderation. The film is inaccurate here as Rasputin in real life urged Nicholas not to go to war in 1914. Not only are wars ruinous in lives and property but the peasants who are armed may not want to turn in their weapons at war's end. These points concerning the First World War are not really covered by the film. In the movie Rasputin loses the favor of the czarina during the war a situation that never happened as she backed him to the end. In the film Rasputin has maintained his favor with Czar Nicholas who eventually dismisses his rival Chegodieff from his military rank. Meanwhile Nicholas has taken over personal command of the Russian armies. The final twentyfive minutes focus on the end of Rasputin 1916 and the removal of the czar the following year. The liquidation of the czar's family subsequently occurred at Ekaterinburg by the Bolshevists 1918. Although the film is fairly accurate about the monk's demise note that Rasputin's actual death also came as a result of several gunshot wounds. The cyanidepoisoned Tobolsk cakes apparently had little effect. Unlike the film's premise in real life Rasputin accepted the fateful invitation of his rival to attend the party on 30 December 1916. Although the movie shows the food riots and dissatisfaction of the populace some stock footage of actual events it fails to go into detail concerning the fate of the czar's family. Such particulars would include Russia's defeat and withdrawal from the war 1917 and the subsequent civil war fighting between the Reds and Whites. There is another inaccuracy specifically when the movie earlier implies that the Duma legislative assembly was being formed in 1913. Actually the Duma was formed in 1906 following the disastrous defeat of the Russians in the RussoJapanese War and the Russian revolution of 1905. On the other hand it is certainly true that people could purchase Rasputin's favor and gain appointments to high office without regard to their qualifications. In the beginning film credits the cast listing claims that Chegodieff Natasha Grand Duke Igor and Doctor Remezov are fictional characters but historians will recognize Chegodieff as Prince Feliks Yusupov one of Rasputin's assassins Natasha as Princess Irina Yusupov's wife and Grand Duke Igor as Grand Duke Nicholas not the same man as the czar. In real life Prince Feliks Yusupov took offense and in 1934 brought a libel lawsuit against MGM the film's producers. He won his case. Rasputin and the Empress is the only film that features together the three Barrymores Lionel Ethyl and John. They do well enough that is in 1930s acting mode. Lionel although a decade older than Rasputin when the mystic flourished captures the coarseness of the infamous and enigmatic character and his impact in Russia's royal court. John's portrayal of the assassin Chegodieff is sympathetic as one who earnestly wants to save Russia from the unpopular eccentric. As for Ethyl this was her inroad into talkies. Ralph Morgan adequately conveys Czar Nicholas' lack of resolution and astuteness. The costumes and sets are of high quality the plot is easily followed and maintains interest.".

I almost halfexpected Greta Garbo to show up in this somewhere. I was disappointed she did not.";

	schema:reviewBody "DER RUF  THE LAST ILLUSION1949 100 min. dir. Josef von Bky Mnchhausen starring Fritz Kortner Lina Carstens English subtitlesA review by Dr Deena PadayacheeRecently I saw this groundbreaking honest courageous film which examines German attitudes after the country had been defeated and occupied in 1945. A Jewish professor who has been hounded out of his job at a German university during the Hitler era is invited back to lecture. His first lecture is about Plato and Virtue. He has returned to a state that had incinerated around 6 million of his fellow Jews but he has personal reasons for returning. In his inaugural lecture he does not hold back about the lack of virtue of the Hitler regime and the need for virtue now. There are so many interesting parallels with our own country South Africa. Many of us did not know the true nature of those who had imposed Apartheid with such zeal and who had tried so desperately to prolong the life of that vicious system by supporting it 'on the border' and in every way possible. They had benefited very greatly from those racist policies and they had been schooled to think of us as inferior ignorant and backward. Many of them did not suddenly change after 1994 and become civilised whether they were professors journalists judges or lawyers. Many are still convinced that how they were and how they are is correct and the only way to be.The laws may have changed but many of them certainly have not.That is what this German film depicts and it makes your blood go cold as you realise just how difficult it is to educate human beings whether they are Nazis or Americans who killed Vietnamese peasants by the thousand or South Africans who enjoyed being racist bosses under Apartheid.The film is very intelligently scripted and is in my opinion a masterpiece. In South Africa many pretend that suddenly the old racists are all non racist 'liberals' but often just a little interaction reveals something very cruel and vile underneath. They are just very good at creating an often wellmannered chimera that fools many people.South Africa has not yet produced such a film and I doubt that it will be made in the foreseeable future as the old racists still control so much in that industry. They still manage to produce films set during the Apartheid era which don't show Apartheid in anything approaching the ugliness of that brutal era. Sometimes not even one Europeans Only sign is shown on a beach!This is not a film which most of those who control the moviehire stores will be in any hurry to acquire. As expected the film was and is not celebrated in the media or in Germany but it was flighted at Cannes.It is through great films like this one that one will gradually acquire an understanding about what this planet we dwell on is really all about. The 'Free West' goes to very great lengths to ensure that they continue to occupy the moral high ground. They continue to sit in judgement of us and they continually highlight the shortcomings of our leaders while they themselves conceal and indeed cloak many important aspects of their unsavoury past and pretend to be civilised today. Most of us are duped.It must have taken great courage and indeed an almost reckless bravado to flight a film like this one to millions of Germans who had fought with everything they had to preserve the Nazi regime. It's amazing that the film was made at all.".

	schema:headline " One most inventive and original films to grace the silver screen";
	schema:reviewBody "Delicatessen is hard to pin down under a specific genre label it's a surreal black comedy a human drama a postapocalyptic horror movie a twisted thriller a futuristic fantasy and all in all one of the strangest and most original films I've ever seen. In this fantasy world the world has been ravaged and food is now in short supply. This has therefore made food invaluable and it is being used as currency. Things are traded for with grain corn and lentils but not everyone can afford the luxury of food and some have had to resort to cannibalism to continue to enjoy eating. Our scene opens at a delicatessen in an unspecified location in France and we are treated to an absolutely delicious sequence no pun intended in which a man is desperately trying to hide himself in the trash can. We later find that the reason for this is that this particular delicatessen hires handymen and keeps them long enough to fatten them up and then they are eaten by the delicatessen's butcher and the inhabitants of the apartment building in which they live. The story really gets going when an exclown turns up at the shop wanting the handyman's job which has...become available. The plot thickens when the new handyman meets and later falls in love with the butcher's daughter Julie. Julie knows what goes on at the delicatessen and can't allow her new found love to meet the same fate as the others and therefore does the only thing she can do hire a band of vegetarian freedom fighters to save her love from becoming dinner for the butcher and his customers.Delicatessen is directed by the team of Marc Caro whom I'm afraid I am unfamiliar with and the more well known JeanPierre Jeunet director of a few lesser known modern classics but best known for the enthusiastic 'Amelie'. The film is brought to life by a brilliant ensemble cast. Dominique Pinon who also featured in Jeunet's Amelie Alien 4 and City of Lost Children takes the lead role of the clown turned handyman. His performance is both understated and magical as he simultaneously manages to entice the viewer into his performance and yet keeps his character in the realms of reality a place in which this film doesn't take place. JeanClaude Dreyfus is the real star of the show however as the extroverted and over the top butcher. His performance certainly isn't subdued to say the least and every moment that he is on screen is a delight. In a stark contrast to Dreyfus MarieLaure Dougnac the young lady that plays his daughter and love interest for Pinon is very down to earth and is the most 'normal' character in the film...although there's still room for her to be a nearly blind klutz. The rest of the ensemble comes together excellently and not a single actor in the film performs below par or looks out of place and there's not many films that you can say that for.This film isn't quite like anything else I've ever seen. In fact the only film I can think of that is similar to this is Terry Gilliam's futuristic fantasy Brazil. The film draws it's originality from it's plot mainly which is extremely surreal and inventive in itself but it's not just that which makes Delicatessen one of a kind it's all the smaller plot points. How many films do you know that feature a bullshit detector? that is set off when the butcher tells it that life is wonderful no less. The way that the film looks is also wonderfully different Delicatessen has a yellow hue which lends it a style that is very dull and dreary and that does the film no end of favours when you consider it's core subject material. The yellow hue also makes the film almost feel like a moving comic book which is one of the things that gives the film it's surreal and absurd edge. I'm a big fan of atmospheric films which is one of the main reasons why I like horror so much and this film also has an atmosphere like no other. It's the way that the yellowish buildings look next to the dark skyline and the way that the film uses darkness and smoke to make it more horrifying see roof sequence towards the end that gives this film the finishing touch to it's already distinct style.The love story in the film is sweet and tender and this very much offsets the dark overtones of the rest of the film. This is nice as during the scenes between the clown Pinon and Julie Dougnac the film allows itself to indulge in humour that isn't dark like the rest of the film and you get the impression that it's enjoying itself a little more. This is just another thing in a long line of great things that make Delicatessen a great movie. Another of these things is the more minor characters. I have never seen a more motley crew than the one in this film. As previously mentioned Julie although not entirely 'normal' is the most normal character in the film the rest of it is populated by lunatics. There's a man with a house full of frogs a woman that continually tries to commit suicide a man that puts cans on his deaf mother in law so they know where she is etc. The support cast's wackiness don't add anything much to the story itself which only really requires them to be there but the fact that they are different and imaginative is another of the film's absurd edges and another thing that makes this film different from everything else. Delicatessen concentrates more on being absurd and surreal than it does in posing deep and philosophical questions. Personally I have no problem with that but those who do want a movie to be deep and meaningful might find the film disappointing because of that. That is not to say that the film completely lacks depth or meaning although a moral to the story doesn't seem to present itself the film takes it's depth from the 'what if' scenario that it presents if the world's food supply became too short to feed the population would you resort to cannibalism or join the vegetarian freedom fighters?. It's a very general message but it's definitely there.Overall Delicatessen is a sublime piece of cinema. You wont find imagination and inventiveness to the extent that it is shown here in most films and that alone is reason enough to warrant this classic status. Delicatessen is everything I say it is and more and overall the film is one of the true highlights of the 1990's. A gem.".

	schema:headline " Perfect for My Tastes";
	schema:reviewBody "Clapet JeanClaude Dreyfus is a butcher who runs the generically named Delicatessen housed in a bombedout looking apartment building filled to the brim with eccentrics. Since food is scarce in the film's world Clapet has devised a scheme to provide himself and his tenants with a regular supply of meathe runs ads in the local paper for handymen and after they fix a few things on the building they become the main course. When the film begins we see a man who tries unsuccessfully to escape. The bulk of the film is the story of Stan Luison Dominique Pinon who is the latest person to answer Clapet's advertisement.This film is definitely an acquired taste so to speak. I've acquired the taste and for me it's a 10 out of 10. Delicatessen is set in a weird postapocalyptic alternate universe that is not entirely dissimilar to the setting of Terry Gilliam's Brazil 1985in fact this could very easily be the same world as Brazil just that that film is situated in its titular locale and this would be a less fashionable section of France. Like Brazil most of the production designthe costumes music television programming etc.suggests an historic setting say about the 1940s but it also seems to be set in the future or at least an alternate present.In place of Brazil's elaborate chaotic technology directors Marc Caro and JeanPierre Jeunet have created a multileveled Rube Goldberg construction. Goldberg was an American cartoonist and sculptor known for drawings of incredibly complex contraptions that often performed simple tasks. This recurs from small scalesthe interconnected tubes in the building and the uses of the Australian to medium scalesAurore Interligator's Silvie Laguna attempted suicide setups to the grand scale of the film where each character or set of characters is interlocking in different ways that has a small but complex causal effect on the whole. Sometimes these concatenations are more simultaneous than causal as in the ingenious bedspring symphony near the beginning of the film.Appropriate to its ultimate subject matter the visuals are focused on decay and dinginess. The delicatessen is filthy and the apartment building is falling apart. The tenants own a lot of broken things and for those things that aren't broken there's a good chance they'll get broken as the film progresses. And by the way if you love the production design and atmosphere of the film and wouldn't mind seeing something with a similar mood but serious instead of a surrealistic black comedy like Delicatessen check out David Cronenberg's Spider 2002.All the tenants have various eccentricities often involving food. One of the most interesting tenants is an old man who decided to harvest his own meals by turning his apartment into a swamp via regularly running water flooding the apartment and inhabited by frogs and snails. He has a huge pile of empty snail shells stacking up in a corner. Water is a motif in the filmprobably because of its relationship to food as a means of necessary nourishment although ironically in a world characterized by food shortages water is mostly wasted in the film.While not a depressing film it wasn't to me at least although not that I dislike depressing films Delicatessen isn't exactly uplifting either although there is a message of hope at the end I suppose. It's definitely not for all audiences but if you're a fan of Gilliam Cronenberg David Lynch and similar directors you should definitely try a meal at this Delicatessen.".

	onyx:emotionText "Clapet JeanClaude Dreyfus is a butcher who runs the generically named Delicatessen housed in a bombedout looking apartment building filled to the brim with eccentrics. Since food is scarce in the film's world Clapet has devised a scheme to provide himself and his tenants with a regular supply of meathe runs ads in the local paper for handymen and after they fix a few things on the building they become the main course. When the film begins we see a man who tries unsuccessfully to escape. The bulk of the film is the story of Stan Luison Dominique Pinon who is the latest person to answer Clapet's advertisement.This film is definitely an acquired taste so to speak. I've acquired the taste and for me it's a 10 out of 10. Delicatessen is set in a weird postapocalyptic alternate universe that is not entirely dissimilar to the setting of Terry Gilliam's Brazil 1985in fact this could very easily be the same world as Brazil just that that film is situated in its titular locale and this would be a less fashionable section of France. Like Brazil most of the production designthe costumes music television programming etc.suggests an historic setting say about the 1940s but it also seems to be set in the future or at least an alternate present.In place of Brazil's elaborate chaotic technology directors Marc Caro and JeanPierre Jeunet have created a multileveled Rube Goldberg construction. Goldberg was an American cartoonist and sculptor known for drawings of incredibly complex contraptions that often performed simple tasks. This recurs from small scalesthe interconnected tubes in the building and the uses of the Australian to medium scalesAurore Interligator's Silvie Laguna attempted suicide setups to the grand scale of the film where each character or set of characters is interlocking in different ways that has a small but complex causal effect on the whole. Sometimes these concatenations are more simultaneous than causal as in the ingenious bedspring symphony near the beginning of the film.Appropriate to its ultimate subject matter the visuals are focused on decay and dinginess. The delicatessen is filthy and the apartment building is falling apart. The tenants own a lot of broken things and for those things that aren't broken there's a good chance they'll get broken as the film progresses. And by the way if you love the production design and atmosphere of the film and wouldn't mind seeing something with a similar mood but serious instead of a surrealistic black comedy like Delicatessen check out David Cronenberg's Spider 2002.All the tenants have various eccentricities often involving food. One of the most interesting tenants is an old man who decided to harvest his own meals by turning his apartment into a swamp via regularly running water flooding the apartment and inhabited by frogs and snails. He has a huge pile of empty snail shells stacking up in a corner. Water is a motif in the filmprobably because of its relationship to food as a means of necessary nourishment although ironically in a world characterized by food shortages water is mostly wasted in the film.While not a depressing film it wasn't to me at least although not that I dislike depressing films Delicatessen isn't exactly uplifting either although there is a message of hope at the end I suppose. It's definitely not for all audiences but if you're a fan of Gilliam Cronenberg David Lynch and similar directors you should definitely try a meal at this Delicatessen.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Delicatessen' is a very original comedy from JeanPierre Jeunet who also directed the great 'Amlie'. It tells the story of Louison Dominique Pinon who is the new helper of a landlord named Clapet JeanClaude Dreyfus. Clapet is a butcher and in a world where food is rare he prepares cannibalistic meals for the people in his building. Louison is the new meal and the people in the building wait for Clapet to kill him so they can eat. Clapet's daughter Julie MarieLaure Dougnac falls in love with Louison and to save him she seeks help from an underground group.You have read the above and you must understand 'Delicatessen' is not a normal movie. Although its subject is close to very scary the movie is a comedy and to be honest it is very funny at times. Listen to the way people talk here. Especially the conversation between the butcher and a mailman is very funny. The underground group gets a lot of laughs as well. The movie hints at real horror images but never gives us that. Most of the time the tension is broken with something funny.'Delicatessen' is not only pretty funny it looks terrific as well. From the great opening sequence to the last shot it is visually perfect. The production design and especially the cinematography add a lot to the movie's whole atmosphere. May be it is not for everyone some will find it ridiculous or the idea too lugubrious may be it is but the way the subject is handled is the right way. At least it is interesting and therefore already worth seeing.".

Similarly the butcher is most apologetic when he accidentally chops off the foot of one of his clients who has paid his rent in full.Into this hellish world is placed someone with his moral values relatively intact.

	schema:reviewBody "In the late 70s french director JeanPierre Jeunet and designer Marc Caro met and found they shared a lot of interests in the visual arts their friendship soon became an artistic team that would spent the whole 80s making short films where the duo was able to explore and master the cinema language perfecting their storytelling abilities and visual design skills preparing themselves to make a career in filmmaking. Their efforts were crowned in 1991 when they were finally able to take their craft to a full feature length film in the project that would become their breakthrough in the film industry and the proper beginning of their careers as filmmakers the postapocalyptic comedy Delicatessen.The world of Delicatessen is a dark bleak France where there is apparently no law and food is incredibly sparse and is now used as currency. In this postapocalyptic world the residents of an apartment building in the middle of nowhere have found a solution to the hunger thanks to their landlord the butcher Clapet JeanClaude Dreyfus who from time to time kills the building's handyman to feed the bizarre group of tenants. One day former clown Louison Dominique Pinon arrives to the building and gets the handyman position but unfortunately for Clapet and the other tenants the butcher's daughter Julie MarieLaure Dougnac has fallen in love with Louison and will do whatever is necessary to stop the madness of the delicatessen.Written by Gilles Adrien who also wrote many of the previous Jeunet  Caro shorts as well as Jeunet  Caro themselves Delicatessen is a wonderfully imaginative tale of sweet romance and hilarious black comedy that gives an unexpected lighthearted twist to a plot that most writers would treat as a serious subject matter. And surprisingly it works as while the story is anything but complex the assortment of strange yet very human characters that populate the world of Delicatessen truly become the movie's soul. And not only the main characters as every single one of them no matter how small the role is is highly detailed and serves a specific function as if the whole building was one of the odd machines that still work in this postapocalyptic portrait of France.Visually the film is simply sublime. Since the directors decided to divide responsibilities Marc Caro took full control of the production design and the artistic elements of the movie so with this freedom Caro's inventive artistic vision reaches new heights creating a movie that could be described as a moving canvas. Highly atmospheric the french duo takes the cinematography by Darius Khondji to the next level mixing techniques and showing a whole range of influences that go from German Expressionism to 40s modernism resulting in one of the most beautiful looking movies ever done. Still the movie is more than a visual fest as Jeunet in charge of guiding the actors shows a complete domain over his cast  crew keeping the many elements of the film working nicely in the right place.As written above the characters are the film's soul and the ensemble of actors playing them really made a terrific job in the film. Dominique Pinon who would become one of Jeunet's regular collaborators delivers a subtle and charming performance as the exclown Louison. He is very believable in the role and gives the character a very human touch essential for the kind of character he is playing. The same can be said of MarieLaure Dougnac who plays Louison's love interest Julie one of the more normal characters in the movie. JeanClaude Dreyfus as Clapet the Butcher is simply delightful as the story's villian and basically every member of the cast delivers an unforgettable performance no matter how long or short is their screen time Silvie Laguna for example is really wonderful.Delicatessen is a solid debut by this two skillful french artists and it already shows why the two quickly became an important team in the French fantasy cinema. Their very own brand of surrealist fantasy flows freely through the film making a unique visual fest although it definitely goes a bit overthetop at times and while it doesn't reach the artistic level of their followup the 1995 classic La Cit Des Enfants Perdus it's still a nicely done movie that most importantly never gets boring or tiresome. Unlike their later films Delicatessen may not be for everyone as it's mix of black comedy and surreal fantasy may seem at times too close to absurd to be enjoyable. However those with a taste for the bizarre will find a great movie in this French comedy.While Delicatessen still shows the excess of the young and raw talent of Jeunet  Caro it's not hard to see why they became known worldwide after this initial success as this movie shows the enormous potential of their skills as filmmakers. This brilliant mixture of genres is definitely a very recommended movie and like La Cit Des Enfants Perdus City of the Lost Children an essential film of the 90s. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a French movie by the director JeanPierre Jeunet and somebody else. Jeunet recently did Alien Resurrection but that movie is nothing like this one. Delicatessen appears to be a rather lowbudget movie. It has no great special effects or dazzling cinematography but it is brilliant nonetheless.Delicatessen is about an apartment block in a postapocalyptic Earth. At the bottom of this apartment block is a delicatessen where the butcher sells human meat and he gets this meat from the people that live in the building. Then a nice man named Louisan comes to the apartment for a job and falls in love with the butcher's daughter Julie. The problem is that Louisan is the next person on the list to be cut up and sold.This movie comes under the classification of foreign movie. There is nothing deep and insightful in it other than the barbarity of man. That is in a time where there is no food humanity will resort to cannibalism to survive. What makes this movie unique though is the characters. The French seem to excel in making brilliant characters. Where the Americans will put serious characters in silly situations the French put silly characters in serious situations. My favourite is when the trogs kidnapped the wrong woman and then have an argument as to whether she is male or not. Then they realise she is not male so run off leaving her tied up. One then comes back unties her kisses her and says that's in case I don't come back Okay you might not think its that funny but the movie is. American movies tend to have the problem of having the first ten minutes hilarious and then the rest of it is ordinary. The French movies start rather ordinary and the comedy tends to last. It usually is because the characters are just so well done and they remain in character right through.Delicatessen is just great if you want to see a decent comedy. It is French and it is much better than a lot of American movies I have seen.".

I say this by way of introduction to the French movie Delicatessen because frankly most French movies really bite.  They have that bottom of the birdcage quality which comes from trying too hard to be deep and philosophical coming off as ineffably silly instead. Delicatessen avoids all of that because it doesn't try to be serious. There's nothing pretentious about it.  But it could be.  It's an outrageously funny black comedy.  Only the French with the penchant for speaking wisely and acting foolishly could have pulled this off.  It's almost a satirical caricature of French society as a whole. Set in an apartment complex with a ground floor delicatessen drifters check in but don't check out  that is until a former circus clown shows up. The owner's daughter and the erstwhile circus performer fall in love throwing her father's brutally perfected supply system' fresh meat all out of whack.  The process' it seems cannot tolerate exceptions to the rule especially not such impractical sentiments as love. Delicatessen has some outrageously comical setups.  And best of all the inhabitants are all laughable each in their own way from the murderous landlord to his delicate little daughter named Julie.

	schema:reviewBody "Almost from the start with the closeups of fat faces in very strange expressions I sensed that I had seen the style elsewhere. Then I realized that this movie reminded me of Amelie. Sure enough it is the same director although this was made about a decade earlier. Amelie is one of my favorite movies not just for the story but also for the unique imagery. This movie shares that unique visual style but in a more grotesque fashion. Faces are shown in closeup that border on nightmarish. Colors and atmosphere meld to form a bleak murky misty and dreary filmscape. It is at once charming and horrifying. One of my favorite scenes is when Louison Dominique Pinon is blowing bubbles in the hallway. The two mischievous boys or young rascals played by Boban Janevski and Mikael Todde are immediately entranced and Louison is spared from any future harassment from them. Indeed at one point they save his life with their mischief on others. Another of my favorite scenes is when Louison and Juliet MarieLoure Dougnat are playing a duet she on the cello he on the saw?!. Together with the music it was a magic moment. In fact whenever Louison is shown clowning around the music is soft and whimsical. Another wonderful moment is when Louison and the Butcher's lover Karin Viard are unintentionally playing a song from squeaky mattress springs. In another scene she and Louison are dancing in his apartment. It looks well enough until you notice that Louison has 3 legs giving new meaning to having 2 left feet. These delightful moments are a stark contrast to the rest of the film. I guess I should expound on what the movie is about. Louison is an out of work clown whose partner has been eaten. He tries to get a job as a handyman for a butcher JeanClaude Dreyfus who is also a tenement owner. The butcher sizes him up and is not sure he will do. He thinks Louison is a bit too scrawny. However Louison's luggage is all over the street so he gets the job just to clear the way. It would have been better had he not because in an earlier scene you see someone hiding in a trash can and then getting butchered as the screen goes black. That someone was the last handyman. This movie is set in a post apocalyptic future where food is scarce and indeed grain has become currency. The world has become divided between those that live underground and still use grain as food instead of currency and those that hoard grain and eat... well anything else they can get their hands on except grain. I don't think I've ever seen a blacker comedy than this but if you enjoyed Amelie I think you will also like this movie.".

Jeunet's films are a feast of color and sound where almost every character is memorable in hisher own way.The plot is simple but why complain?

Relax and let your eyes and ears be dazzled by this offbeat comic romance.";

Everything in this movie is so fresh and unpredictable and new and fantastic and there is even a beautiful love story incorporated!  Delicatessen differs so much from today's Hollywood movies which all are filmed in similar fashion. I have picked this one from one of the Best off SF list and I am glad I have watched it. I don't have much time to spend and I tend to preselect movie on which one I will spend two hours of my time.European movies are so interesting and rich in comparison with US films and I don't get how is possible that people still watch low quality stuff when there are masterworks like this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Envision a postapocalyptic world where all but a few sunbeams are blocked out by thick clouds. Most animals and plants have either perished or were claimed by the upper part of the food chain. All currencies have lost their value after all you'd spoil you stomach eating them. Instead the status of money has been replaced by small sacks of corn. Meanwhile the poor are starving. In a French suburb a butcher JeanClaude Dreyfus has made a merit of the people's necessity. Zealously he accumulates hoards of treasures by providing his tenants with meat. Human meat that is. Under the pretence of offering a janitor's job he slyly lures strangers into his house until finally turning them into profitable delicatessen. His next victim is already under way Louison Dominique Pinon a former circus performer arrives shortly after his predecessor has ultimately moved out. Little does he know of the neighbours' cannibalistic intentions and his grave danger! Luckily he forms a tender friendship with Julie MarieLaure Dougnac the murderous butcher's rebellious vegetarian daughter. When she is trying to save goodhearted Louison's life matters get out of hand and not unexpectedly resort to total chaos. Sounds gloomy doesn't it? But Delicatessen is neither a horrific dystopia nor a social experiment. In fact Marc Caro has created a dark futuristic environment for portraying tremendously comic characters surrounded by the most amusing of oddities. In one scene a tenant tries to pay his debts by offering the landlord a ratattracting whistle and gets gruffly refused because the bothersome rodents are already extinct. The droll idea itself that an immensely survivable species such as rats whose uncontrollable numbers could not even be reduced by the most drastic of measures has been eradicated by sheer human appetite put a grin on my face. There are dozens of similar hilarities of unmatched creativity both big and small at which I couldn't help but smile at. The film is filled to the brim with originality and blackhumoured knowingness about life and what else? love. JeanPierre Jeunet adds his touch with quirky cinematography setting a surrealistic mood which is charmingly emphasized by a fitting score. Being a comedy Delicatessen provides little of philosophical value and does hardly preach on the deficiencies of human nature. Only sympathetic Louison offers an optimistic theory something like There are no bad people just bad circumstances. Or they just don't know what they are doing. Of course they know perfectly well. Hence all the fun.".

The film itself is undoubtedly outstanding in its artistic individuality with Jeunet and Caro creating a masterpiece which is praised by film critics and viewers alike.Throughout the film the lavish use of colour and various shot types are what make the film such a wonder to watch. Jeunet uses alternative camera angles to create a somewhat obscure feeling whilst watching. The use of angles is especially what makes us feel like we are not only watching a movie but that we are becoming part of Jeunet and Caro's wondrous creation.The humour is somewhat bizarre but is still presented to us in a way which can be appreciated audiences especially with Aurores various attempts at suicide and the distinguishing ways in which characters are filmed and presented. The overall plot itself contains some form of humour boy meets girl and girl's father tries to use him for meat this all being set in an apocalyptic future. To me that does not sound like a typical romantic comedy giving the film an element of as I have already stated individuality but it also makes it quite charming.The overall film itself is very unconventional especially with all the cinematic stylistic techniques and the individual touches added by the directors. However although I am able to appreciate this film in all its cinematic beauty I still find that I am unable to say that I am greatly fond of it. Yes I think that it is a work of art by Jeunet and Caro and Yes I think that it's highly appealing to some but I do not find the overall idea of the film that interesting. I would watch it again to be left in awe of the way it was made but I don't think I would watch it as a form of entertainment.

Just when he's leaving Ireland to work in a highly reputed London hospital witnessing gross abuse of commoners changes his mind. he returns and joins the local IRA brigade commanded by his brother Teddy and adopts the merciless logic of civil war while Teddy mellows by experiencing firsthand endless suffering. When IRA leaders negotiate an autonomous Free State under the British crown Teddy defends the pragmatic best possible deal at this stage.

	schema:headline " One of Loach's best";
	schema:reviewBody "The remarkably low rating that this film has so far received 4.1 as of Thursday 8th of June is indicative of its ability to raise the hackles of people who haven't even seen it. How can it be otherwise when the film has not yet been released? 135 people have voted have all of these 135 people actually watched the film? Of course not. They're just voting on the basis of their perceptions or assumptions concerning its political agenda. IMDb voters are not alone in this already Simon Heffer in The Daily Telegraph Dominic Lawson in The Independent Ruth DudleyEdwards in The Daily Mail and Michael Gove in The Times are attacking a film they haven't seen by their own admission. These attacks are the predictable reaction of empire apologists unable to abide the depiction of the dark and brutal underside of that imperial machine or the suggestion that anyone on the receiving end of that brutality might be justified in rebelling against it. The title of DudleyEdward's lazy hackjob says it all really 'Why does Ken Loach loathe his country?' Loach is a traitor and must be punished the rotter.It's a pity that this political controversy seems poised to overwhelm discussion of the film because it's an extremely able piece of cinema and deserves to be seen as such. Barry Ackroyd's cinematography is superb ably capturing the beauty of the Irish countryside without indulging in it. We are rooted in a locale without being lavished with pretty pictures. The acting is also excellent. The charismatic Cillian Murphy carries the movie but the support from Liam Cunningham Orla Fitzgerald Aidan O'Hare and Padraic Delaney is also commendable.But it's the collaboration between Loach and his scriptwriter Paul Laverty that makes the film something like a masterpiece. The grim progress from the murder of an Irish youth to the growth of an armed I.R.A. campaign with its attendant violence shown in stark and horrifying detail is expertly managed the only letup comes not far from the end after the signing of the 1921 peace treaty. Loach tries to show the brief jubilation and relief that ensues but in terms of momentum almost drops the ball. The pace is reestablished in time for the inexorable tragic denouement and the film's final emotional impact is considerable. The load is occasionally lightened by the odd touch of Loach's characteristic wry comedy such as the belligerence of the opening hurling game the teenage messageboy who loses his message the melodramatic pianist accompanying the newsreel announcing the momentous news of the creation of the Free State.One of the most disturbing scenes occurs when a group of I.R.A. men return from a successful battle and discover a farmhouse being attacked and destroyed by a group of British soldiers. The rebels who have no ammunition left are forced to look on concealed in the bushes they watch powerless as the farmhouse's inhabitants are abused. We watch along with the characters just as helpless as they are. Why do we watch? Do we want to intervene to play the hero and save the day? Do we perhaps enjoy it? The trouble with many socalled antiwar films as Loach has said is that they outwardly condemn the violence while at the same time encouraging intentionally or not a vicarious pleasure in the thrill of it all. We want to take part we imagine how we would behave in such circumstances of course we usually imagine ourselves behaving with impeccable bravery and surviving to fight another day. This scene rather than placing us in the thick of the action forces us to occupy the position of impotent bystander. Perhaps this is what being a filmgoer is all about powerless voyeurism. As we watch the country tear itself apart in civil war manipulated by a devious and callous colonial master this point becomes all the more pertinent. A quietly devastating film.".

	schema:headline " Great film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a truly great film and well deserving of the Palm D'Or.It has been said that it is pro IRA or IRA propaganda. I disagree. In fact I think the reverse is the case. It shows up both the brutality of war and the even greater brutality of civil war that sets nation against nation and brother against brother. The film provides an understanding of how Ireland became independent in 19201921. It is well documented e.g. visit the BBC or CAIN websites that the Black and Tans were a brutal and oppressive irregular force sent to put down the rebellion. The IRA reacted with similar brutality. The film records both with equally graphic scenes. But that is only the first half of the film. The second half deals with the civil war. That's even more tragic and brutal.Who was on the right side or the wrong side? The film presents the arguments but I really don't think the film takes sides. More of the anti British and anti treaty argument is advanced. But this is understandable because it is historically accurate that West Cost was ferociously anti British and mainly anti treaty. That's why Michael Collins was destined to die there. And it is more important to understand why peoplenations go to war or civil war rather than why they don't.Understanding the reasons does not mean support for war. The film highlights the futility and awfulness of war. Misery destruction and death. Is there such a thing as a just war apart from 2nd World war? Aside from the historical debate the story filming and acting is magnificent. Much better than the Green Berets on the just war by USA in Vietnam! Blackhawk Down brilliantly covered Somalia from the external US perspective. This film brilliantly covers the 192021 wars from the Irish perspective. We need all perspectives.Well worth seeing with an open mind. Then read the history if you want.".

	schema:reviewBody "An admirer of Ken Loach's unique style of film making I say this is the best I've seen. His direction and techniques are now so finely tuned they sit almost subliminally behind a brutal but superlative story set in 1920s Ireland. I say 'almost' because I came out knowing I've never seen a film like this ever before thanks to Loach.Approach it as if you are about to watch a play. Listen intently to the dialogue complete with Cork accents depicting beautiful people forced into situations where they cross lines they cannot return over. Share in their juxtaposition of feelings of remorse with acts of warselfpreservation. In the horror of it all you might wish to be able to suspend disbelief in the fictional sense but that'll be replaced with the overwhelming sense of truth and a notsolongago reality. The individuals could be you or I at anytime and we take solace in the fact that perhaps we are among the lucky ones to have escaped this. Make space then to contemplate if as a nation we still effect this turmoil on others today. Remain with the story though. You feel as if you are there smelling the turf in the air privileged to be on the doorstep of the thatched residence that witnessed so many tragedies.The character portrayals are mesmerising as Loach maximises body language hesitancy fear stuttering and small moments of humour in his realistic approach. You already know each character before she speaks. But when they do speak you are in the room with them agreeing or disagreeing  ready to pitch in if the moment were to present itself. As each personal struggle is revealed you again feel fortunate to have witnessed it. Simultaneously you feel relieved to be able to pull out and watch from a distance when more horror action scenes unfold.This is true drama seeking no false gratification akin to other current films. Unstinting in its portrayal of the Brutish not a spelling mistake it is nevertheless universally significant and local at the same time. The photography is exquisite capturing timeless Ireland. The sound plays the noises of the times so well the viewers could imagine the scenes with their eyes closed.As a Scot I am dismayed at the general poor responsereviews of the British press and I'm reminded that the British psyche has to learn to come to terms with its recent past. I wish that today we could transcend that and promote this film to ordinary people as an important film to see at some point in their lives. In future any young adult asking me about the 'Irish problem'  I'll simply lend them my own personal DVD of this film and say watch this! It'll make it all the more easier for all of us to see the past and to avoid repeating it.".

Events such as the treatment of the local population at the brutal hands of the infamous convict drafted Black and tans force have all been recorded assiduously by both sides in the conflict.

I have a personal history with the subject matter as I come from a family from both sides of the political divide in Ireland. A stigma that exists to this day but is reflected so profoundly with this film. Ken Loach's direction is crisp and perfect. The performances are each and every one incredibly believable and achingly visceral in the depiction of the conflicts of civil war. Cillian Murphy is wonderful and quite possibly the best Irish actor ever. Pdraic Delaney as his brother and enemy takes the role and makes it one of the best male performances I've seen. It is rare when a film allows you to understand both sides of a violent divide so clearly. The Wind that Shakes the Barley does this with blinding perfection. This film is a template for what film makers can achieve with a small budget dedicated performers and a timeless topic.Some who find this so provocative need to look further into their own loyalties to determine why the truth bothers them so much. Those who feel this to be Republican propaganda  and for you Americans I mean Irish Republican  need seriously to investigate their own history. It doesn't surprise me that so many British people know nothing of their countries colonizing tactics in Ireland and elsewhere in the world. Six counties of Ireland still remain under British control. The sacrifices made 80 years ago still resonate today but the Republic of Ireland is now the third richest country in Europe. The question still debated is Was it Worth it? The question we ask is how's Scotland and Wales doing?".

There are other instances of large and small neighbours with a common language Germany and Austria USA and Canada Australia and New Zealand but nowhere is the penetration of the larger nation's media into the neighbouring market as pronounced as it is in Ireland. Viewership of UK TV stations and readership of UK owned newspapers in Ireland is at a level that makes them as significant to our view of the world as our own media.

Nothing could be further from the truth however as has been graphically illustrated by the reception given in Britain to Ken Loach's Palme d'or winning movie The Wind that Shakes the Barley. There is no question that this film makes the British forces look bad but of course the reality as all Irish people know is that they were. In the UK normally reasonable and intelligent reviewers and commentators cannot cope with this depiction of occupying British forces as violent repressors of a largely defenceless native population. It has been described as unbalanced and portraying the valiant British soldiers in an unfair and unflattering light. The truth is that the vast majority of British citizens couldn't tell you where Galway is and why should they? They're ignorance of their own colonial past so close to home and denial of it shouldn't surprise us it is not something to be proud of. This is not to attack Britain but to remind Irish readers of UK newspapers and viewers of UK television that Britain is indeed a foreign country. They view the world through an entirely different perspective than us and in truth our views are inconsequential to them. That's why Loach's film which tells essential truths will not get a general release in the UK. Despite the fact that AngloIrish relations are probably better now than they have ever been the truth about Britain's history in Ireland is something that they just aren't ready for and probably never will be.".

Somehow finding the stomach for the acts he commits Damien follows his brother Teddy in the field fighting side by side with one common aim. However as some form of progress is made the brothers and the movement find themselves splitting onto different conflicting roads.Let me deal with the big complaint first  that this is a proIRA proterrorist film. Those making this argument in a strong way tend to be like myself and be from a Protestant background or at least have more knowledge of that side of the argument Conversely those that claim that it is just a fair piece of history with no bias would tend to be the reverse. The truth is somewhere in the middle because while the film is not supporting or totally justifying the IRA and terrorism it does certainly excuse their actions to a point. Those who cannot see this are perhaps a bit too close or a bit too remote from the material  imagine the same film with Iraqi insurgents replacing the Irish and the USA replacing the British and you'll perhaps understand more why it is a touchy subject.By having all the British be brutal but yet showing Damien killing because it is somehow the right thing to do Loach cannot be surprised by such accusations? However this is not to say that the film is all that biased because it does generally show the civil war as just as bad and just as pointlessly bloody it is just a shame that it doesn't judge one side as harshly as it does the other  so when the Irish start killing their own it is shown as something they hate as opposed to all the British who actively enjoy doing it. It does still seem to condemn the violence of the land but I must admit hoping for more from Loach  perhaps not a totally even hand because that is not what history tells us this was but perhaps more depth that doesn't appear to put everything at the feet of the British. One could also question the aim of Loach in making this film late last year at a time when the Northern Ireland peace process was still on the edge of disaster although in fairness anytime in the last decade one could say the same.As director Loach doesn't quite manage to produce the natural tone that is his style when he is on his game. However the performances are still pretty solid even if the characters do tend to be slanted towards being sympathetic. Murphy is perhaps the most guilty of this and this was a problem even though his cool presence is welcome here. Delaney works better as his brother mainly because the material doesn't give him as easy a ride. The support cast are mostly solid enough although I do have a confession to make here and now. Despite being from Northern Ireland I did have to put the subtitles on while watching it  not for every line but for sufficient difficult accents to make it worth doing. Given that I should have had more of a chance that say American viewers this is probably worth baring in mind for the casual viewer.Overall then this is a solid enough historical piece that does a soso job of showing the violence and pointless bloodshed of the period and place. Although it is not a glory piece for the IRA it does slant rather towards the Republicans as the good guys which was disappointing from Loach  not because I think the British are the good guys they are not but because anyone who knows the situation knows that one side is as bad as the other and it would have been nice for Loach to scale down the slightly romanticised view of his freedom fighters here.".

Throughout it fails to establish the characters as people you care about and the climax of the film with the episode between the brothers ought to be very moving. Because no proper relationship is established between them throughout the film the ending leaves the audience feeling nothing. Far too much time was spent on showing the brutality of the 'Black and Tans'. We quickly get the message that they were violent abusive thugs within the first twenty minutes. The rest of the time could have been more usefully spent on developing character and focussing on the far more interesting premise of the division of opinion and consequent violence between the Irish themselves as a result of the treaty to form the Free State. Instead we get an hour and a half of rabid screaming thuggery from the British and about half an hour to look at a vast and far reaching aspect of Irish history in the fight that pits brother against brother. A conflict of such bitter brutality needs to be shown in its full horror and I'm afraid that the deaths looked more like something from a village hall play in the way that they were sanitised. Not a drop of blood from anyone who is shot!. This could have been a wonderful film the cast authenticity of locations etc... seemed very good. Unfortunately I felt that it was oddly cold and lacking in emotional involvement. It added nothing to my knowledge of Irish history of the period. I am not an apologist for British behaviour in Ireland over the centuries. I am the son of Irish migrants and was bornbrought up in England. I do however feel that the time spent on showing how villainous the British were was way out of proportion and overshadowed what could have been a story of great courage and bravery played out against the odds.".

Second after the men came in from the ambush they were fed at the farmhouse eating from round bowls. I never saw such a dish in use in Ireland until people started going to Spain on their holidays in the 1960's.

	schema:reviewBody "A mainstream cinema film on the Irish conflict has been a rarity up until now and with good reason. I can't help but feel that this film had it been released ten or even five years ago would have either compounded people's anger or been used for political capital. Now with the troubles dwindling to an end with the IRA more or less finished and with the issue well out of the general news the coast was more or less clear to release a film about Ireland in the early twenties. That said the fact that only thirty cinemas wished to show it in the UK due to its political content conveys the fact that many still perceive the situation as tentative. This is the wrong stance to take in my opinion. Films such as these show that the Brits and the Irish consider these days to be history and that they are not afraid to talk about what went on. Being overly sensitive as to what people might feel hampers a long and complicated recovery process.The film opens with a display of the brutal Black and Tan occupation. Even if you're a die hard nationalistic Brit you can't help but feel for the Irish men and women and what they went through. A game of Gaelic football is regarded as a public meeting and therefore expressly prohibited by the Black and Tans. When one takes place they therefore respond by getting some of the players against a wall and ordering them to strip. When one 17 yearold refuses he is bayoneted in a chicken coop. It is this disregard for human life that gets one to naturally side with the Irish during this part of the film and it led to a few English men and women next to me in the cinema joining in during the several Irish folk song interludes.The film is not entirely sympathetic with the Irish however. A British soldier played by the same guy as the monk in the third series of the Peep Show says to an Irish prisoner that he was only sent by his government and then proceeds to describe the pain of the First World War in a fit of anger. It was refreshing to see that the script writers realised that not everything was black and white back then or I suppose you could say black and tan.The film also displays a fascinating perspective on Winston Churchill. The man who we admire as our ultimate war hero and the man whom we voted our greatest Briton was in fact behind the sending in of the Black and Tans in my opinion one of our nation's darkest hours.The Irish put up a very hard fought resistance to the Black and Tans and eventually force them out. The civil strife that follows however is frighteningly vivid. The changing of attitudes is depicted very well and movingly by brothers Teddy Padraic Delaney and Damien Cillian Murphy. Both these actors put in excellent performances.Overall it is a very good film. A must see for anyone interested in the period or in the conflict in general but one should perhaps be warned that the violence can at times be intense. My father's father was a young boy in Ireland when the Black and Tans came in and for my father the film sometimes got a bit too much.".

My father's father was a young boy in Ireland when the Black and Tans came in and for my father the film sometimes got a bit too much.";

Ken Loach has no reason to lie in his films he gets at the truth and holds no bars in telling it but sure if any truth about the Brits comes out then the provider must be antiBritish.I am pleased that the British are taking this film so badly if you would only open your mind and realize how evil your past governments were then maybe you could see the film in a different light.Well done Ken.".

The socialist argument was particularly badly handled with a monologue by the trade union character otherwise excellently portrayed that reminded me of dreary political consciousness raising afternoons in seventies student unions. The plot started out promisingly but turned into a predictable potboiler long before an ending that should have moved me but didn't.It was also full of lazy mistakes in terms of the sets grass growing right up to the door of the house in a supposedly inhabited farmyard moss growing on the chimney wall of a stone cabin that would have had a permanently burning peat fire all the clothes too new looking  small details I know but very jarring when they occur in such numbers.

It vacillates between a howling rage or an earnest debate with no dramatic tension to make it work as a piece of cinema. The narrative flow and pace is absolutely all over the place with a stop start momentum that makes the film incredibly hard to settle into.Loach's trademark gallows humour is sadly lacking and there is next to no character development so it was very hard to care for the protagonists. The British soldiers were one dimensional cardboard cut outs and more pantomime villains than vicious oppressors.Cillian Murphy is excellent but I felt that Orlagh Fitzgerald's performance was all 'one note' and Padraic Delaney as Teddy lacked the charisma and gravitas for someone who is supposed to be an inspirational leader.Despite my criticism of the film I want to point out that I don't subscribe to the notion that this film is antiBritish. The atrocities committed by the British government are well documented. We can't pretend that it didn't happen. This is just a very flawed depiction.".

Having set the film in the Ireland of the 1920s a turbulent Ireland and brought us into the lives of its protagonist brothers the film starts offering something unique personal and insightful only to become tediously slow and even dragging. Its high points come without emotional punch and feel like story telling by the numbers. The cinematography is too kitchen sink at time just as is the direction while the performances appear to fleet in and out as if one was actually watching a workshop on acting.

Then the film follows his violent actions. And after many minutes some with very masochistic and selfsacrificing violence the British occupation force is ousted.Now at last the film is getting ready to address issues of greater difficulty because suddenly with the disappearance of the common enemy the fighters start to disagree. Should the fight continue until a worker's socialist republic is formed or should a liberal democracy with some ties to the British but not occupied be accepted? Our protagonist chooses the former option. At this point in the film unless the repetitive first hour and a half has bored you completely the real challenge to the audience could be given how can a people with different opinions on how to live and structure society reach a common ground for their mutual existence how should a socialist state deal with persons that does not want to join the collective now when their occupier has left? The film has a clear answer they are traitors lets fight to the End! Here the personal drama which is where Loach has his great power is substituted for very simple political discourse. No intellectual tension is built up because the answer appears so simple... FIGHT! And the ending... so masochistic! You almost wonder if the violence is the erotic? force of the film.

Surely Mister Loach history cannot be that simple.

Loach is trying to teach someone a lesson. The starving child scene is a very good example.

	schema:headline " Even Handed  Compelling And Loach's Best Film As Well As Being A Good History Lesson";
	schema:reviewBody "This comes with a lot of baggage but we can blame the director Ken Loach for that . I do remember seeing a panel at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival where Loach had a panel publicising HIDDEN AGENDA and continually shouted his mouth off about  An army of occupation in Northern Ireland  . The bitter irony was that film had very little if any IRA bias at least in comparison to Hollywood nonsense like THE DEVIL'S OWN . Tirades like that do Loach no favour since at least two critics attacked the film for anti British bias only to be found out that they'd not actually seen the film ! Loach has that effect on people and his  socially aware realist dramas  set on housing estates are very condescending and patronising which leave him open to attack  even by people who live on the mean streets and consider themselves left wing . In short it's very difficult indeed to watch a Loach film with an open mind which is a great shame because this is heads and shoulders above anything he's made before The producers deserve great credit as does Paul Laverty for giving material for Loach to work with . Social realism is a style that is by definition low concept in nature   plot less  in other words . THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY isn't the most plot driven screenplay in cinematic history but it is very involving and a very good history lesson  very much better than Neil Jordan's biopic MICHAEL COLLINS for example . Despite showing the violence meted out to innocent Irish bystanders by the crown forces there is a very important motivation that was fairly common amongst British soldiers at the time and that was unless they were Ulster protestants Irishmen never fought in the British army . This was an erroneous though common held view and we see this stated on screen . We also see that anti treaty IRA men had no compulsion in shooting Irish Free State troops Some critics have argued that perhaps the film might have shown violence against protestant AngloIrishmen that did take place the AngloIrish War and the subsequent civil war that followed but that's to mistake the conflicts as wars of religion when in fact they were political conflicts . In 1919 the Irish population outside the six counties of Ulster was ten per cent protestant and IRA protestant membership was a similar percentage . Perhaps the resulting civil war could have been shown as being more brutal since the Irish Free State executed more IRA men than the Brits and had no qualms of shooting anti treaty IRA men after they'd surrendered but as far as history lessons go it would wrong to criticise a film such as this".

	schema:headline " A fabulous slice of Euro Gothic!";
	schema:reviewBody "Emilio Miraglia's crossover between Gothic horror and Italy's finest cinematic export the Giallo really is a delightful film for the fan of cult horror. While the movie is certainly no masterpiece the story moves well and the imagery on display and imagination on the part of the director that is shown throughout elevates a rather simple tale of insanity and murder into an amazing slice of cult cinema. The title alone is graphic and lurid enough on its own and I'm pleased to say that the film itself carries on this style throughout with some well worked and ingenious death scenes as well as plenty of nudity and some truly beautiful cinematography. The story takes place in a castle just outside London England. We are introduced to Lord Alan Cunningham and a hooker that he is taking home. After brutally torturing and eventually killing her we discover that his mental trauma is due to the loss of his wife Evelyn. His friend and doctor talks him into remarrying to ease his mental anguish and that's a piece of advice that he takes upon meeting the ravishing Gladys...Despite the fact that this film is very much a piece of schlock cinema the director appears to have taken it very seriously and the result is a film that puts a lot of emphasis on the plot and characters and ultimately this means a stronger show as Miraglia takes time to draw his audience in rather than just showing blood and nudity and leaving it at that. The acting performances aren't bad and even though Spaghetti Western star Antonio De Teff is a little hammy he convinces in his role while Marina Malfatti provides eyecatching eye candy. The murder sequences on display are typically gruesome and beyond the immediately obvious as we watch a woman being ripped apart by foxes and a scene that sees a man burn in a pool containing sulphuric acid. Bruno Nicolai's rock score works very well and brilliantly accents every scene. The film all boils down to a satisfying ending which despite seemingly coming out nowhere works well and adequately describes many of the loose ends up until the conclusion. Overall while this film isn't the best of its kind it's certainly a very good one and I'm sure that fans of cult cinema won't be disappointed!".

	schema:reviewBody "Emilio Miraglia's The Night Evelyn came out of her Grave is an entertaining slice of perversely manipulative and seedy Gothic Eurohorror. The way the format works out Gothic crossed Giallo is a delicious web of eerie uncertainty and devilish twists where is it the cracking mind of the protagonist or maybe the supernatural has something to do with the mysterious occurrences and demented happenings. Where never quite sure how it will pan out despite its strictly routine and what you think a simple setup. It does create many effective and spontaneous passages like a layer upon layer structure which compellingly builds up to its showstopping and unforeseeable conclusion. Which eventually goes out of its way to shock. Miraglia sharply paints a sombre atmospheric setting that at times embraces a dreamy elegance and for the darker glum moments it's covered with moody shades due to its shadowy lighting. There's plenty of rough jolting blocks of viciously nasty violence sensual nudity and sordid fetishes. Bruno Nicolai's peering camerawork is smoothly orchestrated and Gastone Di Giovanni's wicked bustling music score fits every scene. The pacing can get rather stumpy and editing can lumber with little rhythm but it has a certain glow and the strangeness of the idea seems to hold you. The performances fair up decently with a voluptuous Erika Blanc looking rather stunning and nailing down her part. Antonio De Teff's nervous wreck portrayal is finely tuned in a neurotic sense and Marina Malfatti is there to shower us with her gratuitous looks. Rod Murdock colourfully hams it up with winning results and Giacomo RossiStuart is suitably adequate as the stableheaded doctor. There are able performances from Joan C Davis and Roberto Maldera too. The story can get patchy with few plotholes but it has a sedately arresting stylised appeal.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lord Alan Cunningham has been a troubled man since the death of his wife. The only release he can find from his torment is by luring women that remind him of his dead wife to his castle and then brutally murdering them. That is until he meets Gladys. The two are quickly married and Lord Cunningham appears to be cured. But a series of strange events involving the possibility that his first wife has returned from the grave seems to send him over the edge.The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave is one part Giallo and one part Gothic horror. It's not the greatest example of either subgenre you'll run across but I was reasonably entertained throughout. There are plenty of twists and turns in the plot to keep you guessing up to the very end. While I've seen enough of these Gialli that I'm rarely surprised anymore there's no way I could have predicted all the twists in the last act. The acting is about average for this kind of film but it was nice to see Marina Malfatti with a large role as Gladys.

	onyx:emotionText "Lord Alan Cunningham has been a troubled man since the death of his wife. The only release he can find from his torment is by luring women that remind him of his dead wife to his castle and then brutally murdering them. That is until he meets Gladys. The two are quickly married and Lord Cunningham appears to be cured. But a series of strange events involving the possibility that his first wife has returned from the grave seems to send him over the edge.The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave is one part Giallo and one part Gothic horror. It's not the greatest example of either subgenre you'll run across but I was reasonably entertained throughout. There are plenty of twists and turns in the plot to keep you guessing up to the very end. While I've seen enough of these Gialli that I'm rarely surprised anymore there's no way I could have predicted all the twists in the last act. The acting is about average for this kind of film but it was nice to see Marina Malfatti with a large role as Gladys.

Before seeing this film I was long looking forward to it since Gialli and Gothic Tales are my two favorite subgenres in Horror and it did not disappoint. Among my fellow Italian Horror buffs director Emilio Miraglia is most praised for his Gothic Giallo masterpiece La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte aka. The Red Queen Kills Seven Times of 1972 which is one of the most atmospheric and brilliant genre gems ever to be released. While this film is nowhere near as great it is definitely a highly original little film that no Italian Horror lover should consider missing.The Night That Evelyn Came Out Of The Grave may have some little flaws but it is without doubt a highly original film with some downright ingenious aspects. The film delivers delightful weirdness and sleaze in an eerie castle setting. Lord Cunningham Anthony Steffen has the unorthodox urge to lure prostitutes redheads only into his eerie castle. Followed by a crazy vision which another redhaired girl more precisely his deceased wife runs around naked in the forest the raged bootfetishist Cunningham kills the prostitutes in the torture chamber of his castle. His psychiatrist Giacomo RossiStuart who is best known for Mario Bava's masterpiece Kill Baby... Kill! advises the man to get married again in order to overcome his strange visions. Cunningham then meets a sexy lady named Gladys Marina Malfatti... The storyline is sometimes a bit confused but overall highly original. Apart from the great Gothic atmosphere and excellent photography the film also entertains with delightful sleaze. The female characters all tend to get naked as frequently as possible which is especially welcome with the stunningly beautiful Erica Blanc and Marina Malfatti. The amount of perversions and insanity is equally satisfactory. The killings are not very gory but stylish and one of them is quite nasty. Anthony Steffen who is mainly known for his Spaghetti Westerns sometimes credited as Antonio De Teffe makes a great psychotic rich guy. The score by Bruno Nicolai is great and the photography and atmosphere are superb. There are some illogical aspects and plotholes though. Lord Cunningham and his cousin have an aunt for example who looks only half the age of her nephews. The film has some other flaws but the great Gothic atmosphere sleaze and delightful weirdness make up for that easily. Overall The Night Evelyn Came Out Of Her Tomb is a sleazy original and stylish Gothic Giallo that no Italian Horror lover should miss.".

She moves in and strange things begin to happen to De Teffe's fragile state of mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally well just look at the title if you are still curious. Also family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Poor Aunt Agathashe looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old meets her fate in a foxy fashion. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course there is a whole explanation as to whyhow Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does do some things fairly well the settings in the film are wellsuited for this film though trying to make us believe it is England is ludicrous at best. None of the actors look English. Many having dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an Englishman wouldn't be caught dead in. The cars drive on their wrong side of the road. But all that notwithstanding the crypt scene was effectively shot and I liked the cheesy resolution too. And of course any film with the sultry redheaded Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a streak of sexual perversion however which I found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons.

What went wrong mainly? Well one too many tedious sequences for starters but primarily it's the fact that justice apparently must NOT be done!

This means we're following a convoluted and demented crime conspiracy but set in an ancient ominous castle and featuring eerie family vaults whips and gigantic cobwebs. Two years later in 1973 the great Antonio Margheriti also proved with Seven Deaths in a Cat's Eye that these two fabulous horror sub genre's can be blend perfectly. And he did it even slightly better as that particular film didn't suffer from so many holes in the plot. The wealthy Lord Cunningham has the strange habit of luring redheaded beauties to his castle suffering from a vision of another redhead running naked through a meadow and subsequently killing the gals barbarically with a whip.

When the Lord finally takes everyone's advise and remarries with a stunning beauty all kinds of mysterious events occur indicating that the first wife returned from the dead with a vengeance. Hence the notsosubtle title! The story is always interesting but the pacing is a little slow and not one character is likable. However that makes the murders all the more enjoyable! They're not particularly gory but certainly ingenious! The killing of the wheelchaired lady is notably brutal! The music and quantity of nudity  eurosleaze are also tip top so there are more than enough elements left to reward this film with a positive rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Italian semihorror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes. The only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film. The story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon go berserk and seemingly kill them. They show the nudity but they never really show the murders at this point in the film. Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her. He has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife Evelyn was also one she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience's business. After a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes foxes and such. At this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely. This movie just did not work for me it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film. Explaining Evelyn's death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where Evelyn did rise from the grave. Granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave just not under her own power. The gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too. I just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull.".

I have to be honest and say I just didn't really care much for this film. It's badly uneven and the pacing is all over the place. It looks great on the new DVD and the rising from the grave sequence is cool but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable. You really have a hard time caring for Alan because he is a psychotic who is skating on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity. He can be quite volatile. Who commits the crime really isn't that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off there aren't but a choice few who could be doing it. What happens to Alan doesn't really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument he's just getting what he deserves. Those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to Alan as I pointed out before aren't that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances..or advantages they'd havethat would benefit them with the collapse of Alan's sanity then everything just comes off less than stellar. I thought the editing was choppy and unexciting but the acting from the entire cast is really below par. Some stylistics help and there is a sniff of Gothic atmosphere in the graveyard sequences to help it some.".

I always had expression that 'The Night Evelyn Came out of the Grave' was a straight Italian horror but it was a giallo all along! Well to be precise it's mix of giallo and Gothic horror. It's also mix between sleazy and 'artsy'. While there's lot of nudity and kinky sm stuff 'The Night Evelyn came out of Grave' has really beautiful cinematography and really interesting plot. Director Emilio Miraglia successfully creates nicely running except couple of tedious scenes atmospheric movie that keeps audience in suspense through from start to the end. Murders in this film are really original. If there were gore it would make the movie more entertaining. Also the score to this flick by Bruno Nicolai is really enjoyable.The Ending is really nice one of the best I've seen. True giallo ending that can't be predicted at the beginning of the film.What makes this film really interesting is the fact that Lord Cunningham the original killer doesn't pay for his crimes and turns out to be the hero of the movie! It sickens me. I love it.So movie in nutshell 'The Night Evelyn Came out the of Grave' is really beautiful giallo with interesting plot with lot of titties. Lot of them.I can recommend this one for all those who loves giallo or Italian horror flicks!I give 'The Night Evelyn Came out of the Grave' 8 whiplash out of 10.Seacrest Out!".

Considering their excellent track record it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases. And don't pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here it's not taken from this film some girl holding the head of a Jim Carrey lookalike.Spaghetti Western star Anthony Steffen sports a hip hairdo and assumes the role of Lord Alan Cunningham a man haunted by the memory of his dead wife Evelyn. This leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being retained in a psychiatric clinic. Once released Cunningham channels this trauma by taking redheaded prostitutes to his countryside castle subjecting them to vicious acts of torture. His doctor and friend Richard Timberlane what do you mean Italian horror names sound made up? advises him to forget the past and remarry but Cunningham is obsessed with Evelyn and even organizes a sance at the castle. Eventually after killing some more girls he meets Gladys another redhead and marries her almost immediately but the arrival of his new wife spawns a series of sinister events. Bloodthirsty creatures strike at Sir Alan's family killing them off one by one. Becoming more distraught Cunningham visits Evelyn's tomb and discovers it to be empty. Soon a number of outsiders begin to suspect something fishy is going on in the castle and Lord Cunningham's treatment might not have been that successful after all.Director Emilio Miraglia tries to blend Gothic horror with Giallo conventions with limited success. As usual not the slightest effort was made to convince audiences the film is set in England. The cars drive on the right side of the road everyone looks very Mediterranean and the castle and the rest of the architecture is patently Italian. This is common practice in Italian horror but sometimes they just take this a little too far. The bad print made this even slightly bearable since it's so dark you couldn't see much of the surroundings anyway. But then again this is the kind of film where anything can happen in the name of exploitation and depicting reality isn't really the issue. A large part consists of sadomasochistic torture scenes in the castle torture chamber but most of the time Anthony Steffen hams his way through this and shows some horrible overacting. I guess it all depends on your state of mind and this can be a fun piece of nonsense if you're in the right mood. I just couldn't take it at least not with the print I watched. A pleasant score though by Bruno Nicolai which combines easylistening tunes with some psychedelic rock numbers.Camera Obscura  410".

He now picks up women who look like Evelyn takes them to his remote castle tortures them and kills them. But he seems cured later on when he marries Gladyswho looks just like Evelyn. But then people are being killed Alan starts seeing Evelyn's ghost her tomb is found empty and he starts to slowly go mad...The synopsis may sound strange but so is the movie! There's plenty of things wrong with this the plot refuses to make sense the acting is pretty bad the dubbing is awful and the film is relatively bloodless. Also there's an astounding amount of misogyny in this even for a horror film. It's actually quite dulluntil the end. There's a double twist ending which caught me by surprise and it gets very bloody too. Still that's only the last 15 minutes or sothe preceding 80 minutes are hard to slog through. There is also a fair amount of nudity all female of course and the main actors are attractivebut that's not enough to recommend this. Completists of Italian horror cinema may enjoy this. Also most of the DVD versions of this are in terrible shapemine was incorrectly letterboxed had faded color and nonstop jumps and scratches. One sequence even started with the top of the image on the bottom of the screen! Sobeware. I give it a 6mostly for the ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Italian director Emilio Miraglia's second film The Red Queen Kills Seven Times 1972 had previously impressed me as one of the most perfect giallo pictures that I had ever seen when I first saw it six years ago so I had a feeling that I was going to enjoy seeing his first. But because of that earlier film's titleThe Night Evelyn Came Out of the GraveI was somehow expecting something more on the order of a supernaturalghost story. To my delighted surprise however Evelyn turns out to be both a modernday Gothic melodrama that combines insanity and SM elements and that ultimately segues quite unambiguously into grisly giallo terrain. Released in 1971 the film succeeds dazzlingly well on both fronts and reveals itself to be a remarkably selfassured outing for the firsttime director.In the film the viewer meets a British lord named Alan Cunningham Anthony Steffen who here resembles at times a young and dissipated Peter Falk. Sir Alan when we first encounter him is in the bughouse having had a mental breakdown after the death of his redheaded unfaithful wife Evelyn who had died during childbirth. After his release Alan becomes infatuated with his new hobby picking up redheaded hookers and strippers to bring home and torturously whipand possibly killin his castle dungeon. Two of the strippers are played by yummy Maria Teresa Tofano and scrumptious Erika Blanc Erika who had previously impressed this viewer in such films as Mario Bava's Kill Baby Kill 1966 and Charles Lecocq's The Devil's Nightmare 1971 here gets to perform a memorable nightclub striptease after arising from a coffin! Following the advice of the institution's Dr. Timberlane Giacomo RossiStuart who had costarred with Erika in Kill Baby Kill although they sadly share no screen time here Alan resolves to forget his dead wife by meeting another woman. And soon enough he meets a beautiful blonde named Gladys squisito Marina Malfatti who viewers may recall from another giallo film with decided supernatural overtones Sergio Martino's 1972 gem All the Colors of the Dark who he proposes to after just a few hours. But marriage with Gladys only seems to make Lord Alan's obsessions worse as the crypt of dead Evelyn is revealed to be empty her walking cadaver is glimpsed and ghastly murders erupt around the estate....Happily Evelyn turns out to be a superstylish film that features inventive and offkilter camera angles DOP Gastone di Giovanni has done a marvelous job shooting this project sumptuous sets a wonderful use of color and a gorgeous theme song by Bruno Nicolai that even maestro Ennio Morricone could not better. Most viewers will have little idea where this picture is headed during its first 23 the modernday Gothic section which showcases an eerie seance Evelyn's ghost and that castle and even less during the stunning giallo section that culminates the picture. And fans of this distinctly Italian genre will not feel shortchanged either as the film ends with as hairy and grisly a bunch of murderous set pieces as could be desired mayhem via a venomous snake head clubbing traditional poison knifings sulfuric acid...and some particularly ravenous kenneled foxes. Even more pleasing the film manages to pull off not just a surprise ending but a TRIPLE twistsurprise ending for one bravissimo and loopy windup! I could not for the life of me figure out why it was necessary to set this film in England doesn't Italy have its own strip clubs castles and wealthy landowners? or why we see in one startling scene Alan's beautiful but paralyzed Aunt Agatha Joan C. Davis arise from her wheelchair and walk but other than these two minor quibbles Miraglia's first work strikes me as being a practically flawless giallo gem. The film has been deemed dreadful by the oftenstingy when it comes to genre fare at least editors of the Maltin Movie Guide but this viewer much prefers the verdict of the indispensable film book DVD Delirium 3 which tells us that Evelyn is particularly deranged with a denouement that is an unforgettably unhinged concoction. But perhaps the Maltin editors would revise their old assessment if they could see the DVD of Evelyn that is currently available from NoShame. Sporting a gorgeous uncut properly framed print in the original Italian and with excellent subtitles the first worthwhile video release of this title in any format DVD Delirium 3 claims the film might come as a revelation to those who have only seen it on lousylooking videotapes with even worse dubbing. Seen in this pristinelooking NoShame format Evelyn reveals itself to be the handsome stylish imaginative and surprising giallo outing that it is. Further good news regarding the NoShame DVD are two of the disc's extras a 21minute reminiscence by the modernday Erika Blanc herself still a looker as she sits at her makeup table and a 23minute talk by the film's set designer Lorenzo Baraldi. In all a terrific package for a terrific film. To all the fine folks at the alwaysdependable NoShame my most heartfelt Grazie!".

When she made an entrance she burst onto the screen like a whirlwind and didn't look back positively exuding earthy vitality. That she didn't have a significant sound career is truly unfortunate for one's imagination plays happily with the notion of Clara bawdily defying the frigid censors well into the culturally stolid war years. Though we didn't get much in that way CALL HER SAVAGE is fortunately a picture worth a thousand words.Okay the first ten minutes make it look like a dusty old western but STAY WITH IT...otherwise you'll be missing one of the boldest and brightest preCode items this side of CONVENTION CITY. When Clara first appears on horseback the wind blowing through her hair you will be transfixed for the remainder of the show. The narrative opens in Texas with a rich landowner punishing his tomboy daughter Nasa Clara by sending her off to Chicago for charm school. He also has latent motivation in wanting to marry her off to the man of his choice. Once in the big city Nasa becomes known as Dynamite in the tabloids for her volatility and elopes with a slippery charmer instead of her intended beau. He strays so to speak as soon as their honeymoon leading Clara to take her leave. From here it's a road to ruin and back again for the young lady with a startling secret in store for her at the climax. A freeform blend of western romantic comedy tragedy and everything in between CALL HER SAVAGE takes sometimes jarring turns from comedy to pathos creating an absolutely unique experience.I can only imagine how Joseph Breen and his ilk must have gnashed their teeth over this film  virtually every scene seems to have been calculated to drive them up the wall. For all its brazenness it's surprising that CALL HER SAVAGE was a Fox production for one would expect it more from Warner Bros. We first see Clara in a tightfitting white shirt enthusiastically whipping a snake  then a handsome ranch hand when he laughs at her! Clara then tears off a portion of her shirt to tend to his wounds my hasn't that one been appropriated time and time again!. Further mix in race relations prostitution and an attempted rape of Nasa by her STDravaged husband Don't get up she cautions. I GET UP every afternoon! he answers. And don't miss the detour to cinema's very first gay bar where the waiters sing about sailors in pajamas !. On a seedier level there's a brief but unsavory taste of pederasty when a drunken old fool approaches a little girl.But it's Clara who makes this movie. The early scenes of her scantily clad and writhing on the grass have a palpable erotic charge that no black and white vintage can dilute remember this was the woman who sat through a stage performance of Dracula dressed in a fur coat  and little else. I really hope that Clara is well remembered today for she was TRULY a star and incredible personality. A lively vital and eternally beautiful free spirit.

After being replaced in City Streets Sylvia Sidney The Secret Call Peggy Shannon and Manhandled Claudette Colbert Clara was let go by Paramount. People in the know felt she would never make another movie. After an extensive rest she had married Rex Bell and retired to his ranch who would have thought the next year would be so bright career wise? She came back to Hollywood as a Fox star and selected Tiffany Thayer's novel Call Her Savage for her Fox debut. She looked extremely pretty and played with much vitality. Call Her Savage was very popular and promised a bright future.There is definitely enough plot for 3 movies and it is all sensational!!! Nasa is a wildcat and after a few hairraising incidents  whipping a rattlesnake to death and then turning on her chum Moonglow Gilbert Roland and whipping him in a frenzied attack  her father decides to send her to a finishing school in Chicago but her antics don't stop there and she is frequently the subject of lurid gossip columns. When her father arranges a marriage between her and a dull college boy she rebels and elopes with womanizer Lawrence Crosby Monroe Owsley after a knock down drag 'em out fight between Nasa and Sunny a dynamic Thelma Todd Crosby's unfaithful mistress  it's a Wow!! Before the night is over her father has washed his hands of her and Crosby deserts her for Sunny he had only married Nasa to make Sunny jealous. After a whirlwind few months she spends spending and gambling her husband asks to see her  he is in a hospital suffering from insanity !!! and after almost being raped by him  she escapes to New Orleans where else to have her baby in peace. When she has to turn to prostitution to help pay for her baby's medicine the boarding house where she lives burns down something Clara experienced as a child and her child dies. Moonglow then turns up to tell her of her inheritance  100000 left to her by her grandfather. Wealthy again she returns to New York where she hires Jay Randall Anthony Jowitt a wealthy young man posing as a worker to show her the city  they even go to a gay bar. Incredibly while at dinner she runs into a now recovered Crosby who is back with Sunny and the evening concludes with yet another fight between Nasa and Sunny you just don't see this one. Just as she is about to hit the bottle again word comes to her that her mother is dying and Nasa finally learns about her true heritage Nasa's birth is the result of an affair between her mother and an Indian Chief. She then decides to stay with the only man who has ever shown her true affection  the half caste Moonglow.I wonder if this was the real Clara  so vibrant high spirited and absolutely adorable. Clara claimed this was one of her favourite films  if only her other talkies had been up to this standard. This film is a definite precoder and not a pretender. It is right up there with Three on a Match 1932 and Baby Face 1933.Highly Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I might have passed on this film but I happened to notice Clara Bow's name in the credits. I never saw any of her films before and for starters you might call this one a knockout. Bow's character is Biblically cursed by her grandfather's sexual indiscretion aboard a wagon train heading West during the pioneer days and we're reminded a number of times that the 'sins of the father' will pass down to the third and fourth generation.Pass down they do as it doesn't take long for Nasa Springer Bow to earn the name 'Dynamite' when she heads to a finishing school in Chicago her father's 'punishment' for an earlier scene in which she whips a rattlesnake and a halfbreed Indian in short order. Those are actually the tamer elements in this preCode gem in which we're startlingly reminded that subjects which might have been considered taboo in cinema were actually front and center as far back as the Thirties. Nasa revels in her naughtiness revealing a nipple through a sheer blouse for example or even more egregiously wrestling her large dog rather lasciviously on the floor of her parents' apartment. These scenes come and go so quickly that you sometimes don't catch the nuance immediately but reflection on them after the film is over offers some incredible insight. Maybe a little catfight?  but of course!Bow's character runs the gamut here marrying divorcing having a baby going the prostitution route to feed her child when she hits the skids losing the baby in an apartment fire ! and slumming with a new wealthy boyfriend at a gay bar in a scene that's so over the top you won't know WHAT your reaction should be. If Nasa Springer needed a motto it would be Don't start anything you don't want finished. In response she earns the name given her by Jay Randall Anthony Jowitt right after she destroys the senior Randall apartment in another but this time off screen brawl with Sunny De Lane Thelma Todd  You savage! Let me remark as well on a few items no one else has mentioned here. You would probably have to go some to come up with an earlier example of commercial product placement in pictures. While trolling her New Orleans neighborhood for a potential paying customer Nasa passes a store front window with ads for Bromo Seltzer and Dr. Scholl's ZinoPads. They might have simply been in camera range inadvertently but who knows?And if Cagney hadn't done it to Harlow a year earlier in The Public Enemy this might have been the first time a guy in pictures Monroe Owsley as Larry Crosby manhandles his girlfriendwife by shoving her in the face. Cagney used a grapefruit but at least his girl didn't fall down over a chair the way Bow hit the deck in this one. And speaking of Owsley's Crosby did anyone else get a chuckle out of his uncanny resemblance to Pee Wee Herman? In hindsight that made some of the scenes in which he appeared even more comical.Well I guess there are a lot of reasons to see this flick trying as I have to enumerate a few. If you're a cinema fan this is probably one of those you'd classify as a must see and if truth be told probably for all the wrong reasons.".

Maybe a little catfight?  but of course!Bow's character runs the gamut here marrying divorcing having a baby going the prostitution route to feed her child when she hits the skids losing the baby in an apartment fire ! and slumming with a new wealthy boyfriend at a gay bar in a scene that's so over the top you won't know WHAT your reaction should be. If Nasa Springer needed a motto it would be Don't start anything you don't want finished. In response she earns the name given her by Jay Randall Anthony Jowitt right after she destroys the senior Randall apartment in another but this time off screen brawl with Sunny De Lane Thelma Todd  You savage! Let me remark as well on a few items no one else has mentioned here. You would probably have to go some to come up with an earlier example of commercial product placement in pictures. While trolling her New Orleans neighborhood for a potential paying customer Nasa passes a store front window with ads for Bromo Seltzer and Dr. Scholl's ZinoPads. They might have simply been in camera range inadvertently but who knows?And if Cagney hadn't done it to Harlow a year earlier in The Public Enemy this might have been the first time a guy in pictures Monroe Owsley as Larry Crosby manhandles his girlfriendwife by shoving her in the face. Cagney used a grapefruit but at least his girl didn't fall down over a chair the way Bow hit the deck in this one. And speaking of Owsley's Crosby did anyone else get a chuckle out of his uncanny resemblance to Pee Wee Herman? In hindsight that made some of the scenes in which he appeared even more comical.Well I guess there are a lot of reasons to see this flick trying as I have to enumerate a few. If you're a cinema fan this is probably one of those you'd classify as a must see and if truth be told probably for all the wrong reasons.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nasa Dynamite Springer Clara Bow is a freewheeling headstrong Texas girl with a violent temper. This film follws her life over the course of many years. Since it's preCode it's pretty extreme. The film goes into detail showing her whipping a man virtually having sex with a dog having a baby out of wedlock becoming a prostitute drug abuse and a really funny cat fight with Thelma Todd. Also there's a sequence in what is pretty obviously a gay bar. The film veers wildly from humor to action to melodrama and feels very uneven. Still it's very short and certainly never dull. Also Bow is excellent in a role which gives her the chance to get as extreme as she wants. This is easily one of the most racy preCode pictures out there. It was supposed to be Bow's big box office comeback but the film for some reason failed at the box office. Prints are hard to come by but I think it is on DVD and FXM shows it once in a while. If you get a chance watch it. Lots of fun! I give it an 8.".

According to her Wikipedia page Bow wasn't interested in a comeback  even though she was getting offers from MGM who wanted her for RedHeaded Woman which instead became Jean Harlow's starmaking film RKO who wanted her for What Price Hollywood? eventually filmed with Constance Bennett and Howard Hughes as well as Fox. She was willing to make a couple more films because she and her husband Western star Rex Bell needed the money to maintain his ranch in Nevada but she didn't want to be tied down to a longterm contract and she apparently picked Fox because they only wanted her for two movies this one and HoopLa from 1933. I was interested in Call Her Savage which TCM was showing as part of their Friday festivals of socalled preCode productions partly as a late Clara Bow vehicle and partly because Vito Russo's book The Celluloid Closet said it was the first film in history to depict a Gay bar.Call Her Savage had all the earmarks of an interesting but not particularly good movie  a faded star trying at once to live down a scandalous reputation while playing a bad girl role that capitalized on it a story by a racy novelist Tiffany Thayer whose reputation was for writing as close to porn as could be got into mainstream print in 1932 and a studio that already had the reputation of being a place where careers went to die. Well surprise! Call Her Savage turned out to be a masterpiece one of the glittering gems of the preCode era alongside Love Me Tonight I'm No Angel Safe in Hell Sensation Hunters Three Wise Girls Virtue and several others one which used the relative freedom of loose Production Code enforcement to create an artistically and emotionally intense world in which people's sexual drives are depicted as integral parts of their nature and characters fall in and out of love or in and out of bed with each other for reasons similar to those that obtain in the real world. John Francis Dillon a director I've never thought much of mainly because the most prestigious film I've seen of his before this one is Sally the 1929 filmization of Marilyn Miller's hit musical done as dully and in the same stagebound manner of most preBerkeley musicals turns in a magnificent job here using oblique angles and surprisingly noirish lighting aided by the superb cinematographer Lee Garmes he throws together a dazzling array of different visual looks to bring home the point of each scene. I suspect only his early death at age 49 in 1934 prevented Dillon who'd worked himself up from Mack Sennett comedies to silent features from remaining a major director well into the talkie era.The screenplay is by Edwin J. Burke who managed a tough assignment  bringing a Tiffany Thayer novel to the screen and making it both cinematically coherent and agreeable to the Hays Office enforcement arm of the Production Code and anyone who reads the American Film Institute Catalog entry on Call Her Savage will quickly be disabused of the notion that the 193034 era in American movie was truly preCode! Fox went through several drafts and several writers before Will Hays' enforcer Col. Jason S. Joy finally reluctantly gave his O.K.  and came up with a script full of both wisecracks and surprisingly emotional situations to show Bow's emotional range as an actress. And Bow's emotional range as an actress is probably the biggest surprise about this movie there are sequences in which she's the uncontrollable flibbertigibbet she'd been in her silent films but also scenes especially when her character is suffering in which she is almost Garboesque in her nonacting her refusal to milk it her somber serious mien. After seeing a bunch of films both old Something for the Boys Doll Face and new the most recent Godzilla that fell far short of their potentials it was refreshing to watch a movie like Call Her Savage where everyone concerned got it right and nailed every aspect of their story they were aiming for Dillon's assured direction Garmes' deep cinematography the down parts of the story in which Nasa is suffering were obviously inspired by the street films about urban poverty that had been the rage in Germany in the 1920's and Garmes copied the shadowy chiaroscuro look that in the 1930's would have been called the German look and nowadays is known as film noir Burke's mordant script and most important the surprisingly nuanced and multidimensional acting of Bow combine to create one of the finest films of its era.".

	schema:headline " Bow's Comeback";
	schema:reviewBody "Call Her Savage 1932 12 out of 4 It girl Clara Bow made her comeback with this at times raunchy PreCode that features the actress turning up the sex level. In the film she plays a wild child who goes through various up and downs throughout her life. This starts with stealing a husband Monroe Owsley from his wife Thelma Todd which turns into a disaster but these two will pop up again later in her life. As with Bow's characters life this film is up and down from start to finish. At times the film comes off very sexy at times it's funny at times it's heartbreaking but there are other moments where the film comes off as pure camp. Since this is a PreCode we get all sorts of scenes where Bow is showing off her sexuality which includes scenes showing off her legs and one memorable scene with her nipples showing through her clothes. Before we get to all the sexual stuff we have a prologue that tells us Bow's character is cursed by God due to her grandfather's bad doings behind the back of his wife. These religious elements come off very campy and really put the movie at a slow start. The reason to see this film is due to Bow's terrific performance. She was always great at being the wild child and her funny side has always been good and that continues to be the case here. What really works is her dramatic turns which includes one heartbreaking scene that I won't ruin here. Bow's comeback would only last one more film which is a shame because it's clear she hand more punch than a lot of the actresses of this era which went onto have long careers.".

In the film she plays a wild child who goes through various up and downs throughout her life. This starts with stealing a husband Monroe Owsley from his wife Thelma Todd which turns into a disaster but these two will pop up again later in her life. As with Bow's characters life this film is up and down from start to finish. At times the film comes off very sexy at times it's funny at times it's heartbreaking but there are other moments where the film comes off as pure camp.

Her grandfather committed adultery and was cursed by Godfearing cowboys. Her mother carried on the family tradition by carrying on with a handsome Native American Indian. Without showing the actual sex the film suggests Bow was fathered by the savage Indian. Due to her family's wickedness God damns Bow because I am a jealous God and visit the sins of the fathers upon their children. Bow makes a grandiose entry into the film she takes a wild ride straddling a horse to a scene wherein she whips both a snake and halfbreed Gilbert Roland as Moonglow. Whipping the snake symbolizing Satan? shows her good side but she cannot understand her savage nature. Thus Bow's cursed life is filled with melodramatic tragedy.After a relative to the time but not really short absence from the screen this was considered a comeback vehicle for Bow. It was a tawdry exploitive offensive and unsuccessful attempt although Bow is entertaining and continued to prove herself a capable actress. After a more focused attempt at a characterization the careerending Hoopla Bow would retire. At least she left showing she would have been capable of continuing on had the material been more worthy.Today the preposterous premise of Call Her Savage and its outmoded luridness may unintentionally amuse. Bow's performance is quite good considering the ludicrous situation. A couple of effeminate homosexuals entertain Bow and courtly Anthony Jowitt as Jay Randall in a New York diner. You won't believe God's wrath on prostitution. Presumably Bow's cursed existence is ended with revelation and acceptance of her lot in life.

	schema:reviewBody "My summary is NOT meant as derogatory. No I mean 'trash' in a good waya film so unabashedly sleazy and sensationalistic at times that it makes for highly entertaining viewing. And when I say PreCode this refers to the years just before the middle of 1934 when Hollywood pretty much ignored conventions and put practically EVERYTHING in movies. Adultery violence sexuality and even abortions were not taboo during this time. It was only with a severely strengthened Code in 1934 that all this crazy stuff came to a halt...at least until more recent times.Call Her Savage is a very odd tale. It claims to be a morality tale about the wages of sin and quotes some Biblical referencesbut the savvy viewer knows that this is all an attempt to put a respectable face on a film meant to titillate. It begins in the Old West on a wagon trainwhere the leader not only commits adultery but stomps a man to death when he's confronted by this! Then the old 'sins of the fathers are visited to the second and third and fourth generations' quotation is plastered on the screen. The second generation is his daughtera woman who delights in spreading her legs whenever her husband leaves the houseleaving her pregnant with an other man's baby. This baby Clara Bow is a wild savageand she has a great time whipping things including her boyfriend with her whip. I guess back in 1932 all fashionable ladies carried whips! Eventually the funloving and somewhat crazed Bow marries a man on a whimonly to learn on her wedding night that he didn't care one whit about her. He disappears and only turns up late in the film to try to rape her. While the film didn't say it explicitly it seems that he must have caught syphilis during all his 'fun' and his mind is gone. And in the process he blew all his money and left Bow pregnant. Now broke Bow and her baby struggle to get by...and then tragedy strikes at the same time she inherits her father's fortune. Will Bow manage to turn it all around or will she prove the notion that once a bad egg always a bad egg? The film is a sleazy but enjoyable piece. Apart from murders adultery and syphilis this one even features what appears to be a gay club!!! Now this gay barclub was a bit ridiculouswith the campiest singing duo in movie history. And it's hilarious to see Clara enjoying the heck out of the placeespecially when folks start tossing food and plates and fists. But underneath all this sleaze is an interesting story and the acting isn't bad at allshowing that Bow despite her career being pretty much over by the time she was 30 really could act.This is an ironic film as Bow played a woman much like her in real life. During the 1920s Bow was legendary for her wild and debaucherous life see the brilliant biography Clara Bow Runnin' Wild by David Stenn for more on this VERY sordid time. She was also notorious for picking the wrong men until she eventually married and sadly shortly thereafter became schizophrenic. Tragic that's for sure and her life would make a very interesting movie.Also if you pay attention you'll note a bit of a racist note in this film. While Bow's character is in love with a half American Indian man Gilbert Roland she can only act upon this late in the film when she learns that she too is a 'halfbreed'which is pretty sad.".

Bow who is spectacular in the lead unfortunately does way too much brooding a carryover from her silent film years. But I also recognize this was likely at the command of the director. I suspect a fair number of babies were born nine months after this picture came out due to an incredibly sexy scene where Bow slips into a very tight chemise and stiletto heels and proceeds to parade around for several minutes. It may be an illusion but it would appear she is wearing nothing under her lacy garment. And for a notsoyoung woman she was one hot mama!

	schema:reviewBody "Storm 2009It is hard for people outside of the United Nations crimes courts to know quite how that world feels from the inside. I think it's too foreign in every way to know. And Hollywood tends to approach this kind of situation with heightened drama exaggerated flair darker darks and more romantic romances. I'm not a U.N. insider but this isn't Hollywood and Storm feels as close to getting to the reality of that world as you can get in a fictional milieu. That's the brilliance of the filmmakers withholding and avoiding undue drama but also making the characters complex and interesting.Of course restraint isn't always the way to engross your audience and Storm tends to be interesting all along. It feels important and principled a lot like its characters. This might help it last as a classic of some sort gaining over time some of the shine it doesn't quite have now. But there is also the issue of why exactly the victims of war atrocities in the Bosnian conflict were forgotten by most of the world in the years after the war ended. From an American point of view Yugoslavia had always seemed far away not quite Europe not quite Asia becoming a mix of newly minted countries from the dissolution of a big one that had always remained isolated internationally. But the Europeans understand one of their own and if this movie is right it seems that Bosnia and Serbia et al were largely forgotten once the actual war was over. Storm is a particularly European approach to the issue a Danish film overall but a multiculti multicountry production that fits its subject perfectly.This movie is about a kind of dogged heroism that is part of the glory really no joke of the United Nations. You come to appreciate the struggling idealist foreign service and civil rights work that goes on at the lower levels of the U.N. completely out of sight but critically important. Here the fight is led by a discouraged midcareer lawyer played by Kerry Fox with something approaching perfection. Her character is so everyday for a high powered lawyer you sometimes forget that the actress is pulling it off so well. The second lead comes in only halfway through the equally brilliant Romanian actress Anamaria Marinca who is a victim being coaxed into testifying even though it is putting her life and her family in mortal danger.Not many movies get made about this world in part because it's a little dry. There are no shootouts or bombs just suspicious glares sudden backroom decisions. But it's an important movie at least it was for me giving me just a small insight into that world and into the social wreckage of the Bosnian war. If it had been given more drama it would have acquired more hype and director HansChristian Schmid deserves a bow for his steadfastness.In researching a little I found this review which I thought was really well written you might also enjoy httpwww.filmcritic.comreviews2009stormOr just see the darned movie.".

As a retired Lawyer I was fascinated by the Hague and its world Court process in prosecuting the atrocities of the Muslums and others in Bosnia. It is a cerebral thriller. It is more interested in pursuing the criminals who were the Leaders of these horrible crimes. It is a great film about the legal system no matter what the court. It relies on drama good acting rather than tales of horror. The trial scenes are simple yet riveting and suspenseful. It is also a great pleasure that my wife and I knew NONE of the cast making the film that much better. It always amazes me how many good filmmakers there are in the world who out perform the crap that Hollywood makes. The over blownin love with special effects is so juvenile it is revolting. Suffice to say Im not a kids anymore and is great to know there are people who recognize that there is an adult mature audience hungering for such films. It is also a thriller so I guarantee you wont be bored. See it as soon as you can since it is very limited release!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was supposed to be done in 2007 and to talk about a Croatian war crime criminal Ante Gotovina that was arrested in Spain and the infamous 'Storm' military offensive in Croatia in 1995 but somehow the title stayed but the story changed probably doing the long research and it's about a trial against a Serbian commander from the same war who gets caught in Spain at the beginning of the film though and the main roles the convict and his lawyer were played by Croatians which was funny. The commander's name and the place where he allegedly committed crimes are fiction except the hotel's name that was modified but who can speak the language will get it.Anyway doesn't matter which side is being the bad one a war criminal is a war criminal but also a national hero for some. What I like about this film is that it's remarkably restrained for a political film there are no flashbacks to the wars in the Balkans because in the first place it covers the dynamics of the ICTY International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in pretty much critical way how it works shown from personal and public perspective how time pressure on witnesses judges prosecutors.. should be reduced because the UN plans closing the Tribunal by the end of 2010 and many things have been left untold unsolved criminals unpunished.. It yearns for public awareness hoping something will change. It portrays how difficult it is to run a lawsuit when you can't make witnesses testify because they are afraid for their lives and families when even after so many years some people are not ready to speak the others are not capable of accepting the terrible crimes violating human rights as crimes that should be punished. It shows women's zeal for justice and punishment more than men's people trying to maintain their balance when everything's unjust betrayals political countermeasures.. In this film a hero may not get the villain the victim may not get to testify like she wants and the justice may not be satisfied because even at high court as this one justice is just a part of political games a lot of compromises are being made because a lot of things are at stake for example the witness' testimony may jeopardize the political need to bring various states from exYugoslavia into the EU it should be done as smoothly as possible and everything else is less important even justice.The heart of the film lies in the scene when a witness finds out that she won't be allowed to testify about her ordeal she asks a question about the ICTY in the fury  What kind of court is this? What the hell is it actually for?! The frustrating answer which is hard to accept is  Partial justice is better than none. And I should add superb acting by leading female roles Kerry Fox and Anamaria Marinca the Notwist's music in the background giving the special cold feeling to the whole murky atmosphere and making the film good as it is but still it has more sense to people from the region or those involved with the Tribunal.".

	schema:reviewBody "Storm is a superb drama about the continuing search for justice for crimes committed more than a decade ago during the war in Bosnia.The brilliant Kerry Fox stars as Hannah Maynard a prosecutor working at the Haige who is mounting a case against a Yugoslavian army commander Goran Duric Drazen Kuhn who may have played a part in Serbian ethnic cleansing. The equally affecting Anamaria Marinca plays Mira a young woman who was repeatedly raped under Duric's orders but who has since moved to Germany to try and forget the past and to start a new life with her husband and young son. Yet under Hannah's insistence Mira is eventually convinced to do the right thing  i.e. to come forward as a witness against Duric  at great personal risk to herself and her family.The screenplay by Bernd Lange and director HansChristian Schmid is multilayered and complex with each character emerging as a fully fleshedout human being. Hannah is largely motivated by a righteous zeal and a desire to see true justice achieved through the court of law. Yet there are moments when her motives are brought into question when even the man she is dating accuses her of using the case more as a steppingstone in her career than as a means of achieving a noble ideal. Similarly Mira is torn between the desire to see that justice is finally done and the understandable need to secure a safe and peaceful life for her and her family. But there are more than issues of mere justice involved here for by suppressing the horrors of what happened to her in the past Mira has in many ways prevented herself from moving on with her life a condition she may be able to rectify if she agrees to testify against Duric.Beyond the character dilemmas there is the broader issue of whether justice can ever be truly achieved in cases such as these especially given the delicate political nature of such trials. Too often for instance the EU finds itself not wanting to rock the boat with present and future member nations and thus turns a blind eye to many of the obvious atrocities that have occurred in those places in the recent past.Rife with human drama and enflamed by a righteous passion Storm is an engrossing and vital recounting of recent tragic history.".

Kerry Fox Anamaria Marinca Stephen Dillane Rolf Lassgrd Alexander Fehling Tarik Filipovicprovide remarkable nuanced performances. While the pacing is slow it is necessary to appreciate the moral and ethical ambiguity that both the prosecutor and victim must endure in their pursuits of justice or truth.

There won't be a speech into the camera delivered with the intensity of Sean Penn. Instead there will be small acts of defiance  which may not be as dramatic as American audiences are accustomed to seeing  but they are delivered with no less moral courage.Watch for small but poignant scenes between Kerry Fox and the President of the tribunal or between Kerry Fox's character and her immediate boss. Is the prosecutor merely acting as a person that is bitter about losing out on a promotion or is he she motivated by higher purposes? Is Anamaria Marinca's character motivated to release a personal secret or seek justice? See if you think her character is seeking redemption and release from testifying. The relationship with her husband and how she deals with her secret are telling. This is not a person that would tell the world on Oprah  she seeks something greater than personal therapy.The title remains intriguing. What storm are they referring to? The vicious acts that set into motion the plot? Or the response of the prosecutor and the victim to not only the criminal acts but the manner by which the international court decides to confront them? Don't pay any attention to the New York Times review. The reviewer missed the mark. While I agree with the reviewer that the movie was slow paced I disagree that it fails to maintain its promise by the end. This is a movie that is consistent and powerful to the end.

	schema:reviewBody "STORM works best as a legal thriller I'm a criminal lawyer. Its depictions of witnesses evidentiary rules discussions with opposing counsel etc. are done very well. STORM's acting dialog shooting and direction are done professionally and convincingly e.g. the film never drags and until the end there's nothing that drags or takes one out of the film. The intertwining of the political influences is also done well. It should be made clear that while the Balkans tragedy serves as the vehicle for STORM this is not a movie about those horrors in particular i.e. the same film may have made using a different conflict.Having said so much STORM lacks passion. Its as if a talented group of people were tasked with making the movie put in many hard days then went back to pursuing what they truly loved. The lack of passion may result from STORM's lack of evil clearly depicted villains i.e. stuff which arouses viewers. Indeed hardly any background or time is given the Defendant in the docket for the entire film. The horrific scenes of the crimes involved are not seen but provided via the courtroom testimony. I understand that such may be precisely what the makers of STORM wanted to do i.e. not be explicit to highlight the routine and tedium of legal work. If so they succeeded. Maybe too well.".

The cast were complete unknowns to me but clearly that is because I have a poor knowledge of rising European actors a work in progress the actors delivered most convincing performances.This movie brings you inside the International Criminal Tribunal where you will discover the enormous challenges this organization has to overcome to fulfill its mandate the utter frustrating obstacles the prosecutors administrator researchers minders and others have to contend with on a regular basis and realize that the more passionate and dedicated prosecutors are the more likely they are to find justice is an elusive ideal and a practically unrealistic hope they are best not to invest to much in. You will feel the same sad resignation to reality as that which the movie The Whistleblower mad me feel see my review of same.The main character in this movie Hannah Maynard played by Kerry Fox is undermined at each of her attempts to make progress in the case of genocidal murderer rapist and most despicable military commander she has been assigned to prosecute. A desperate victim of that commander's atrocities resorts to false testimony in a futile attempt to help the case before the tribunal and as a result makes it all but impossible for Maynard to proceed when the defense attorney debunks the perjurer. Riddled with shame and despair the false witness kills himself. Maynard strongminded sense of purpose manages to find a related real but reluctant witness a rape victim herself engaging that new witness to help but too late to satisfy the court's protocols has now to deal with a new situation.

The criminal walks away the victimwitness' spirit is broken and so is Maynard.I enjoyed the experience but the spoiler I just blurted above will not likely make you want to see the movie sorry.

Excellent natural acting by the whole cast that gives the film an air of actually being a documentary as much as a theatrical film. The court proceedings both the public part as well as the behind the scenes maneuvering was quite accurate from my layman's point of view. The cinematography was very good as well providing several interesting camera positions in many scenes. The only unrealistic part of the film is towards the end when the female prosecutor begins to lose her professionalism and becomes emotionally involved with the case. That she discovers in the end that her diplomat husband was actually conspiring with the defendant for political reasons was Much TOO coincidental for me as well. Overall though I would DEFINITELY view this film again now having benefited from seeing it the first time. ... joseph.kulik.919gmail.com".

Complicated interesting emotionally twisted flawed human beings just looking to be loved and accepted.

Like an addict knowing full well the consequences that will have to be paid seeking out this alluring drug nevertheless they are driven to seek it out like a moth to the flame...Ritters character has an innocent charm about him. A boyish lovable quality that is undeniable. You can clearly see the flaws in him but strangely you look away taking a risk on him in the chance that he will redeem himself once again. He is relentless in his efforts to win the heart and attention of this emotionally damaged and yet highly intelligent woman. How many people do we know like this is our own lives??? These irresistible charmers that seem to win their way into our hearts against our own better judgment? Palka's character clearly a highly intelligent woman who can verbally bash a man into a bloody pulp has been verbally and sexually abused by her father since she was a little girl. We later see her emotionally unravel as Ritters character bravely tries to pull her out from her isolated world breaking the routine of her dysfunctional patterns. I am constantly reminded as I watch this film how real these characters are! They are not unlike so many of the dysfunctional people around us. Misfit loners abused and wounded by the predators of this world left to cope with the damage they leave behind. It takes tremendous courage to open your self up to love and healing after such abuse and betrayal of trust has been broken. These two characters portray that there is hope in the healing power of love!".

I'm not sure since his role was so small what good it does to cast a known celebrity in a film full of unknowns.

The whole concept boils down to she's crazyselfishaddictedbrokea cheateretc etc etc but SO DAMN CUTE or HOT that the main male character in said movie ignores all the obvious warning signs that she's not relationship material and often turns their life upside down for her. Or at the very least ignores the normal stable girl who is in love with him in favor of the rush of being with the crazy girl. This movie seems to be telling the opposite story. The male protagonist is portrayed as being sympathetic and a suitable partner for the female lead despite the fact that he puts out all kinds of shady vibes almost immediately. He lies. He follows her and peeps in her window. He repeatedly shows up uninvited guilts her into letting him sleep on her couch and brings her porn Yes she likes porn but still...not really the first move of a Prince Charming. However I've seen a lot of reviews suggesting that the relationship in this movie is good for her or healthy and I have to say I disagree. I didn't like this movie I'll just put it out there. It was slowpaced and honestly after the initial peeping I thought it was going to go in a much different direction. As much as I've enjoyed the lead actor in other roles his character here creeped me out intensely. I think this movie puts out the Manic Pixie Dream Girl vibe for women. I think if she had found out the way the relationship actually started the average woman would be incredibly freaked out. I kept waiting for things to catch up with them for her to find out and she never did. Because of that I just couldn't feel any support for their relationship. In truth it gave me a nasty almost rapey vibe. However it seems to foster that the creepy guy who followed you home and peeped in your window MIGHT BE MR. RIGHT stereotype the male equivalent of the MPDD vibe and I just couldn't get past that. Knowing what we know as the viewer and knowing she doesn't know and he won't tell her almost made me feel like an accomplice in his misleading of his potential girlfriend and it just left me with a sad shady feeling. The movie presents an unnaturally positive attitude towards overtly creepy and socially unacceptable behavior and I just can't cosign that. I don't think anyone would want their best friendsisteretc getting involved with a former addict who has followed them peeped in their window and lied about it multiple times to continue to see her. In fact if you remove the fact that she stupidly let him in you have classic stalking behavior. Beyond this I found this movie depressing bleak and long even though it wasn't necessarily. It was one of those movies where I just kept checking the time because it felt like it would never end. I'm no activist but I wish writers would stop enforcing these silly stereotypes in romantic movies. No wonder boys and girls alike have a twisted idea of what love should be. This is why we can't have nice things people. 1 out of 10 stars AKA that's another hour and half I'm never getting back. A disappointment. In fact Mark Webber is the only thing that made this flick bearable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Took in this independent film from newcomer Marianna Palka at Sundance 2008. The audience was overwhelmingly appreciative of the film though some were left perplexed due to the funny title which implied a comedy. I'll admit I assumed from the synopsis and title that this was going to be a comedy a porn loving women is courted by a video store clerk definitely sounds like the makings for some good sexual innuendo and lots of genitalia jokes. In fairness the Good Dick is very humorous in parts though much of the time the humor comes from dysfunctional sexual material that would be uncomfortable if taken too seriously. The lead male played by Jason Ritter is a down on his luck and low on funds video store clerk who attaches himself to a shy and highly dysfunctional women played by Palka. Palka's character rents adult movies at his video store and wants nothing more then to be absolutely left alone. This obviously makes for an interesting courtship and interesting dates do occur the video store clerk brings over his personal playlist of pornos and the women begrudgingly agrees to share her viewing time with him thus allowing the chance for something more. Palkas character shows signs of hope in letting our video store clerk into her life but no sooner does she lower her defenses then she aims to hurt him in an attempt to keep her life less complicated and keep her personal problems hidden. Some awkward moments create some good laughs but the laughter is just a slight distraction from the obvious pain that stirs deep within the women. Bits and pieces of ideas float throughout the movie hinting at the ending but when the ending does eventually come it is still moving and should strike a chord with anyone who has ever cared so much about someone that they were willing to endure almost anything to connect with them or were on the other end and had to finally deal with something deep inside that they wished they could leave untouched and forgotten in the past. While the movie misses on a few scenes its still a very well done attempt at the strong subject matter.It will take a certain kind of audience to truly appreciate this movie for what it is that could be tough for a lot of people who are uncomfortable viewing subject matter dealing with sexual dysfunction and the boatload of issues that brings into relationships. Regardless of content though Marianna Palka should be applauded loudly for all her work that went into this film it's hard to imagine that she wrotedirected and acted in her first feature film. Also Jason Ritter is outstanding in this role and obviously deserves more of our time.".

More alone because though the pure unconditional love offered up is exquisitely beautiful it is extremely rare and I doubt seriously it will ever be offered to me. Except by God of course.

The pace of the story is sometimes a little too slow which is the only reason I have given it 810 as opposed to full marks but overall it moves from one moment to the next giving you enough time to consider what is happening without running off and not allowing you time to understand what is going on.Palca and Ritter play their roles superbly though you never find out their names and you genuinely warm to both the lead characters ably supported by the rest of the cast.It is not your typical boy meets girl she's not keen but he wins her heart eventually story at times you genuinely feel for Ritters character as he struggles to win his girls heart and even think it might be better for him to give up whist she continually rebukes him and discourages him at every possible opportunity.It is a film that everyone who has ever tried to win the heart of someone can relate to. Another wonderful element of this picture is that you never really know what time period it is being conducted over although you get the impression that it is a course of months.As the film moves forward you realise that both characters have had destructive pasts and are dealing with them the best way possible and whist you never are told what happened to Palca's character there is subtle nods that lead you to make your own decisions.On the whole I left ready to trumpet the beauty of this film to my friends and coworkers happily going to see it again if they cant find anyone else to go with them and will definitely be getting the DVD when it is released.I cant recommend this film strongly enough go and watch it and then tell everyone you know to watch it too.".

	schema:reviewBody "To be honest I'm rather divided by this film. On one hand I'm intrigued and fascinated by the characters on the other hand I'm slightly disturbed.There's not much story here. Basically a young video store clerk became obsessed with a rather weird and introverted woman who is a frequent customer. And then he decided to stalk her.Fair enough we all have had weird crush on certain somebody we met in our lives and we all may have mentally stalked someone. But to act it out like in this movie is rather disturbing. The movie turned it into a rather awkward but nonetheless sweet love story but in real life who knows how ugly it can get.Both characters have some severe issues which I won't spell out the specifics. Suffice to say that we all have some personal demons that made us do some stupid or weird things or act in some unhealthy ways. That's why at some level I can relate to certain scenes or certain dialogue. On the other hand to put it bluntly the two main characters in this movie are pretty sick mentally. When I say sick I didn't mean they are disgusting or anything. I basically meant that they are not healthy.There's a major problem with this movie it basically copped out in the end by cheating its way out with a rather clich ending. But I assume it's the only way out by then since both characters though likable are so damaged to the point that it simply can not be fixed within two hours.If I had watched this movie few years ago I would be totally lost. Now after going through some really messed up things and messed up people I am able to understand the characters in this movie. Trust me I am sympathetic to the girl though I find her to be a lost case. To our stalker boy he's an emotional train wreck with criminal potentials. This movie save the ending can be a great case study for a shrink.Though I enjoyed the movie I have to say that the mind behind this movie is rather disturbed as well. That's probably why she's great too as the female lead. I got a feeling that she playing herself to a great extend.".

It's a simple situational setup that masks the layers beneath. The woman is cold and distant and seemingly not interested in a relationship of any kind despite the constant attempts by the video clerk. In fact she treats him pretty bad. Not until the end when we meet her father do we really understand her. She's been sexually abused by him the first man in her life and that shapes how she interacts with other men. It now becomes interesting that her erotic interest lie in soft core porn porn without penetration as the clerk tells her. The clerk too isn't without issues to be addressed. He's battled drug addiction which may explain his addictive personality and why he won't give up on her despite the vitriolic insults and humiliation she dishes.It's been said that hurt people hurt people and that concept is exemplified well in this film. She treats him bad because that's what she knows. She maintains control of their relationship because she knows how awful it feels to be the one being controlled. Many times throughout the film she dominates him even simulating rape to humiliation and it's painfully clear that she's been through hell.Through it all we are left with a hopeful ending. A confrontation with her father and reconciliation with her video clerk are small steps in her progression. In the end we're left with two damaged people moving forward together.

	schema:reviewBody " This review may contain spoilers  This movie is not about a troubled young woman and a hopeless video guy. It is about any couple who meet and overcome their neuroses enough to be able to get along and open up to each other. Usually people abandon their partner too soon before the rough edges have been knocked off and smoothed out enough to become livable.Yes it is a story of support unfailing love and belief that helped Mariana Palka's character deal with her past and finally face the present.But who doesn't carry problems from the past with them? And who's spouse doesn't exhibit issues that arise from childhood challenges.That's why i love this movie I can totally relate to it and like Jason Ritter's character i know that we can help our spouse as they help us. It takes time patience and love lots of it.If you are perfect and have had perfect partners then you won't understand this movie. However if you are human with the usual foibles and have had relationships with other humans you will find something rewarding about this unusual portrayal of a very usual human condition.".

It is about any couple who meet and overcome their neuroses enough to be able to get along and open up to each other. Usually people abandon their partner too soon before the rough edges have been knocked off and smoothed out enough to become livable.Yes it is a story of support unfailing love and belief that helped Mariana Palka's character deal with her past and finally face the present.But who doesn't carry problems from the past with them? And who's spouse doesn't exhibit issues that arise from childhood challenges.That's why i love this movie I can totally relate to it and like Jason Ritter's character i know that we can help our spouse as they help us.

Well I am celebrating my download. This is on itunes for purchase andor rent. There are a few disturbing moments but I really enjoyed the acting plot and music. This film is about humanity and the power of supportive relationships. My favorite quote I love you and this fight is over. Go for it this one is worth seeing. I hope this film receives more attention. The acting is so real I did not want this to end. Do not let the title prevent you for watching it really is a great film.

Although this is a flawed movie there is much to like here however. Jason Ritter is the best thing about this thinly plotted indie antiromance. The scenes of Ritter and his video store pals including Martin Starr one Director Judd Apatow's regular players provide a nice backdrop for the main romance. And Ritter's desperate need for human connection feels sincere  you are rooting for him despite the seemingly impossible quest to reach Palka's damaged character. Viewers however may be let down at the end when things get wrapped up a bit too cleanly like a bad Lifetime movie. I would have liked to see Palka's character struggle more with her own demons and find a way out that was less predictable and abrupt.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of Warner Brothers' early talking picture experiments made in late 1929 and released in 1930. The main thrust behind Warner Brothers' being first in talking pictures with The Jazz Singer died with its premiere  Sam Warner died just before the Jazz Singer opened. Since the other brothers had been dragged kicking and screaming into the talking picture era Warner Brothers fumbled around from that point until late 1930 when they truly began to find their stride. This film is from their fumbling era of 19281930.That doesn't mean that this picture or any of their other experiments are necessarily bad it just means that they are truly experimenting at this point with somewhat kooky plots they would never try just a couple of years later. Warner Brothers was very fortunate during this time to continue a long running relationship they had with one star of the stage  John Barrymore  and begin a relationship with another  Mr. George Arliss. His acting is the main reason to watch this film.Here Arliss plays the wise and wizened Raja of the mythical kingdom of Rukh. The day before his three brothers are to be executed for an assassination of a British official in India three British citizens crash land in his kingdom having gotten lost in the fog over the Himilayas. The primitive people of his kingdom who worship a green goddess see this as a gift from the goddess  a British life each for the lives of the Raja's three brothers taken by the British. The three British prisoners had quite a bit of drama in their lives even before landing in this mess. Major Crespin H.B. Warner has been an unfaithful husband to his wife Lucilla Alice Joyce who has forgiven him but not forgotten. The pilot Dr. Basil Traherne Ralph Forbes and Lucilla have been in love for years but have done nothing about it because Lucilla is still technically married and wants to remain so because of her two children.The Raja is technically and politically astute. He actually wants to kill his British prisoners as a kind of thumb in the collective eye to the British for keeping the Indians in subjection. However he is also smart enough to know his goose would be cooked if the British ever knew what he did. He also doesn't really want his brothers released because their deaths eliminate any possible wranglings over his throne should he die before his own children reach adulthood. Learning his lesson from British and Russian history surviving uncles are not always so kind to the surviving underage progeny of deceased kings. We learn all of this from Arliss' own lips as he gives a superb performance every bit as good as the one he gave in Disraeli just in a more inane plot.The Raja does offer one concession he will spare the life of Lucilla if she agrees to be his consort and bear him a son. He even agrees to smuggle her children out of India and bring them to her so she can raise them. As for the other two they are pretty much condemned to die but there is one hope for them all. There is a wireless device in the Raja's castle with which  if they can get access  they might be able to get a message to India. Also the Raja has as his assistant a man of British birth named Watkins a condemned criminal if he returns to his homeland but inside Rukh he is the Raja's link to the culture and habits of the west and more importantly the Raja's wireless operator.The kookiest part of this film  Nigel De Brulier as a wild looking bearded man who is always looking through keyholes and  for some reason  is given to carrying around a trident. I highly recommend this film to the fans of early talkies. This one will hold your interest.".

Early talkies tended to appear very claustrophobicwith all the action confined to small space on screen due to primitive recording equipment that could only pick up sound directly under the microphones. In addition several innovations were still in the futuresuch as providing incidental music during the film. Believe it or not to get music an orchestra had to perform live just off camera! And finally some of these sound films did not feature integrated sound by encoding it on the side of the film strip but on a separate recordwhich caused MANY problems with perfect synchronization and the records wearing out after only a few performances. This Warner BrothersVitaphone release is one of these sound films employing a record. However in an odd twist years after the film was made the accompanying disk was transferred to film stock. To do so the left edge of the film strip needed to have the sound encoding addedexplaining why a bit of the left side of the print is clipped. So when you see the film bear all this in mind.The film is set in a mythical kingdom along the border with India. A group of three travelers have trouble with their airplane and are forced to land. At first their reception by the local king George Arliss is very cordial. However he and the travelers know the same secretthe Indian government has three of Arliss' countrymen and are planning on executing them. Now with these three travelers in his control Arliss can hold them hostage and possibly kill them in retribution. Naturally the three want to escape or contact the British authorities in India about their plight.The Green Goddess is divided into roughly two sectionsthe first one that consists of Arliss and the three acting cordial and then verbally sparring and the second involving their escape plans. The initial segment is very talky and staticthe second very violent and more exciting with a horrifying scene near the end. However at no point in all this does any of this seem realistic in the least. Part of this is because the British Arliss is a bit silly as an Asian. The rest of this is that the script is very old fashioned and never the least bit believable. However for fans of oldtime cinema it's still worth seeing mostly because it's one of Arliss' surviving films and there just aren't that many opportunities to see this famous silent starmost of his films have simply become lost to the ravages of time. Not a great film but worth while if you are a true cinema freak.".

The original novel is told slowly with a lot of humor wit and delicacy the movie instead tries to squeeze the whole plot into two hours which results in an unbearable speed of pictures scenes halftold stories and fast  colorful scenes without sense simply not nice to see any more. It takes twenty minutes until some recognizable scene shows up. Half of the story is invented which is of course disappointing when you know the novel.It could have been a good movie despite of all this when you forget the novel and see it as a different story. But here why on earth is the acting so poor? The actors talk laugh move and behave like an average 21th century German filmcast. No one talks the northern dialect and there is no sign of class differences in the language. They try but they don't succeed. Just think of Gosford Park  Downtown Abbey one of my favorites where every detail just fits into the time picture.Most ridiculous scene main characters who play the violin but can't. Total nogo. Moving around with a bow holding the instrument without moving the fingers while great melodies are heard come on you can do this in some cheap production or in a TV commercial but not in a movie that wants to be taken serious.I tried to watch it anyway just for enjoying some historic sites but impossible. Stopped halfway. Boring kitsch annoying. Please excuse my poor English I am still too upset... man... incredible.".

	schema:headline " The downfall of a family";
	schema:reviewBody "The 2008 movie Buddenbrooks directed by Heinrich Breloer is not the first time that this Thomas Mann novel was put on screen. Breloer made Die Manns  Ein Jahrhundertroman earlier a film about the man who wrote Buddenbrooks and actually Armin MuellerStahl played Thomas Mann. Here he plays the patriarch of the Buddenbrooks family. Apart from him this film has quite an interesting cast some of Germany's finest actors and actresses August Diehl Jessica Schwarz Alexander Fehling Iris Berben Justus von Dohnnyi may all be known to those interested in German cinema. The film runs for roughly 2.5 hours and is very long but I rarely felt that it dragged. Good job all in all. The first half hour is about Jessica Schwarz' character and her unhappy marriage with another merchant. She never loved him but her father did not allow her to marry the one she actually loves as he lacked standing.Actually this film worked best as a pure drama. There are some moments when it tries to include some humor but none of these really work like the greedy cake eater or laughing about one guy's wart. If anything funny worked it was Sylvester Groth's weird character with his very unique smile. However I would almost say his complete inclusion and appearance was also in fact dramatic. I was a bit surprised to see Jean Buddenbrook already die before the onehour mark but from that moment on it was all about the lives of the three children. We find out about the next unhappy relationships from everybody involved how one son is very fragile while the other tries to lead the company just like his father did and how these two keep having conflicts for the rest of the film. One scene I found particularly interesting is when Diehl's character's girlfriend a singer is pregnant and the other Buddenbrook son becomes a father too with a violinist. The reactions from the mother played by Iris Berben are so different. The other son was played by Mark Waschke not a name to many but he held his own very well against the more famous cast members. Berben however is actually forgettable. Very stereotypical character and performance with little to remember. MuellerStahl stays in the mind much more.In the end there is a few more deaths and the downfall of the Buddenbrook empire is sealed genetically and economically. As a whole I enjoyed this movie. It is neither extremely outstanding nor bad but I felt it was an interesting watch. One of the things I liked most was the makeup or maybe also casting work. Waschke looked a lot like Diehl in many scenes which makes sense as they were brothers and Schwarz' aging makeup is just as convincing as her similarity in looks compared to her movie mother Iris Berben.".

	schema:headline " You're Crazy Not to Go Wild If You're Theodora";
	schema:reviewBody "Irene Dunne plays Theodora Lynn a proper New England girl. She also happens to go by the name of Caroline Adams. Secluded all her life with her two prudish aunts and the other puritans of the highly regarded Lynn Literary Circle she sublimates her revolt as the secret author of a tantalizing bestselling novel. This is her sublimation of revolt. The movie illustrates the makeover of an allegedly homely and introverted girl into the most wild and highspirited lady. And it marks a difference between wild and silly as Uncle John says A Lynn may go wild but never silly. See title for more info on how Theodora goes.She lives in Lynnfield named after the Lynn family whose only legacy are Theodora and her two aunts Elsie and Mary. The two oracles says Thomas Mitchell editor of The Lynnfield Bugle the pulse of the town. It's an enticing note for the movie to start on a brassy Thomas Mitchell carving out the lovable spirited personality he'd bring to Stagecoach fending off puritanical spinsters protesting that the titillating novel he's featuring is not fit to print. Indeed the members are singleminded not to allow sexy trash like this come right into our homes and corrupt the morals of our youth. When Mitchell gets to have a word he blames the community for denying social progress. But the group deems it their obligation to keep Lynnfield the one pure Godfearing place left in the world.We chuckle knowingly when the action then cuts to New York where a publisher reads an irate wire from Lynnfield. Theodora is so frantic she thinks Caroline Adams is depraved. Was he raised in a small town by two maiden aunts? Has he lectured Sunday School or played church organ for years? Categorically not. Undaunted he knows that nobody dumps an audience this big a career this sensational due to scruples. That's the reality one curtailed by Hollywood soon after. But the censors were new and hadn't yet learned to keep its right up so here we have a forgotten earlysound keepsake of silverscreen censure of moral censorship frivolous and wacky but by god not silly.It's this uncensored rebellious energy that I think lends itself to a creative stylishness rare to early American cinema. Shortlived Russian immigrant director Richard Boleslawski brings a particularly effective and stylishly economical editing and visual direction to this appropriately fastpaced early romcom. Like all the early romcoms its time played a big role in not just its plot but its attitudes which on the one hand make Theodora Goes Wild refreshingly irreverent but on the other still outmoded in certain varying personal ways. Theodora meets her dapper illustrator in the form of Melvyn Douglas. Here's a persona who bursts into the movie mugging blustering and making a domineering nuisance of himself. Theodora opposes his idea of a writer who ought to live life and so he enlists himself to liberate her. And yet judging this behavior as extraordinarily narcissistic overbearing and cocky against the alpha male fantasy in romantic comedies of the era would be judging one against a homogeneous crowd.Women were to be rescued shown the way wisened up to the real world. And consistent with that role Theodora is finally inspired by this dashing leaderofthepack type to run amok even exceeding him in mischief and cheek. She now exhibits what he's urged on her so winningly. She relates with dignity how she told the town off It's a free country she's an adult and phooey to anyone who judges her for what she does. Indeed Theodora woos infamy summoning one outrage after another. But to her disappointment beneath his supposedly freethinking facade Michael is as soft and repressed as she was. Michael is ensnared in a hateful marriage on behalf of his father's political livelihood and Theodora guarantees to return his favor with a taste of his own juice. Usurping into Michael's apartment she dresses in feathers and gives shocking interviews to the tabloids. They rotate. Now it's Theodora's task to free him from his bourgeois sense of decorum.Regardless all that good stuff is just decoration. Actually it's foundation but there is a definite sublime enchantment in its star Irene Dunne. She played more kinds of roles in more kinds of movies than most of her female peers and yet is arguably more natural spontaneous and memorable than any of them. In fact Theodora Goes Wild is her first comedy. She walks right into it fully and effortlessly possessed of herself and manages to both be better than all of her female comedy contemporaries and completely different from all of them as well. I'll even go as far as to say that the movies owe more to Dunne than Claudette Colbert Carole Lombard and Myrna Loy put together. Her Theodora became the forerunner of copious romantic comedies like The Awful Truth and Ninotchka all anchored in similar principles the enchanting transformation of their female protagonists. The Awful Truth made a star out of Cary Grant. And in his later costars were looking for Dunnelike qualities. This is her show and like it always is in such cases absolutely no one else could've compared.".

	schema:reviewBody "Irene Dunne breaks out of small town conventions in Theodora Goes Wild a 1936 comedy also starring Melvyn Douglas Thomas Mitchell and Spring Byington. Dunne plays Theodora who lives a sterile life with her two aunts in a small Puritan judgmental town. However she's got them all beat because she's living a double life  in New York City she's Caroline Adams a hot romance novelist who put the capital L in LOVE. Her scandalous bestseller is in the process of being banned by the town literary society. While in New York visiting her disapproved of uncle she meets a friend of her publisher's the flirtatious irreverent Michael Douglas. He doesn't know her real name or her literary alter ego so to prove to him she's no prude she gets drunk and goes to his apartment  of course she leaves screaming  but in doing so drops a few papers that tell him who she is and where she lives. He soon shows up in her home town as a down on his luck man seeking work and she's more or less blackmailed into giving him a job as the family gardener.This is a delightful comedy buoyed by the marvelous acting of Irene Dunne and Melvyn Douglas. The points are hit a little too hard however so that both characters come off as very annoying and exasperating at times. The fault lies in the script because I don't think those two actors ever made a wrong move. Douglas who in later life would prove himself one of the great actors of all time sails through this film as he sailed through so many others in roles that gave no hint of his enormous abilities. Here he's charming smooth and attractive inspiring Theodora to take some risks  though he's got a few skeletons he fails to mention to her. Dunne is great as the staid spinster who becomes the talk of New York with her wild outfits saucy attitude and smart remarks.Underneath it all of course it's a love story some innuendo you don't find in a lot of '30s comedies which adds to the fun. Highly recommended.".

Dunne is great as the staid spinster who becomes the talk of New York with her wild outfits saucy attitude and smart remarks.Underneath it all of course it's a love story some innuendo you don't find in a lot of '30s comedies which adds to the fun. Highly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "Theodora Goes Wild is perhaps the greatest sleeper in film history. When other comedies such as Midnight Lady Eve It Happened One Night and especially the overrated Bringing Up Baby are touted with 4 star ratings this relatively unknown gem sweeps them all away in its irresistible path. One of the finest comedies ever filmed this is a masterpiece in every way. The direction is superb the writing sparkles with a wit that time has not dimmed. But the frosting on its cake is the comic genius of Irene Dunne one of Hollywood's most underrated actresses. This her first real comedy is an object lesson to any aspiring comedienne so perfect is her timing and delivery of virtually every line. This film should be studied by every student in the field of film and enjoyed by countless others who have never even heard of it. It's too bad that Irene Dunne is not given the credit she truly deserves. My bet is that in 50 years she will be considered perhaps the finest Hollywood actress of her time. If you think I'm joking just watch her in Back Street Love Affair much better in my opinion than its more popular remake Affair To Remember Show Boat I Remember Mama this film The Awful Truth A Guy Named Joe Anna and The King of Siam Life With Father Ann Vickers........".

Some of those small New England towns like Lynnfield are not bastions of conservatism any longer. Today the home of a well known author like Irene Dunne would be a tourist attraction.But back in the Thirties this still was the New England of Calvin Coolidge and descendants of the town founder just don't go writing romance novels. But that's what Irene Dunne is doing only its under a pseudonym lest the good people of Lynnfield make life uncomfortable for herself and her two maiden aunts.Irene's cover will be blown though when she meets her illustrator at her publisher. Melvyn Douglas is quite smitten with her and he follows her back to Lynnfield from New York and persuades her that she ought to live life a little and not just vicariously through her novels.Dunne takes his advice with a vengeance after he's thoroughly embarrassed her. But when Theodora Lynn does go wild she takes no prisoners. Coming out in public under her pseudonym of Caroline Adams Dunne gets fame and notoriety confused. Today she would be big time tabloid fodder and pays Douglas back in a way he can only blame on himself.It's charming pair of leads with a delightful supporting cast that play their roles to perfection. A particular favorite of mine is publisher Thurston Hall who gets to do a drunk scene with Dunne something the very proper Mr. Hall didn't often do.Irene Dunne got one of her five Oscar nominations for playing Theodora Lynn aka Caroline Adams but lost in the big sweepstakes to Luise Rainer for The Great Ziegfeld.I'm not sure how you could do Theodora Goes Wild today though. I can see the town billboard on the Massachusetts Turnpike Welcome to Lynnfield Home of Caroline Adams.".

	schema:reviewBody "Theodora Goes Wild was released two years into Hollywood's production code and yet the entire premise of the movie is one huge how did they get away with that?!. Only The Lady Eve Ball of Fire and The Moon Is Blue perhaps out do it in terms of most precode postcode films. A film with a heroine who writes risqu novels and rebels against her ultraconservative Godfearing Helen Lovejoy type aunts who deem it their obligation to keep the fictional town of Lynnfield Connecticut yet another screwball comedy set in the state the one last pure Godfearing town in America. Moral puritans who try to ruin everyone else's fun and claim to speak for a larger group every generation has them. Theodora Goes Wild proceeds with an ending in which the once silent majority Lynnfield show their true colours.  This movie hasn't lost an ounce of relevance for today's world.The scene at the beginning of Theodora Goes Wild in which the local literary group read passages from the latest scandalous novel from author Caroline Adams really is jawdropping. However the local newspaper run by Thomas Mitchell starts printing a serialization of the scandalous bestseller in an effort to show the town how people live love and learn in the real world. Little do they know Caroline Adams is their own Theodora Lynn a Sunday school teacher who's been playing the church organ since she was 15. Under the rules of the Production Code a character must receive a punishment for their socalled immoral actions. Not here though! Despite Theodora rebelling against her Godfearing upbringing she receives no punishment. Whoever said old movies are stuffy and the dreaded O word outdated?Despite writing highly successful adult novels Theodora's conscious still objects to it and thus requires a bit of Melvyn Douglas as Michael Grant to ignite Theodora's sexual awakening after he seduces her while wearing a vest as his only piece of torso. Despite neither of these two performers being sex symbols it's surprising how steamy this scene comes off. Melvyn Douglas plays a potentially creepy stalker but is charming enough and carefree to a comic degree that he gets away with it. The man has adapt comedic timing I never tire of that whistling of his and it's easy to see why Douglas was one of the most reliable male costars of the time. However what succeeds in making him a more interesting character is the discovery that Michael is actually just as repressed as Theodora due to being enslaved in a hateful marriage on behalf of his father's political livelihood. Once Michael liberates Theodora from her small town way of life she returns the favour and liberates him from his New York bourgeois decorum.".

But about a quarter of the way through it I found myself asking When is this thing going to get funny? The subject matterhow the reactionary repressive mentality of a clique of smalltown religious zealots stifles any kind of individual creativity at allis more suited to a drama than a comedy and I think this film would have actually worked better as a drama with some comedy thrown in which both Dunne and Douglas were more than capable of than just as a comedy alone which it really isn't. There are a few amusing moments in it but not nearly enough to be classified as a screwball comedy. Thurston Hall is his usual amusing blustery self and Spring Byington is good as the town's twofaced gossip but that's about it. Dunne and Douglas try hard but they're just not given much to work with.I know that a lot of people think this film is on a par with Nothing Sacred My Man Godfrey or Twentieth Century but I just can't see it.".

The people in town were outraged however they liked reading the articles in the paper and soon the people decided to tell Jed Waterbury to remove the book and the feature in his paper. It just so happens that the author of this book comes from Lynnfield and no one would ever expect just who it could be.

	schema:reviewBody "Irene Dunne had been in Hollywood six years and made 20 feature films before this her first crack at comedy. And what a success it was and is. Theodora Goes Wild is a wacky comedyromance that introduced the comedic talents of Irene Dunne to audiences. The super talented wonderful musical voice and dancer Dunne continued to make a variety of films  drama romance musicals mystery war Westerns most of which were big hits. But none could top the comedies she would yet make. Dunne is one of the great actresses of Hollywood who never won an Oscar though she was nominated four times. Dunne was one of the three best comediennes from Hollywood's golden age. The other two were Jean Arthur and Carole Lombard. There were some other very good female comedy performers Myrna Loy Claudette Colbert etc. but the top three were in a level above all others. They were the masters of oneliners themselves quick quips snappy dialog clever witticisms and above all else tremendous facial expressions. By their knowing glances pursing of the lips biting a lip looking askance raising eyebrows frowning puzzling looks and any number of faces they could clearly broadcast the humor of a scene. They were the best at it where many other fine female comedians were in more serious or straightfaced or blas comedic roles. Theodora Goes Wild is a hilarious film of give and take. First it's the male Michael Grant who is the purveyor and Theodora Lynn who is the victim. But she turns the tables and the comedy ratchets up a couple of notches. Dunne plays Theodora and Melvyn Douglas is Michael Grant. A wonderful supporting cast includes Spring Byington as Rebecca Perry Thomas Mitchell as Jed Waterbury Robert Greig as Uncle John Thurston Hall as Arthur Stevenson Nana Bryant as his wife Ethel Elisabeth Risdon as Aunt Mary and Margaret McWade as Aunt Elsie.This is a superb comedy to add to any film library. Here are some sample lines from the movie. For more funny dialog see the Quotes section here on this film's IMDb Web page.Michael Say this place is crawling with aunts.Ethel Stevenson That adorable young thing is an unholy terror on wheels. There's nothing in the world more deadly than innocence on the manhunt.Jed I guess I know a righteous spanking when I get one.Agnes You know this woman's really out to break up our marriage Michael. Maybe you and I will root for her.".

A wonderful supporting cast includes Spring Byington as Rebecca Perry Thomas Mitchell as Jed Waterbury Robert Greig as Uncle John Thurston Hall as Arthur Stevenson Nana Bryant as his wife Ethel Elisabeth Risdon as Aunt Mary and Margaret McWade as Aunt Elsie.This is a superb comedy to add to any film library. Here are some sample lines from the movie. For more funny dialog see the Quotes section here on this film's IMDb Web page.Michael Say this place is crawling with aunts.Ethel Stevenson That adorable young thing is an unholy terror on wheels. There's nothing in the world more deadly than innocence on the manhunt.Jed I guess I know a righteous spanking when I get one.Agnes You know this woman's really out to break up our marriage Michael. Maybe you and I will root for her.";

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Irene Dunne's and not having managed to catch up with Theodora Goes Wild I was looking forward to finally getting to see this movie after having read the lavish praise heaped on it on this site. Having said that I have to admit that while yes it was amusing it was very much of a onenote idea that was stretched very thin. Dunne as always was at the top of her form and her talents in all departments were very much on display. What did let the movie down was a weak script and an irritatingly hammy performance by the usually reliable Melvyn Douglas. One only has to look at Ninotchka to see how good he can be when his comedy acting has a serious side to it. His character in Theodora Goes Wild was just too silly to be believable. The smalltown sequences were charming in their way but after a while became tedious with repetition. Thomas Mitchell's scenes as editor of the local newspaper were riproaring first class which made one want for more. Would I recommend this movie? Yes if you're a fan of Irene Dunne's and want to watch her comedic talents at work. Several postings on this site have recommended The Awful Truth as a mustsee. Well yes if you're a Dunne fan but here again there are moments when the script sags and both Dunne and Cary Grant both consummate professionals are skating on very thin ice pulling the movie onward through sheer force of personality. If you really want to see Irene Dunne at her very very best then you should catch her in the much better written My Favorite Wife or Love Affair both infinitely superior to their later remakes. In these two movies her talents REALLY soar!".

It is all about smallminded bigotry in smallminded Americans. Given its time  the 1930s  that smallmindedness is linked to living in a small town. Unfortunately today location has nothing to do with it there are smallminded Americans in our biggest cities and our suburbs. But the movie has lost none of its relevance. It is very definitely a movie that calls out for a modern remake. Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore and in this case that is a loss for all of us.".

Neither one is at their best here plodding through a limp comedy that has not worn well at all. A few smart witticisms would have helped but the script is a painfully dull affair about a novelist smothered by the hypocrisy of living in a small town where the latest bestseller is causing a stirand happens to have been written by her. It may have sounded good on paper but as executed here it doesn't work.Nothing can save this from sinking not long after the painful opening depicting the town gossips and then hammering home the point that they are all well overdue for a comeuppance from somebody! At least the ending gets some credit for showing a bit of daring in its comic twist but other than that it is hard to recommend this as a screwball comedy to anyone familiar with the genre. Somewhere something went very wrong. And how Irene Dunne got an Oscar nomination for this bit of trivia is a puzzlement.

	schema:reviewBody "ACT ONE In the town of Lynnfield Connecticut publisher Jed Waterbury Thomas Mitchell causes a scandal when his newspaper publishes a serialization of The Sinner a risqu bestseller by Caroline Adams. The local Lynnfield Literary Society a group of catty gossiping ladies led by Rebecca Perry Spring Byington threatens to cancel their subscriptions unless the paper stops printing the novel. Waterbury is forced to concede.The uproar is especially troubling for Theodora Lynn Irene Dunne a member of the town's founding family who lives with her two uptight maiden aunts Elisabeth Wisdon Margaret McWade. In fact Theodora IS Caroline Adams author of The Sinner a secret she keeps from her aunts and from the town.ACT II While in New York to meet with her publisher Theodora meets Michael Grant Melvyn Douglas an obnoxious artist who designed her book's cover.Intrigued by the fact that Caroline Adams wants to keep her personal life a secret Grant follows Theodora back to Lynnfield. He then woos her with that timehonored movie technique of behaving like an ahole a ploy that seems to work only in the movies.Grant tells Theodora he's going to help her break out of her circumstances even though she repeatedly tells him she prefers to keep things as they are. Grant gets Theodora to hire him as a family gardener by blackmailing her threatening to tell her aunts that she is Caroline Adams.He takes up residence in the family's guest cottage and drives the Lynn family and the people watching the movie crazy by his constant annoying whistling and by setting his dog after the Lynn family's cat.The second act of this movie was one of the most screechinglypainful things I've watched in movies in a long time. The filmmakers treat the cat with nothing short of animal cruelty. They would be ARRESTED today for what they do on film to the cat! And we're supposed to think this is funny? But of course Theodora falls in love with Grant. But when she finally stands up to her aunts and their gossipy selfrighteous lady friends Grant leaves Theodora and flees back to New York.ACT III For some reason Theodora follows Grant back to New York. There she learns he has a wife Leona Maricle whom he does not love. But he can't divorce her because Grant's father Henry Kolker is Lt. Governor of New York and it would cause a scandal.Determined to break Michael Grant out of his circumstances as he did for her even though she didn't want him to Theodora orders her publisher to publicize her as the scandalous author Caroline Adams something she wouldn't let him do until now.Theodora becomes a celebrity author. She moves in to Michael Grant's apartment and entertains reporters there hoping to cause a scandal that will force Grant's wife to sue for divorce even though Grant himself moves out of the apartment when Theodora moves in.Side Note The filmmakers had no respect for Asians. I really hated Toki Grant's stereotypical Japanese manservant character who is always going on about his lemon pie.Of course Theodora's actions scandalize the town of Lynnfield and cause a lot of trouble for her aunts. But eventually Theodora is welcomed home by the town despite the efforts of the hypocritical gossip Rebecca Perry to make her an outcast.The Third Act of this movie ALMOST makes up for the horrible Second Act because Theodora turns the tables on Grant and drives him crazy by causing a scandal about him in the press just as he did about her in her home town. It's a very sweet payback and Irene Dunne has fun turning from a shy hometown girl into a wild celebrity author.But Theodora just doesn't realize that Michael Grant isn't worth it. Do they end up together at the end? Do they live happily ever after even though he's the most obnoxious guy she's ever met?This is a Hollywood movie. What do you think?".

Hey after all this film is 66 years old  much more than my own 60 years.At least the last half of the film turned the plot around and around and around such that every moment was fresh and hilarious.One must view this film it in its time and place in the history of cinema but in that same breath wonder why most current films are inane and lacking gravity and quality.Well in my same breath I must admit that a recent DVD rental viewing of Beautiful Mind reaffirmed my hope in films and that miracles in cinema presentation still occur when pure creativity exists in the writing and direction and content.".

Then Melvyn Douglas' pursuit of Irene Dunne might have seemed charming in a different era but it rankled me. The picture picked up steam as it went along. The banter and screwball table turning was fun. Weaknesses of both small town and big city life were touched on but the picture was never meanspirited.As one writer noted it's very much like Miracle at Morgan Creek. Both have appealing enthusiastic performances. Thomas Mitchell Irene Dunne and Melvyn Douglas all do a great job.

	schema:reviewBody "It was 1936. Irene Dunne had just finished being the lead in the popular Kern masterpiece Showboat. In it she had shown off her wondrous singing voice. One song required her to do a bit of comedy in blackface. This looked promising enough to recommend her for a lead in a straight comedy. This film is what they came up with. Apparently it was quite popular in it's day. But I submit that it hasn't aged particularly well.The plot revolves around a scandalous novel The Sinners written by a small town young woman Theodora Lynn who has adopted the pseudonym Caroline Adams to hide her identity from her 2 elderly aunts she lives with in particular and the people in her town especially the conservative Literary Circle. Thanks to the very conservative views of the town Theodore has lived a very sheltered life hardly having been beyond the borders of her town. As her illustrator Michael GrantMelvyn Douglasremarks in her book she imagines many of the things she would like to do but is afraid of disapproval. Theodora seems to agree with this. Michael has acquired the ambition to help get Theodora out of her shell and live some of the things she has written about. Initially Theodora is hesitant refusing to tell him where she liveshe finds out anyway and panicking when he makes advances on her in his NYC apartment. For some reason during his brief stay at Theodora's home he irritates everyone by whistling tunes.. Theodora retaliates by playing and singing Be Still My Heart. After finished Michael whistles again inducing Theodora to bang on the piano and muss her hair her aunts to slam the door breaking the glass portion and causing the cat to scream from having it's tail caught in the door. That should wake up the dozing audience! Then Michael hitches his adopted dog to the front of the hand mower as if he is pulling it singing Get Along Little Dogie Again this irritates the aunts. Against her objections Michael finally induces Theodora to go berry picking in the woods with him and go fishing with him where they get further acquainted. Finally Theodora gets the nerve to tell off the members of the Literary Circle including her aunts but good. She starts wearing very frilly evening gowns and gets drunk to show she's not afraid of an occasional drink. Theodora's gone wild say the women in her circle. Eventually she tells reporters that she is Caroline Adams creating a sensation in her hometown. Michael estranged from his wife tries to dissociate himself from Theodora fearing scandal relating to her will include himself and embarrass his politically important father....I leave the finale for you to see. Available at YouTube.Thomas Mitchel does a good job making the town newspaper editor interesting with limited screen time. ..Spring Byington is the most prominent of the Literary Circle and has a surprise waiting for her at the end worth fainting for. ...Thornton Hall serves as Theodora's publisher and friend and long shares her secret.".

Theodora's 'scandalous' novel 'The Sinner' was by now inevitably required by the proprieties of the Production Code to be wholly a work of her imagination and is largely forgotten as the film progresses postCode the Hays Office would never permit the notion that there could possibly have actually been any men in the life of the demure unmarried Ms Dunne before she put pen to paper. Five years earlier it would have been a very different story indeed and the escapist fantasy of 'Theodora Goes Wild'  even down to its innocently racy title  recalls a silent film of ten years earlier rather than the earthier fare of the early sound era.Ms Dunne was approaching forty when she made this film and although the title holds out the promise of her eventually letting her hair down she never reveals half as much in the film as she does baring her arms and shoulders in the figurehugging dress she wears on the poster revealing her inner hussy by instead piling on feathers and sashaying about in expensive bad taste while the plot ties itself into knots attempting to subvert the requirements of The Code while simultaneously observing its constraints and parodying the very rural bluestockings it was introduced to appease.This was the last film completed by the always interesting Richard Boleslawski before his sudden death the following year at the age of 47. Aided by luminous photography by Frank Capra's regular cameraman Joseph Walker and superb performances by a firstrate supporting cast the end result is a handsome piece of fluff wholly devoid of the bite and contemporary relevance it would have had if made five years earlier. Melvyn Douglas does his best to bestow some charm on the obnoxious Michael Grant but the two lead characters have absolutely nothing in common and Theodora deserves much better than this mischiefmaking jerk who doesn't even let her know that he's married.".

Eventually though the truth does come out and Dunne resigns herself to marrying Douglas and revealing who she really is. However at this point she realizes that Douglas ALSO has a secret to hide and when the shoe is on the other foot so to speak he is upset and pretends he doesn't know her!!

	schema:reviewBody "I caught the last 30 minutes of Silence Becomes You on cable and was intrigued enough to order the DVD. The DVD would have benefited from a director's commentary as the film is annoyingly vague at times even to me and I imagine that most viewers would welcome some clarification.My favorable first impression was probably a combination of the great production design the excellent acting for the camera direction and the understated yet inventive editing. It was filmed in Lithuania in HD video said to be the first feature film with 100 digital cinematography a technique that allowed the production staff to see each days rushes immediately so they could make timely rewrite and reshoot decisions.Silence Becomes You was written and directed by Stephanie Sinclaire the Associate Artistic Director of the internationally known Kings Head Theatre in London. Her stage background shines through the production as all three of her main characters are given a nice multidimensionality. They are all flawed yet to varying degrees sympathetic.Take the assorted plot summaries and comments about this film with a certain grain of salt. It is about two 20something halfsisters if you credit certain statements and make an inference who are still living together in the estate where they grew up. Alicia Silverstone plays Violet and Sienna Guillory plays Grace.They have decided that Violet should have a baby and lure a roguish drifter named Luke Joe Anderson to the estate for the purpose of getting her pregnant. There is a fourth character the house which exercises a considerable hold and influence over the two women. This relationship is represented by frequent memory flashbacks to their father and their childhood. The two young actresses who play them as little girls most likely chosen for their physical similarity to Silverstone and Guillory are convincingly directed by Sinclaire and their frequent appearances give the film a lyrical quality.As in Terrance Mallick's Days of Heaven 1978 the four principal characters represent the four elements earth the house water Violet fire Grace and wind Luke. The principal dynamic being how the least transitory element holds the three elusive elements in place. Most of the complaints about the film seem to center on Sinclaire's frequent misdirection the viewer only knows what she wants you to know and when she wants you to know it.

	onyx:emotionText "I caught the last 30 minutes of Silence Becomes You on cable and was intrigued enough to order the DVD. The DVD would have benefited from a director's commentary as the film is annoyingly vague at times even to me and I imagine that most viewers would welcome some clarification.My favorable first impression was probably a combination of the great production design the excellent acting for the camera direction and the understated yet inventive editing. It was filmed in Lithuania in HD video said to be the first feature film with 100 digital cinematography a technique that allowed the production staff to see each days rushes immediately so they could make timely rewrite and reshoot decisions.Silence Becomes You was written and directed by Stephanie Sinclaire the Associate Artistic Director of the internationally known Kings Head Theatre in London. Her stage background shines through the production as all three of her main characters are given a nice multidimensionality. They are all flawed yet to varying degrees sympathetic.Take the assorted plot summaries and comments about this film with a certain grain of salt. It is about two 20something halfsisters if you credit certain statements and make an inference who are still living together in the estate where they grew up. Alicia Silverstone plays Violet and Sienna Guillory plays Grace.They have decided that Violet should have a baby and lure a roguish drifter named Luke Joe Anderson to the estate for the purpose of getting her pregnant. There is a fourth character the house which exercises a considerable hold and influence over the two women. This relationship is represented by frequent memory flashbacks to their father and their childhood. The two young actresses who play them as little girls most likely chosen for their physical similarity to Silverstone and Guillory are convincingly directed by Sinclaire and their frequent appearances give the film a lyrical quality.As in Terrance Mallick's Days of Heaven 1978 the four principal characters represent the four elements earth the house water Violet fire Grace and wind Luke. The principal dynamic being how the least transitory element holds the three elusive elements in place. Most of the complaints about the film seem to center on Sinclaire's frequent misdirection the viewer only knows what she wants you to know and when she wants you to know it. There does seem to be vagueness for the sake of vagueness or at least in the service of introducing complexity to a relatively simple story. The girls have a degree of paranormal skills and there is a strong mental connection between them qualities that their alchemist father lead into gold is his metaphor for reproduction went to great trouble to develop.

The sisters' especially Grace's comments seemed to prove that they were obsessed with the past with an imaginary life. They were in love with fiction with magic not with the disappointment and cyclic routine of normal life. They were in love with a dream.I'm sure someone will say That interpretation is retarded. The movie is a horror an nothing more. However I rarely find that anything is one thing and not another. This movie is a psychological thriller but can it not have some underlying themes as well? The world is rarely black and white. Yes that last sentence is a reference to my opinion of the conclusion of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Silence Becomes You is a beautifully shot fantastically scored dark tale of innocence and seduction. Two sisters bring home a man on a dare. A game of chance spirals into higher and higher stakes and finally out of control. Alicia Silverstone's character Violet is childlike emotionally reactive charming seductive and freespirited. Sienna Guillory's Grace is cool erotic manipulative brilliant and increasingly unhinged. Joe Anderson's Luke is the good looking drifter funny irreverent angry and vulnerable who reveals a strong inner compass that leads us to an explosive and finally poignant ending. Like a sailor dragged to the shore by mermaids Luke is picked up and brought to the strange colorful dysfunctional paradise of the two sisters who's closeness is often telepathic. He can't believe his luck at first. Gradually the house reveals the secrets of the past which haunt the present and as Luke gets drawn further and further into the web the fragile balance becomes increasingly disturbed. The sisters hothoused by their father brilliantly played by Leigh Lawson have been raised as experiments and ruthlessly surveyed. Their freedom is in theory as they live in the golden cage of their own psyche. Grace follows in her father's foot steps whereas Violet longs to escape into a 'normal life'. Luke is forced to feel with devastating but ultimately cathartic consequences. With a nod to the classic suspense movies of the 40's Visual Consultant was esteemed Academy Award winning cinematographer Jack Cardiff it is a good ride engaging suspenseful and ultimately satisfying.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd like to get this movie in a very much artistic way. The two sisters issue is a reflection of an experiment that a father did on his children. The alchemist topic in the movie is relevant just in the main history but the personality of two sisters that connect each other and link their own thoughts even with their dad's thoughtsis definitely a wonderful description of what the real art is. I remember the many scenes of Grace painting and the messages the father left into her consciousness all of that meaning that the art is life and life is art a real paradox of an artist. This is just an example of many scenes in the film.I conclude that the movie is really worth to be seen specially if you are an artist musician painter writer or any kind of art you do".

Silence Becomes You Is a film created out of pure apathy to those who are too lazy to think or attempt to think for themselves. We have Movies that tell us every step of the way What kind of fun is that? We have no room to think or to read between the lines When we are told and given baby steps to the resolution. When we can predict..anything it leaves out the mystery and the climactic progression. If you could predict every single step of your life or your neighbors life how much room would that give you to learn fail and succeed? When it comes to a movie that you actually have to think about you tend to get upset because the plot and the story line isn't handed over to you on a silver platter. What is the use of a movie that you aren't inspired by? When we think our mind expands when we view our mind Is merely molded. We have all been molded to believe that If a movie doesn't have the 4 steps that is is crap.. Is it really? I myself found it difficult but exciting It was completely by accident that I rented this movie but When I was done I wanted to experience their lives first hand. Isn't that what a movie is supposed to do? I'm sure that some of you who might be reading this are thinking no a movie is supposed to entertain me..My response to that is to lower your standards Anything can be entertainment if you allow it to be. Most of the population has to look to cinema or technology for our entertainment when really it's in the palm of our hands. We provoke the men and women that are creating these movies to make something either overly entertaining or just..sublime. Give them a break Day in and Day out people are reading new novels watching new movies playing new games that those people created..What do we do but live off of their creations? Try to get out of your house and make something make a movie write a book create a painting anything But..If you didn't like this movie remake it..Don't complain about it. Simply get a life. Your minds are null and lazy Don't punish the creative for not satisfying you. Go out and satisfy yourselves. Katie Morgheim  Age 16".

ALso what was with Alicia's reaction when the blonde guy was playing around with the dead mother's things. And don't get me started on the dad. He dressed like a magician and the whole thing he kept saying about lead to gold lead to gold...I'm still confused on that part. Also the paintings that moved around and were moaning when the fire broke out. Was that house under some kind of spell or were the girls just stir crazy from being locked up? Oh and they never fully explained what the plan was that the girls had. Was it just to get one of them knocked up by some random guy? Needless to say I am still scratching my head over this mess!".

The fact that there was a planned plot twist in which the father would be revealed to be still alive that got cut due to time restraints is to me further proof that the film is not so much pretentious but incomplete.All that aside the film is skillfully edited and beautifully shot. Leigh Lawson is nothing short of magnificent as the enigmatic father standing out in the limited time he is on screen as a halfmad mix of Orson Welles and John Huston that was a delight to watch every time he appeared.While it is far from being a magnificent film the bones of one are most definitely in there.

This surprised Ya'ara as she rushes to her parents full of concern. Previously Ya'ara's life was okay. Happily married to Joni Ishai Golan Jara has good prospects for early employment at the university. But already the first encounter with Arie throws Jara off track.

The frequently occurring question of how to transfer the inner and intimate thoughts of a protagonist into actions and moving images Maria Schrader has answered with an outstanding portion of selfconfidence and craftsmanship. A strong cast altogether lead by Israelian theatre actress Netta Garti and Rade Sherbedgia as the leads is guided by a safe hand of the directrice and her German cameraman Benedict Neuenfels who manages to paint a fine contrast of the barren landscapes of Israel against the nicely observed interiours of contemporary Jewish living in the city. It is their well thoughtout concept that keeps the atmosphere and rhythm of the movie constantly fresh and moving yet at the same time takes the right pauses to capture even the closest and most emotional moments that the actors portray in their fine performances. The thoughtprovoking conflict of the heroine is well told and with a surprising twist brings to light the underlying tension of a family that has tried to ignore its own dealings of the past for far too long. The strong collaboration between novelwriter and director seems to be ever immanent and it is not exaggerated to say that the film as a whole is really making its point in the truth of the novels soul. It is worth mentioning that it is quite an achievement by firsttimer Maria Schrader and her collaborators that this GermanIsraelian coproduction works on many levels and comes to full fruition. Certainly the director is someone to be watched for a promising cinematic future.".

While the scenery is very nice the lack of skillful narration and superficial acting leave the movie goer empty. The storyline also sometimes gets lost so that I had the urge to leave the movie theater at times and wished the movie would end soon. The story tells of a married woman who falls for an old man because he is attractive. However this attraction seems to be merely physical. Why would a woman give up her life for the mere thrill of sex? The movie shows that all the characters have some kind of psychological problem be it the woman's obsession or the other characters' emotionless behavior. Even when the main character's father cries this show of emotion seems shallow and fails to convince the viewer. In the end this is a movie that aims to make the viewer think but fails because it makes one feel hopelessly lost in pointless dribble.".

The protagonist debases herself consistently and inexplicably with a much older and terribly ugly man. Many of these sexual encounters which are shown in considerable length and detail could be quite comfortably described as rape. In one of these scenes she is drunkenly shared in a threeway with an even more hideous and pathetic man. When her parents and husband learn of her selfdebasement they are understandably shocked and it is surprising that they do not put her into a mental asylum. The protagonist feels satisfied however because she unravels some of her family's shady history  namely that her mother also had a relationship with this man and apparently would have stayed with him except that he couldn't have children. Big deal. What happened way back then in no way justifies the disgusting things she did to find them out. A truly gross film. All copies of it should be destroyed.

Not because there was any character that the audience could sympathize with. Eventually some exposition of the characters' background was produced basically in the form of sheer monologue rather than being cinematically integrated but the exposition came too late.

So it's sort of like hearing a joke and then just before the punch line being told Oh I should have mentioned that the guy was hunting a bear in the forest.";

They could easily have let the former professor and his former student have an affair they didn't. They could easily have played up the manipulation of the boy against the psychologist they didn't. In all that it's downplayed the realistic speaking type of performance we were allowed to see the wretched grief and anger and blocked memories that do come out with horror and a bang. It was REAL. It was superb. It was better than that. From script to acting to film shots  to editing from directing and producing from casting so perfectly a real woman who looked like a real mother and even the psychologist's special lecture to the students at the beginning. It was all so real. So real it hurt.".

Deep secrets will be revealed along this brilliant story. The plot starts as a drama and as far as the characters reveal details about the real facts the viewer gets more and more evolved by this surprisingly excellent psychological thriller. The story is very credible and realistic the direction is tight and the performance of the cast is marvelous. Andy Garcia is the producer of this low budget but excellent movie. A couple of months ago I watched The Man from Elysian Fields' also a lowbudget good movie produced by him. Andy Garcia is selecting good screenplays for producing and revealing also an excellent producer. I regret the title of this movie in Brazil No Limite do Silncio'  the translation would be In the Limit of the Silence'. Do not ask me why but in Brazil most of the movies have their titles changed. The distributors believe it makes the movie more commercial'.  The original title The Unsaid' is perfect for the plot but unfortunately Brazilians have to deal with In the Limit of the Silence'. This movie is highly recommended for lovers of a dense dramatic and psychological thriller. My vote is eight.".

Kyle's dad Michael Hunter Andy Garciawho should have known his problems and how serious they were since he's a collage professor in psychology as well as threats people like Kyle all the time is so devastated by his son's death that he ends up leaving his wife Penny and daughter Selly Chelsea Fields  Linda Cardellinito live by himself since he couldn't face them anymore. We later learn the real reason for Kyle's suicide and it shows how right Michael was in feeling guilty about his death and what he had unconsciously and unknowingly to do with it. It's now three years later and Michael is getting his life back together and putting Kyle's tragic death behind him as he goes on the lecture circuit and is invited to speak at his alma mater Kansas University. It's at Kansas U. that Michael meets one of his former students Dr. Barbara Wagner Teri Polo now a licensed psychologist at the Holly Health School for Wayward Boys who asks him about seeing one of her patients 17 yearold Tommy Caffey Vincent Kartheiser. Hesitant at first Michael agrees to talk to Tommy who's about to be released since he's doing so well psychology and is about to reach his 18th birthdayat the school. Tommy almost by accident get's to know Michael's young teenage daughter Shelly who falls in love with him when she meets Tommy at a dance by the railroad yard when he was out on a nighttime leave from Holly Heath. Tommy also murdered a young girl Chole Kim Schraner earlier that evening when she aggressively come on to him by the deserted railroad cars not knowing what kind of monster the shy sweet and good looking Tommy really is. Tommy learns all about Shelly's deceased brother Kyle and uses that knowledge to manipulate Michael into  or having his personal psychologist Dr. Wagner give him a clean bill of health and thus release from the hated by Tommy institution.Tommy had developed a murderous hatred of women or young girls who try to be intimate with him because of what happened to his mom when he was a young boy she was brutally murdered by his dad Joseph Caffey Sam Bottoms when he found that she was having an affair with another man. The truth behind Tommy's mom's murder and what caused his dad to keep it secret all these years is something that Tommy has been trying to keep locked deep inside his mind and that's the reason for his dangerous psychosis that eventually leads to murder and madness.Disturbing but thoughtprovoking movie that has you almost as shocked as Michael is by the time it's over with Tommy skillfully getting under his skin and subconscious by morphing himself into Michael's son Kyle and unknowingly bringing out the truth behind Kyle's death that Michael by his actions in trying to help his troubled son had a lot to do with. Michael begins to realize later the reasons for Tommy knowing so much about Kyle he's been secretly dating his daughter Shelly and even more shocking the real reason for his mothers murder that shaped Tommy's mind and turned him into the Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hyde that he became. The ending of the movie The Unsaid is a bit confusing at first with Tommy going wild in his effort to get out of the Holly Health School and almost murdering his psychologist Dr. Wagner and then taking Shelly hostage in the process. But when confronted with the truth by Michael and seeing that he really needs help and that a life on the outside will only end with him being either dead or on death row the movie couldn't have ended any other way.".

However the title THE UNSAID is if not perfect very close to it. Andy Garcia again pulls off what I feel maybe the hardest thing to pull off a professional actor being a professional psychiatrist. I think the acting on every ones part was superb as well as the lighting and make up. I think a lot of detail was put in things as simple as sitting in a chair when to lean back when to lean forward. An excellent movie I highly recommend it.".

And so many other variations of this genre may arise.With The Unsaid' however you can expect to be tied to your seat the whole time as the plot develops. It has a dramatic starting point a powerful and constant thrilling middle section and well I won't refer the ending because believe it if you start watching this flick you won't go away until you see the whole thing. It's that good! But that's me I personally like movies that grab your attention from the start and make you not even take bathroom breaks or answer to your cellphone calls. What about you?The acting by Andy Garcia was brilliant he really got inside his character. Only with a role like this could he show his true dramatic acting skills and was followed very well by the rest of the cast. The directing was ok and had some notorious influence on our understanding and dramatic effect of the scenes. It was done the way it's supposed to clean and sober even in action sequences.

I was almost certain that this would be such a movie with a disturbingly realistic subject that goes right to and through your heart like a knife ... but it didn't. I'm not saying it was a bad movie it just wasn't that good.The subject on itself isn't bad though. A young boy is kept in an institution because he saw his mom being murdered by his own father. Since then he hasn't shown much emotions and hasn't spoken about the incident. When Dr. Michael Hunter a retired college professor and psychologist examines the boy he's convinced that they should keep him in the institution a bit longer because he isn't ready for the real world that he might be a ticking time bomb. He starts working with the boy in who he sees his own son who committed suicide a few years earlier and gradually he is able to reveal the horrible truth...The acting in this movie isn't bad but it wasn't great either. However I guess you can't expect any better from a crew without many wellknown names Only Andy Garcia and Teri Polo I had heard of before seeing this movie the rest of the cast was a complete mystery to me and it has to be said I've seen a lot worse in the past. The same can be said about the story which was OK but not excellent. It was compelling but somehow I missed something in it. Anyway I'm already glad that it was a lot better than the average TVmovie that would deal with this subject. But if you want to see an excellent psychological thriller about this subject than I suggest you watch Primal Fear. That movie offers about the same story murder child abuse... but does it in a much better way. I give this movie a 6.510. It's worth a watch.".

He handles his 'revelation' in a prison scene near the end with aplomb.The one downside is a maudlin overbearing score that draws too much attention to itself.This is a film that deserves to be better known.

	schema:reviewBody "With one of the most heartbreaking introductions The Unsaid places audiences on a psychological carousel with enigmas about human behaviour that provoke curiosity and perplexity. Watching this film a whole decade later since my first viewing it was even more emotional than I previously comprehended. As I mentioned above the story begins with a tragedy of the greatest magnitude. Michael Hunter and his wife Penny intend on going to their daughter's school performance however their son refuses to join them. He is showing clear signs of depression and is reluctant to converse with his family. Unable to penetrate their son's barrier of silence the family travel without him. In a climactic moment the family return home to find their son dead having committed suicide. Several years later therapist Barbara Lonigan enlists Michael's expertise with seventeen year old Thomas Caffey. Thomas is soon to be released from a home for troubled adolescents pending his eighteenth birthday. The seemingly balanced teenager shows no signs of trauma regardless of his brutal memory of his mother's murder.Barbara suspects that Thomas is not ready for release despite his 'normal' appearance and persona. Tortured by nightmares and feelings of failure to save his son Michael takes the task  Deciphering what really happened in Thomas' past is the crux of this intriguing psychological film. This plot will wrench at feelings you possess and other emotions you were unaware existed  I am not a father but that initial scene successfully forced the power of paternity on me. Trevor Blumas who plays Michael's son Kyle Hunter emulates the body language facial expressions and tone of a depressed individual in an unbelievably convincing act. There is a great amount of pain sadness realism humanity and inhumanity throughout the movie. If there was ever a place where there are real complications real grey real conundrums in psychology this storyline harbours them. There is no simplistic right or wrong black or white good or evil just a set of horrific and profoundly sad events.The IMDb average rating currently stands at 6.510. This should definitely be higher.Review by Stephen Leslie France".

The man was Kyle's psychiatrist and the woman was Tommy's mother. And I think the roles both those characters play to the boys is something that seems to be overlooked. I think the movie is really focusing on the fact that both of the adults were in roles of authority which means they took advantage of the trust and level of dependence both Kyle and Tommy had between them. And looking at it from that point of view I think Michael Hunter's feelings of disturbance are justified.SPOILERS ENDED".

	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever had something that sounded really great in your head but sounded really lame when you said it out loud? That's what this movie is like. You can understand why The Unsaid seemed like a good story in theory. In the actual telling though you can see that it's lacking in so many ways even before the film takes a hard left turn into Idiotville at the end.The movie starts with the suicide of the son of psychologist Michael Hunter Andy Garcia. The kid is obviously disturbed about something but Michael and the rest of the family decide that leaving him alone in the house is the greatest idea they've ever heard. The family returns to find him dead in the garage of carbon monoxide poisoning giving Andy Garcia the chance to yell and carry on the way actors love to do.Three years later Michael is now sporting a beard bigger than his head. He writes books on psychology and refuses to see patients. His wife has divorced him and his daughter Shelly Linda Cardellini has little use for him. That's when Barbara Lonigan Teri Polo an old student of Michael's asks him to help a young man who is about to age out of the state care system. Tommy Caffey Vincent Kartheiser appears to be perfectly normal something Barbara finds doubtful given that Tommy has never expressed any anger or grief over his father killing Tommy's mother when he was a child. At first Michael refuses but after shaving off the jungle ecosystem growing on his face agrees to try and get past Tommy's defenses to the secret pain underneath.While that's going on Tommy manages to sneak out of the state home where he lives and meets Shelly. She like a lot of young women mistakes his mental and emotional dysfunction for being all deep and soulful. Tommy seems to like Shelly but he also uses her to find out about Michael's son and then uses that information to manipulate Michael in their impromptu therapy sessions.I'm sure it's clear how The Unsaid seemed like a good story in theory. You'd think a psychological thriller about a man trying to deal with his own emotional wounds from his son's suicide while helping another troubled young man only to discover his patient is more violent and crazy than he first thought would make a great film. It really doesn't though and the reasons for that are legion.Let me just touch on a few. The secret of Tommy's pain is so obvious that you'll guess what it is at least 40 minutes before the movie even hints at it. Sitting around waiting for a film to tell you what you already know always sucks. Making it worse this time is that to reveal Tommy's secret the story first pulls virtually the same secret about Michael's son completely out of the filmmakers collective ass. There's absolutely NOTHING in the story that foreshadows or supports the revelation about Michael's son yet without it the movie wouldn't be able to reveal Tommy's secret. I don't want to spoil The Crying Game for you but imagine if 15 minutes before that film's big discovery the story played out almost the exact same scenario with another character. That's what The Unsaid is like.The movie also never decides if Tommy is a good person with psychological problems or a screwedup bad person. So sometimes he behaves like someone who needs to be helped and sometimes he's much more malevolent. That may be realistic psychologically speaking but it makes for a fictional character that is muddled and a story without a moral compass. The story wants us to be afraid of Tommy because he does terrible things but also empathize with him. Those two emotions don't easily mix.Vincent Kartheiser does what he can with Tommy appearing both creepy and vulnerable when the Almighty Plot Hammer requires it. Linda Cardellini and Teri Polo also do fine jobs but Garcia essentially sleepwalks through his role. He plays Michael Hunter as Generic Thriller Hero with nothing original at all about the performance.And then we get the crappy ending. The two most common problems in screenplays are having a great beginning and ending but no middle and having a great buildup but an ending that stinks on ice. The Unsaid is definitely the latter. I am not exaggerating when I say that after trying to be a psychological thriller it's like the film simply gives up and morphs into a Steven Seagal flick complete with car chase and armed standoff. I half expected Michael Hunter to sprout a pony tail and start karate chopping people.Finally let me note that this film is very slow. I mean this.movie.is.very.slow. If you can't get to sleep some night watching The Unsaid would work better than a glass of warm milk.This movie isn't so aggressively horrible that you'll want to throw something at your TV. There are just many better examples of this genre that you should be watching instead.".

A young Linda Cardellini is beautiful as always and as anyone who saw Freaks and Geeks knows is excellent as portraying a realistic teenager. She also sings a song. Andy Garcia is a bit subdued but realistic enough in the main role.Overall it's fairly middling. Overly melodramatic at times and the ending is poor.

	schema:reviewBody "The Unsaid is slow and predictable barely even qualifying as a functional thriller as it seems more interested in piquing the interest of bored housewives who think they're experts on psychology because they watch Oprah and Dr Phil on a daily basis.  I wouldn't question this movie's earnestness but good intentions are no substitute for a smart script something this movie is sorely lacking.  Early scenes with therapists not wanting to let their patient out on his 18th birthday seem strange since there's no indication that the kid has been anything other than a model resident of the youth home.  But the audience knows there's something wrong with the kid or there wouldn't be a movie would there?  Rather than take the audience for a ride the movie here has to constantly catch up to the viewer a backwards way of making a thriller unless you don't actually want to generate any suspense.  An early scene where Thomas the patient flips out violently after being touched by an extremely hot sexually agressive young woman gives away the fact that Thomas was sexually molested as a child although like a bad poker player who shows his cards but figures nobody was really paying attention anyway the filmmakers seem to think the audience will react with something other than complete indifference or a loud duh when they finally pull the molestation card out about forty minutes later.  Maybe if your brother made movie this you could act surprised out of politeness but if you're not a relative what's the point.  Acting is variable Andy Garcia brings sincerity and dramatic weight to his portrayal navigating the hokey cutaways to his suicide son during sessions with the current patient. Terri Polo who I have to admit to liking pretty much just in one movie Quick is fine here through she seems to be channelling Laurie Linney.  Vincent Kartheiser who was so damned annoying on the last two seasons of Angel isn't much more impressive here.  I'm at the point where I hope I'll never see this guy again.  And then there's the daughter played by Linda Cardellini. She seems to have some of the worst maninstincts that a girl could possibly have moving on from a bullying neanderthal with all the charm of a rapist on his night off and on to deeply disturbed  Thomas who has already murdered one one of her friends.  This girl needs help.I can't imagine why anyone would want to sit through this movie but if you're a fan of Lifetime Movies inyourface earnestness and movies where the upper middle class hero finds love and redemption then hey maybe this is the movie for you.  Just don't expect any nicities like suspense.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a timeless masterpiece and one of Germany's top 10 rated films. It will draw the viewer with surprising frankness  and bold actions of 2 young men of an unlikely friendship coming of age in the 1940's Germany. Drafted from Highschool to the German Military both of them going through a character Transition Werner a more sensible person turns more and more into a sceptic by witnessing how his ideals getting destroyed by the application of a ruthless fascist system where he has to be part of it. Gilbert also intelligent a man of action and a Go Getter develops a passion for everything Military that eventually will challenge his friendship to Werner. The viewer will experience both of them as likable characters at first and will go with them through a transition .Eventually feel the painful decision process they are forced to undergo. The gap between them widen and resolves a final movie climax. Being a complex psychological Drama the film does not lack action or battle scenes which were masterfully staged and ahead of their times. Using newly invented filmographic artwork a realistic ambiance leaves the viewer in awe even today with it's special effects and CGI technologies. Many elderly Germans who I had the pleasure sharing this movie with attested it as being an authentic capture of the period. Made in 1965 the memory of the 40's where fresh and painful the production used people with first hand experiences to left no detail missing. For most movie directors using flashbacks of a flashback are usually a No No to use in blockbuster films. Surprisingly it works very well in this film. It does because it helps the viewer to understand their character transitions from High School to the dramatic combat scenes. Both of them are not the typical blind Nazi followers nor fanatics nevertheless prisoners of their times. Sometimes even swimming against the popular tide of fascism by beating up their schools Hitler Youth leader for being a cruel prick.If they would have been born 20 years later they would have blended right into our social fabric as perhaps intellectuals Werner or aggressive businessman Gilbert. Some viewers criticized this film for not using authentic WW2 rifles pointing towards the AK47 allegedly used in this film by German soldiers. When in fact they where Sturmgewehr 44s with whom not many people are familiar with. This Gun was issued by few German units in 1945 and described as one of Hitlers so called Wonder weapons to change the outcome of the war.The Actors and the Acting As a German raised Canadian I love those Actors because I grew up seeing them on German TV for half of my lifetime and recently again because the internet and online shopping makes it possible to reunite with them. Most of them can still be seen on new German TV productions today. For me they where simply the best. Does a wage of xmillion  per film make a Hollywood actor better than an actor from another country who does quality work with a moderate wage ? I guess only American movie fans can answer that. For me they just created one of my most favourite films. My Dad  a veteran of age 84 and I are in accord on this opinion as for my part I have listened a lot but not enough of my past 55 years to him specially interested in the wartime. At first very reluctant to tell me much my insistence paid of over the years. He grew up like a normal child from a middle class farming family enjoying the seasons Fishing hunting and swimming in the ancient Hessel river. Joined the Hitler Youth because almost every young boy did. That meant privilege's like participating in motor sport and glider plane classes. Our farming community lived in a quite and tranquil place of Germany with not much going on. There was plenty of food on the farm many family gatherings and celebrations it seemed like time would not touch this little peaceful and enchanting world. That idyll all ended in the second year of the war just like it did in the movie. If my Dad says the movie got it accurately than I do believe him".

	schema:headline " A great insight look of the life of a young German soldier in WWII";
	schema:reviewBody "The Adventures of Werner Holt will probably not stand out much here in the West due to its being written by East German author Dieter Noll and film in East Germany by Director Joachim Kunert. It was one of the relatively few DEFA pictures to be released in West Germany where it enjoyed considerable success. So it's one movie worth checking out despite it not being wellknown. The plot revolves around Werner Holt KlausPeter Thiele a young German soldier who becomes disillusioned with the Nazis during the last days of World War II. Klaus gives a great performance with and without saying a word. The actor looks a bit like young Jake Gyllenhaal. He looks so close to Jake that you might mistake him for starting in World War II. His facial and the use of his hands tell us the audiences his emotional stage. The way he stares at people and things can make you think or question everything you know about patriotism. The movie has this All Quiet on the Western Front 1930 feel to it. Werner begins to understand the senselessness of war while his friend Gilbert Wolzow Manfred Karge begins to be more vicious. A powerful political and artistic masterpiece. The movie goes from a series of flashbacks telling Werner's coming to age story from his high school days to fighting nearly impossibles battles and finding romantic in the women he meet. I like the flashbacks but it's seems badly edit in the film. I felt like it edited way too soon as if missing parts. A good example Gilbert and Werner were pick for a neardeath winter battle mission to stop Russian tanks in their tracks after two of his friends flees midbattle. The scene cuts to spring time in another area and time. Wait a minute how did they survive the attack? The movie does this it cuts half way through the flashback and puts us back in present day multiplies times without explaining how did they get to point A to point B. It seems like there were a lot of delete scenes taken out of the film. In some ways it get confusing as hell with how many flashbacks there were. You don't know if you're watching a flashback or present day. The movie does have great symbolism. I like the dancing scene with the SS wife. Great use of shadows and reflections. It makes it look like there were a lot of people there when there wasn't. Still the Hawaiian Jazz like type music was a bit annoying and seem out of place. I do like the scene where the piano is being play in the background only to stop when one of Werner's friends died in the mud. It's makes it more interesting when you know what his friend was trying to do with his life. The language is a bit strong was a bit surprised by it seeing how this was a early 1960's film. The action scenes were great to watch. The title is kinda misleading I wouldn't call it 'Adventures'. When you think of adventure you think of exotic fun and heroic. In the film you get more scary depressing and no heroes just people trying to survive a war while trying to keep their set morals alive. The sawmill was haunting scene as you don't see what happen in the room but your mind knows that something bad happen there. The movie is a bit different than the book as Holt and his company fight against Russians and not against Americans like in the book due to the ongoing Cold War at the time. The movie might be a bit historic wrong as Holt and his friends have the uniforms of SS although they just standard Wehrmacht soldiers. The ending is a open question that makes you wonder if Werner ever did survive the war or didn't. I would say give it a watch. The movie was overall was worth watching as I learn great insight how life was in Nazi Germany.".

	schema:headline " Excellent Movie made in East Germany";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER FREEVery intriguing movie with superb acting ! that shows the life and mindset of young Germans during WW2 how they were moulded into becoming killers without second thoughts and how they were eventually used up in war. Definitely worth watching especially if so far you have been exposed only to Hollywood's interpretation of the second world war and the nazis.Unfortunately there is one HUGE propagandainsertion though which the DEFA included At 54 minutes into the movie the young men or rather boys discuss Nazi racialtheory where eventually one states that Slavs are basically Aryans without anyone dissenting it Selbst wenn die Slawen nicht so hochwertig sind wie die Nordische Rasse so sind sie doch immer noch Arier. This is total nonsense of course. The Slavs were considered subhuman by the Nazis worth not very much more than Jews themselves. This propagandainsertion is really bad in TWO ways because it a twists around the truth 180 degrees in order to make their Big Brother from Russia look better AND b because it looks like they ACCEPT the naziracial theory why else would they try to make the Slavs look better? The Nazi racial theory IS COMPLETE NONSENSE of course since there are no human races. This one sentence should be cut out when showing Werner Holt today as it gives the whole movie a cheap taste What else could be made up? And that shouldn't be since everything else in it seems very accurately depicted.One note concerning the previous comment by Mrdat Kundu Their black uniforms are quite correct. Those are Panzeruniforms. Maybe you should have done some research before claiming such nonsense. Besides they never were standard Wehrmacht. First they were members of the HJ Hitler Youth then RAD Reichs Labour Service and then members of the Panzertruppe Armoured Troops. Did you really read the novel 34 times?The reason for them fighting Soviets instead of Americans in the movie is quite obvious How could the DEFA possibly have gotten American WW2 tanksuniformsweapons? And it really shouldn't  matter to anyone that the Soviets are using Kalashnikov rifles as the movie is not trying to depict weapons but people. Unless of course you have read the novel 34 times do not know the difference between Panzer and SS uniforms and rate the quality of a movie by the types of weapons used in it.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILER FREEVery intriguing movie with superb acting ! that shows the life and mindset of young Germans during WW2 how they were moulded into becoming killers without second thoughts and how they were eventually used up in war. Definitely worth watching especially if so far you have been exposed only to Hollywood's interpretation of the second world war and the nazis.Unfortunately there is one HUGE propagandainsertion though which the DEFA included At 54 minutes into the movie the young men or rather boys discuss Nazi racialtheory where eventually one states that Slavs are basically Aryans without anyone dissenting it Selbst wenn die Slawen nicht so hochwertig sind wie die Nordische Rasse so sind sie doch immer noch Arier. This is total nonsense of course. The Slavs were considered subhuman by the Nazis worth not very much more than Jews themselves. This propagandainsertion is really bad in TWO ways because it a twists around the truth 180 degrees in order to make their Big Brother from Russia look better AND b because it looks like they ACCEPT the naziracial theory why else would they try to make the Slavs look better? The Nazi racial theory IS COMPLETE NONSENSE of course since there are no human races. This one sentence should be cut out when showing Werner Holt today as it gives the whole movie a cheap taste What else could be made up? And that shouldn't be since everything else in it seems very accurately depicted.One note concerning the previous comment by Mrdat Kundu Their black uniforms are quite correct. Those are Panzeruniforms. Maybe you should have done some research before claiming such nonsense. Besides they never were standard Wehrmacht. First they were members of the HJ Hitler Youth then RAD Reichs Labour Service and then members of the Panzertruppe Armoured Troops.

	schema:reviewBody "Die Abenteuer des Werner Holt or The Adventures of Werner Holt is an East German Germanlanguage film from 1965 so it had its 50th anniversary last year. It is among the more known films from the GDR these days and the director as well as one of the writers who adapted the Dieter Noll novel is Joachim Kunert still alive at almost 90. Most GDR films are in blackandwhite and this one here is no exception. However it is an exception in terms of the duration as this one runs for no less than 2 hours and 45 minutes. Extremely long. Unfortunately I must say that I was not too impressed here. There were some good moments but overall the script was not good enough to keep me interested in the title character and his actions and life. I also must say that the late lead actor KlausPeter Thiele may not have been the best casting decision. I found him fairly bland for the most part and his colead Manfred Karge still alive was somehow more memorable over all. Then again he also had the baitier scenes and moments I guess. This is the story of two friends during the days of World War II. They have to join the army but take very different paths in the next months. This also has a lot to do with how they perceive the Fuehrer and his claim to power and of course by other factors that make an impact on them individually. I already wrote in the title that this film may have worked better at 90 minutes max. I definitely would have preferred a more essential version of this story about Werner. I guess the director decided to keep it that long because he did not want to cut out too much from the book but I believe this may not have been the right decision. Thumbd.won from me. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "To enjoy this film  and you can  accept the fact that the characters take their time in expressing themselves in mostly slow but sometimes abrupt motions. Give up the idea of Get on with it! and accept the slow pace. It's worth it just let yourself be drawn into a world of shadows dreams and mesmerism.At a dinner party a shadow player entertains a count his flirtatious wife and four of her admirers. He appears to entrance them into a weird dream in which the suddenly cuckolded husband has the three suitors kill his wife. This is enough of a spoiler since you could probably guess watching it that something was going to happen to her because of her outlandish flirtations with those fawning over her or perhaps as another noted above she was more in love with herself than with others. Finally the party goers watch the ending of their dream on a screen in front of them the curtains close over it and they wake up. The husband and wife reunite now deeply in love seeing the folly of their past ways.What makes the film stand out are surprise! the extensive and creative use of shadows the slightly bizarre story which definitely cries out for a remake and some outstanding camera work even if this is the kind of German Expressionism Mike 'Deiter' Myers used to satirize on the 'Sprockets' segment on 'Saturday Night Live' in the 1990s.We don't get the herkyjerky motions so common in comedies of the teen years or as seen in the great 'Intolerance' 1916 or the amazing 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' 1920 but we see more naturalistic 24 frames? movement even if it's all too stagy. It has a good well fitting score. If you want good fluid movements with an interesting story and not very stagy acting check out 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse' 1921 or any of so many other great films of the twenties.This one is innovative ground breaking enjoyable film making. I give it a 7.".

This is enough of a spoiler since you could probably guess watching it that something was going to happen to her because of her outlandish flirtations with those fawning over her or perhaps as another noted above she was more in love with herself than with others. Finally the party goers watch the ending of their dream on a screen in front of them the curtains close over it and they wake up. The husband and wife reunite now deeply in love seeing the folly of their past ways.What makes the film stand out are surprise! the extensive and creative use of shadows the slightly bizarre story which definitely cries out for a remake and some outstanding camera work even if this is the kind of German Expressionism Mike 'Deiter' Myers used to satirize on the 'Sprockets' segment on 'Saturday Night Live' in the 1990s.We don't get the herkyjerky motions so common in comedies of the teen years or as seen in the great 'Intolerance' 1916 or the amazing 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' 1920 but we see more naturalistic 24 frames? movement even if it's all too stagy. It has a good well fitting score. If you want good fluid movements with an interesting story and not very stagy acting check out 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse' 1921 or any of so many other great films of the twenties.This one is innovative ground breaking enjoyable film making. I give it a 7.";

	schema:headline " Minor film in German Expressionist mode";
	schema:reviewBody "German Expressionism was a style of filmmaking that seemed loaded with potential especially after the early success of The Cabinet of Caligari. The idea of the movement was that the filmmakers would make the sets reflect the interior state of the characters which is a neat way to get around the seeming perspective limitation of cinema when compared to literature. In practice however Caligari has remained pretty much the only famous film to do this successfully and consistently in spite of the utilization of this technique in very small measures in several films of the period most famously in those of Murnau and Lang. I was hoping that the relatively obscure Warning Shadows aka Schatten  Eine nchtliche Halluzination might be another film that took full advantage of what I see as the great potential of this movement but I was somewhat disappointed to see that it uses it minimally. First of all in spite of a couple of cues that suggest a good deal of the film isn't quite real or even that it's all the dream of a character this idea is never fully developed so there really isn't a specific interior state to reflect. Even if you work with the assumption that the film doesn't represent any specific perspective but is meant to look like a dream the set design is still lacking because it just seems like a staged mockup of a large manor house. In fact for a film that foregoes dialogue and intertitles altogether Warning Shadows is surprisingly stagy and the rooms seem artificial in a bad way especially since it isn't common to see more than one wall at a time here. The plot and its execution is solid but unremarkable. The film is about a very jealous man who has invited four amorous young men to have dinner with him and his coquettish wife. It's obvious where this is headed all along although things are complicated by the presence of an entertainer who can do amazing things with shadow puppets. He uses these puppets to show what might happen if the young men don't cool their heels around the jealous husband. This is a simple plot that is still somewhat hard to follow because of the lack of dialogue and is further complicated by the languorous pace. On the bright side the entertainer character seems to be a neat variation on the supernatural trickster archetype. Anyway the highlight here is still the visuals especially the warning shadows themselves. There's something inherently creepy about shadows and especially a mysterious person who can manipulate them for reasons of his own and even though he ultimately turns out to be relatively benevolent the film still manages to pull of a few unsettling sequences. Further there are a couple of scenes in which the characters' behavior is odd in a way that calls dreams to mind so this isn't just your run of the mill tale of jealousy. I also have to give the film some credit for relying so much on visuals and the last scene is suitably bizarre. Overall Warning Shadows is a worthwhile watch that doesn't quite live up some of its more famous predecessors.".

I'm still bitter about an incident at the 1982 World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago when an audience full of idiots jaded by hightech SFX movies laughed at the cardboard sets in 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari'. Those morons didn't care that the high degree of originality and imagination in 'Caligari' more than made up for its tiny production budget.'Shadows' however while firmly within the Expressionist genre is too arty for its own good. While this film does have some merits its flaws greatly outnumber and exceed its merits.All the actors perform their roles with handtobrow histrionics of precisely the sort which have given silentfilm acting a bad reputation. Several of the actors in this movie have given good performances elsewhere so I assume that director Arthur Robison deserves the blame for their mannered theatrics here. During one scene when a swain aims a punch at his rival the actor cannot simply throw a punch he must put his fist up against the other man's face and then shove.Alexander Granach as a showman with a shadow box and shadow puppets demonstrates some extremely deft hand shadows apparently with no other props supplementing his hands. But when the puppetmaster isn't performing Granach lurches across the screen like Igor the hunchback. Ruth Weyher is pretty and graceful but is given no opportunity to behave like a human being.This silent film was originally released with no intertitles. Several other silent features also eschewed captions  'The Last Laugh' The Old Swimmin' Hole 'The Last Moment'  but those films had linear plots which the audience could easily follow. The plot of 'Shadows' is deeply confusing made even more confusing by the arty pretensions and the story would have been far easier to follow with some captions. A curator at the Murnau Archiv has told me that 'Shadows' was given intertitles by several exhibitors when it was released outside Germany.The plot  such as it is  vaguely reminded me of Renoir's 'Rules of the Game' and Bergman's 'Smiles of a Summer Night' in a swank country manor some people with more money than sense amuse themselves at each other's expense. But here the cast members are introduced in arty tableaux that are more alienating than edifying. After the final tableau we're treated to the odd spectacle of a single upraised finger casting a shadow on the screen. What does this mean please? Later in hindsight we understand that this signifies the beginning of the drama's Chapter One. I saw this film in London where the audience burst out laughing at the start of Chapter Two symbolised by a hand with TWO upraised fingers in Britain this twofingered gesture has obscene connotations. The finger device is confusing and adds nothing to the story ... nor does the decision to divide the narrative into arbitrary chapters.The production design is impressive judging by the furniture and clothes this story takes place somewhere in Europe probably Germany circa 1830 again some titles would have helped. But Robison considerably weakens the effect of these wonderful costumes and sets by obscuring them with elaborate shadows and by gimmicky effects such as raising and lowering a proscenium curtain in front of the actors. As if we need to be reminded that this very artificial story is merely a story! Considerable talent effort and expense were put into 'Shadows' to little effect. Rather a lot of today's moviegoers are sadly prejudiced against silent films misperceiving them all to be crude and laughably overacted. Sadly 'Shadows' is precisely the sort of movie which would convince such people that all the negative stereotypes about silent movies are true after all. My rating for this failure 2 out of 10 mostly for the production design.".

If we don't understand what is going on we lose interest and don't care about the story or characters. I really wonder why so few directors included a sufficient amount of subtitles during the silent film era. I guess there is a reason why nobody knows Arthur Robison today anymore the writer and director of this German movie here. Another problem is overacting. Especially the male protagonist who is also in the last scene really needed a lesson in subtlety. So yeah a weak film with regard to basically everything story acting and directing. I do not recommend this over 90yearold film. Not dramatic not entertaining and especially not scary. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps I will refrain from mentioning the German title because of the spelling correction program but it's interesting how the second part is translated differently because it says that woman are unable to move their car into a parking spot in the German title  different countries  different prejudice is a German 100minute movie from 2007 so this one has its 10th anniversary this year. The books this film is based on are by Allan and Barbara Pease and Rochus Hahn and Alexander Stever worked on the screenplay. It's probably a contender for most known work for both of them. The director is Leander Haumann and he is mostly known for his films that focus to a major extent on German history so the subject in this 10yearold film is something entirely difference. And it is also something he never may want to do again. Then again Haumann did not work on the story apparently so you cannot really blame him for how badly all this turned out eventually. This is especially disappointing because the cast is massive certainly a contender for German movie with the best cast in both quality and quantity of the 21st century. So with a better story and better attention to detail this actually could have turned out really decent. I will not mention the cast members' names I am referring to as you can check out the cast list yourself. Let me just say that the story turned many characters into caricatures that never were allowed to show us their range and talent. Or maybe they are just better when it comes to drama compared to comedy.Anyway now about the story. This is a relationship comedy from start to finish. But the quality is on the level of Mario Barth at times perhaps even lower. One major problem is that the writers in their attempts to make it funny and entertaining completely forgot about realism. There is zero authenticity in here and almost never one has the impression to watch actually existing characters. Instead one funny scene after the other was included here for cheap entertainment purposes and the material wasn't good either. This gives the entire project a very tryhard vibe in my opinion. It never makes powerful or memorable or at least witty statements on human relationships especially between partners as it is all lost in the unsuccessful attempts of rushing one comedic scene after the next. The negative highlight and there were several contenders was probably when the male protagonist even ends up in the newspaper towards the end and as such somewhat funny. It just did not make any sense. A contender for worst film for everybody involved including Haumann at least from what I have seen by him so far. His narration being one of the better aspects of the film is not because it was any good but because it did not suck as much as the rest of it.

	onyx:emotionText "Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps I will refrain from mentioning the German title because of the spelling correction program but it's interesting how the second part is translated differently because it says that woman are unable to move their car into a parking spot in the German title  different countries  different prejudice is a German 100minute movie from 2007 so this one has its 10th anniversary this year. The books this film is based on are by Allan and Barbara Pease and Rochus Hahn and Alexander Stever worked on the screenplay. It's probably a contender for most known work for both of them. The director is Leander Haumann and he is mostly known for his films that focus to a major extent on German history so the subject in this 10yearold film is something entirely difference. And it is also something he never may want to do again. Then again Haumann did not work on the story apparently so you cannot really blame him for how badly all this turned out eventually. This is especially disappointing because the cast is massive certainly a contender for German movie with the best cast in both quality and quantity of the 21st century. So with a better story and better attention to detail this actually could have turned out really decent. I will not mention the cast members' names I am referring to as you can check out the cast list yourself. Let me just say that the story turned many characters into caricatures that never were allowed to show us their range and talent. Or maybe they are just better when it comes to drama compared to comedy.Anyway now about the story. This is a relationship comedy from start to finish. But the quality is on the level of Mario Barth at times perhaps even lower. One major problem is that the writers in their attempts to make it funny and entertaining completely forgot about realism. There is zero authenticity in here and almost never one has the impression to watch actually existing characters. Instead one funny scene after the other was included here for cheap entertainment purposes and the material wasn't good either. This gives the entire project a very tryhard vibe in my opinion. It never makes powerful or memorable or at least witty statements on human relationships especially between partners as it is all lost in the unsuccessful attempts of rushing one comedic scene after the next. The negative highlight and there were several contenders was probably when the male protagonist even ends up in the newspaper towards the end and as such somewhat funny. It just did not make any sense. A contender for worst film for everybody involved including Haumann at least from what I have seen by him so far. His narration being one of the better aspects of the film is not because it was any good but because it did not suck as much as the rest of it. Admittedly Uwe Ochsenknecht was mildly funny at times except the closing credits where he just sucked as much as everybody else. What a waste. Luckily this did not run for 2 hours.

	schema:headline " Good intentions and some powerful moments but overall a disappointment";
	schema:reviewBody "I honestly didn't think it was very good at all though I respect the intentions of the filmmakers. Whatever one wants to say about Oliver Stone he showed a commitment to faithfully telling the story of these two Port Authority cops trapped in the wreckage of the World Trade Center and their worried wives.I liked a lot of the scenes in the beginning the little mundane details like when Michael Pena's character is going about his everyday street beat. But the scenes at the WTC itself are really awkward especially the crosscutting between real footage and the actors. They just don't match neither the film stocks nor the actors' reactions. A couple of moments with Pena standing there on the concourse were effective in creating a sense of horrific surrealism and the moments right before the collapse were sudden and chilling...but overall it was not as powerful as I was expecting. For a film called World Trade Center I guess I was expecting a little more context and not something focused so narrowly on these two Port Authority cops and an exMarine from Connecticut as the only person outside these two cops' families whose story is told in the film the focus on him reeks of jingoism in a GI JoeRambo vein. I know it's a little unfair to compare this to United 93 but I need to in order to illustrate the point. U93 told a specific story the experience of the passengers on the plane and placed it within a context what was happening with air traffic control and the military. The lessons that are demonstrated in the actions of the passengers are enhanced by contrasting them with the helplessness of the professionals responsible for their safety. It's telling a dramatically powerful story conveying a theme  AND providing a larger historical context of what happened that day. Oliver Stone by comparison has failed to effectively tie the experiences of these two trapped cops with the larger events of the day and his film suffers as a result. And in the end the film largely shortchanges the stories of the 2749 families who didn't get good news that day. OK so the film focuses on a narrow story of these two trapped cops and their families and the gung ho marine but he has limited screen time. Was their story well told? The scenes amidst the wreckage were compelling but the backandforth with their wives became annoyingly schmaltzy. Yes Maggie Gyllenhaal gave a strong performance as the pregnant wife and a lot of the moments with her family esp the brief scene with the Colombian motherinlaw praying were emotionally poignant but so much of the family stuff was lame melodrama. And to be honest even Maggie's performance was a little generic. I understand that these characters are all closely based on real life but it still felt very Lifetime movie of the week. As for Maria Bello in the role of the other wife I loved her in A History of Violence but she was bland in this. The kid actors playing her children were mostly awful and the film dragged whenever their story was on the screen. The resolution is mostly handled well I really like what Oliver Stone is trying to convey about these small gestures of heroic goodness in the face of such desolation. But the power of these scenes is undermined by his tendency to pour on the sappiness while largely ignoring the greater horror of the day. It feels like a soap opera set against the greatest tragedy of our age and that just doesn't work for me.In short...not intense enough not enough context too much melodrama not enough of a sense of reverence for what happened highly impressive job of recreating the debris field a charismatic performance from Maggie overall a mediocre film.".

Personally I hated this movie on its own merit as poor filmmaking. It seems that Oliver Stone just decided he wanted to make a movie any movie about 911 and didn't care about the content of the movie. The end result was a movie of such pitiful quality that one could go though the script and replace the term police officer with miner and World Trade Center with a coal mine and the entire script would work perfectly as a cavein disaster movie. It's that generic. Stone tries to carry the movie just by showing how sad the families were and how scared the policemen were meanwhile allowing the audience no interesting plot points to hold on to nor any significance to the tragedy. In the end I have to conclude that Oliver Stone just wanted to get some cheap emotional reactions from the crowd because at one point the movie says that it is about the potential for good in humanity and how strong we can be in the face of adversity. Stone quickly forgets this because only about 15 of the movie even shows people coming together to help one another. The other 85 of the movie is spent watching the families argue or seeing flashbacks to their happy memories which is a good way to get audience reaction but hardly lends any significance or depth to the plot. I don't in any way want to belittle the pain that these families had to endure which is why I am disappointed that that pain was exploited to make a bad movie. September 11 was the most important and tragic event in my lifetime and I think it deserves more respect than to be made into a generic poorlywritten disaster movie less than five years after it happened.".

	schema:headline " A lifeaffirming movie about courage";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a little known story from a day we know all too well. World Trade Center tells the gripping true story of two of the last men pulled out of the rubble of Ground Zero alive.Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena play Port Authority Police officers. In the film's heart pounding opening minutes we watch the attack unfold through the eyes of these first responders. As the routine morning becomes anything but routine the officers glimpse news reports we are thankfully spared any images of the plane striking the towers and get bits of information from cellphone calls to family members as they race downtown. But what's most striking is how little the men know about what's really happening. As the officers prepare to the climb the North Tower they are unaware the South Tower has even been hit. Communications gear is failing and there is confusion all around.Through impeccably detailed sets and flawless special effects director Oliver Stone and his filmmaking team recreate these hectic moments in alltoorealistic detail. You're right there on the street looking up and watching the chaos unfold in 35mm and THX surround sound. If you didn't know any better you'd think Stone had a crew shooting in Lower Manhattan that day. You have to struggle to remind yourself everything you're seeing was recreated on a sound stage on inside a computer.Screenwriter Andrea Berloff further enhances the realism with believable dialog. She not only effectively captures the cop talk half the time there's so much lingo being bantered back and forth you don't understand what the heck the characters are saying  as it should be she also delivers a truth and honesty to the conversations and interactions. The words never feel contrived.The quality cast does the script justice. It's remarkable how well Cage a major movie star disappears behind the mustache and hunched shoulders of Sgt. John McLoughlin. Pena last seen as the locksmith in Crash is instantly likable as Ofc. Jimeno. Their performances are even more noteworthy considering they spend the majority of the movie flat on their backs. They are also well supported by Maria Bello and Magie Gyllenhaal as their respective wives who spend much of the film enduring an agonizing wait to learn the fate of their husbands.Stone's storytelling is also more methodical and straightforward than it's been in recent years. He mercifully ditches the frenetic editing style he's employed in films like Natural Born Killers and Any Given Sunday.Not PoliticalWhen one hears that Oliver Stone director of such politically charged films as JFK and Born on the Fourth Of July is making a movie about 911 your first tendency is to say uh oh. But this may be the least political movie Stone has ever made one both red states and blue states can agree on. It's not about the roots of terror or who's to blame for what. It's not about villains. It's about heroes. Though set during one of America's darkest hours it tells a lifeaffirming story of courage love and the strength people can summon inside. The movie reminds us how we all felt that day how we all came together. Some say it is too soon for a movie like this. But as our nation sits so sharply divided it's not a minute too soon to remember the unity of purpose we all had on 911 and ponder whether we can ever get it back.".

But what's most striking is how little the men know about what's really happening. As the officers prepare to the climb the North Tower they are unaware the South Tower has even been hit. Communications gear is failing and there is confusion all around.Through impeccably detailed sets and flawless special effects director Oliver Stone and his filmmaking team recreate these hectic moments in alltoorealistic detail. You're right there on the street looking up and watching the chaos unfold in 35mm and THX surround sound. If you didn't know any better you'd think Stone had a crew shooting in Lower Manhattan that day. You have to struggle to remind yourself everything you're seeing was recreated on a sound stage on inside a computer.Screenwriter Andrea Berloff further enhances the realism with believable dialog. She not only effectively captures the cop talk half the time there's so much lingo being bantered back and forth you don't understand what the heck the characters are saying  as it should be she also delivers a truth and honesty to the conversations and interactions. The words never feel contrived.The quality cast does the script justice. It's remarkable how well Cage a major movie star disappears behind the mustache and hunched shoulders of Sgt. John McLoughlin. Pena last seen as the locksmith in Crash is instantly likable as Ofc. Jimeno. Their performances are even more noteworthy considering they spend the majority of the movie flat on their backs. They are also well supported by Maria Bello and Magie Gyllenhaal as their respective wives who spend much of the film enduring an agonizing wait to learn the fate of their husbands.Stone's storytelling is also more methodical and straightforward than it's been in recent years. He mercifully ditches the frenetic editing style he's employed in films like Natural Born Killers and Any Given Sunday.Not PoliticalWhen one hears that Oliver Stone director of such politically charged films as JFK and Born on the Fourth Of July is making a movie about 911 your first tendency is to say uh oh. But this may be the least political movie Stone has ever made one both red states and blue states can agree on. It's not about the roots of terror or who's to blame for what. It's not about villains. It's about heroes. Though set during one of America's darkest hours it tells a lifeaffirming story of courage love and the strength people can summon inside. The movie reminds us how we all felt that day how we all came together. Some say it is too soon for a movie like this. But as our nation sits so sharply divided it's not a minute too soon to remember the unity of purpose we all had on 911 and ponder whether we can ever get it back.";

	schema:reviewBody "Something surprising happened while watching Oliver Stone's World Trade Center  I realized how much more I appreciated Paul Greengrass' United 93. Greengrass' film was lean stripped of any backstory for any of the characters. Very simply it told what happened that horrible day on the plane  though he used some license  and didn't wallow in needless sentimentality.Stone on the other hand and rather surprisingly seems to have gone out of his way to make something that would be so palatable and inoffensive that it would turn out rather bland above anything else.The 45 minutes of World Trade Center are terrific. After offering us quick glimpses into the lives of Port Authority cops John McLoughlin Nicolas Cage and Will Jimeno Michael Pena Andrea Berloff's script gets us right into the attacks on the Twin Towers.The crumbling of the towers which still is incredibly difficult to watch let alone fathom is handled with taste but also is awfully gripping. We get a real sense of the terror and panic and then Stone gets the claustrophobic atmosphere right. With closeups of Pena and Cage amidst the ruins he gets us so close we can almost taste the rubble and concrete dust.But that's the last time we really see or feel any sense of genuine gripping storytelling in this film. I realize criticizing a film about 911 especially one that displays its American stars and stripes so blatantly is tantamount to treason these days. After all as this administration and its minions love to point out if you disagree with them you're not only unpatriotic but also an appeaser of the villains. It's poppycock of course. Dissent is undoubtedly American but these chaps so love draping themselves in the flag that jingoism overwhelms all reason. Why bother with rational thought when you can scare people?What struck me while watching the film is realizing how much goodwill was channeled toward the United States after the attacks and what's ultimately sad is how this president took all that goodwill and squandered it by launching an utterly pointless war in Iraq. We could have done so much good in the world instead of now being one of the most hated nations in the world. And Bush has now turned 911 into a political slogan for political and personal gain.The problem with Stone's film isn't so much the story but how Berloff chose to tell it. According to Berloff cops rescue workers even family members tend to enjoy speaking in exposition. There are moments that surely someone of Stone's calibre should have realized needed to be rewritten because the dialogue seems mediocre at best.Where the film suffers is when the story cuts between the two trapped men and their families especially their wives. Maria Bello as Donna McLoughlin and the always wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal as Allison Jimeno never get much to do with their sorely underwritten roles. It's a true testament to Gyllenhaal's talent that she turns a rather sour role into a passionate moving performance. Poor Bello on the other hand isn't that fortunate. She's relegated to spending more time than she should weeping.The trouble with these scenes is not that Berloff tries to wring some emotion out of them but that they come off as unabashedly sentimental. And the emotions are entirely unearned.Pena proves just as he did in Crash 2005 that he's able to be something special on screen. His character is far more engaging than Cage's Pena's emotions come off without any artifice.I can't help but feel that World Trade Center could have been the gutwrenching experience Stone intended it to be had he and Berloff approached the story much in the way Greengrass did United 93. Stone's movie is far from lean. It's padded with needless sentimentality and moments that just try so hard to earn some emotion any emotion that they come off as utterly false. And that's unfair to the people whose story is being chronicled here.Watching Cage and Pena trapped should be gripping stuff. But even their dialogue is reduced to exposition. And when Berloff finally leaves the two men and their families we get Dave Karnes Michael Shannon a man so moved by what he saw that he came down to the Twin Towers and proved to be McLoughlin and Jimeno's miracle. We all know Karnes is a real person but I very much doubt that he speaks in bumper stickers. But that's exactly what Berloff has him do.The first 45 minutes of the movie showed what Stone truly is capable of doing. The rest is rather tepid. And unbelievably forced. Who knew that Oliver Stone of all people would resort to formulaic storytelling. Perhaps he's been so stung by conspiracy accusations and was so keen on appeasing his critics and forgetting the execrable Alexander 2004 that he opted to make the kind of movie Ron Howard would make. That's not a compliment.".

	schema:reviewBody "The horrifying destiny of thousands of ordinary people and hundreds of servicemen and rescue workers on 911 is certainly worth making a disaster movie but this film is dull and boring in its essence. First of all for 60 minutes we watch two guys being trapped under the rubble of WTC tower fighting to stay alive. Not much of a plot. We hear people talking in abbreviations we see flashbacks from their everyday lives we see their families shattered by uncertainty and suspense we hear them rant about cheesy stuff that would make any other movie not this delicate pathetic and a complete washout. What we don't see is an insight on these dramatic events themselves. I can't criticize this film from an artistic point of view but rather from a political one. As we hear a number of explosions inside the WTC the tagline should read The world saw evil that day. Millions of people saw an inside job.There's this dull character Marines staff sergeant Karnes a big bullylike hunk with the IQ of a mongoose and a mindset of a thoughtless pawn who is determined on finding the survivors and pulling them out. He even takes a haircut for this occasion. As he sets an example of what good heroic and obeying citizen should look like. In the end he says US will need lot of good men to avenge this. The end credits show that he served two tours of duty in Iraq which means let's avenge this on the first country that comes along. Or the one Mr. Bushy points at. When we hear media anchors in the movie rant about the attacks from all over one can't help but to compare these descriptions to what US is doing to other countries on a regular basis. They also have no respect for human lives they also bomb civilians they also use terror as the mean to an end and then they stage a falseflag attack so they could bomb even more countries under the excuse of war on terror. Here we have a subtle message that US should avenge their dead but when the others do that it's called terrorism. Why hundreds of thousands of people had to die in Iraq? Just because Uncle Sam yearned to avenge the events so suspicious that even their own brainwashed fellow citizens find them hard to believe? Why did they bomb Serbia which also fought Muslim terrorists within its own borders under the excuse of humanitarian disaster when alleged 100.000 refugees in Kosovo were nothing compared to the millions right now in Iraq? Not to mention the body count. Double standards for the privileged world power we all should feel sorry for. Poor little Americans. Yet the Hollywood machinery also makes a profit.Please come and shower us with some more of that depleted uranium before you make another movie like this one.".

	schema:headline " A surprisingly good film";
	schema:reviewBody "I went into this film without expectations. I saw Flight 93 and enjoyed it and I am very interested in all events surrounding September 11th so this film appealed to me. Now I must say that I am not an Oliver Stone fan however upon hearing this movie was nothing like an Oliver Stone film I decided to check it out.The storyline for the film as stated was based on the stories of a few Port Authority police who survived the collapse of the building while being trapped for hours in the rubble. At the beginning we are introduced to each of the characters and their families. It's enough to get us involved with each of them but leaves enough room to elaborate as the film unfolds. The film moves rather nicely without going too fast or slow. The vast amount of the film takes place after the towers collapse while the men are trapped in the rubble. The story is told through the trapped police officers current situation as well as what their families are going through at the same time.I felt this story to be very natural and not Hollywoodized something I had been worried would happen. All the events seemed plausible they didn't throw anything in for added drama. All of the characters were completely believable and you ended up loving all of them by the end. I will caution you though there are some intense scenes in this movie so if you are unable to deal with some of the events from that day you may not want to see the film.The cinematography and sound really aided this film. All of the filming was crisp and clean the special effects were great and you could hardly tell this had been filmed after the towers were gone the shots containing the towers that is. There were some great scenes from life in new york shots of the skyline and the subway as well as some breathtaking aerials. The sound was spot on you could feel the building collapse as the scenes unfolded on the screen. It was a great job all around.Overall I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was it lived up to Flight 93 although it has an entirely different feel to it. This film is not groundbreaking work but it wasn't meant to be. It was meant to tell the story of a few brave men and their families and their experiences during September 11th and it accomplished this very well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before you brush this review off as someone that is just looking to cause problems or badmouth a movie let me give you my background. I live in NJ less than 5 minutes from the city. My family is heavily in twined in the Port Authority of NYNJ. My grandfather is a retired Lieutenant and my uncle has been a PAPD officer for 12 years and I have both friends and family that worked in the world trade center in the PA executive offices.The movie itself concentrates on two PAPD officers Will and John. It follows their ordeal up to the point of rescue. OK. Seems good. But what about the 2700 people that were lost on that terrible day. The writers spent too much time basing the movie on two men and their story of triumph that the true events of the day were left in the shadows.There were times during the movie that I almost forgot what I was watching because it seemed like these were the only two men along with their families affected by the tragedy. The ordeal seemed no different than that experienced by the miners that were rescued in pennsylvania several years back. There was no rescue of other people even mentioned until the ending credits at which time they finally acknowledged that people were actually lost.The movie gives the impression that September 11th and the days following was an uplifting experience because two men were found alive. It fails to document all that was lost and never recovered. If a movie must be made about such a tragedy then the movie should show it like it is. There should be no dramatic rescue with uplifting music. The day was terrible the events were terrible and the story was terrible. Lets not make the worst day in our country's history into an uplifting happy ending version of titanic.Throughout the movie there were 3 mentions of lost people other than the main characters. The first of an unnamed elevator operator the second was a quick clip of missing person posters and the final was the ending credits that gave the true numbers. Those three scenes are what September 11th was. It was not a love story. It was not a triumph. And more than anything it was not material for a Hollywood movie.".

I remember watching the TV glued to it for answers to the questions that I never will have answered as to how something so horrible could happen. This film doesn't attempt to try to answer that question instead it looks at the spirit of people and how we can come together to help others.I am so glad I went to see this! It is a powerful work of film that tells the story without sensationalizing the event and the anger and hatred for the attackers following the attacks. It's a film of last words and feelings we tend to develop after years in a relationship. There are tears of joy laughs and tears of sorrow interlaced throughout this film with Strong acting from a huge cast including Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena.Totally recommend this film although it may certainly be tough for those that lost loved ones in the buildings.".

	schema:reviewBody "First I vote 1 for this dreadful piece of celluloid just because IMDb hadn't provided negative votes yet. Absolutely big disappointment coming from one of the finest directors of all time  Oliver Stone. Having in mind that he directed such masterpieces as JFK and Naturally born killers I have no excuse for him making such blatant propaganda movie except for the paycheck. Every single clich you name it you have it here. Patriotism is flowing from every possible hole the opposite of smart Bush showing like a cockroaches from every frame. Yes for sure Americans do deserve to have such idiotic film made for such tragic event so let them have it. A apropos when do we have movie about more than half million innocent civilians killed in Iraq by Americans? For all those women and children coldheartedly slaughtered and maimed by American soldiers and not even statistically put as collateral damages? A movie about how the US invasion of Iraq provoked and increased the uniting of the world terrorism in that poor country? Where is THAT movie mister Stone?".

Absolutely big disappointment coming from one of the finest directors of all time  Oliver Stone. Having in mind that he directed such masterpieces as JFK and Naturally born killers I have no excuse for him making such blatant propaganda movie except for the paycheck. Every single clich you name it you have it here. Patriotism is flowing from every possible hole the opposite of smart Bush showing like a cockroaches from every frame.

Instead we get cheesy apparitions of Christ and macho chest bangers who dissolve quickly to tears all driven by an overload of emotion. It was clichd beyond belief and a sadly missed opportunity. Ultimately it did a disservice to the heroes of that horrendous event. Some of the early morning cityscape scenes were interesting. The special effects were unnoticeable the way it should be. This presentation of reality gave the film the authenticity it was looking for. Nick Cage was underwhelming in World Trade Center. Among his many excellent works Weatherman Lord of War Matchstick Men Adaptation this must be low point for him as it was for this Cage fan. The supporting actors were a partial salvation to the generally awful filmmaking. I think Oliver Stone is gradually revealing himself to be overrated. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone particularly if you're an American For a start it insults your intelligence and your sensitivity but more significantly it makes a mockery of your identity and your history. I'd be offended. Miss it now.".

The fact that this film was directed by Oliver Stone wasis a surprise. The film is benign in the sense that it does not postulate about what happened that day and why which is not your typical Stone movie. Instead it takes its time telling an intimate story about a group of Rescue Workers caught up in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers and their battle to surviveescape an unimaginable hell.The film works because Stone takes the time to flush out his characters we genuinely care about these people and feel their emotions as things turned from bad to worse that day. Cage Bello Pena et.al. play their roles effectively making us aware that 911 affected ordinary people and caused them to perform in an extraordinary way.All in all an excellent film. While it is bigbudgeted and full of big names it simply tells one of MANY stories to be told on that day effectively and faithfully. As with United 93 I would recommend bringing Kleenex.".

	schema:reviewBody "A totally preposterous but fastmoving and quite enjoyable potboiler that doesn't outstay its welcome this film also boasts additional interest for its audacious train crash sequences and its status as almost the first British sound film.It's based on what had been a very successful West End play cowritten by Arnold Ridley later better known as Dad's Army's Private Godfrey. The characters are all stereotypes of the day the hero Joseph Striker is a good chap the sort who puts up his fists when some cad threatens him with a firearm who has retired from being rather good at cricket to help his uncle run a railway while his plucky girlfriend Benita Hume ends up saving the day. There's an annoyingly dense private detective Leonard Thompson for comic relief an oily villain Carlyle Blackwell who got star billing and his moll Pauline Johnson who comes good in the end. The villain the owner of a bus company who also masquerades as a railway general manager has a cunning plan to promote road transport by organising the wrecking of trains. He should have just waited a few decades for the British government to wreck the railways and then franchise them out to the bus companies.It's the sort of film where characters turn amateur detective rather than doing the obvious and going to the police and even a series of horrendous rail disasters and a murder can't shift the impression that this is all a rather jolly jape.The film claims to feature the most spectacular staged rail crash in British film history and with some justification. The money shot shows a loco hauling a full rake of six coaches down an incline at 65kmh smashing into a steam lorry at Salters Ash level crossing on the sinceclosed Basingtoke to Alton Light Railway later the location for the betterknown Oh Mr Porter!. The lorry is simply pulverised the train jumps from the track and crashes onto its side belching huge gouts of steam. There's lots of other authentic railway detail if you're interested in that kind of thing the Southern Railway cooperated with the film makers to provide authentic locations. The railway is brilliantly and innovatively filmed including one remarkable shot where the camera appears to track sideways from the exterior of a moving train to the interior of the coach.The soundtrack was never intended to have full dialogue just sound effects and musical score with a few snatches from a radio announcer  in fact a plot point revolves around a phonograph recording of the villain instructing a henchman. It's now lost and the current DVD release features a decent new score by veteran silent film accompanist Neil Brand.".

In return Katja had an attitude towards people like Bokma because they don't take her seriously as an actress. In a way this is reflected in the choice of the cast. Katja is a soapy and Bokma is a classic play actor. I found it quite refreshing to see Katja act very well. Even playing that she played a role towards Bokma came out very good. She really has a talent and actually can act. I was both delighted and ashamed of myself that I had judged Katja only because she played in a soap and looks gorgeous...

Theo van Gogh is a gifted director Thomas Kist a good DP and the actors do a fine job. The film's problem lies in it's screenplay. Yes Holman has created selfconscious characters and given them confrontational brutally honest lines that certainly exceed the quality of dialogue in the average Dutch production but I didn't find the characters psychologically valid especially Katja's. They never struck me as real people. Holman doesn't display a true understanding of the human psyche which is unfortunate for a psychological thriller. Therefore it could have been better.".

I admit I started and continued watching Interview for the most shallow reason possible the starring of Katja Schuurman. This ravishing Dutch actress has the face of an angel the voice of a siren and a booty that would even make the most popular Hollywood actress jealous. In this she plays the part of a successful actress who gets interviewed by some sort of Bosnian paparazzi guy. They constantly argue play with each other's feelings etc etc etc The script is tedious and nowhere near original or compelling. Although it probably was Van Gogh's intention it totally doesn't feel like an artistic piece of cinema as there's no style to detect anywhere. Not even a bit of exceptional camerawork or memorable music. This is a complete failure and I don't really feel obliged to give it more praise simply because the maker is death. Avoid!

These are the same people who don't like Godzilla films because they can't get over the lowbudget special effect and the silliness and who can't tolerate anything different than megabudget hollywood blockbusters and that just breaks my heart.  I kind of enjoyed seeing it on MST3K but I was dissappointed that they included it in the same league as the truly awful but no les enjoyable Hobgoblins and Space Mutiny.  This is one of the great 60s films as far as i'm concerned.  What really sets the films apart is stylish cinematography and direction by the great sadly underappreciated Mario Bava also responsible for great films like Black Sabbath Planet of the Vampires Bay of Blood Lisa and the Devil and the gritty cynical Rabid Dogs which was a real surprise after Diabolik.  Even if you hated Diabolik you owe it to yourself to track down a copy of Rabid Dogs.  Also noteworthy is the psychedelicatinged score by the great Ennio Morricone my favorite film composer.".

These are the same people who don't like Godzilla films because they can't get over the lowbudget special effect and the silliness and who can't tolerate anything different than megabudget hollywood blockbusters and that just breaks my heart.  I kind of enjoyed seeing it on MST3K but I was dissappointed that they included it in the same league as the truly awful but no les enjoyable Hobgoblins and Space Mutiny.  This is one of the great 60s films as far as i'm concerned.  What really sets the films apart is stylish cinematography and direction by the great sadly underappreciated Mario Bava also responsible for great films like Black Sabbath Planet of the Vampires Bay of Blood Lisa and the Devil and the gritty cynical Rabid Dogs which was a real surprise after Diabolik.  Even if you hated Diabolik you owe it to yourself to track down a copy of Rabid Dogs.  Also noteworthy is the psychedelicatinged score by the great Ennio Morricone my favorite film composer.";

	schema:headline " How to enjoy this film";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching the featurette that accompanies this DVD did help me to appreciate this movie more. Namely that Diabolik pronounced Deeabolik in the Italian is an antihero thief rather than a government sponsored spy and is all about 'sticking it to The Man' as befits the 1960s counterculture. Being Italian it also contrasts with the American idea of a superhero. The Italians lost the last war they had Mussolini and no faith in the government. This antihero is on the same page whereas Superman is all in favour of the President. I suppose this is the superhero's answer to Burlesconi.Point no 2 unlike Fleming's James Bond Diabolik is based on a comic strip hero and many of the shots mirror that panel shape in the way they're framed the shot of the couple talking reflected in the rear view mirror of a car for instance. For all that the style is more dynamic than other comicbased films like Barbarella.Otherwise it's astonishing how many scenes anticipate similar ones in Bond films from the opening helicopter car chase along the winding mountaintop road which predates that of The Spy Who Loved Me by nine years along with other scenes that pop up in Moonraker For Your Eyes Only A View to A Kill and GoldenEye.Sadly Diabolik played by John Philip Law who was the angel in Barberella is a humourless blank a charismafree zone who scarcely utters a witticism in the entire film. I think the only reason such lusty or promiscuous attitudes prevailed in the 1960s is because the likes of Sean Connery and Michael Caine put a positive spin on it.This is a guy in superhero guise who has no alter ego  and therefore no social life. Batman has Bruce Wayne Superman has Clark Kent. He is just Diabolik and when he retreats to his lair to bang his bird fine but he doesn't actually have any mates at all so it's hard to connect with him. It's like if Superman decided to not bother to save lives but just went on Vikinglike pillages once in a while holing up in the Fortress of Solitude every so often to shag his mistress and count the cash.The antihero and his girl are so unlikeable and ruthless that you do feel excluded from their activities. They remind me of the charmless pair from Topaki though the film has more to offer than that and is superior to many Bond knockoffs of the day.".

And if you think that a lot of 'stylish' 90's films with their musicvideo montages aren't going to look dated in twenty years you're kidding yourself.

The next morning I thought the whole experience had been a vivid and bizarre dream. The film has fascinated me ever since.Mario Bava's film is a hallucinatory artistic but undercooked and underbudgeted concoction which never quite coheres into the film we want it to be. 'Danger Diabolik' nonetheless conjures up some masterful cult moments that richly reward the intrepid viewer who is willing to brave and embrace some ropey filler scenes and awful dubbing.The magic of this film is sometimes missed by the casual viewer and many of those who I have lent my copy to have simply stopped watching half way through as the plot gets bogged down in the muddled leaden Valmont scenes.The magic of this film for me lies in this childhood connection that I have. Diabolik is indeed as many viewers have pointed out amoral and selfish. He kills people and lives only for his hedonistic indulgence. But this isn't really the point. Diabolik's greed is a metaphor of all our material greed and fantasies of selfindulgence for more on this see the definitive article on 'DangerDiabolik' on the 'dvd savant' website Diabolik in all his piecing glances hystrionic leaping minimal dialogue fetishistic costumes and designer love parlours is very much like an irrational inexplicable dream that we read our own meanings and desires into. Diabolik is a hypnotic mysterious figure beyond judgement and law he's not a real person in any way and is not supposed to be one. His love for Eva is an erotic wet dream and has nothing to do with anything except sensual pleasure and wishfulfillment and these scenes linger on as if the editor had forgotten to cut the film.Bava denies us or is perhaps incapable of constructing a conventional wellpaced narrative or a palatable structured story. Instead he gives us a psychadelic reverie. A string of moments to enjoy and remember.

Any fan of the MST series who followed the creators' commentary and blogs on the SciFi channel website and via their newsletters etc knows that the Best Brains crew really ENJOYED Diabolik and saved it for their last episode as sort of a going away present for themselves. And anyone who paid attention to the way Mike and the 'Bots riffed through the movie would know that most of their comments were pretty goodnatured and mostly about the sheer silliness of the proceedings. Certainly Diabolik is head and shoulders over typical MST3K fare. Only MaroonedSpace TravelersSquirm Hercules and the Russian Finnish trilogy come close to it in terms of actors budget energy set design and general competence and ingenuity. Oh and the blackandwhite German TV staging of Hamlet. Even starchy porkfilled German Hamlet is still Hamlet and it does have Maximillian Schell.While the movie is purposefully lighter than cotton candy and not meant to be taken at all seriously it does do a great job of adapting the essence of the Italian comics antihero to the big screen. At a couple points the Bava even has pencil graphics from the series integrated in stop motion into a couple scenes as a tribute to the feel and atmosphere of the Diabolik comics. They got the costume right they got the hot blonde babe right and they even had the audacity to try to pull off some of the gimmicks and plot devices typical of the series much easier to do for an artist with a pencil and a drawing board than a stage and special effects crew! And the whole thing is kept cooking and perking along with an incredibly insistent soundtrack that is built around catchy motifs that sink their hooks into the brain.People don't really act in a film like this. Instead they invest energy inhabiting the cardboard characters who populate the film and trying to bring them to life. But Law and his hot blonde paramour do a splendid job of being magnetic and compelling in a very clichd twodimensional way of course and are fun to watch and they run around pulling heists duping the law making love atop piles of money casually murdering everyone who gets in their way etc. Even the supporting characters the Inspector and the chief mob guy recognizable as Blofeld from the early 007 movies are fine and perform their thankless roles as Diabolik's dupes admirably. It's not like anyone who ever heard of Diabolik didn't know what to expect. And it's not like anyone who spent more than 30 seconds watching it with an open mind wouldn't find plenty to enjoy as a harmless piece of escapist fluff. So I can't quite see the harsh reception and bad comments on the movie. I rate it 7 out of 10 since I refuse to penalize it for dated pop culture references or the questionable morality of the source material. If I even find the 'straight' version on DVD somewhere for under 7 I might pick it up for my collection especially if there are some background extras.".

While she made one other great film Fulci's Hitchcockian giallo One on Top of the Other 1969 her work for Bava will stand as her creative peak. Alas Miss Mell died of cancer before she got a chance to prove her undeniable acting skills elsewhere.";

I pity them. The rest of us including Mike Myers and The Beastie Boys  see their Body Movin' video for an affectionate homage love it as one of the best examples of 1960s Pop Art kitsch. 'Modesty Blaise' was I think the first of the 60s European comic book adaptations in this style followed closely by 'Barbarella' and then 'Diabolik'. Later in the early 70s there was 'Baba Yaga' the last gasp for this short lived genre. Too bad because I just can't get enough of this stuff! 'Diabolik's director Mario Bava is a horror legend largely because of brilliant movies like 'Black Sunday' and 'Kill Baby... Kill!' but he was in fact very versatile not just making Gothic horror classics but also science fiction westerns Hercules movies and hard boiled crime thrillers. And then there's 'Diabolik' something else again. John Phillip Law who played the blind angel Pygar in 'Barbarella' as well as appearing in cult favourites like 'Death Rides A Horse' and 'Open Season' is perfectly cast as Diabolik. Many criticize Law's performance which is admittedly pretty wooden but I didn't have a problem with it. He suits the material which let's face it isn't exactly Shakespeare. Marisa Mell 'Mad Dog' plays Diabolik's beautiful partner in crime Eva Kant Bunuel regular Michel Piccoli 'Belle De Jour' 'La Grande Bouffe' is Diabolik's nemesis Inspector Ginko Adolfo Celi 'Thunderball' 'That Man From Rio' plays Valmont a rival criminal mastermind and TerryThomas 'I'm All Right Jack' The Abominable Dr Phibes' is the Minister Of Finance. Bava was working with quite a small budget less than half a million US dollars  for comparison 'You Only Live Twice' cost nine MILLION more! but achieved wonders a testament to his skill and creativity.  It's a very stylish movie with some wonderfully inventive visuals especially Diabolik's cave which is very impressive considering the lack of money you'd generally expect for this kind of movie.  Added to that a fantastic score from Morricone which many fans believe is one of his very best if not THE best. If you want to see one of the inspirations for the Austin Powers series especially if you enjoy 60s pop culture comic books Pop Art psychedelia trash and the Bond and Flint movies then don't miss 'Diabolik'. The rest of you can wait until 'Bad Boys 3' or whatever drivel you think is a good fun popcorn movie. In my opinion anyone who slams this movie is beyond redemption!".

	schema:reviewBody "Mario Bava may be best known for the horror films he directed but he wasn't limited to just one genre. He dabbled in sciencefiction westerns comedies and peplums. That brings us to this his spy film. And what a film it is! If you didn't know that Bava directed Danger Diabolik and you caught parts of it you would immediately notice his style all over the film. Innovative camera work impeccable lighting wonderful mat paintings and terrific set design are all highlights that have Bava's fingerprints all over them. It's a visually stunning movie from start to finish. It's a real pleasure to watch each scene just to see what Bava will come up with next.As for the story and the character Diabolik for lack of an intelligent review I'll simply say that it's one of the coolest films I've ever seen. Diabolik is the ultimate criminal. His underground lair is as good as anything you'll see in a Bond film. As is his girl Eva Kant. She's the perfect compliment to Diabolik a woman who can keep up with him. Their his and hers white and black Jaguars are the epitome of style. As I said it's all just so cool.My only real complaint is with some of the acting. John Phillip Law may consider himself a leading man on the order of Steve McQueen at least that's the impression I was left with after listening to the commentary but he's got a long way to go. The best I can say is that as an actor he's adequate at best.The rest of the cast is first rate. Terry Thomas is always fun  never more so than here as the government official who has to deal with the result of Diabolik's crimes. Marisa Mell is a joy to watch as Eva. And Bond veteran Adolfo Celi is good in the role of the competing master criminal. The other supporting cast is just as good.In the end if you're a fan of 60s spy films Danger Diabolik should please. But if you're a fan of Bava Danger Diabolik should become a real favorite.".

	schema:reviewBody "The great Mario Bava strikes again. Danger Diabolik! is yet another example of this man's wonderful cinematic style. It has impressed me greatly that Bava has produced superb films in a variety of genres  the horror film the giallo the crimethriller the comedy  and now the superhero film. No matter what type of movie Bava seems to invest it with a remarkable visual flair. With Diabolik he is allowed to go overthetop like never before. This is a picture that is as much a comedy as anything else with a camp style that Bava exploits to the fullest. A lot of the jokes are still pretty funny and the 60's vibe is priceless. Some people evidently don't think too much of this movie but for an Italian genre film enthusiast it offers lots of fun.John Philip Law has never been a good actor. However he suits the role of the antihero Diabolik very well. Similar to his role as Pygar the angel in Barbarella this role just calls for him to look good and play deadpan. And this he does even in a gimp suit. Marisa Mell plays his sidekick she was certainly one of the most beautiful actresses in Italian cinema at the time and needless to say she is perfectly cast here. This dastardly duo get into all manner of situations as they thwart the law. All of their schemes and actions are completely ridiculous and crazy of course but this is all in keeping with the comicbook origins of the characters. I had no problem at all immersing myself in this world.Another consequence of note is the fact that this movie unites both Mario Bava and soundtrack legend Ennio Morricone. I'm not aware of these two creative forces working on the same picture before but for two such titans of the Italian movie scene to come together in a single film is a happening of enough value in itself. Bava photographs everything brilliantly and his typically glorious colour scheme is very much in evidence here too while Morricone pitches in with some ultracool lounge grooves. Both men seem to be in their element. And you will be too if you have any love for psychedelia 60's superhero movies or Italian genre cinema.".

Italians are renowned for making cheap ripoffs of successful American films and Danger Diabolik is their answer to James Bond. I'm not a massive fan of Bondlike thrillers but I'm going to make an exception for this ravishing slice of popart! My main reason for viewing was because of the man in the director's chair. Mario Bava is famous for his horror pictures but he's proved with other films that he's a diverse director and this film proves that further. The film follows a pair of crooks Diabolik master thief and his girl the lovely Eva Kant. After successfully evading the police numerous times Italy finds itself in need of desperate measures which leads to them calling on the help of the criminal underworld and setting up an elaborate ploy to bring Diabolik out into the open. However our man is always a few steps ahead of his wouldbe captors.Bava's direction is once again superb and considering he isn't really in his element that's quite an achievement. The film is continually exciting and great to look at and even though this is very much a 'B' picture Bava elevates it above the rest of the pack. Aside from a plethora of dangerous stunts and clever ploys by our lead character Bava also finds time to plug in a lot of really beautiful scenes  the one that sees our hero's make love on a bed of stolen money being the best of them! The plot is pure comic book so you've got to expect lots of wackiness and things that don't make a lot of sense  but it's all easy to buy into because of the fact that the film is such a blast to watch. The acting isn't bad either. John Phillip Law doesn't really get much to do aside from wear a lot of tight suits but his persona and face match the cool character that he's playing. Marisa Mell provides the eye candy and the pair receive great backup from a cast of experienced Italian actors. Overall I can't say that Diabolik is one of the best films ever made  but it's a supreme piece of pop art and certainly didn't deserve a spot on the show 'Mystery Science Theatre 3000'. For what it's worth I never liked that program anyway but Diabolik comes highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Austin Powers simply couldn't have existed without this film an Italian production produced by the estimable Dino De Laurentiis who also brought us Barbarella Amityville II The Possession Orca the 1976 King Kong and numerous other cheesy gems. With it's swingin' 60s sets outfits and attitude this movie and Barbarella is essential viewing for those curious about the origins of Austin Powers. In fact this movie can be seen as a sort of companion piece to Barbarella as it shares a very similar tone and look as well as one of the stars John Phillip Law. Yes ladies and gentleman it's Pygar here without his wings and in tight black leather.Unlike Barbarella which comes off as far more cheesy than its makers intended this one has its tongue firmly in cheek from the start and never seems to lose control. Diabolik steals whatever the biggest loot around is seemingly for the thrill of it and the way it seems to enhance sex with his fabulous girlfriend Eva. They enjoy having sex on a spinning round bed with 10 million dollars in cash splayed all over it. I suppose I would too if anyone were ever to ask. They never do. Anyway they perpetrate a number of crimes making Scotland Yard look like fools in the process and that's pretty much the movie.The sets and costumes arethere's no other wordfabulous. And what really makes this movie fun is how freely the director will just stop everything to show how cool a set is how outrageous an outfit is whatever. He really shows how fun it would be to be Diabolik and Diabolik himself seems to really enjoy what he does which makes the film enjoyable for everyone.The DVD for this film includes a Beastie Boys video that cleverly interweaves shots from the film with the boys playing Diabolik and various others which is all based on a sequence from the film. There's also a documentary which I didn't watch. Amazingly the trailer gives away the very end of the movie! It's inexplicable.Not much more to say about it. The plot is so simple you can very clearly follow it even with the movie on silent fastforward but the point is not so much the story as the look clothes and attitude. And it's got all of those in spades. Check out my website on bad and cheesy movies Cinema de Merde. Find the URL in my email address above.".

Yes ladies and gentleman it's Pygar here without his wings and in tight black leather.Unlike Barbarella which comes off as far more cheesy than its makers intended this one has its tongue firmly in cheek from the start and never seems to lose control. Diabolik steals whatever the biggest loot around is seemingly for the thrill of it and the way it seems to enhance sex with his fabulous girlfriend Eva. They enjoy having sex on a spinning round bed with 10 million dollars in cash splayed all over it. I suppose I would too if anyone were ever to ask. They never do. Anyway they perpetrate a number of crimes making Scotland Yard look like fools in the process and that's pretty much the movie.The sets and costumes arethere's no other wordfabulous. And what really makes this movie fun is how freely the director will just stop everything to show how cool a set is how outrageous an outfit is whatever. He really shows how fun it would be to be Diabolik and Diabolik himself seems to really enjoy what he does which makes the film enjoyable for everyone.The DVD for this film includes a Beastie Boys video that cleverly interweaves shots from the film with the boys playing Diabolik and various others which is all based on a sequence from the film. There's also a documentary which I didn't watch. Amazingly the trailer gives away the very end of the movie! It's inexplicable.Not much more to say about it. The plot is so simple you can very clearly follow it even with the movie on silent fastforward but the point is not so much the story as the look clothes and attitude. And it's got all of those in spades. Check out my website on bad and cheesy movies Cinema de Merde. Find the URL in my email address above.";

In reality the two have little in common other than both being based on comicstrips and sharing a penchant for exuberant outrageousness.'Diabolik' is the brilliant criminal mastermind behind the most audacious thefts in history accomplished with the aid of amazing Bondesque gadgetry as well as speedboats and sports cars!The film's plot is divided into three sections in the first Diabolik steals 10 million from the government the second has him going after a priceless pearl necklace to give to his lover Eva  the stunning Marisa Mell  while the third focuses on the theft of a gold ingot and boasts some 'Thunderball'style underwater sequences. Each step of the way the supercrook is shadowed by the clever  though not clever enough  Inspector Ginko  great name! .It is interesting to view this movie now in the light of the successful Marvel Comics movie adaptations such as the 'XMen' and 'SpiderMan' trilogies. How different times were then. For one thing there's no back story for the main character. We never find out who 'Diabolik' is or how he got into crime and it doesn't matter. As soon as the film gets underway we are pitched headlong into the action.Bava apparently used the original comic strips as reference when composing shots making the film into a living cartoon. While hardly the world's greatest thespian John Philip Law is perfect for the role of 'Diabolik'  cool handsome and energetic. He's so likable that at times you forget he's the villain! As 'Eva' the late Marisa Mell effectively secured herself a place in the affections of cult movie buffs the world over. Adolfo Celi who plays gangster Ralph Valmont more or less reprises his role as 'Largo' from the Bond classic 'Thunderball'. Dear TerryThomas pops up now and then as a befuddled 'Minister Of Finance'.The eyecatching sets are impressive even by today's standards particularly Diabolik's underground lair. Who would not want to live in a place like that? Here we get what must be the screen's kinkiest love scene as Diabolik and Eva make out on a circular bed covered with the money they have stolen. If nothing else it gives a new meaning to the phrase 'a big bang for your buck'!Unsurprisingly this stylish tongueincheek romp has influenced many rock videos and movies over the years amongst the latter the 'Mission Impossible' films and Phillip Noyce's disastrous 1997 version of 'The Saint'. If Noyce had wanted to remake 'Danger Diabolik' why did he not do so instead of attempting to transform Leslie Charteris' suave club land hero into something he was never intended to be? Though not a spy film per se I think its right to lump 'Danger Diabolik' in with the numerous Bond knockoffs of the '60's such as the 'Flint' and 'Matt Helm' movies. Much of the humour is Bondlike. For example when a villain pleads with Valmont not to shoot him Valmont lowers his gun  and then sends the terrified man plunging through a trapdoor to his death.A final mention must be made of Ennio Morricone's score which I think is marvellous the distinctive sound of 'A Fistful Of Dollars' filtered through '60's psychedelia.'Danger Diabolik' was the final film to be 'riffed' by 'M.S.T.3.K.'. I did not see that particular edition but expect Tom Servo and co. got some comic mileage out of the film's wayout designs and  then  futuristic look. Whoever chose it for inclusion in that show deserves to be covered from head to foot in molten gold!".

There's that underground popart cavern that scene with the revolving bed Diabolik getting encased in molten gold a psychedelic credit sequence with the international charttopping hit Deep Deep Down by the world famous Christy sung over it OK maybe that's an overstatement... cheesy dubbing an LSD club scene and multiple EType Jaguars. This movie rocks. And anyone who disagrees should be encased in molten gold too.";

Knife and his crew make good use of their new friend's abilitiesbecoming upwardly mobile thanks to Chocolatethe nickname they bestow upon him knowing no other.Chow Yun Fat has never been more endearing and charming as the brain injured Chocolate.

Further trauma to poor Chocolate follows which leads to a showdown that highlights the God of Gamblers uncanny ability to win even when opponents cheat and friends betray. While Chow Yun Fat's impressive talent and charisma are at the heart and soul of this film the supporting players are excellent especially Andy Lau and Joey Wong.A must see and a must own for any Chow Yun Fat fan! In DVD versions of this film the subtitle problems noted in other reviews can be overcome by using the zoom feature on the remote. By slightly shrinking the image and adjusting it upward on the screen the English subtitles will be perfectly visible and readable 99 of the time. NoteThe DVD version of the film is edited with several original scenes cut that track the ascendency of Knife and Co. and one pretty major plot point that would clarify the denouement at the film's end. VCD versions which are unedited can be sometimes found but the subtitle problem reasserts itselfVCDs cannot be adjusted to compensate for the problem.  But for anyone who has seen the DVD and has the general plot and dialogue down the search for the unedited VCD version is worthwhile.".

However that's not the only kind of character he plays in this film. Try and think of the coolest person you know. Now try and imagine someone really childish. Now imagine both as one person. Sound like a difficult role for an actor to play? After you see the acting in this film it won't look difficult at all. If you didn't think much about Chow Yun Fat before this movie I can almost guarantee you will after seeing it. He is clearly a brilliant actor.There's really no point to have a really good actor if you can't even have a good story. Luckily though God of Gamblers succeeds in this aspect as well. I don't really want to say anything as the plot is kind of weird at parts but if you just follow along with it you should pleasantly enjoy it. The characters are all performed fairly well and are enjoyable to watch. There is also a great sense of humour to this film which may seem weird at times but always funny.The directing is well done and the music is absolutely awesome and fits the film perfectly. This movie also has what could be considered as one of the greatest endings of all time. This movie is brilliantly executed and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching movies.".

Even if you can't read all the subtitles it's still a pleasant romp.

	schema:reviewBody "First off most likely the reason your interested in this film to begin with is because of Chow YunFat. Well in that case this movie is the absolute Chowiest of the Chow. Interpretation is up to the viewer and this is why Traditionally CYF divides the charisma of his typecast roles into three genres Lighthearted comedies witty romancedramas or violent crimedramas. Sometimes he may blend 1 or 2 of these genre based roles together in one feature however in God of Gamblers we have a blend of all three. Unfortunately the writing doesn't make this a positive attribute as the movie feels like a disjointed combination of two main separate roles for CYF. For instance here gangster and toddler. Yes Chow plays both a gangster and a toddler. The film IS as strange as that sounds. If you have an affinity for the actor and are prepared to suspend your disbelief however this is a very fun movie with silliness and violence slapped across the entire run time. Chow plays Ko Chun The God of Gamblers who becomes a magical legend of every casino he enters. A problem arises where one day he loses his memory due to an unexpected incident and becomes a silly wandering manchild. By coincidence he meets Andy Lau a low level street thug and after some misadventures together Chow is able to slowly remember the legend that he was and then will continue to enforce. Despite a horribly bizarre portion of the film being dedicated to an infantile CYF overall God of Gamblers is a fun ride with an epic ending which will leave you highly entertained plus eager to go out and gamble. In conclusion the TVB CYF and John Woo CYF don't mix well but a bipolar CYF translates to ridiculous fun onscreen. 610".

The problem with Hong Kong films and I did actually buy this one in Hong Kong is that the translations are quite bad and sometimes the humour can be lost not just in the translation but also in the fact that it is a different culture. The thing about Hong Kong is that you can't go there and expect it to be simply an extension of European culture in the way that Australia and America and extensions of European culture but rather it is a sophisticated mix of European and Chinese culture. As one person told me Hong Kong is effectively east meets west and when you go there it is very obvious that that is the case.The movie is about a man named Ko Chun who has an almost supernatural ability to win at games of chance. It is not that he is skilled or lucky but that he is supernaturally endowed with the ability to win even when the odds are stacked against him meaning that the other side is cheating. However one night after escaping some assassins he is walking along a path I suspect in the New Territories when he steps on a trap rolls down and hillside and hits his head a number of times and loses his memory. The small time crooks that set the trap have an attack of conscience and instead of robbing him and leaving him for dead they decided to nurse him back to health.Much of the film simply involves these small time crooks trying to work out what to do with this guy and they do discover that he has this uncanny ability to win however because of his injury it comes and goes so when they try to use his abilities to make themselves rich they end up landing up in a lot of trouble. However there is still the background plot namely the trap where they are trying to lure Ko Chun into a game with a big time crook who lives on a boat in international waters. However because he has gone missing people are at a loss as what to do though they do end up finding him again restoring his memory and bringing the film to a conclusion with a high stakes poker game.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike most gambling movies God Of Gamblers does not address the addiction of gambling. It does not revel the dirty underside to casinos either. Most of all there are no plies of money floating down on a couple having sex. No God Of Gamblers is something entirely different. With a fantastic mix of comedy martial arts and high stakes poker God Of Gamblers set itself apart from all other gambling movie in a way only Hong Kong can do.Ko Chun seems to have an almost supernatural ability to gamble. After nearly missing an assassination attempt Ko Chun falls victim to a prank set by a neighborhood hoodlum. After hitting his head Ko forgets his past life and is left with a child's personality and an affection for chocolate. The hoodlum Knife brings Ko in and when he discovers the mans gift for gambling he uses Ko Chun to become rich. Only until Ko's past returns and the two worlds collide.Chow Yun Fat plays Ko Chun and carries the film on his shoulders. With his excellent delivery as both the expert gambler and the innocent child we are captivated watching his story unfold. Although the subtitles are horribly translated the camera work is great and the fighting is better than expected.Most action movies to come out of America or Hong Kong seem to have one problem in common. They focus on the action and forget the characters. This is why God Of Gamblers stands out from other martial arts movies. We take the time to get to know everyone in the story. The movie is just as much a comedy as it is an action movie. We aren't overloaded with longwinded action scenes. The action is short to the point and interesting.The film on the whole works well. Jing Wong has directed around 140 films and although I have only seen God Of Gamblers I'm sure this is at the top of his list. One of the most interesting bits of trivia about the film is it spawned four sequels and six spin off films. It must have been HUGE over seas. And for good reason! Although the film is two hours long it moves fast and is highly entertaining. A must see for Chow Yun Fat fans or action nerds the world over!".

Only until Ko's past returns and the two worlds collide.Chow Yun Fat plays Ko Chun and carries the film on his shoulders. With his excellent delivery as both the expert gambler and the innocent child we are captivated watching his story unfold. Although the subtitles are horribly translated the camera work is great and the fighting is better than expected.Most action movies to come out of America or Hong Kong seem to have one problem in common. They focus on the action and forget the characters. This is why God Of Gamblers stands out from other martial arts movies. We take the time to get to know everyone in the story. The movie is just as much a comedy as it is an action movie. We aren't overloaded with longwinded action scenes. The action is short to the point and interesting.The film on the whole works well. Jing Wong has directed around 140 films and although I have only seen God Of Gamblers I'm sure this is at the top of his list. One of the most interesting bits of trivia about the film is it spawned four sequels and six spin off films. It must have been HUGE over seas. And for good reason! Although the film is two hours long it moves fast and is highly entertaining. A must see for Chow Yun Fat fans or action nerds the world over!";

	schema:reviewBody "It is kind of odd that it is only now 23 years after the movie was released that I actually got around to watching it especially since I am a huge fan of Hong Kong cinema and God of Gamblers is one of the heavyweighters of Hong Kong cinema. Why? Well when it was released it wasn't easy to get a hand on the VHS copy here in Denmark and not even when I lived in Hong Kong did I acquire it.So did the movie deliver and live up to my expectations? Well yes and no. Yes because it was a very interesting movie and a genre defining one for the time it was made. No because there was a little bit too much juvenile attempts at incorporating comedy into the movie which failed miserably.The story in God of Gamblers is about gambling savant Ko Chun played by Chow YunFat who is known as the God of Gamblers amongst the gambling circuit of Hong Kong. Chun is living the good life lots of money fame and everything he could ask for but it is all taken away one fateful night as he has an accident which leaves him with amnesia. With all memories gone except for his unprecedented knack for gambling small time hustler Knife played by Andy Lau takes advantage of Chun in order to further his own ambition. With lots at stake can Chun recover his past and win the all important upcoming gambling event?Actually the story was quite interesting good and entertaining however the laughable and juvenile attempts at incorporating comedy into the movie somewhat brought down the overall impression of the movie as a whole. Had director Jing Wong opted to not make use of this inappropriate comedy the movie would have worked on a whole other level.As for the cast well of course you know what you get with Chow YunFat however this movie was fairly early in his career and he hadn't honed his actual acting talent all that much it is heavier on the action parts though thankfully later in his career the acting picked up. And opposite him there is Andy Lau with also is one of the major names in Hong Kong cinema.God of Gamblers proved to be good entertainment if you look past the comedy parts and is a definite must have to any DVD collection to fans of Hong Kong cinema everywhere. And having seen this first movie now I am looking forward to actually getting around to watched the sequel and perhaps even the spinoffs as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a massive fan of East Asian cinema. Having watched over 1400 such films and having heard of God of Gamblers and reading the IMDb reviews I was expecting an enjoyable film. In addition I was excited to see Chow Yun Fat and Andy Lau play off of each other.After the opening sequence the viewer will recognize that this film explores wildly unrealistic outcomes for the benefit of entertainment value  and it works for about 20 minutes. At that point this viewer was thoroughly hooked.Afterwards my enjoyment was severely crippled when Chow's character loses his memory and starts acting like a brainless halfwit. Seriously he acts like a mentally retarded 5yearold who likes chocolate. Now don't misunderstand me  I love chocolate too but to see Chow Yun Fat munching on cocoa bars while acting the imbecile does not qualify as cinematic entertainment. Five minutes after this plot development was introduced I was praying that Chow would snap out of it very quickly.I apparently should have known better. This stupid plot line drags on for 75 friggin' minutes and singlehandedly destroys the entire film. It should not be surprising that the screenplay was written by Jing Wong who gave us the utterly overrated piece of crapinfested garbage known as Kung Fu Mahjong 2005 and other subpar efforts like Moving Targets 2004 My Schoolmate the Barbarian 2001 The Duel 2000 Naked Killer 1992 as well as other superlative pieces of trash like Naked Weapon 2002 and Her Name Is Cat 1998. His only good script was Casino Raiders 1989 but then again even a broken clock is right twice a day.The fact is simply that Jing couldn't come up with good material so he made Chow Yun Fat a certifiable lunatic who does lots of stupid things that have no comedic value whatsoever. It's much easier than coming up with a clever screenplay.I'm truly perplexed at the raving reviews of God of Gamblers here. Does everyone really enjoy seeing Chow Yun Fat act like an annoying retard for 75 minutes? It's simply unbearable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greenberg about a discontented 40 year old who's not at all sure what he's doing with his life is a provocative slice of life  but it's not for all tastes. It moves slowly and demands extra attention but even if you're really into the story you might wonder where those 107 minutes went.Ben Stiller in a terrific performance is the titular ne'er do well an itinerant carpenter housesitting for his brother in Los Angeles for six weeks. During that time be meets and falls in and out of like for his brother's executive assistant Florence Greta Gerwig who's also magnificent who's just as awkward as Roger Greenberg.The bulk of the film covers their relationship on one track and the events of Greenberg's past that have led to his existential whereamI ponderances. Some 15 years earlier Roger was in a band out of college with a few good friends. They were apparently quite good but when a record company offered them a deal Roger turned it down afraid of the success it might bring. This led to a serious rift in the band causing each member to go his separate way none of the members has played much music in the intervening years.Liking Roger isn't easy for anyone not even the audience. He's sort of a jerk. It's mentioned that he's just been released from a mental institution although the cause for his hospitalization is not explained. The film indicates that Roger has problems maintaining relationships sometimes acting out  and lashing out  in order to keep himself safe and serene. His arrival in LA allows him to reconnect with several of his old friends many of whom he hasn't seen in those 15 years.It's these fractured relationships that hold the key to Greenberg's life. At times he tries to patch things up and move on with his life but he's just as likely to snap at the friend or lapse into the same behavioral issues that had plagued him as a young man.Stiller is really really good in this. He's surprisingly very good at showing myriad emotions convincingly. At once you believe Greenberg is a polarizing hurting hurtful man on the cusp of the rest of his life. Stiller's brand of comedy can take time to grow on someone but he really shows his range here. I certainly didn't know he could plumb the depths of a character like he did to Roger Greenberg.Gerwig is his equal and is a real presence here. Florence is  like her namesake Nightingale  a huge help to Greenberg's brother as his assistant and he's much more savvy about taking care of the house than Greenberg is about taking care of himself in a funny early scene she asks him to make a list of things for her to get at the store and he writes whiskey and sandwiches. But as good as she is at her professional life her personal life is an absolute mess. She goes on onenight stands because they feel good  okay no problem there  but she has few true connections in life. She has one good friend and you get the impression that her family isn't really close to her she says her niece doesn't relate too well to her. Florence is physically and emotionally awkward unsure of herself in all ways save for her job in which she's commanding. This of course also makes her terribly vulnerable to the advances of the older Greenberg.So the acting is really top notch but the movie just isn't for everyone. Here's why. There's a lot of plot a lot of things happening but very little is resolved or accomplished the film almost feels like a stream of consciousness to which we're privy. What WILL Greenberg do after the six weeks are up? Will he stay with Florence? Will he jilt her? In the end does it really matter? Probably not the ending is abrupt although not out of place for the rest of the film. But one really needs to be atuned to Greenberg's plight in order to enjoy the film. If one isn't the movie's mostly dull with bits of funny moments interspersed throughout. I didn't find it terribly heartwarming just a character study of an unlikable character. Which is not a bad thing at all but this one just didn't completely work for me.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant Heartwarming Character Study That's Not For Everybody";
	schema:reviewBody "... which if you've read the other reviews here you know is a massive understatement.Let's start with the two obvious stumbling blocks to loving this rather astonishingly good and for some altogether lifeaffirming and lovable movie. The main character is pretty much a jerk. There's no plot.Now realize the main character is supposed to be unlikeable. And the movie does not try to have a plot. And you might wonder how can a movie that starts with these two conditions possibly be any good let alone some be some kind of masterpiece? So let me explain.Roger Greenberg Ben Stiller in the performance of his life is by no means completely unlikeable. He's quite funny an adept verbal wit there is no situational comedy in this movie at all it's funny in places because Greenberg is often funny. He has very firm and uncompromising moral ideals. He cares deeply and responsibly for animals. What makes him unlikeable is that he sometimes unexpectedly treats people especially people he cares for like crap  he uses that verbal wit like a blunt knife and goes on unwarranted tirades. And he has almost no insight into himself occasionally the movie is very funny at his expense. You know that guy in your family who is fundamentally deep down a very good person but is all too often an incredible pain and aggravation to be with? That's Greenberg. He is in short the sort of person who is much easier to love than to like. We are told from the outset that he has in fact just been released from a mental institution and this is one of the least clichd and most fullyrounded portraits of a seriously mentally ill person in recent cinema. We watch as he works really really hard to sabotage any hope he has for a happy life.He meets and is immediately smitten with a woman played terrifically by Greta Gerwig it's nearly as much her story as his who has her own set of neuroses but ones that are much more ordinary than his. We watch their relationship play out over a few months exactly as it might in real life without any set of causally related events to provide an engine of plot.So what narrative tension is there? Why keep watching? Very simply if you like Roger Greenberg enough to have empathy and sympathy for his plight if you can see past the sarcastic surface to the deep pain underneath if you can recognize a little bit of yourself in him then you are going to root for him to get his act together to cut all that nonsense out to start to understand himself in short to start to recover some sanity to find the first cobblestones of the path to some kind of happiness.Well that's what happens and it's wonderful to watch. That it's possible to watch the movie and not notice it happening is obvious from some of the reviews here including one that criticized the ending as incomplete in fact this may have the best and most perfect last line of any movie I can think of.If you didn't much like Sideways or Up in the Air I can guarantee that you will hate Greenberg I mean imagine those movies but with no plot too!. If you loved those movies  if you have no problem watching emotionally stunted people slowly grow up  then you'll probably love this too and you may even love the way that the lack of conventional plot makes the movie completely realistic and hence especially powerful emotionally. When I first wrote this review I ended by saying I can't wait to see it again and I suspect I'll watch it many times. I've now seen it twice more and indeed it only gets better.".

	schema:reviewBody "You know those fleeting inelegant moments and transitory almost Seinfeldian scenarios in our lives that unlike on Seinfeld we never really talk about because they betray how clueless and insecure we all are? You know how we'll go to parties basically to see one person and find we're inept at opening up and socializing with anyone else? You know those pointless roundabout stories we'll tell about something that happened that we thought was interesting or funny but we don't realize how boring or monotonous they are till we're halfway through them? What about the receiving end of that situation? Why are we so worried about hurting these painful storytellers' feelings when they're making us so uncomfortable having to feign interest or amusement for indefinite durations? You know those sexual experiences we never talk about even to our best friends because they were so painfully awkward and nakedly ungraceful? You know how when we're on drugs we only indulge occasionally and we find ourselves wording things in creative ways feeling overconfident and impulsive while everyone else is viewing us as rather reckless? Roger and Florence know all too painfully awkwardly uncomfortably recklessly well.Some of us handle these situations much better than others. Some of us save face some of us don't care that much some of us read other people well enough to know it's all just part of life. Fortyyearold carpenter Roger Greenberg and his brother's collegeage assistant Florence are stranded by an utter deficiency of any of these possible salvages. Inevitably finding themselves sharing these horrible moments whenever they're together they are in turn repulsed by one another. They can't stop reeling over what happened last night the other night a week ago. And while Florence is too timidly selfeffacing and in need of being with someone to bring herself to write off Roger Roger's whole perspective on everything is disfigured by his narcissistic compulsion toward suffering his hermitlike disdain for any and every inconvenience and righteous indignation that he can't allow to exist alongside ever being at fault. It's Seinfeld in the bathroom with a razor blade in the tendon.When you watch the trailer you're watching a nervously smoking exec hoping to at least break even by streamlining all the overtly laughinducing moments. With the possible exception of less than a handful they indeed are all in the preview. The dry carping lines by Stiller the Starbucks letter at the party telling off the GenY stoners hitting the SUV and bailing when it actually stops. Greenberg is a comedy but in such an internal and carefully cringeworthy way that most scenes are seemingly shapeless renderings of a combination of characters situated in a combination of daytoday situations and the readily apparent punchline moments are indeed that few and that far between. But that is its intent and it succeeds with witty effect An impossible jerk and a bashful marginally popular girl idiosyncratically push each other's most debilitatingly precarious buttons but aren't able to go their separate ways because they're too thinskinned to be alone. It is the ultimate antiromantic comedy. No Golden Globe moments here.Ben Stiller gives the performance I believe all truly good comic actors capable of one of fierce angst and biting personal honesty. We've seen Sandler unravel an entirely different dimension of himself in Punch Drunk Love and Reign Over Me Robin Williams in World's Greatest Dad and Insomnia Pryor in Blue Collar and so on. Roger Greenberg is his tour de force as a wellrounded perceptive and talented actor who's not afraid of his audience going as far as to dislike his character which would be entirely understandable for many viewers to feel because he deeply understands Greenberg and doesn't judge him. The gratifying discovery we make here is that of Greta Gerwig. Yes she is very sexy but exactly the way Greenberg describes She's I don't know bigger. I find it sexy. She's pure salt of the earth a real person unfettered by makeup or fashion. I know many girls who talk dress and act just like her Florence who she makes come alive on just the right naturalistic levels.Writerdirector Noah Baumbach made two previous films very strongly akin to this. They were the concise and beautiful The Squid and the Whale and the soulcrushingly relatable and mercilessly matteroffact Margot at the Wedding. All three of these films have difficult and selfunaware individuals at their centers they each share a bonedry and woefully cynical sense of humor and they each reveal Baumbach's inimitable talent at showing us characters and situations so universal and everyday as to levelheadedly gaze at the most abstract innards of acknowledgeable moments of personal and social frustration. His actors always feel extemporaneous in the moment unscripted. Their characters belong to an everpervading yet littlecharacterized contemporary facet of liberalized informationage American society. At arm's length he shares the quirky idiosyncratic likes of Wes Anderson except there is not one shred of hopeful sweetness or heartwarming serendipity. Those are things we love and we embrace them whenever we experience them but at the expense of never taking the time to face the realities of the banal the bilious stuff of everyday life. That's where Baumbach comes in.".

It is funny in the sense that Ben Stiller is socially inappropriate at times but honestly it's not a funny film and sometimes the film tries to be funny and definitely falls flat. The story is also a little slow to start. That said it's still a good film.Some people clearly don't get this film...Anyone who says it wasn't funny!! or nothing happened! is missing the point. This is one of those rare movies based entirely on character with a very realistic plot progression. It's not the best movie of the year or anything but it's a really good example of a characterdriven story. If you don't care about or get Greenberg there is nothing for you here.I must protest the people who say the film is unbelievable. It is very believable but not necessarily relatable. It portrays a man bordering on mental instability very well.Ultimately this movie is similar to Woody Allen pics in affect although much less funny. But it still has that world through the eyes of a neurotic gimmick as well as the laissezfaire plot progression.Ben Stiller also deserves praise for a great real performance as Greenberg and he is supported by a mixed cast some great some poor.I recommend this film to anyone familiar with OCD anxiety or anyone over 40 who asks what happened?".

He's also just been released from a mental institution so you can well imagine that his neuroses are going to be pretty much off the chart as well. A carpenter and former musician who regularly resides in New York City Greenberg is currently housesitting at the Hollywood Hills home of his wealthy and successful brother Phillip Chris Messina while the latter is away on business in Vietnam with his family. While he's staying there Greenberg meets Florence Greta Gerwig a sweet but rather unfocused woman almost half his age who works as a personal assistant  i.e. dog walker babysitter and allaround gopher  to Phillip and his family. Greenberg's mental issues manifest themselves through various phobias and idiosyncrasies all of which lead us to the conclusion that he is generally just afraid of life of taking a risk when doing so could possibly lead to failure. To that end he avoids large groups of people writes endless letters of complaints to companies he feels have somehow screwed him over overreacts to other people's words and actions and makes a general antisocial and sociopathic painintheass of himself. And to no one is he more psychologically abusive than to Florence a girl with her own share of vulnerabilities who in his own crazy way he is obviously trying to impress but who he just keeps pushing away with his eccentric behavior. It's hard to really get much of a bead on either Greenberg or Florence and that is both the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of the screenplay by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Noah Baumbach who also directed the film. On the one hand one appreciates the complexity of the characters their refusal to allow themselves to be pigeonholed into one neatly delineated box or other. On the other the coolly objective stance the script takes creates a barrier between us and the characters the result being that we find it hard to identify or empathize much with them especially Greenberg who finally becomes as offputting to us as he is to those he comes in contact with throughout the course of the picture. In drama there's a fine line between a character who is intriguingly different and one who is just annoyingly selfindulgent and Greenberg crosses over that line with dismaying regularity.Still the performances are excellent  this is probably Stiller's best dramatic work to date  and the inconclusive ending is impressively brave enough to erase a multitude of earlier sins.".

Ben Stiller stars in this as a man struggling with his life who meets a woman and begins a romance with her. Greenberg is a very unlikable person at times although he often reminds one of some neurotic Woody Allen creation and has at times a certain charm. Stiller is very toned down in this and a such does a good job. Stealing his limelight is Greta Gerwig as Florence who gives a fine performance here. Florence is a little odd in her ways and so there is perhaps a connection between the two but if this is meant to be a character study it fails to be anything but a study in dullness. So very little happens that it's difficult to maintain interest and with a unlikable main character the film plods along to the point where I longed for the credits to start.It's a shame the film falls flat especially when you consider previous efforts from Baumbach. Whilst there are some things going for it mostly in performances including a good supporting role from Rhys Ifans there is very little going for it especially when it runs at nearly 2hrs it's a tough film experience.More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com".

	schema:reviewBody "A shrink said to me once that I have trouble living in the present so I linger on the past because I felt like I never really lived it in the first place you know?Greenberg is a drama about...Greenberg. Roger Greenberg Ben Stiller to be specific. A 40 yearold New Yorker who returns to Los Angeles to stay at his successful brother's home while he and his family are away on a trip. He's not dealing with his life not going the way he planned as well as most of the other people he knows and he's perpetually stuck in the past. The music he listens to is old he talks to people about events that happened 15 years ago that they don't even remember and he's just generally an unhappy guy. His main activity is writing letters of complaint to various companies. To say that Roger is flawed is an understatement. He just got out of a mental hospital recently he's selfcentered and he tends to freak out about insignificant things as a way to protect himself from people and the world. Yet I still liked him. As does Florence Greta Getwig his brother's personal assistant who isn't exactly a model of happiness and mental health herself and Ivan Rhys Ifans Roger's longsuffering old friend and band mate who is having family troubles of his own.If I had to compare this to another movie it would be Rachel Getting Married. Not because of any plot similarities but because of a similar tone and some shared themes. Specifically being adrift in adult life and how issues and regretted decisions from youth can linger and fester. Also similar to Rachel Getting Married there's never a breakthrough moment where the flawed characters are suddenly okay and all the problems disappear. If you expect grand resolutions from your movies please avoid Greenberg. All we get is a sliver of light at the end that makes us think that something positive may be happening in some of these characters' lives. We're left to imagine and hope that Roger Florence and Ivan are on the road to getting or finding out what they need from life. So yeah I liked it. It's a good indie drama and quite different from Stiller's usual thing. Stiller and Gerwig were both great the characters were wellwritten and I've always been interested in these kinds of stories about adults flailing away blindly in this tricky thing we call life. If you're a fan of movies like Margot at the Wedding The Squid and the Whale both movies share Greenberg's director and Rachel Getting Married I'd suggest that you give this a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Noah Baumbach wrote and directed the excellent The Squid and the Whale and it is with Greenberg that he really makes a statement as an independent filmmaker to anticipate. The second gem is always the most elusive. That said I am not sure I can recommend this movie to very many people despite all the good things I am about to write.This is the first Ben Stiller role that actually seems to fit him. His typical role is as a punchline. Here he plays a guy who recently suffered a nervous breakdown and is now housesitting for his rich brother whose family is vacationing in Vietnam. Throughout the movie Greenberg states he is concentrating on doing nothing right now. Of course that is his defense mechanism for being unable to connect or communicate with any real person. Yes that sounds bleak ... and it is. Yet it is also fascinating and thoughtprovoking.Despite Stiller's strong turn Greta Gerwig as Florence proves to be the heart of the story. She is the family assistant to Greenberg's brother and finds herself oddly attracted to Greenberg's vulnerable state. This is my first exposure to Ms. Gerwig and I find her fascinating as an actress. She has a natural openness on screen and is certainly no glamourgal. Instead she comes across as a very real 25 year old trying to make sense of life  especially her own.In addition to Ms. Gerwig Rhys Ifans provides outstanding support work as Greenberg's long ago band mate. This is the polar opposite of Ifan's character in The Boat that Rocked as here is just a guy putting together a grown up life for himself. He struggles with the adjustment but accurately depicts how choices can make or break us.I am not sure whether to categorize this as a character study or just an exquisitely written series of scenes that hit the nail on the head. One of the best scenes of the film is when Stiller meets up with Jennifer Jason Leigh and she immediately rebuffs his reconciliation attempts. They had been a couple briefly 15 years ago and she has obviously moved on. Excellent filmmaking.The best way I can describe Greenberg the character is that he is a compilation of the dark thought that we all experience from time to time ... a desire to do nothing wanting to be blunt and direct dreams of recapturing the magic of youth and of course writing complaint letters for everything wrong in the world. Obviously most of us spend very little real time on these things but that is the Greenberg character. Let's keep an eye on Mr. Baumbach  he may just be the real deal.".

Occasionally a movie comes along that builds slowly to a great climax at the very end. That is the hope that kept me through this excruciatingly boring attempt at filmmaking. I mean who can tell me the point of this movie? Not once in the entire movie did anything so much as evoked a smile on my face yet they billed it as a comedy.The title character is supposed to be suffering from obsessivecompulsive personality disorder but apparently no one taught the actor what a patient with OCD should look like. Hasn't the actor watched the title character in The Aviator? There is a flicker of ramance in the movie but in the end you wonder if Roger loves Florence or he is just feeling sorry for her. The part of the movie that featured an unplanned pregnancy and an abortion is so emotionally dry you could swear some other couple are involved not them. We are not even told who is the father of the baby but we can infer that it is Roger because Florence denied sleeping with the other guy. In spite of this you do not see any emotions displayed by Roger or Florence before or after the abortion  this is so unreal for those who have actually been through this experience in real life.Another totally incongruous piece in this movie is the caligraphy hanging on the wall of the home Roger was staying in. We are made to believe that this is a Jewish home yet the caligraphy is the Arabic script that translates to In the name of Allah the Most Merciful and the Most Beneficient. Well if this was meant to be a subliminal message that is supposed to show that Jews and Arabs have a common ground no mention of Islam or the presentation of an Arab character featured in this totally pointless movie.In the end the climax that I anticipated to give this movie a reason for being never materialized. I was left wondering what was it all about. This is clearly the kind of movie you should be watching in a blizzard when you are sure there are no taxis available and your home is far away.".

We have heard Roger was in a mental hospital and now seemingly okay goes about his business being demanding uncaring selfish mostly oblivious to other peoples' needsfeelings but also in a funny way trying to reestablish himself. But he is no hurry to do that. Told you it was in a funny way. Remember the Seinfeld TV show where it was practically about nothing yet you laughed your head off? This movie too is about nothing yet we are kept waiting for 90minutes for it to start. There is basically no story. This is a slice of life that goes nowhere. And there is more tension in here than in some murder mysterythriller because we have no idea what Greenberg will do or say next.For the most part he does nothing which really doesn't add up as someone trying to reestablish himself toward any goal job or future. So the way I see it this falls flat. Not even any good lines to come away with. None funny anyway except for the Stiller incrowd. Greenberg is just self centered and that is that. Wait. There was one good line in here hurt people hurt people. That sums up Greenberg and this movie. Greenberg realized he did hurt people but saying that and doing something about it are two different things. Some may argue he started to do something at the end of the movie. Are we so sure of that? We are not sure why his friends are still his friends as Greenberg in his younger days put the Kabosh on a record deal that would have made his musical group rich and famous but they broke up and went their separate ways. I thought that the letter writing campaign to companies that displeased him because of poor service in his mind would be the comic relief in here. Didn't happen. Ben should talk to his father Jerry about comedy. Look if you are not going to do comedy then confrontations are needed and the only one was with Ivan near the end of the movie. Not enough. I did come away with something though. Rhys Ifans who played Greenberg's best friend Ivan has a lot of Peter O'Toole in him. I wouldn't say as animated as O'Toole in his later years but there's something there. I suppose we will know more when Ivans stars in a remake of Lawrence of Arabia.Violence No. Sex Yes twice Nudity Yes once Language Yes some in the beginning.".

When I started watching it and learned that Noah Baumbach who had previously made the excellent 'Margot at the Wedding' was the director I knew this was going to be a different kind of movie that would probably reveal a different side of Ben Stiller's acting. Many have described this to be for Stiller what 'Punch Drunk Love' was for Adam Sandler and 'Stranger Than Fiction' was for Will Ferrell.Baumbach's 'Greenberg' is a character driven piece that centres on Roger Greenberg Ben Stiller who recently left a mental asylum and is back in town to housesit for his brother who's away on holiday. He falls for his brother's assistant and tries to pick up the pieces of a life he had once left behind while going through a midlife crisis.Like he did with 'Margot at the Wedding' Baumbach's execution is lowkey and his narration mostly relies on the interactions between the characters and the protagonist's quiet moments when heshe is alone. The art direction is suitably minimal and the camerawork is solid. The dry humour is very effective and consistent with the atmosphere Baumbach creates.Ben Stiller does a remarkable job with an effortless performance. This is definitely a departure from what he's familiar with and he proves that he can deliver a restrained performance when required. Rhys Ifans is equally good. Jennifer Jason Leigh who also cowrote the screenplay provides fine support on both counts. Greta Gerwig is competent.Baumbach has done it again successfully telling a complex story that appears to be much more than what shows on the surface.".

This movie seems to last 4 hours but has a runtime of 107 minutes and I only watched the first 60...I am now officially adding Ben Stiller to my list of never watch a movie with them starring again which includes Adam Sandler Will Ferrel Eddie Murphy John Travolta Nicolas Cage Jessica Alba and Jim Carrey. Eight of the least interesting least funny and least watchable actors on the planet.Graphic designer Milton Glaser has a great quote about healthy vs toxic friendshipsThere is a test to determine whether someone is toxic or nourishing in your relationship with them.

Unfortunately Stiller is not Newman and everything about Stiller's character is an advertisement for running as fast as possible in the opposite direction. Not an iota of charisma in fact anticharisma would be a better description. I guess it could be said that the message is that if you bring nothing to your life you get nothing out of it. Do we need a long boring movie in order to receive this message? There was absolutely no rhythm to this film and filmmakers take note of the intentional fallacy. e.g. if you believe life is boring make a boring movie. While Greta Gerwig lightened up the movie somewhat I couldn't tell whether she was a competent personal assistant or someone with limited mental abilities. It was never clear what her attraction to Greenberg was or why she kept letting him back into her life. Baumbach has made some good films but alas this is not one of them.".

There ARE too many scenes of entire rooms of people turning around to look at Jolie like a perfume commercial or someone with toilet paper stuck to their behind. Characters and relationships aren't fleshed out enough and it's a predictable film  North by Northwest is far superior.But. As one critic said it's a frothy diversion pleasant and fun. Thought the rumpled Depp was lowkey and charming and Jolie was gorgeous and a sympathetic character. There are some amusing twists and our fairly full theater laughed a lot and was entertained by the film at no point did any of us lose interest. There are far worse ways to spend a Friday night and I'd recommend to anyone looking for some diversion and gorgeous views of Venice. Good for anyone looking to unwind after a long hard week.".

The romantic orchestra soars one moment we're treated to a few slapstick shenanigans the next and then comes the brooding minor key to remind us that there's a mysteriously mysterious mystery afoot! I would not have been shocked had Rowan Atkinson made an appearance.Plus the climactic twist isn't as clever as it thinks. I suppose one might be forgiven if he or she finds it cutesy but even if you do fall for it by the time it arrives your interest will be too detached to care.Eliciting little more than a few chuckles and a whole lot of apathy The Tourist makes its mark as one of this year's most pointless and useless films. I can't single anything out as being truly awful but neither can I think of a single reason why you should consider spending 10 a pop on a film that offers absolutely nothing new to the cinematic universe. The Italian backdrop is nice to look at and Jolie and Depp are adequate if not dynamic in their chemistry but it takes more than the visual image of Depp traversing rooftops barefooted and in grandpa's pajamas to be deemed worthy of my time.Entertain engage educate or humor me.

If you did that you would have the trailer for The Tourist and it would sound like a pretty good movie right? But then if you take away the words dark and thriller and realized that those sought after actors were actually last minute replacements then you would have the actual movie.The Tourist stars Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in what appears to be a very promising plot. Jolie plays Elise a beautiful and mysterious woman who ensnares spyfiction fan Frank Tupelo Depp into his very own web of international crime and intrigue. Under the orders of Chief Inspector Jones Timothy Dalton Scotland Yard's John Acheson played by Paul Bettany The Da Vinci Code A Beautiful Mind tries his best to keep up Elise and the man he believes she is connected toAlexander Pearce.For what sounds like a fantastic plot on paper the execution of it all leaves a little something to be desired. Perhaps the problem is with expectations. As stated before the premise and the trailer and two actors who typically take on fairly meaty roles suggests that The Tourist would at least have hints of substance instead the audience is left with a beautiful andfun movie that is essentially summer action fluff  think The Italian Job meets Knight and Day.The problems with the film almost assuredly were the result of apparently several casting and directorial issues during preproduction. Depp's role was reportedly originally slated for Tom Cruise who was replaced by Sam Worthington who dropped out over creative differences and ultimately was replaces by Johnny Depp. Angelina Jolie's character was also apparently intended for someone elsenone other than Academy Award winning actress Charlize Theron. The director German born  Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck Director of the Academy Award winning film The Lives of Others also was a replacement and who he himself dropped out at one point only to resume his directorial role later on. It seems that for whatever reason no one wanted to be a part of this film.The Tourist certainly has its strong points. The visuals are simply stunning whether that describes the beautiful European vistas lavish homes and hotels or the lead actors there is definitely eye candy everywhere. The action scenes are exciting and even the dialogue has some charm. However it seems that for every peak there is a valley. The Tourist like its preproduction story seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. At times the film feels intense and brooding other times it feels like a carefree romp through the waterways of Venice. The dialogue and script have their moments of wit and charm while other parts feel like a reject Bond script. The Tourist is by no means a perfect film however going in with realistic expectations it may be just the way to end your night or your week".

Frank a math teacher and Elise must evade the police and also the mobster who's money was stolen.My Comment This movie is unlike many that Angelina Jolie has played in in that she is involved in very little action. Johnny Depp has a few minor action scenes. Most of the time Angelina walks around looking beautiful and Johnny is like a lost puppy almost as if they phoned in their parts. It isn't a totally bad movie because it only has a little action and a poorly written dialogue for these talented actors. The storyline is not complicated the mobster's money man steals a large amount of his money and he is now on the run for his life plus the police want him too. The movie contains some beautiful panorama scenery of Venice. Overall the movie is not what you would expect but it kept my attention and it is a little entertaining. By the way there is a story twist that you may figure out for yourself before the end. Sony Pictures Run Time 145 Rated PG13 410".

Anyone who missed that must have been watching a different film because it's funny  in fact it's hysterical. But not because it's so bad it's good. No it's totally intentional. The lines are funny the pauses are funny the actors are funny... it's like a younger slightly subtler Venetian version of Red. What's not to like? We're all used to seeing Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie in dramatic roles  Finding Neverland Public Enemies The Changeling A Mighty Heart... and it's so easy to forget that they can be funny. But they are both of them. Johnny shines as he always does. Angelina Jolie looks glorious and when she smiles the screen lights up. They don't have chemistry critics say. Oh yes they do I say. More importantly they seem to be enjoying themselves.Johnny's Frank is delightful touching and slightly mysterious. He has endless room to play around and makes Frank memorable and lovely as only Johnny can. Angelina's role is more limiting but she still makes it fresh and  yes  deeply amusing parodying both herself and the genre in general. Watching her saunter around on her high heels one can't help but recall what James Bond used to be like. This isn't Wanted or Salt she has far more to do here than look cryptic and shoot people and she does it very well.Add to that the utterly magnificent Paul Bettany Timothy Dalton a few stereotypically dim Russian gangsters they speak actual Russian for once and their funniest lines aren't subtitled and Rufus Sewell and there's no way you can go wrong.Yes there's a twist at the end  a twist that seemed to annoy most people. But does that take away from the film? No! It adds to it because it's just so obvious and natural that it's all the funnier for it. This isn't an intellectual film. Nor does it try to be. It's a romp a fun romp with two beautiful endlessly talented actors set in a beautiful city which is shot so beautifully that it becomes like a separate character. So who cares how intellectual it is? This is a film that's genuinely entertaining from start to finish. And if it's snowing where you are you'll certainly appreciate the sunshine. Give it a chance!".

Anyone who missed that must have been watching a different film because it's funny  in fact it's hysterical. But not because it's so bad it's good. No it's totally intentional. The lines are funny the pauses are funny the actors are funny... it's like a younger slightly subtler Venetian version of Red. What's not to like? We're all used to seeing Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie in dramatic roles  Finding Neverland Public Enemies The Changeling A Mighty Heart... and it's so easy to forget that they can be funny. But they are both of them. Johnny shines as he always does. Angelina Jolie looks glorious and when she smiles the screen lights up. They don't have chemistry critics say. Oh yes they do I say.

	schema:reviewBody "'THE TOURIST' Two and a Half Stars Out of Five Two of Hollywood's biggest stars Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie team up for this goofy spy thriller. It's a remake of a 2005 French film entitled 'ANTHONY ZIMMER' which starred Sophie Marceau and Yvan Attal. The American remake is cowritten and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmark who also directed the critically acclaimed German film 'THE LIVES OF OTHERS'. I have not seen that film but his writing and directing here is pretty weak. Pretty much the only good thing this film has going for it is it's two stars and a decent supporting cast including Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton but it really has me wondering what ever attracted the two to this film to begin with! Jolie plays Elise the beautiful mistress of a mafia moneyman who embezzled over 2 billion from a big time mobster played by Steven Berkoff. The British police want the embezzler for it's share of the 775 million in tax money on the stolen money. They don't know what their target looks like though so they've been trailing Elise for a couple years hoping she'll lead them to their man. After receiving a note from her lover Elise sits next to a random American tourist named Frank Depp on a train hoping to lead the police into believing he's the culprit but she unwittingly gets him targeted by the mafia as well placing him in grave danger. Of course the two quickly fall for each other despite the extreme lack of chemistry between the two leads.The story is pretty simple and routine but it does have a couple clever twists towards the end and the climax is enjoyable. There are a few funny lines here and there mostly by Depp but for the most part the dialog is less than impressive. The direction is uninspired and the film feels like a million other mistaken identity movies we've already seen before. Depp is funny though and Jolie looks gorgeous. Like many big star combinations in film the movie is a disappointment though. If only they had picked a better project together the combined talent could have made for a truly entertaining film. I expect more from Jolie and a lot more from Depp. I seriously don't know what they were thinking other than maybe what they were going to spend their money on.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?v68YJe1yftWY".

Time very well spent if you enjoyed Michael Caine and Shirley Maclean in 'Gambit' or Cary Grant with Audrey Hepburn in 'Charade'.From the setup in the opening sequence through the final curtain Angelina Jolie is radiant a classic combination of strength and vulnerability with a distinctly 21st century style. As with Audrey Hepburn in 'Charade' I can imagine no other female star in this role. It is literally decades since I have seen a woman take the gloves off with such seductive grace.Johnny Depp is a masterpiece of bumbling charm as the tourist out of his depth. His comic turn on the rooftops of Venice is one for the ages. He changes mood and character with purely a shift in the intensity of gaze.Paul Bettany is firmly in character as the obsessed agent who will stop at nothing to get his man. Timothy Dalton's small role as his boss is most entertaining. The police in France and Italy are polished comic versions of the hapless agents in a Pink Panther movie. The villain is a dread villain indeed. Rufus Sewell looks fab in a tuxedo and I wish he had more screen time.The only reason I can think of for the lower rankings is that people expected to see lots of highaction sequences as in 'Wanted'. This is not that movie. The action is more Pink Panther than Jason Bourne.Venice is timeless in its elegance as usual. The lack of a gondola ride is a nice departure from tradition.All in all a charming beautiful movie that is worth rewatching.".

	schema:headline " Extremely Charming Beautiful Music Angelina Johnny and Venice Never Lovelier";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is more a work of art than a theatric presentation.  Everything is absolute perfection from scenery to the color of  Venice's waters idealized to casting to every hair in place to  superlative acting to timing to a perfect train ride through a  impossibly lovely countryside to scrumptious scenery throughout to  perfect accents melodically modulated voices and soundtrack.  Angelina Elise has not ever looked more flawless acted more  flawlessly while Johnny Depp Frank quintessentially summoned his  unseemly man one can't help but fall in love with. Is there a human who  doesn't love Johnny Depp? I don't think so.  They are never a step out of place. Smooth as glass crystalline as  diamonds they dance through this movie together. The direction is...  flawless.  The story line will keep you glued to the screen the insouciant charm  will keep you entertained. The music and soundtrack are not ever  intrusive but subtle and softly gorgeous. Reminds me a bit of  Tombraider. Musical passages that must be provided by the London  Philharmonic. No? Yes I would just imagine so.  It's been a VERY long time since I had to restart the movie a second  time immediately after the first watch just to see the little twists  and turns and superb acting.  Rented this from Netflix... but will buy just to listen to over and  over again.  In a word insouciant. And a delight to remember. Perfectly cast  although it would also have been interesting to see Brad Pitt play the  staring male lead in perhaps another version.  What a dilemma... can a girl marry both Brad and Johnny in their  dreams? If there was any flaw in this movie it would be that the few  subtitles were the wrong font and the wrong color...    And perhaps the Venetian canal waters were just a tad too blue  clear and clean.  Luv to All!".

	schema:headline " Johnny  Angie  some good old fashioned star power";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes with the vast amount of special effects extravaganzas monsters movies and super hero vehicles going around you can't help but get a bit bored with them after a while. They have a numbing effect the brain and they can get very tedious. As viewers we need a break occasionally. That's why it's always nice just to sit back relax and watch a straightforward story where good actors do what they're trained for act. Without a CG creature in sight And that's exactly what we get here two good actors having a great time with a slight though still extremely entertaining and watchable story.Johnny plays a lonely guy called Frank who while on holiday in Europe is approached on a train by a mysterious and beautiful woman called Elise Angie  who else. Little does he know however he's actually being used by her as a decoy to shift police attention from her lover  a financial 'whizzkid' who ripped off a scummy criminal and now owes the British government over 700 million euros in taxable funds. In a case of mistaken identity the angry criminals assume Frank to be her thieving lover and he ends up being plunged into a whole web of intrigue pursued by both the cops and the robbers. At the same time he's trying to battle his own increasing infatuation with the enigmatic Elise who keeps ditching him at every turn but who  in the grand tradition of romps such as this  keeps ending up being thrown into dire situations with him despite her best efforts. This is a rather sophisticated and oldfashioned movie and its all the better for it. It would be easy to imagine this being made in 60s with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn starring in the lead roles. As Frank Johnny Depp  who really does look about ten years younger than his actual age  once again shows us why he's one of the best out there. It's easy to imagine George Clooney  surely the aforementioned Grant's heir  playing this role but Depp is more effective and brings a more earthy quality able to play both plain and debonair at the drop of a hat. Similarly Angelina Jolie is convincing as the conflicted mystery woman Elise and puts in a nice understated performance while at the same time never looking better. The chemistry between them flows off the screen. In fact the interplay between them for the first 40 minutes is absolutely brilliant. You know something is good when simply the sight of two people conversing is keeping you entertained.It's a jet setter of a story mixing a bit of James Bond with a dozen mistaken identity movies. It's lightly Hitchcockian but in a good way though it probably wouldn't have been as effective had it had been set completely in the United States. As with the Bourne movies the European locales prevent it from being just another runofthemill thriller while adding something romantic and unique to it. The photography is gorgeous and the film itself ends up being a good advert for European tourism as all the locations come off looking magnificent. The story moves along fast and there's plenty of engaging action sequences the stand out being one involving boats. The supporting cast is good though Paul Bettany has a somewhat thankless role that requires him to do little more than be grumpy while at the same time barking down a microphone at every available occasion. But it is good to see Timothy Dalton the best Bond bar none in an acting role again. Even if it only ranks as an extended cameo he dominates the screen whenever he's on. Somewhat appropriately he's even in the position his boss 'M' was in his own Bond movies  a guy who sits behind a desk handing out the missions and giving all the orders rather than taking them. It's almost like James Bond has been promoted to top dog! There's also another Bond connection are all these intentional? in another supporting player Steven Berkoff who played a slimy Russian general in 1983's Octopussy. Here he plays a similarly depraved and ruthless criminal who's actually British but surrounds himself with a pack of Russian heavies. He also has the most sadistic scene in a movie that can't really be classed as being overly violent.Even if it's not the kind of dark Euro thriller you might be expecting this is still a very entertaining movie that will keep you hooked all the way. It's got everything action suspense comedy and romance. And even if that's not enough for you certainly the interplay between Depp and Jolie will be. They're really effective in this and display the kind of chemistry we haven't seen since the heyday of the movies the most recent example probably being Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. Based on this hopefully they'll work together again sometime in the near future. Yes it's all very oldfashioned stuff and you will feel like you're caught in a time warp to the 60s. It's also a bit lightweight and fluffy but you know what? When you have a cast this good just go with it. I enjoyed very minute of it. And if you give it a chance you will too.".

Kind or like the 1963 hit Charade except this movie is much more low key. Cary Grant would have been ideal in Johnny Depp's role.Despite mostly dialogdriven Angelina Jolie and Depp have starpower faces that will have you involved as does the great European scenery and photography which is first rate on a BluRay.All in all a pretty good subtle film and worth a rental.".

It is first of all a remake of the eternal Arsne Lupin or Rouletabille to remain French or simpler Robin Hood to turn English or William Wallace to lean towards Scotland. And definitely I am fascinated by these thieves who steal the money of the very rich for their own sake with a few crumbs to the poorest. And here the very rich are Russian making fortunes in casinos and brothels so it is just right to steal billions of decent currencies from them though it is bad to forget paying one's income tax to the British Treasury.The film is simple but effective. We kind of know from the very start who Alexander Pierce may be but that's not important at all because what is essential is how that thief who nicely put several billions of some good currencies in his pocket directly from the coffers of a Russian Mafioso will evade the police and escape from the real Russian gangsters.There is no depth in all that but there is a lot of fun and action. It is also so realistically critical of the world's polices that it turns funny somewhere. The English police are only interested in recuperating the income tax that was not paid. The French police are whipping other cats as they say in French and looking the other way. The Italian police are only attracted by the profit they can make out of selling their prisoners to the highest bidder. Only Interpol or a couple of Interpol agents are honest though some might already be too high a count. Only one in fact and as long as the game is funny and paid for by his authorities.The most difficult part is to convince the girlfriend that she is just doing what she has to do according to the letters he has delivered to her regularly when there is a bend or turn along the way. Ha has spent one million dollars having his own face restructured somewhere in Brazil or Latin America and she does not know what he looks like any more. She is an Interpol agent and he can count on her being able to resist anything including violence and her being very creative in her actions. And she does not disappoint us and probably not our Alexander Pierce.While she is going from one station to the next according to his instructions he is getting close to her and observing her and getting the protection she can get from Interpol who are protecting and following her just like a pack of dogs would follow the smell of a fox. In fact the scent is that of a vixen in this case since Interpol or the Russian gangster do not know the scent of the fox since he has spent a fortune to change his physical parameters.And everyone will be happy. The Russian Mafiosi will be all dead as dead as a bunch of door nails though not enough nails to nail down their coffins. The British cops will recuperate the 744 million pounds of overdue tax money they wanted to get out of the business. The beautiful Elise will be reunited to her mysterious Alexander Pierce. Alexander Pierce will be able to sail away with no one on his tracks any more.That's a pure action film done in the best immoral tradition of the morality one can find in robbing the rich. It is their fault any way. They would not be robbed if they were not rich. Let them give everything away and follow Jesus on his way to Capharnam or Jerusalem. Unluckily today's rich people are not like the tax collector Matthew. They don't believe in giving their money away and they prefer losing their lives rather than not retaliating against some one who borrowed a few billions from their coffers with the intention of not bringing them back.

	schema:reviewBody "The critics are completely off base with their treatment of The Tourist.Was this trying to be an Oscar contender? Absolutely not. So why was it reviewed like it was? I thought Johnny and Angelina were perfectly fine and even charming in their roles. I didn't find the film to drag at all and actually thought it was an entertaining and engrossing story that moved along at a good pace. Jolie is the most stunningly beautiful actress of this era and her beauty is even more magnified with the Venice backdrop. Yes if I had it my way based on my personal tastes I would have preferred a more serious thriller in the vein of Taken. Because of the tone of the movie I was never really concerned for the welfare of the characters. But it was the film makers' decision to make this lighter fare and it still worked on that level. I thought the subtle comedy in here was actually quite funny and sarcastic in a way and so did the other people in the audience. I know a lot of people complained about the predictable twist at the end but I can't comment on that as a couple of the reviews I read prior to seeing this pretty much gave that away. I will say though that I was more surprised with the twist concerning Elise Jolie's character. My only real complaint is the score I thought it got in the way at times and was a little too sappy fairy tale if you can understand that. Overall I think this was a fun harmless throwback crime caper and really a bit of a modern spoof on the genre. I loved the cheeky line at the end was that a wink at Depp's less than perfect looks in this movie? B".

I was so amazingly shocked with Venice in this movie that I immediately put Venice landscape as my desktop wallpaper. The acting by Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp is not so good and the movie has some scenes that you don't know if they are meant to be funny or are just plain bad.

Russell's technique of turning his camera sideways as Ursula and Rupert Alan Bates run nude through the fields has been dismissed by some but it is quite effective in creating the unreal state in which their romance seems to find them one quite different from the hardness and madness that surrounds them.  This too is achieved to stunning effect as the two lovers are seen twisted together in the mud in the same position that two deceased lovers had been found only hours before.  The colors surrounding these two are always bright and warm in stark contrast to the way the other pair of lovers Gudrun and Gerald Oliver Reed are photographed.Gudrun and Gerald's initial sexual encounter is harshly lit and edited emphasizing the brutality of their situation.  Their love is shown to be more of an addiction rather than true love.It would take more than 1000 words to paint an accurate work picture of the films' creative genius and incredible cinematography.  One scene in particular a nude wrestling match between Rupert and Gerald quite defies description and I urge you to see the film and experience it's mastery yourself.".

They are played by Alan Bates Oliver Reed Glenda Jackson and Jennie Linden.Glenda Jackson who was relatively unknown at the time won her first Oscar for a magnificent performance in a most difficult role her Gudrun is not a likable character she is an selfcentered predator but she is honest and very interesting. I read some comments that she was not beautiful. Well she may not have been pretty but I believe there is more than prettiness to make a woman loved and admired otherwise a lot of women in this world would never be able to learn the feeling. Gudrun's intelligence strong character and selfconfidence make her very attractive and desirable. The film has many unforgettable scenes with two that stand alone after all these years. First of them is one of the most provocative and delightful sexual scenes ever filmed. It takes place during a picnic. Alan Bates dressed in a light white suite describes to the others how to eat a fig. He carefully holds it and then pulls it open while he compares the process to a woman and looks teasingly at shy Ursula Gudrun's sister Jennie Linden. This little scene is as powerful as a famous wrestling scene even though everybody who saw the film would recall the wrestling scene as a most memorable in Women in Love.The wrestling in the nude was Lawrence's and Russell's  solution to allow two men to relieve the horror and dreadfulness of the drowning tragedy that occurred shortly before. The scene takes place for long time 510 minutes with the fire from fireplace highlighting Reed's and Bate's bodies as each struggles against the other. The scene is extremely sensual but whether they engaged in sex or not we don't knowThis is a very special film that has not lost its beauty and appeal now even though it was made over 35 years ago. Extraordinarily striking and highly sensual it is a must see for anyone truly interested in film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Erotica rarely gets a decent treatment in film and that basically is due to the fact that despite plots that are drenched in the essence of highly sexualized relationships the norm is to have actors whose visual appeal is excessive but their acting skills a nonexistent concept. Adding to insult the norm seems to have a director whose sole interest is to pan and scan  slowly of course the perfect voyeur  over the glowing skin of perfectly toned bodies writhing around each other like a pretzel making love to itself and occasionally hint at some personal conflict that finds its necessary resolution in yet another dramatic sex scene. I wonder if there is today such a thing as intelligent erotica  not that I'm against the sex per se that's rather dandy with me  but it would be great to imbue the embellished engorged incursions into intimate debauchery with some notion of innerouter turmoil. Anais Nin at least knew what she was doing when she wrote her masterpiece A Spy in the House of Love. She also wrote a dissertation on the author of what became the film WOMEN IN LOVE. Hers was at the time rather revolutionary since women weren't at the forefront of literature and much less erotica but Nin wasn't the ordinary creature. She was first and foremost a keen observer of a person's place in the world fragmented in time and space here and there and the eroticism implicit within her stories even the more frank ones which she wrote for a dollar in order to survive. There was a powerful poetry already palpable and rarely have I read anyone like her. Now as for the writer whom she admired and defended his work is also quite arresting even when then it was considered too controversial  which by default makes it horribly dated. D.H. Lawrence's Women in Love is a sequel to The Rainbow which also would see a transition into film form later with Glenda Jackson playing her character's mother and it is in a nutshell an erotic quadrangle between two men Oliver Reed and Alan Bates the first a man who represents old money the latter a man who is a part of the new society and two free spirited women Jackson and Jenny Linden.A story that meanders around how these people meet get involved with each other and eventually get tangled in their emotional conflicts which come to a head in the Alps Ken Russell's WOMEN IN LOVE is a visually arresting tour de force of beauty and sensuality. The nowfamous sequence involving a nude wrestling match between Reed and Bates is a sight to behold and anyone with a minimal level of understanding can figure out what is really taking place between them this is made even more erotic due to the extraordinary similarities between both actors who even comb their hair in the same fashion. Bates is the perfect feminine counterpart to Reed's tormented masculine self the man who's there for the asking but who cannot see this desire for Reed come to a fulfilling thing. The two women fare equally well Glenda Jackson being the more masculine of the two  closer in essence to Katharine Hepburn even in her choice of words and mannerisms  and Linden almost thankless in her ethereal beauty. That Jackson winds up in the arms of Reed and Linden in Bates is a part of what makes them tick Jackson is a stronger presence than Bates and therefore can withstand Reed's incursions into Heathclifflike behavior while Linden and Bates make what can be only considered the perfect couple. All in all this is a stunning movie a work of art that breathes and an allegory of the battle of the sexes that would see itself become more pronounced as people became less tied to conventions. Haunting even in some of the quieter moments  such as when Bates walks out naked and lets himself feel the garden in a very powerful journey of selfdiscovery it's one of those that can make anyone view it again and again and see its own petals reveal new colors for the first time.".

Minutes later they are watching a wedding party arrive at the village church. One presumes that the sisters would be starryeyed and agog at the wealthy and their high fashions.But these two are much much more than a couple of envious groupies. They are quickly drawn into the circle of the groom's brother Oliver Reed and Oliver's best friend Alan Bates. Gudren and Ursula are two young women as only Lawrence could fashion them Gudren wastes no time departing from her teacherfather's somber lifestyle for the riches offered by Oliver Reed. And Ursula by default follows in her wake.Gudren played by the strongest female actress at the time Glenda Jackson is like a praying mantis a predator. Her head is held high and her eyes are bright and her brain latent predacious. She quickly challenges and competes with the young man whose father owns coal mines. We watch their relationship develop. While he is quizzical and uncertain of her yet strong and resentful in the way that moneyed youth are strong and resentful she is a giantess in her brilliance  an arch ego of Lawrence. She digs she routs she emasculates  and she stands by to watch the young collier die eventually. Whereas Ursula is sweet golden blond and willing to accept traditional love.There are several scenes that are indelible the drowning scene of the quintessentially beautiful bride the sheer horror when her young husband's laughter changes from amusement to realize that she has submerged  the gurgling as he chokes on water in his hysteria pleading for help and sinks. The only thing to approach it is in Jaws when the swimmer is bitten in half by the shark before the viewer quite realizes what is happening.The other scene was the unexpected eroticism immediately following the drowning after the lake has been drained when the two young men disrobe and wrestle. It was magnificently evocative telling us of Lawrence's freedom to engage his two heroes in something so intimate  a solution to allow the men to relieve the dreadfulness of the tragedy. Whether they engaged in sex or not is almost incidental. The fireplace highlighting their masculine prowess as each struggles against the other was not only beautiful but orgasmically satisfying. The only way Reed can find consolation is to engage in this loverepulsion with his best friend whom he loves.Yet another scene is when Hermione dashes Alan Bates with a paper weight and he rushes from the great hall blood streaming down his face and smearing his ivory trousers as he sheds his suit. It was the rush of Hermione's unexpected hatred when only a moment earlier her selfindulgent Grecian dance had deteriorated into a scene out of The Great Gatsby.The final scene of wonder was of course poor Olive Reed's death and he died because Gudren that inquisitive challenging harridan had left him for a glamorous decadent German in a Zermat skilodge. This physically strong man curled up in the snow and the next morning was found hoary and frozen.Overall this movie offers a magical entree into Lawrence's senses. It is rich quixotic  of the Twenties. I still can't say if the dialogue makes the greatest sense or if the characters are simply talking psychobabble and cant. There is lushness throughout one small example being when at luncheon al fresco Bates delicately quarters a fig pulls it open and compares it to a vulva deliberately taunting the shy Ursula. And like DebussyStravinsky Lawrence moves the viewer out of the traditional England into the cacophonous new world of sensuality and reality.".

But it is also important to pay attention to its focus on England's class system. In my opinion probably the most effective scene is during the opening credits as Gudrun Glenda Jackson and Ursula Brangwen Jennie Lind  both dressed in fancy aristocratic clothes  walk through an economically depressed neighborhood barely if at all moved by the poverty surrounding them. Of course it's hard not to remember Rupert Birkin Alan Bates and Gerald Crich Oliver Reed fighting each other. That scene probably goes to show the falsity of the rich English lifestyle they act like these refined individuals but the whole time they're ready to explode. Back when D.H. Lawrence wrote the novel he probably never guessed that the movie would look like this.All in all this is certainly one that I recommend. I often say that the period from about 1967 to 1973 saw some of the greatest movies released and this backs that up. Also starring Eleanor Bron the woman in Help! and Michael Gough Alfred in the Batman movies from 1989 to 1997.I've never heard of people cutting open figs and eating only the inside.

	schema:reviewBody "D.H.Lawrence and Ken Russell. A potential train wreck. This film works and is the closest rendition I have ever seen that reflects and adapts a novel so well and accurately to the screen. D.H. Lawrence was a master writer and to have a director like Ken Russell depict it so beautifully was heavenly to watch. If people could only let themselves go and get rid of their hangups they might enjoy and understand this film. The novel however is the prize. Only a handful of scenes are taken from the book for this movie as so much of it is left out of the film. But what is portrayed is accurate and beautiful to watch. Oliver Reed is miscast as Gerald the heir to a lucrative coal mining operation in the Midlands of England where D.H. Lawrence grew up. However his rugged appeal and animalism on screen was perfectly portrayed and only an actor of the stature of Oliver Reed could have brought it off. Bates and Reed together exude magnetism and are thrilling to watch. Their wrestling match in the glow of the warm fire gives a sense of life and relaxation following a cold death scene. A crude display of homosexual behaviour is not what this is about. It is about life itself in all its raw and powerful conflict and struggle. Birkin played by Alan Bates is supposed to be a selfportrait of Lawrence and he does an admirable job as the brooding man who is on a life quest for romantic fulfillment. This is a wonderful movie that should be shown to all literary students at the University level. I doubt there are enough good teachers out there who would know what they were teaching but perhaps Lawrence's novel Women in Love would help to disseminate the truth of what Lawrence was trying to say. I highly recommend this film to all who believe that raw sensual power in life is attainable for all who dare let themselves go 100 into a relationship without any drawbacks doubts or hangups to hold them back  to indulge fully the carnal and spiritual fusion that is a worthy endeavour to be attained at all costs lest we just live out our lives with no purpose few memorable experiences and little zest for life. To live life fully and healthy with love as the focus  this is the goal for Lawrence. The issues of death and male friendship are also fully explored along with the two love relationships  one that is destructive in a fierce competitive clash in a battle of the wills that corrodes the relationship towards a spiritual ruination represented by Gerald freezing to death in the snow in the solar plexus of the world  the Alps in Europe  and the other that works towards success which is highlighted by a loving and sensual regard for the other while allowing each other to grow in love. Get this film! Own it and Love it! Till Death do you Part!".

Oliver Reed is miscast as Gerald the heir to a lucrative coal mining operation in the Midlands of England where D.H. Lawrence grew up. However his rugged appeal and animalism on screen was perfectly portrayed and only an actor of the stature of Oliver Reed could have brought it off. Bates and Reed together exude magnetism and are thrilling to watch. Their wrestling match in the glow of the warm fire gives a sense of life and relaxation following a cold death scene. A crude display of homosexual behaviour is not what this is about. It is about life itself in all its raw and powerful conflict and struggle. Birkin played by Alan Bates is supposed to be a selfportrait of Lawrence and he does an admirable job as the brooding man who is on a life quest for romantic fulfillment. This is a wonderful movie that should be shown to all literary students at the University level. I doubt there are enough good teachers out there who would know what they were teaching but perhaps Lawrence's novel Women in Love would help to disseminate the truth of what Lawrence was trying to say. I highly recommend this film to all who believe that raw sensual power in life is attainable for all who dare let themselves go 100 into a relationship without any drawbacks doubts or hangups to hold them back  to indulge fully the carnal and spiritual fusion that is a worthy endeavour to be attained at all costs lest we just live out our lives with no purpose few memorable experiences and little zest for life. To live life fully and healthy with love as the focus  this is the goal for Lawrence. The issues of death and male friendship are also fully explored along with the two love relationships  one that is destructive in a fierce competitive clash in a battle of the wills that corrodes the relationship towards a spiritual ruination represented by Gerald freezing to death in the snow in the solar plexus of the world  the Alps in Europe  and the other that works towards success which is highlighted by a loving and sensual regard for the other while allowing each other to grow in love. Get this film! Own it and Love it! Till Death do you Part!";

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been attracted to this movie. It came out where young people were exploring more freedom in sexuality and sexual expression. A particularly memorable scene involves Alan Bates describing the correct way to eat a fig. There is never been a more sensual description of a vagina in bloom than Bate's fig description at least on film. Ken Russell does a wonderful job in bringing this D.H. Lawrence to life. The movie beautifully and repeatedly contrasts the sensuality to life with the brutality of the industrial revolution in England immediately after WWI when two sisters Gudrun Brangwen Glenda Jackson and Ursula Brangwen Jennie Linden find two very different types of men Alan Bates and Oliver Reed to love. Conventionality also clashes with idealism in this movie too. This is made clear when the two couples decide to vacation in Zermatt. For me one of the most memorable visual shots of the movie occurs when the two couples first arrive in Zermatt and Glenda Jackson holds her arms in the air to greet the Matterhorn Mont Cervin as if her arms were the labia of a vagina opening widely to fully embrace an erect penis. In this shot this is nature representing the joy of human sensuality.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ken Russell always was a unique director with a style unlike any other. He was also a very controversial one with some great films but also ones where his excesses tended to get in the way too muchLisztomania being a primary example. Women in Love is an example of Russell in restrained mode like he showed in his documentaries on Elgar and Delius and as of now I consider it his best. It is a beautifully filmed film and looks striking throughout not opulent but there is a real eye for details and evocativeness here. Russell doesn't allow any of his excesses to get in the way on the most part his directing is very restrained especially compared to Lisztomania and his Strauss biography Dance of the Seven Veils to a lesser extent also The Devils which still managed to be a great film and one of his most fascinating with some slightly overexaggerated moments which actually were in keeping with the writing. Women in Love is exceptionally well written the story is quite stark but because of the complex characters and somanydifferent emotions it is always involving and it certainly kept me glued me to the screen. The nude male wrestling scene is the most talked about scene and for good reason a very daring scene for the time and a fine example of what is so good about the story. The script is talky but incredibly intelligent and thoughtprovoking the detail to characterisation and their emotions is one of Women in Love's high points. Furthermore it is very respectful to the original source materialif condensed and is one of Russell's most coherent films. Because of Russell's restraint in his directing he gives his actors a real leeway to act. The best in the cast are Glenda Jackson and Oliver Reed. Jackson is a revelation in one of her most difficult rolesperhaps even the most difficult role of hers managing to be formidable and heartfelt. After seeing Women in Love I've changed my mind about saying Oliver Reed's best performance was in the Devils he's brilliant there but as of now he has never been better before or since Women in Love. Alan Bates has a commanding screen presence and Jennie Linden while not quite on the same level as the other three is very touching. Overall outstanding and Russell's best film out of an understandably controversial filmography. 1010 Bethany Cox".

Methinks the switching of genders in the title would obviate much of the confusion amongst the audience of this film. Lawrence was not so much a writer as he was an explorer and pioneer in the psychologies of sex the frictional variety that is as he himself puts it. As the Aztecan? guru spiritually sublimates the physical needs of the matron in Plumed Serpent so does the Alan Bates character overtly name his love as in I offered him. Women find one answer in Gudrun's coolcold acceptance of her own polarities even as she trots off to sample Teutonic variations on a theme called love. But I found the Bavarian? exemplar of gayness herein a bit too fey and much too overt for his day surely. All in all a literally beautiful evocation and visualization of times and personae past. Figs anyone?I have just watched this LswrenceKramerRussell movie again and I find myself perforcemoved to bring my personal. subjective reactions up to date belated as it is. Which is to say again that this flick eludes EVERYone onsofar as each of us brings to our individual witnessings our own idiosyncratic baggage of preconceptions and presumptions. The naysayers here the macho types who cannot see themselves as a Gerald haven't a clue and not a hope of ever achieving one. The subtleties AND the truths Lawrence enounced will ever elude them which of course is what they deserve. Gerald's realization that he never really wanted the frictional fruition of his lust for Gudrun before he traipses off to his need for sleep is just one of the profound insights herein. Gudrun's perfervid knowledge of same and HER need for selfvalidation is equally insightful. But it is the closing two scenes that aptly sum up Lawrence's vision and Lawrence's perceptions 1 The author's fictional personification who tearfully pronounces He should have loved me. I offered him. 2 The closing dialog between man and wife thatruefully evinces the gulf between normality and perversion. Alan Bates was a revelation in Georgy Girl and his performance here is no less full and professional AND persuasive. Lawrence was much less physiczl forget healthy but Bates captures the essence of the author's spirituality. Some find Reed hammy and onedimensional but his performance here is deeper than that. Finally I believe that in its own inimitable way this conjunction of author fan and cineaste is nonpareil likr the MerchantIvory Maurice or today's Brokeback Mountain. That Glenda Jackson looks like Tony Curtis in drag is amusing of course and that macho types can't abide the slow pace of superficial crawlings must be expected as in get on with it. They will NEVER perceive much less understand just exactly WHAT is that is ongoing. Love and lust and fruition and loss are herein embodied in the ripemess of a mere fig as in figment or figurative.".

Lawrence's novels Women In Love is Ken Russell's greatest film namely because of its powerful and complex thematic nature and the fact that unlike most of his films this one does not suffer from excess and from abstract and bizarre fantasy sequences. Alan Bates was a big name in British cinema in the late 60's and 70's and the type of actor who felt at home doing American film like Roger Moore. Here he plays Rupert Birkin an attractive upperclass and athletic British gentleman from the country. Oliver Reed another successful British actor plays his rival Gerald Crich. In a nutshell the two men set the women's desires aflame and all kinds of trouble ensue. D.H. Lawrence's novels were radically modern for their time and stressed sexual freedom for women and generally strayed from conventional Victorian literature. Ken Russell's adaptation is close to perfection and does not damage the heart of the novel's themes of sexual repression desire and heterosexual as well as homosexual relationships. Even though the film is long and has the dominant feel of a period piece it's quite clear Russell was comparing those times to the current year of 1969 which saw the sexual revolution kick in the birth control pill was in the market gays were coming out of the closet and feminism was strong. Glenda Jackson was a rising British star. Not physically attractive by some standards she was a powerful actress who committed herself to becoming the characters she portrayed from modern women to Queen Elizabeth I of England in the BBC series Elizabeth R 1971 Mahler's wife in Ken Russell's Mahler 1975 and other films that display her versatility as an actress. Here she portrays the passionate Gudrun Brangwen who while outwardly showing her blue blood and aristocratic gentle manners burns with desire and is in reality an independent and exciting woman. Jennie Linden as her sister Ursula is also delivering a fine performance a character who is also swept away with the wildness of the country and the passion spell cast by the bold suitors. The intense love scenes though tame by today's standards were very graphic for the British big screen at the time which saw no nudity and not much more than couples kissing. The scene between Alan Bates and Glenda Jackson in the picnic when they give in to temptation is especially striking. Many still remember the infamous mud wrestling scene and the implied homoeroticism between Bates and Reed as they wrestle and become very physical with each other on the floor. But all these sexual and sensual scenes are far from one another in film time so that it's very evident Russell did not intend to shock or make the film strictly about sexual relationships. Instead it's about the men and women and their psychology even if it's applied to sexuality in this case. The couples behave in a way that is more 60's than Edwardian Era. Their spirit is free and not bogged down by formalities or fastidious etiquette. Instead they embrace their darkness and their wildness as human beings. Furthermore they openly dislike mainstream society. Philosophical sensual psychological this is the kind of film Russell is most known for. But this one is far more easy to watch than some of his more abstract and crazy movies Liztomania and the scary and controversial The Devils. With lovely music by Georges Delerue and cinematography by Billy Williams Women In Love captures the essence of D.H. Lawrence's novel and pays tribute to him while still being a quintessential Ken Russell movie.".

The scene between Alan Bates and Glenda Jackson in the picnic when they give in to temptation is especially striking. Many still remember the infamous mud wrestling scene and the implied homoeroticism between Bates and Reed as they wrestle and become very physical with each other on the floor. But all these sexual and sensual scenes are far from one another in film time so that it's very evident Russell did not intend to shock or make the film strictly about sexual relationships. Instead it's about the men and women and their psychology even if it's applied to sexuality in this case. The couples behave in a way that is more 60's than Edwardian Era. Their spirit is free and not bogged down by formalities or fastidious etiquette. Instead they embrace their darkness and their wildness as human beings. Furthermore they openly dislike mainstream society. Philosophical sensual psychological this is the kind of film Russell is most known for. But this one is far more easy to watch than some of his more abstract and crazy movies Liztomania and the scary and controversial The Devils. With lovely music by Georges Delerue and cinematography by Billy Williams Women In Love captures the essence of D.H. Lawrence's novel and pays tribute to him while still being a quintessential Ken Russell movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Well you might not actually SEE any women in love in this movie but you'll certainly hear women TALKING about love and men talking about love and women talking about men and men talking about women and men talking about men and everyone talking about death and talking and talking until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all like paint your bedroom or water your plants.Welcome to the world of D.H. Lawrence where psychobabble reigns supreme and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are. Spending time with the characters in a D.H. Lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most selfabsorbed acquaintances who you would run away from if you met them at a party. When I read Women in Love I so desperately wanted to strangle every single character in it but since I couldn't I was hoping they would at least strangle each other. Alas only one of them dies not by strangulation and I won't spoil it for you by telling which one in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these people.To give director Ken Russell his due he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as it's possible to make this essentially unfilmable novel. He throws out much of the psychological mumbojumbo that Lawrence adored and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts so we get lots of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields two buck naked men wrestling by firelight and one embarrassing scene featuring Alan Bates yup buck naked again roaming around in a meadow making love to bushes and grass I'm not kidding. Glenda Jackson won an Oscar for her performance as Gudrun the more dominant of the two sisters at the story's focus and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material anyone would deserve an Oscar simply for having to bear Russell's decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystifiedlooking cattle. Oliver Reed has one expression an intense glower. The whole thing is overwritten and overdirected and it's deliriously campy. Indeed this vies with Mommie Dearest as perhaps the most unintentionally hysterical movie I've ever seen.Grade D".

Though I'm not familiar with his inring persona at all I thought he was very comfortable in his role and could easily have handled more. Perhaps a more serious movie will be in his future. Jamie Kennedy was fine though not memorable while Jennifer Esposito and Alicia Witt were essentially wasted in small roles. Pruitt Taylor Vince and Philip Baker Hall were excellent in their limited screen time and Jessica Walter did not disappoint though her character was a bit campier than I was hoping for. Her fans should especially enjoy the scene where no fewer than nine pictures of Walter herself adorn the background. Hall and Walter were perfectly cast and it seems like a film based around the Gold family could be quite a treat  either as a comedy or a family drama.The biggest problem is that while there are some great funny moments Bending the Rules is not really funny enough to be a comedy  yet it's too absurd at times for a drama and I was torn between wanting more laughs and wishing it was a serious film. The assembled cast is certainly capable of either and deserved better. I'm giving the film an 8 out of 10 not because it's a stellar film but simply because it's a fun film that doesn't drag and it exceeded my expectations. Some of the film's weakest moments are in the trailer and if the firstday turnout in Memphis is any indication too many people have written it off based on that alone. That's unfortunate because the film deserves a better fate. Those shut out by the limited release only have to wait a few weeks for the DVD which I hope will fare better than the theatrical release.".

	schema:reviewBody "First i'll admit that i am a fan of Edge. From tag team champion to WWE Champion. This is a first that i haven't seen him in a leading role. His character of Nick Blades is like a blend of Axel Foley Beverly Hills Cop Dirty Harry and Martin Riggs Lethal weapon. He had some good one liners and his mannerisms were just outrageous. Jamie Kennedy is still just as funny. The story wasn't great nor bad but in between. I kinda got lost and confused near the climax but then i understood what was happening. This is one wickedly funny movie. I highly recommend it for any comedy lover. I my honest opinion i think Edge should have his own sketch comedy. He's truly a natural and i've seen some comedic relief in him back when he was still competing in the ring. the days of his feud with Chris Jericho up to his retirement. Overall this gets an 8 out of 10.".

There's nothing in this movie that shouldn't have played out exactly the way it did.I've heard lots of arguments about how it wasn't quite a drama but it wasn't quite a comedy. Its not so hard to imagine that when a movie tries to play both parts equally we end up with a watered down version of each genre. Typically you either have a drama with a few comic scenes or a comedy with a few dramatic scenes. This film splits it right in half whether it upsets the viewer or not.That said i think that this was well executed. A buddy movie about two characters doing what they do best despite the scorn of family associates and management. What is received is an odd couple match up with their own problems that make them human as well as a understanding of the idea that they have their hearts in similar places albeit different circumstances.If you want cream of the crop find another flick. Otherwise watch this and enjoy it for whatever it can do. Movies are made for a reason not always the one a viewer wants. This movie probably hardly makes my top 500. But watching it from an unbiased viewpoint i enjoyed it twice for what it was trying to portray.".

The saving grace might be those goofy comical scenes with Edge and Jamie albeit many of them were so numby. The mystery did draw our attention at regular intervals which were all hindered by those inane stumbling sub plots which i found rather irritating.I admit it was a treat to watch Edge with a character persona which really suited him the stylish mannerisms the walk and the funny oneliners which were all helped by some good background score duhhh but all goes haywire right from the word go.

It's one of those things where I know him as a heel bad guy in the ring but in the movie he has the nicest persona and I love to see the range in people who I only know one side of. He's no Rock but he's good enough to carry a small movie that needs that spark. Plus it's hilarious hearing that deep Canadian accent coming out of a guy whose suppose to be playing a New Orleans cop.Jamie Kennedy is definitely the weaker link of the somewhat buddy cop movie thing going on here. Kennedy plays a district attorney trying to put the Edge's character in jail for being a bad cop. Then they end up having to team up to find a car that leads to a bigger crime. Kennedy is the jerk in the relationship and he plays it too well. Even thought he's at a bad point in his life with his wife leaving him and not getting the promotion he wants and all his colleagues hating him for not being able to bend the rules but I never fully feel sorry for Kennedy. He never really shows his redeemable qualities. He starts a jerk and ends still being a jerk. May not be all his fault as that is what the character is suppose to be but it does put a little more work on The Edge to be likable.It's a good story about the Edge doing detective work going around trying to solve a crime and interacting with interesting characters in New Orleans and it's a good movie for that. Kennedy does not hurt the movie but does not help it either.Very fun to watch and after watching hearing what I herd I give it a 6 but it maybe a 5.httpcinemagardens.com".

Whereas Copeland's character is instantly likable Kennedy's character is annoying sanctimonious inflexible neurotic and instantly unlikeable. Many of the supporting roles are robust multidimensional and well performed. Unlike many lowbudget productions the movie is refreshingly free of annoying and distracting jiggly cam shots. It is easy to point out faults. The script relies on a lot of coincidences and leaves several loose ends untied. For a WWE production there aren't many fight scenes and the fight choreography isn't particularly imaginative. One scene in which Copeland faces off against a couple of dozen opponents is particularly disappointing. It doesn't really have a car chase and there are no explosions. The one big gunfight is staged at night and it's not clear who is who and it's not up to current standards.

Jamie Kennedy's role would have been done way much better if it had gone to John Getz 20 years back or Jon Lovitz. But nevertheless Jamie did a nice job. Adam Edge Copeland went through the film as if he had long tenure of previous experiences and i was surprised to find this is one of his first movies in leading role. Liked him very much in this role hoping for more. This movie reminds me of late 80's and early 90's cop movies such as hard way. Jennifer Esposito and Elena Lyons looked hot. Kevin Weisman Philip Baker Hall and Jessica Walter did a nice job and will remain in my mind for at least a year. I am definitely going to recommend this to my friends.".

You don't find any action sensation in it for it has so few action part which was not good at all. You also can't feel the drama because it didn't draw you to one. You may laugh for some part in this movie but not good enough just okay. Every part of this movie was made nearly half of being good. It's like climbing a mountain but stop just in the middle and then go back. We don't even have the chance to reach the top.Dwayne Johnson Terry Gene and John Cena are several wrestler that I know also played in movies too. They played not bad at all especially Dwayne and I think Edge too. He maybe not acted so well but he still made his part okay. If you ever saw him wrestle then you will notice that he surely can hide his character in the ring and show up in different character in this movie. Jamie played in many comedy movies or absurd character. He shows his experience in this movie and I think it's too bad that the story is so poor.Such a poor ending also ruined the whole movie. The only good part of this movie is the relationship of Theo and his father. Not that well but at least gave a glimpse of color in this plain movie.".

But I guess his role is not really supposed to be funny though his role is meant to be the punchline of the joke. Jamie plays a lawyer who's trying to nail a cop that likes to bend the rules and by doing that he get harassed and bullied by the whole police department almost on a organised level. And that is supposed to be funny but really really isn't big surprise. That's not all that it's about though of course but the rest of the plot is so riddled with plot holes and other nonsense that it would be hard to even describe it. It's a WWE movie so of course it stars a wrestler in the lead as the bad cop Jamie Kennedy's character is trying to nail he's played by someone called Edge he's not the worst wrestler to attempt at acting but he's miles away from being The Rock and I mean comparing him to actual actors he's pretty crap. Jennifer Esposito is just wasted talent in this one as well.If you like your comedies humour free with plots that doesn't make sense and with a New Orleans bluesrock soundtrack then you might want to give it a go.

They are tailor made action stars who even do their own stunts. That's why I was looking forward to Bending The Rules It's star Edge is one of the most charismatic superstars in WWE history and he certainly didn't disappoint unlike the script. The story follows a by the book District Attorney who turns to an unconventional cop to help him when his late father's prized possession is stolen. In order to score points with the man who is out to get him the officer agrees having no idea the case would take him into something much bigger. As I said Edge was great the stunts were terrific he was funny and had great chemistry with Jamie Kennedy. This comedic duo could have made a great film together if they didn't get stuck with a script that made little sense and was all over the place. This film randomly jumps between scenes without any context and without completing the scene before it A lot of it just doesn't make sense. The whole premise is a bit ridiculous to begin with a D.A. turning to the cop he's trying to bust to help him get back a stolen car which leads to an international conspiracy involving the police the D.A. the FBI gangsters drug dealers gangbangers and everyone else they could throw in there. Honestly I continued to watch this film for it's humor and it's exemplary choreographed action sequences beyond that Bending The Rules is a pretty forgettable film.".

It's really not difficult to imagine since a pro wrestler is simply acting a role for the most part. So he seems to carry a confidence that most newcomers don't have. His contrast with Jamie Kennedy is really good and there seems to be a good chemistry and blend to make the characters interesting.

You pick up things you missed the first time and it's like watching a new movie. Some people have very analytical minds and can quickly pick this one apart in no time so the details are part of the puzzle. In any event there is enough action and comedy mixed with drama and suspense it makes for a pretty decent movie overall.Plus... Any movie set in New Orleans is going to be interesting.

Peggy Cummins is his love interest the open minded schoolteacher whose uncle may have been a victim of the Demon.  Niall McGinnis is disturbingly likable as the head of the Demon Cult chucking aside a chance to play Aleister Crowley and opting for Benny Hill instead.  He is very disarming as the films central villain and Andrews confusion mirrors our own as the movie stalks relentlessly through a seance a stormy Halloween party and a frightening hypnosis session to its surprisingly violent conclusion.This movie is by turns sarcastically funny suffocatingly tense and shockingly scary.  The demon looks a little corny nowadays and was revealed much too quickly with no suspenseful buildup but the movie is so smart so moody so creepy and well done with an excellent cast to boot that one can easily forgive the demon which looks a lot like a slightly deformed bear with a pig nose and goat horns.  This is an excellent adaption of the short story Casting the Runes by M. R. James and still has the power to scare even 50 years later.  Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Filmed in England this 1958 film was originally released with a running time of 95 minutes under the title NIGHT OF THE DEMON when it reached the United States it had a running time of 83 minutes and the title CURSE OF THE DEMON. Both versions are contained on this DVD with the English version the better for those twelve minutes but in truth there is little significant difference between the two and if you are a connoisseur of 1950s horror films you will find both equally fascinating.Based on the short story Casting the Runes by M.R. James DEMON offers the tale of American psychologist John Holden Dana Andrews who travels to a conference in England planning to debunk a devil worshiping cult led by Karswell Niall MacGinnis. Unfortunately for the professionally skeptical Holden Karswell's powers are genuine he has successfully translated an ancient text and through runes written on parchment casts a curse first against Holden's colleague and then against Holden himself.DEMON was directed by Jacques Tourneur who worked with producer Val Lewton to create a series of memorable and distinctly noirish horror films at RKO in the 1940s CAT PEOPLE I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE and THE LEOPARD MAN. All three films created a sense of unease and screamaloud fear by implication and suggestion and although DEMON is much more explicit in its effects Tourneur brings the same sensibility to bear on DEMON endowing it with remarkable authority and power in spite of several distinct flaws.Chief among these flaws is the script which can best be described as somewhat abrupt in terms of dialog and leading man Dana Andrews whose performance is remarkably unsubtle even in a decade noted for a lack of cinematic restraint. Film lore also has it that Tourneur lobbied against showing the demon on screen and given the fact that the visual is hardly inspired this clearly would have been the better choice. None the less DEMON has jolts and jars aplenty not the least of which is Karswell Niall MacGinnis' performance with its mixture of the commonplace and the flatly evil is remarkably fine. The film also sports a host of memorable set pieces the storm the flying parchment Dr. Holden's exploration of Karswell's mansion Dr. Holden's run through the night forest and the final train sequence to name but a few.Although it is not well known today like Tourneur's films with Lewton DEMON has cast a very long shadow in terms of influence and it is very difficult to imagine such films as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE CHANGELING without both this film and those that proceeded it.

So you know what to expect suspense and quality.By now of course technology changed a lot of how films look and it is the show less  scare a lot attitude of Cat People and I Walked With A Zombie that made them into the classics that they are. 'Night of the Demon' a far better title than the American 'Curse of the Demon'  and if you see the film you'll know why has one nasty side effect you see the demon and it's a film demon from the 50s. No matter how scary the film makes the demon he looks like the thing you see on the cover of the movie box. It could be scarier. But now comes the best part... it doesn't matter! Because the suspense comes from something else in the movie and that is what makes this film so great. Dana Andrews is coming to England to prove that a socalled satanic cult is nothing more than a bunch of fakers and illusionists. The cult leader however puts a spell on him and warns Andrews that he will die in a few days. Other 50s film that depend more on the monsters and demons do have that problem e.g. Roger Corman made some movies that could've been a lot better and scarier if the monster had either been more convincing or given less screen time.Like in the other two films by Tourneur I mentioned you always sense something scary could happen. That is what makes films work. In 'Night of the Demon Tourneur' succeeds in scarying you on some occasions when you least expect it. Combine that with cleverly builtup suspense and you know why you should watch this classic. Even if you don't like horror films in general.".

The acting is pretty weak once you get past the two main characters but it's the craftsmanship of the director that really matters.Jacques Tourneur manipulates light and shadow to create fear of the unknown in this tale of modern science colliding with ancient sorcery.

Long dark corridors ..... dancing shadows ..... strange sounds contrasted with eerie silences ..... the impending sense of doom and apprehension.

Scientists try to expose a Devil Cult for being fraudsters.

Those dissenters who carp on endlessly about whether or not the demon should have been included are arguing about the wrong issue which is whether or not Tourner managed to effectively scare his target audience with an essentially psychological beast from the depths of Hell. He easily achieved this without showing the actual demon but it should however be noted that the very last shot of the demon where it is shown for the only time in profile tearing poor Karswell to bits is the only representation of a devil that I have ever seen that sticks rigidly to the earliest known wood cuts of demons. All you oculists out there  check out your old books this film might be more of the real deal than you give it credit for. Remember that in 1957 the British public were still reeling from the witchcraft murders of Lower Quinton and Hagley Wood do your homework on these murders!I honestly believe that this film addresses the subject of Black Magic in a far more sinister fashion than I have seen since. It is the 'Thinking Man's' Exorcist ... Watch it with an open mind !!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Night of the Demon is hands down one of the most superb horroroccult thriller films ever made and that's particularly remarkable because the original concept got pampered with a lot of additional ideas and effects the director didn't agree on. Jacques Tourneur Cat People the Leopard Man initially wanted to put the emphasis purely on the psychological aspects but the moneysuppliers didn't like this and insisted on bringing an actual demonic monster into the movie. It would be enormously interesting to see the nonexisting version like Tourneur imagined it as then you'd constantly be wondering whether the occurring events are realor all just going on inside the characters' heads. This creative and innovating for 1957 at least impact is naturally ruined by explicitly showing the hideous demon early in the film so it's extra praiseworthy that the whole finished product is still extremely suspenseful. The plot revolves on a headstrong and overly rational scientist who travels from the States to England exclusively to prove that the supposed blackly magical powers of a certain Dr. Julian Karswell are all just a swindle. Even the mysterious circumstances surrounding his overseas partner's death as well as multiple warnings from close friends and colleagues can't convince Dr. John Holden to abort his mission to expose Karswell as a fraud. The latter eagerly accepts this challenge and places a curse on Dr. Holden that gradually becomes eerier and pretty much inescapable the curse of the demon! This is a marvelously atmospheric and genuinely unsettling horror masterpiece! The dialogues and acting performances of the entire cast are downright impeccable and the script adapted from a story by M.R. James is so intense  persuasive that you almost begin to believe in the supernatural yourself! Ever encountered a film that has such an impact on you? Night of the Demon is very likely to become the first. Several sequences showing our good Dr. Holden pursued by evil forces are truly haunting while the stylish black  white photography and the beautiful set pieces only increase this effect. You can honestly trust the high IMDbrating and the praising reviews on this one Night of the Demon is one of those rare films that every selfrespecting horror fan simply HAS TO see for himherself.".

My favorite scene When Karswell explains to two nonbelievers the difference between white and black magic at a Halloween party he's thrown for the local kids. To make a point he conjures up a stylish wind stormwhich crashes the party and still fails to convince his intended audience. Be sure to note the similarity between the kids' party here and the one in The Birds.

	schema:headline " I didn't know you had cyclones in England Karswell ............ We don't";
	schema:reviewBody "Rarely has the UK produced a film of such enduring quality as Night of the Demon  Its a post war classic.People have often tried to connect the character of Julian Karswell Niall MacGinnis with English Occultist Aleister Crowley the self proclaimed 'Great Beast'18751947. Crowley was around at the same time as M R James' 18621936 who wrote the short story 'Casting the Runes'  upon which the film is based  so there's a chance that there may have been a link. However the character of Karswell in the movie is far less of an arrogant glamour seeker than was Crowley. All Karswell wanted was for he and his followers to be left in peace.Dana Andrews was a good choice to play the character of John Holden  a sceptical American scientist who personified what some would consider to be 'the new establishment' as it was in 1957. Confident unbending and opinionated. Typical of a generation that had just gone through huge advances in science and technology during WW2.Jacques Tourneur directed this film on a shoestring yet he created an uneasy atmosphere of disjointed anxiety throughout. The lighting the music the photography and dialogue all add up to a piece of cinematic grace and mastery. Allow yourself to be completely absorbed in the plot and at the end you'll realise that you're exhausted and your heart is pounding like a steam hammer.I guess this is the bit that might be construed as a spoiler but when you look at the characters objectively you'll perhaps come to realise that Karswell wasn't a deranged madman after all. In fact he was a very likable man  reasonable from start to finish. He tried to talk rationally with both Harrington and Holden but neither man was prepared to listen to his point of view. In the British Library he tried to appeal to Holden's objective scientific mind by inviting him to Lufford Hall to look at a very rare manuscript in an attempt to convince him not to go ahead with his expose of Karswell's group. It was only when Holden showed no sign of movement that the runic parchment was passed thus unleashing the demon. Perhaps Holden deserved it......? The closing sequence of the film sees Karswell being dismembered by a truly traditional demon check out the earliest medieval woodcuts of demons if you disagree. A little unfortunate for those of us that had grown fond of Karswell's character a bit like one grows fond of the character of Hannibal Lecter in 'Silence of the Lambs' or Colonel Kurtz in 'Apocolypse Now'.For some this is quite a disturbing film  perhaps not in the way my 16 year old son would see it but on a psychological plane. Although it reaches a definite conclusion the story isn't over nor could it ever be. Karswell died but the demon from hell could still be called forth by anyone with the wherewithal to do it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Previous posters have rightly commented that this is a fine Alevel thriller on a Blevel budget with generally good acting tight direction great cinematography and a good script taken from a good story. Just a few comments about the two versions of this movie. Night of the Demon is the original version released in U.K. and is 135 minutes long. Reedited and retitled for the American market as Curse of the Demon this version is about 14 minutes shorter. A number of scenes were cut from the original but as far as I can tell no other scenes were added or changed. Luckily for me the DVD had both versions. Thinking that Curse was the original and Night was a sequel I watched Curse and found it greatly entertaining but a bit disconnected and confusing at points. Reading Maltin's review later I learned that I had one movie in two different edits. WATCH THE LONG VERSION IF YOU CAN! The missing scenes go a long way in explaining Karswell's motivation it's not just that he's opened Pandora's box and can't close it  he's motivated as well by the money he makes as a cult leader as well as the peculiar actions of Karswell's mother which don't make much sense without the missing two scenes that explain her motives. Also the missing scenes make Karswell slightly less appealing than in the edited version. All in all a really good movie. P.S. I think the monster was OK.".

Andrews plays a psychiatrist determined to debunk the world of the occult but instead nearly falls victim to a monstrous demon summoned by MacGinnis.  At one point in the film MacGinnis dressed in a clown suit takes on an aura of pure demonic power under Tournier's direction and it's a joy to watch.  The effects including the demon itself are simple but surprisingly effective and serve to highlight rather than overpower the actors and the storyline.  Based on the story Casting the Runes this mostlyforgotten film is a masterpiece of scripting editing acting and direction and shouldn't be missed.

If so it's a shame Tourneur isn't around to put a director's cut on the DVD instead of Curse Of The Demon which is a little redundant being on the same DVD as Night Of The Demon. I found the demon scary when I was 12 years old and would not have enjoyed the film as much without it. Now of course the film would seem better without it. The atmosphere of Tourneur's work that I've seen thisI Walked With A Zombie Out Of The Past and that Twighlight Zone episode one of the best of the elderly lady getting calls from her deceased husband consistently has that great nocturnal shadowy and mysterious quality to it. This body of work alone is enough to make him one of my favorite directors. Even if this isn't one of Dana Andrews best performances his stubborn skepticism is convincing enough to contrast nicely with Carswell's over politeness. As old horror movies go this ranks up there with The original Haunting Eyes Without A Face Black Sunday and early Universals as the best among the old black and whites for me.

Much has been said about the appearance of the Demon at the beginning of the film I can't help but think that it does lend a certain charm and sets the tone of the film quite nicely though. Few films are so atmospheric brooding and dark. There is something eminently disturbing about a devil worshipper in clowns make up conjuring the forces of darkness at a kiddies Halloween party. The final scene at the railway station with the screeching thundering locomotives and the whooshing steam combined with the dramatic music are amazing and the whole film seems to have the lowkey blackandwhite style typical of film noir. If I had to nominate one outstanding performance in this film it would have to be NiallMacGinnis as Julian Karswell who gives a stunning performance as the leader of the cult. With his pointy beard and charmingly English manner he manages to act rings around Dana Andrews who somewhat woodenly plays the disbelieving sceptic. In fact I actually found myself siding with the bad guy at some points! Full points for this one I only wish that most of todays films could live up to its mark.".

James  is an Agrade shocker on a Bgrade budget which challenges unreasoning attitudes towards the supernatural by believers and skeptics alike. Andrews plays the blinkered American cynic  cast adrift in a foreign country  who refuses to believe the demonic threat made against his life despite all evidence to the contrary though Bennett's script makes it clear that the movie's central 'villain' a powerful and charismatic performance by scenestealer MacGinnis is motivated by fear of the powers at his command.Tourneur and Bennett were contemptuous of the alterations imposed during postproduction by producer Hal E.

Despite the reservations of fans and filmmakers alike this fearsomelooking creature  which makes a brief appearance at the beginning and end of the movie  generates an authentic jolt of cinematic horror in a film which otherwise prides itself on visual ambiguity. Bennett's script foregrounds the human drama and Tourneur's firstrate cast  including Athene Seyler THE QUEEN OF SPADES as MacGinnis' frightened mother and Reginald Beckwith NIGHT OF THE EAGLE as a dotty psychic  plays it completely straight throughout. There's at least half a dozen powerful setpieces including Maurice Denham's terrifying encounter with the eponymous beast in the opening scenes Andrews' confrontation with MacGinnis during a children's birthday party and an episode in which Andrews is followed through the deep dark woods by an unearthly invisible... THING I'll say no more. Ted Scaife's atmospheric black and white cinematography makes a virtue of the bleak English landscape and veteran technicians George Blackwell and Wally Veevers contribute some brief but memorable special effects.

With me its hokey horror movies. My passion for such things began in my youth during those weekly popcorn eating sessions glued to the late night creature features. My interest in such things did not wane with the coming of adulthood. Rather it intensified into a full blown addiction!Unlike most junkies my addiction is harmless. The only negative side effect being the occasional let down caused by the worst of these cinematic efforts. Regardless I still need my fix. So once a month or so I invariably find myself scanning the horror film section at the local movie rental store attempting to locate a flick capable of satisfying my need.One evening when the 'fever' was upon me I happened upon a film sitting on the bottom shelf of a lonely section of the rental store titled 'Curse of the Demon'. I looked it over carefully. It seemed to have all the necessary requirements. Lurid title. Made in the 50's during the height of hokey horror and best of all its cover bore the image of a laughable demonic creature. Perfect! Just the tonic needed to quell my current bout of addiction. Greedily I snatched up my prize and raced to the checkout line membership card in hand. Back home armed with a bag of BBQ chips and a coke I popped the movie into the VCR and awaited the coming onrush of cinematic nonsense.As the credits rolled I noticed the film was based on the classic 19th century story 'casting the Ruins' by M.R. James. I recalled the tale as one read during my college days. It told of a demonologist whose studies had supposedly granted him certain forbidden knowledge and powers. Chief among these abilities is the power to mark his foes for death though the use of a 'caller' a slip of paper upon which are written certain ancient runic symbols. The 'caller' has the ability to summon a vicious demon who will slay whomever is in possession of the 'caller. My interest peaked I awaited the films start. 'Curse of the Demon' stayed true to James's basic concept while expanding upon it with quality filler.The plot details skeptical psychologist Dr. John Holden's attempt to disprove the existence of the occult. The debunkers main target is Julian Karswell the wealthy leader of a socalled devil cult. Not wishing any negative press concerning his groups activities Karswell demands Holden drop his investigation. Holden refuses and Karwell responses by slipping him a 'caller'. Holden scoffs at the implications but soon has second thoughts when strange things begin to occur. Holden begins to suffer strange bouts of dizziness and blurred vision. He hears unearthly sounds. He feels overcome by an odd sense of mortal dread. During a visit to Karwell's home he is attacked by Karswell's house cat seemingly transformed into a deadly jungle cat. On a nocturnal stroll through a wooded area he is apparently pursued by a monsterous unseen force. Is it the hex? Or is Holden the victim of a clever hoax performed by a master of manipulation?The film has slow but steady pace gradually building to a predictable but satisfying conclusion. As the film ended my expression became one of utter contentment. For cinematically speaking I had enjoyed the best of both worlds. Not only had I satisfied my 'B' movie craving but at the same time I witness a film that bordered on genius.".

Or is Holden the victim of a clever hoax performed by a master of manipulation?The film has slow but steady pace gradually building to a predictable but satisfying conclusion. As the film ended my expression became one of utter contentment. For cinematically speaking I had enjoyed the best of both worlds. Not only had I satisfied my 'B' movie craving but at the same time I witness a film that bordered on genius.";

	schema:headline " Hairraising supernatural film a classic tale of terror";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is an absolute mustsee for fans of supernatural horror. It was directed by the great Jacques Tourneur who uses many of the same stylistic touches as in his earlier films Cat People and I Walked With a Zombie for Val Lewton in the Forties.Everything in this movie works brilliantly from the doomladen narration at the beginning accompanied by the ominous music of Clifton Parker to the black and white cinematography that shows the everyday existing side by side with the occult. In a uniformly fine cast a number of actors stand out . Joanna Harrington  as played by Peggy Cummins is an intelligent and determined womanas well as an attractive one unlike the insipid heroines of many Fifties science fiction and horror films.The villain Professor Karswell is smoothly played with a kind of genial menace by the great Niall MacGinnis. He is a man who lives a comfortable life by the black magic powers he exerts over his followers and uses to destroy his enemies but he is clearly shown to also be a victim of that same power. He is oddly likable even sympathetic when he gives Holden  Dana Andrews several chances to call off the investigation. Many critics have described him as being very much like the kind of suave intellectual villains found in the films of Alfred Hitchcock. Dana Andrews does a good job of portraying the skeptical Professor Holden who keeps looking for logical explanations in the face of mounting evidence that supernatural forces are actually threatening him.The normality of the modern Fifties England we see stands in contrast with the ancient medieval superstitions the scientists are investigating. Another fine performance is by Liam Redmond as Professor O'Brien who cautions Holden against an excess of skepticism. He has a great line in which he says something like  I know that light must be shown upon things to reveal them. But I also know the deep shadows that light can cast which blind men to the truth. The buildup of eerie events is so well done and there are so many moments of suspense and sheer terror that we can't deal with them all here. But a few scenes should be pointed out SPOILERS AHEAD Holden's walk through the dark woods on Karswell's estate pursued by some invisible creature that leaves flaming footprints in the ground... or was it only a harmless smoke ball that Holden says was a trick Karswell had rigged to frighten him off? One of the most dramatic scenes shows Holden's visit to some English farmers who live in a house that must date back to the 1600's and Holden asks the forbidding matriarch Mrs. Hobart for permission to hypnotize her son for a meeting of psychologists to unlock the secrets his mind has turned away from. The old woman agrees to the bafflement of her family all staring at Holden in an unfriendly row behind her. They ask why she's willing to agree. Janet Barrow in just a few lines gives one of the most powerful performances I've ever seen. Let them all know what he saw she says with a chilling matter of fact tone. When the slip of parchment with the magic runic symbols suddenly falls out of Holden's coat she rises and points a finger as the others stare.  He has been chosen! Let no arm be raised to defend him! she declares as Holden looks confused and asks  Chosen for what? The rest of the movie will give him the answer. Anyone interested in serious films about witchcraft and the supernatural owe it to themselves to seek out this movie.It is an unforgettable masterpiece of terror.".

Upon learning of Harrington's death Holden finds that the only link to the mysterious death and Karswell's alleged cult is an accused murderer called Rand Hobart who is currently in a catatonic state. While Harrington's niece Joanna is convinced her uncle was felled by supernatural forces Holden sets about debunking it all as pure hogwash. Something that may yet prove to be fatal to his well being?Prior to 1957 director Jacques Tourneur could boast on his rsum psychological horror classics I Walked With A Zombie  Cat People the simmering pot boiling Western Canyon Passage and the rightly heralded filmnoir piece that is Out Of The Past. He was in short the perfect choice to direct this loose adaptation of M.R. James' story Casting the Runes. Why then? That producer Hal E. Chester chose to interfere and not let Tourneur have full rein to deliver a supernatural picture that is more about what you don't see is actually what scares you? Is open for scornful debate.The problem and the source of much discussion over the years concerns the demon of the title. Goofy looking and at once taking away the quizzical factor for the audience Chester had the demon appear both at the beginning and the end of the piece. It was also featured heavily in the film's advertising material it's on the poster for instance which quite frankly killed off the minuscule chance the less than scary vision had of shocking the audience. It's now all the years later considered across the board that it would have been better to not have seen the demon at all certainly at the least to not see it at the beginning of the film.Thankfully though and with much credit to Tourneur his team and the cast Night Of The Demon is still a nerve pulling piece of work that shines bright today as a true classic horror picture. After the demon has shown its unremarkable face we follow Holden a knowingly effective and stoic turn from Dana Andrews as he delves deeper into murky waters that he's convinced do not exist. Only to realise he's in a devilish trap laid by the creepy Karswell Niall MacGinnis a trap from which he must escape or face the dire consequence.The tension has been built up beautifully by Tourneur tension given an added dimension by Ken Adam's spookily adroit set designs. So come the glorious train station finale nobody can be quite sure what will happen and this in spite of us knowing the existence of the said demon thanks to the appearance of it at the beginning. The film was cut by 12 minutes and retitled Curse Of the Demon for the American market but both versions have readily been available in disc form in the US. Odd then that in the country where the film is proudly called one of its own better horror entries it had to wait till 2010 for a home disc release! That is almost as criminal as Chester's insistence on the demon appearing at the start of the film. Only almost mind you. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Psychologist Dana Andrews is on his way from America to attend a convention in London and in answer to a friend's cry for help. In fact we see that friend Maurice Denham when the film opens up. He's at the house of another scientist Niall McGinniss who's been experimenting big time in the occult. Denham is scared and begging for his life begging for McGinniss to call off some kind of evil force that is pursuing him.The evil force gets him of course and when Andrews touches down in the UK he learns from Denham's daughter Peggy Cummins about what has happened to her father. That only arouses Andrews's curiosity.But the message of Night of the Demon is that there are some things that nature means we should not disturb. Andrews learns that almost too late. As was typical back in the day the British film industry to get a wider distribution of their product sometimes imported an American star for their films. In this case Dana Andrews is with an all British supporting cast.But as another viewer pointed out the film really belongs to Niall McGinniss the scientist who summons up evil forces from another plane of existence he can't control.

	onyx:emotionText "Psychologist Dana Andrews is on his way from America to attend a convention in London and in answer to a friend's cry for help. In fact we see that friend Maurice Denham when the film opens up. He's at the house of another scientist Niall McGinniss who's been experimenting big time in the occult. Denham is scared and begging for his life begging for McGinniss to call off some kind of evil force that is pursuing him.The evil force gets him of course and when Andrews touches down in the UK he learns from Denham's daughter Peggy Cummins about what has happened to her father. That only arouses Andrews's curiosity.But the message of Night of the Demon is that there are some things that nature means we should not disturb. Andrews learns that almost too late. As was typical back in the day the British film industry to get a wider distribution of their product sometimes imported an American star for their films. In this case Dana Andrews is with an all British supporting cast.But as another viewer pointed out the film really belongs to Niall McGinniss the scientist who summons up evil forces from another plane of existence he can't control. His comfortable way of living for himself and his mother Athene Sayler comes at a price. McGinniss is charming and deadly at the same time.Jacques Tourneur learned well at the feet of Val Lewton the master of such films as these. After over 50 years the film still holds up well.

The acting is alright Andrews is a little dull as the hero I suppose but nothing too distracting.Night of the Demon is a great British horror film from a era when makers used good story telling  atmosphere rather than CGI computer graphics there may not be much here to please the MTV crowd  god forbid it's in black and white! but for lovers of good horror films  film in general this definitely gets a recommendation from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the last millennium comes to a close and a new one opens the science fiction genre seems to have latched onto a brand new narrative format  the cybertechno thriller wherein characters are free to wander in and out of virtual reality worlds and are even forced to call into question the validity of the world we have hitherto smugly referred to as reality.In 1999 alone this theme has been explored in The Matrix  eXistenZ and The Thirteenth Floor.  Actually of the three this is probably the most intriguing intelligent and involving successfully combining the elements of a whodunit with a clever scifi tale of a group of characters who drift in and out of a simulated version of Los Angeles in 1937.  The plot though complex is spun out with coherence and everincreasing clarity as the layers of information are slowly peeled back to reveal the larger picture. The filmmakers manage to create a sense of unbalance in the audience as we and the characters become more and more unclear as to what is reality and what is a simulation.  Because the writers never lose their way the result is a work of considerable mystery and intrigue.In terms of art direction and cinematography the film is a total triumph. The Los Angeles of 1937 the moviemakers have visualized on screen actually has a slight studio backlot artificial feel to it  perfectly befitting just the kind of world a simulator would create.  The photography in these sections also utilizes a slightly off color cast nicely reflecting the tone found in color pictures of that era.The Thirteenth Floor may not be a very deep movie but it is an honorable addition to a newly formed genre that has not yet had time to ossify in its own conventions.  Time alone will tell if filmmakers will be able to expand on this theme or whether as with most genres it will fall victim to its own inevitable cliches.".

Similar in aspects but very different in others.This is what happens when two movies of similar type are released in close proximity. The first one always has a jumpstart on the second by means of box office success and pleasant reviews. That's why I think The Thirteenth Floor was branded as a bad movie. People had already seen The Matrix with it's knockout special effects cast and weren't openminded for a movie on the same genre branch. So The 13th Floor was said to be 'a bland pale imitation of the Matrix'.Maybe The Thirteenth Floor doesn't have a starstudded cast  yes it's cast is mostly regular supporting players but they work well with the material. So there's no kungfu ass kicking scenes so what!There's great atmosphere a intriguing story and a real nice plot twist. To me that makes up a very fine movie. So I ask what was so very wrong with The Thirteenth Floor that made critics turn away and made it tank at the box office? Really it's people's unwillingness to give a similar movie a chance and instead opting to take the easy route and branding it as a ripoff. Which is their loss unfortunately.".

Great set of actors here too. Ones that deserve the job title actor and have many creditations to their name.I am surprised that this little effort hasn't been more popular since it manages to get a complex story line and make it very easy to follow without becoming bogged down with the characters explaining each scene ergo the matrix.Overall definitely one to watch and one to own.".

The surrounding desert shows what LA used to look like and it makes you wonder what life was like back in that era.  As for the movie itself it's not that bad.  The film really moves when it centers in on the mystery of who killed who.  Craig Bierko sounding like Jeff Goldblum delves into the LA of the past to find out what is going on.  Of course LA of the past only exists in a computer. The film zips along and carries us for the ride only toward the end does it seem to drag down a little.".

I've always been fond of this movie with actors who are not wellknown but still manage to shine on their own. With relatively unknown actors in the film it made it much easier to accept the reality of the story than if there were stars all over this film.Also there are actions scenes but they do not require unrealistic kung fu moves that go on and on for twenty minutes. Instead there is a nod to the film noir genre with its toughguy characters shady dames and guns and fists.If you enjoy detective films sci fi or just like to be entertained this will definitely serve well.If you are looking for some run of the mill scifi goofoff go check out something else.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Thirteenth Floor is one of those films that has gotten lost under all the more wellknown films of the late nineties and this is a shame because it's a damn sight better than a lot of the films that always receive praise from the critics. Not everything in this film works and for that reason and others it's no masterpiece but you've got to admire The Thirteenth Floor for it's originality and it's ability to pull a coherent plot out of a scenario that has 'disaster' written all over it. The film is based on the book Simulacron3 by Daniel F. Galouye which is the same book that inspired Rainer Werner Fassbinder's World on a Wire. Whether or not this version is better I can't tell you having not seen Fassbinder's version but I can tell you that this version is worth seeing. The film follows the death of a computer programmer. He was working on a computer simulated world before his death and his colleague Douglas Hall believes that the programmer left the key to discovering his murderer inside the virtual world...prompting him to go in search of it.The film works both as an entertaining science fiction flick and a thought provoking drama. The film asks questions about the value of life and the ills of playing God and although these questions have been asked by many films many times before here it's done so well that you forget that and ask yourself these questions all over again. The twist at the centre of the movie extremely well worked and after it hits you'll ask yourself how you didn't guess it sooner  and that is testament to the excellent plotting preceding it. Despite being a science fiction film there is very little in the way of special effects in this film. However the movie makes up for this with the excellent way that 1937 Los Angeles is created  it's easy to buy into the film's multiworld plot and for that reason it doesn't need special effects to work. The acting is largely good with Craig Bierko impressing in the lead role. Vincent D'Onofrio Gretchen Mol and 24's Dennis Haysbert who is excellent in his small role support him. On the whole this isn't brilliant or a masterpiece but as far as modern SciFi goes this is one of the best I've seen.".

I know that The Thirteenth Floor didn't rip off these other movies but it did stumble into its share of cliches. When Armin MuelerStahl is walking in and everyone greets him even though he doesn't know them reminded me of The Graduate with Benjamin at the hotel.  The scene when the cop pulls over Ashton and finds the body in the trunk reminded me of just about every movie.  And the idea that their world was artificially created and their is an end point signifying a fake world definitely reminded me of Dark City. Finally the dumb chase scene near the end where the elevator door is closing and Bierko just barely gets his hand in to prevent it.  Bullets fly and it's a shame.  There was one really cool thing that I noticed.  The same song that the band is playing in a '30s scene is again played by a live band in a '90s scene when Bierko and Mol are dancing.  Very nice special effects too.  The acting was good with the main characters sometimes acting in three different roles.  For a great movie with Bierko in it see Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas Bierko is simply hilarious in the scenes that he appears.The ideas that the movie presented were very interesting.  I wish the writer and director would have followed the philosophical implications instead of what they did.  It should have showed the hopelessness and despair that the characters of the artificial world would now be going through for example the cop who throws in his share of dumb lines instead of the lovely and uplifting final scene.  It would have made for a much more powerful ending. So good but could have been better.  Worth your time though.".

The DVD only has a French Audio soundtrack but there are optional French AND English subtitles which should henceforth make it accessible to anglosaxon enthousiasts of French cinema. The quality of the film is a slight improvement on the version I saw in 1983 but we are not talking here of a pristine restoration job ! Indeed the beginning and end credits seem no different from the former version but the body of the film seems to have been cleaned up although the audio is no great shakes. The two main protagonists Grard Philipe and Micheline Presle were two of the finest French actors of their day. The film distills a truly weird atmosphere where parts of the soundtrack are played backwards to indicate flashbacks  the music played during the funeral scenes sung by a sort of wailing choir must rank amongst the weirdest and most sinister music I've ever heard in a film. The sheer insignificance of Marthe's death in relation to the overall joy at the Armistice being signed is striking. Grard Philippe is experiencing internal sadness which is incomprehensible for the rest of the world around him. It appears that the original book by Raymond Radiguet caused quite a scandal at the time.The title theme music by Ren Cloarec is quite haunting and is available on a CD. A remake was made in the late 90's but is not a patch on the original. The film starts with an aeroplane overflying Eastern Paris and several well known buildings such as the Gare de Lyon are instantly recognizeable ! Most of the action the situation of the school and the boat trip takes place at NogentsurMarne a few miles east of Paris in the guinguette country.".

In the Radiguez novel the boy is several years younger than the woman and whilst Gerard Philippe and Micheline Presle were the same age  both 25 when the film was made  this is irrelevant such is the luminosity of the acting. It is doubtful whether Micheline Presle ever did anything to eclipse this despite a long and distinguished acting career. Thankfully she is still with us and still gracing the screen via cameos in her highly talented writerdirector daughter Tonie Marshall's often brilliant films whilst costar Gerard Philippe died tragically young. AutantLara skillfully blends drama and lyricism and one would go a long way to find the equivalent of the scene on the river with Presle at the oars in striped jacket and picture hat as Philippe relaxes with his head on her lap. The moral climate of the time probably played its part in dictating the shot where the couple first consummate their love the camera panning away from them and lingering on a fire which slowly bursts into full flame and a subsequent scene is shot from behind the fireplace with the flames rising gently between us the audience and their faces in close up. AutantLara uses the fire for a third time when the camera pans from Presle's deathbed to that same fire as the flames slowly dwindle to nothing. Equally inventive is Lara's handling of flashbacks which are invariably triggered via bells winding down whilst Presle's first appearance  she materializes out of a mirror into which Philippe is gazing  arguably owes something to Cocteau. This is quite simply a stunning film and cannot be recommended too highly.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this wonderful film yesterday in wellknown theater for movie lovers in Paris Quartier Latin.The story is based on Raymond Radiguet's novel of same title and as far as I remember the book pretty close to it.October 1917 in a bourgeois suburbia of Paris. Franois is a 16 year old lycen  in his high school now partly an auxiliary hospital the Great War is all around he meets Marthe whose mother is chiefnurse in the hospital. Marthe faints at her first contact with the wounded arriving en masse. Franois supports her and express his desire to see her never get used to the horror. Seeing her the day after understanding she is going to spend the day in Paris Franois skips the classes to come along...This film has very remarkable characteristics. The interpretation first. Micheline Presle is impressive in the difficult part of a woman going from a submission to another and conscious of this. She is even better than in Falbalas. Grard Philipe is quite alright even when he has to cope with teenage attitudes the actor is much older than the part but very convincing nevertheless. Denise Grey and Jean Debucourt old thespians are a little bit declamatory but quite effective and their parts are complex enough to escape stereotypes. Palau is wonderful as Marthe's landlord a mean old conformist. The rest of the cast is excellent as it happened quite often in French movies of that time let's think about the bunch of waiters in the scene at the restaurant.Scenery and locations are perfect. The river and the platform the scenes at the lake all is fine and more than fine. Two details are wrong one transparence and a short shot with a model river boat are the two technical flaws of the film to me. The cinematography is very classic even in some rather sophisticated movements of camera. The construction is classic too the use of flashback being far from revolutionary at this time. But all of this routine and wellcrafted filming is very very effective permitting the concentration on the story and the evolution of the characters. One word about the score signed by Ren Clorec  a very beautiful romantic theme.One of the great qualities of the film is the depiction of progress and variations of love by touches elliptic and precise. Passion burst out quite early in the 110 minutes of the film but the writers  well then ill then well again famed Bost and Aurenche  know how to show the evolution of the lovers  Franois enjoying his new power and the overwhelming contradictory sensations it procures to him. And the writers give to Marthe the best part of their talent  shy fiance then reluctant then betrayer and wouldbe passionate lover then betrayed then true wife then falling again then passionate lover she seems to understand as soon as the events are happening who really is the man who takes her in perdition I have two children she said holding Franois on her pregnant woman's lap when in the train. And she understands everything about the destiny of a woman of her time and of her condition a future she fights anyway albeit weakly.Now that a restored copy is available this movie is being watchable again. Do not miss it! Do not! It's a great film.Didierfort at hotmail.com".

The rest of the cast is excellent as it happened quite often in French movies of that time let's think about the bunch of waiters in the scene at the restaurant.Scenery and locations are perfect. The river and the platform the scenes at the lake all is fine and more than fine. Two details are wrong one transparence and a short shot with a model river boat are the two technical flaws of the film to me. The cinematography is very classic even in some rather sophisticated movements of camera. The construction is classic too the use of flashback being far from revolutionary at this time. But all of this routine and wellcrafted filming is very very effective permitting the concentration on the story and the evolution of the characters. One word about the score signed by Ren Clorec  a very beautiful romantic theme.One of the great qualities of the film is the depiction of progress and variations of love by touches elliptic and precise. Passion burst out quite early in the 110 minutes of the film but the writers  well then ill then well again famed Bost and Aurenche  know how to show the evolution of the lovers  Franois enjoying his new power and the overwhelming contradictory sensations it procures to him. And the writers give to Marthe the best part of their talent  shy fiance then reluctant then betrayer and wouldbe passionate lover then betrayed then true wife then falling again then passionate lover she seems to understand as soon as the events are happening who really is the man who takes her in perdition I have two children she said holding Franois on her pregnant woman's lap when in the train. And she understands everything about the destiny of a woman of her time and of her condition a future she fights anyway albeit weakly.Now that a restored copy is available this movie is being watchable again. Do not miss it! Do not! It's a great film.Didierfort at hotmail.com";

It's the kind of hollow concept that you see much more often in presentday movies which are made for audiences who don't care about plausibility and who are easily persuaded that a shallow pseudoromantic attraction between two characters automatically makes them sympathetic.None of that is to imply anything against the stars. Audrey Hepburn is so engaging as Ariane that it makes you want her to be happy even though much of her behavior is fatuous. Maurice Chevalier is enjoyable and is obviously wellcast and John McGiver also adds some good moments. Gary Cooper's character doesn't work very well but that should not be blamed at all on Cooper. The character just is not as appealing as the scriptwriters presume him to be and Cooper should actually be commended for making him as likable or as ununlikable as possible.Wilder's skill made some strange stories work pretty well in his time and he also deserves much of the credit for keeping this one afloat. There are also some very good sequences in the screenplay for all that it was uneven in general.

The part was offered to Yul Brynner also. But Gary Cooper turned out to be available when Hepburn was and he got the role. Wilder later admitted the bad casting but he also said that it was his ill luck to get Cooper at the start of the health problems that would eventually kill him. He said Cooper got old overnight. In fact he looks as old as Maurice Chevalier and Chevalier as Hepburn's father was 13 years older than Cooper.Maurice is a detective who specializes in tracking down and confirming spousal infidelities. He's been hired by John McGiver to find out if his wife has been seeing millionaire playboy Cooper. Daughter Hepburn however is crushing out on Gary big time and unbeknownst to Maurice she takes it upon herself to warn him. The old popular standard Fascination is heard through out the film and in the same year it came out the 20 year old standard was revived in a million selling hit by Pat Boone. It was not an easy shoot despite those familiar Parisian location. In a recent biography of Wilder the story is told that he had tremendous difficulty in shooting the picnic and row boat scenes. It seems as though the location was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and they were unmerciful to cast and crew. Wilder took several takes just to get enough usable footage.Audrey Hepburn fans will be mad for Love in the Afternoon Gary Cooper's though might wince when seeing it.".

	schema:headline " Sparkling if a Bit Overlong Boulevard Comedy Shows Wilder and Hepburn in Top Form";
	schema:reviewBody "There is likely no more romantic ending to a Hollywood movie than the one in this souffllight 1957 romantic comedy where Audrey Hepburn tries to keep up with a departing train upon which Gary Cooper stands and listens intently to her babbling about her fictitious sexual conquests. Hepburn plays Ariane a young cellist and the daughter of a Parisian private investigator named Claude Chevasse. She has an unbridled interest in her father's often tawdry cases chief among them the affairs of Frank Flannagan a millionaire industrialist and aging playboy who finds himself in various trysts with married women around the world. A certain Monsieur X has come to Chevasse to catch his wife in a suspected extramarital fling with Flannagan. Overhearing Monsieur X's intention to kill his wife and her lover Ariane decides to warn Flannagan and they embark on an afternoonsonly affair under the pretense that she is as much a worldly bon vivant as he is. Things come to a head when Flannagan becomes infatuated with this mysterious thin girl and recruits Crevasse to find out who she is.Master filmmaker Billy Wilder leaves his unmistakable stamp on this confection with a clever ironic script cowritten with his longtime partner I.A.L. Diamond in their first collaboration. The dialogue is full of their trademark sparkling banter and leave it to Wilder to use a Gypsy string quartet to act as a chorus for Flannagan's sexual shenanigans. Hepburn is her usual impeccable self as Ariane and especially good fun when she layers the deceptions about her checkered past. Cooper played this type of boulevardier role in the 1930's under masters like Ernst Lubitsch and it is quite enjoyable to see him come back to this milieu two decades later as an aging lothario. Looking weatherbeaten after years of Westerns and adventure pictures he was given a lot of grief because of the age difference between him and Hepburn but I actually find the gap quite touching and Cooper surprisingly game. Maurice Chevalier is ideally cast as Crevasse even if has to play down his naturally effervescent manner.

	onyx:emotionText "There is likely no more romantic ending to a Hollywood movie than the one in this souffllight 1957 romantic comedy where Audrey Hepburn tries to keep up with a departing train upon which Gary Cooper stands and listens intently to her babbling about her fictitious sexual conquests. Hepburn plays Ariane a young cellist and the daughter of a Parisian private investigator named Claude Chevasse. She has an unbridled interest in her father's often tawdry cases chief among them the affairs of Frank Flannagan a millionaire industrialist and aging playboy who finds himself in various trysts with married women around the world. A certain Monsieur X has come to Chevasse to catch his wife in a suspected extramarital fling with Flannagan. Overhearing Monsieur X's intention to kill his wife and her lover Ariane decides to warn Flannagan and they embark on an afternoonsonly affair under the pretense that she is as much a worldly bon vivant as he is. Things come to a head when Flannagan becomes infatuated with this mysterious thin girl and recruits Crevasse to find out who she is.Master filmmaker Billy Wilder leaves his unmistakable stamp on this confection with a clever ironic script cowritten with his longtime partner I.A.L. Diamond in their first collaboration. The dialogue is full of their trademark sparkling banter and leave it to Wilder to use a Gypsy string quartet to act as a chorus for Flannagan's sexual shenanigans. Hepburn is her usual impeccable self as Ariane and especially good fun when she layers the deceptions about her checkered past. Cooper played this type of boulevardier role in the 1930's under masters like Ernst Lubitsch and it is quite enjoyable to see him come back to this milieu two decades later as an aging lothario. Looking weatherbeaten after years of Westerns and adventure pictures he was given a lot of grief because of the age difference between him and Hepburn but I actually find the gap quite touching and Cooper surprisingly game. Maurice Chevalier is ideally cast as Crevasse even if has to play down his naturally effervescent manner. Granted the film runs a little too long at 126 minutes but it is fine light entertainment similar to Wilder and Hepburn's previous collaboration the classic 1954 Sabrina. The print transfer on the 2005 DVD is fine though not outstanding. Unfortunately there are no extras included.";

Regrettably Gary Cooper was not only too old but lacked the charm and suaveness needed for the role. Cooper was also in the twilight of his career and was suffering from health problems when the film was made. Cary Grant or Gregory Peck would have been more appropriate for the role of Frank Flannagan the womanizing jet setter who falls madly in love with the daughter of a detective who has been investigating him. Nevertheless even with a miscast Gary Cooper the film works ....thanks to the marvelous performances of Audrey Hepburn and Maurice Chevalier who play the young innocent musician daughter and her snooping pooping private detective father. The title song Fascination with original music by F.D. Marchetti and Franz Waxman serve as a romantic thread that runs tightly through out the entire cinematic heart throbbing experience. Billy Wilder's more noted films such as The Apartment and Some Like It Hot may have garnered more recognition than this film over the years but in my opinion none of them have the charm that this film has to offer. In fact if one is willing to What if? and trade off Gary Cooper for Gary Grant for the role of Frank Flannagan I suspect that that this film would have been right up there with the best romantic comedy of all time It Happened One Night.".

This film is what it's all about. I feel sorry for those artfilm historians who fail to be overwhelmed by the depth and charm of this piece and would rather pick it apart with their overly dissecting maddeningly analytic tweezers missing the point entirely.

How many among us know of numerous lifelong loves where the age difference between the lovers would appear prohibitive but proves to be only a minor obstacle to a lasting relationship. In my experience life imitates art. In this work it is the very difference in their ages and the differing circumstances of their lives that attract Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn's characters. It is the differences that are extranormal that make this story so believable. He is attracted to her utterly captivating refined insouciance and she to his masculinestraight forward worldly charm. He is the best of the fantasies she has constructed from her father's Maurice Chevalier's detective business files and she is precisely the down home girl with her wits about her who knows his world and his past and loves him anyway.Why is it the desire of all those incapable of suspending disbelief even a smidgen to turn every work of art into a highly predictable formulaic mouthful of insipid prestamped pabulum. How shallow. Or perhaps I am not only overly romantic but additionally overly democratic. I am proud to see that at least the positive vote count for this film that is the large number of 9 and 10 votes more accurately reflects the quality of this timeless vignette than do the rather sour comments that I have just read.

	schema:reviewBody "While Billy Wilder idolised Ernst Lubitsch he worked on the script for that director's Ninotchka he did not have his tenderness and romantic charm. Audrey Hepburn is lovely in this movie but it is painful to see her opposite Gary Cooper who was nearly 30 years older than she and looks in bad shape for his age.When Hepburn began her career the Hollywood studios had a lot of male stars in their forties and fifties and sixties who had been popular before World War II but had not developed young male stars. So Hepburn was paired with these much older menHumphrey Bogart in the soso Sabrina Fred Astaire in the charming Funny Face. This movie is distasteful and unpleasant not just because Cooper's character is so much older but because he is an immature vulgar boor. He shows up at the opera with another woman and when his date goes to the ladies' room sees Hepburn in the lobby and makes a date with her and tells her that he is at Tristan and Isolde by mistakehe thought he was getting tickets to the Folies Bergere! If he meant this he is an idiot if he meant it as a joke he has a puerile sense of humour. When his date returns he winks at Hepburn behind the woman's back.At another point in the movie he is caressing Hepburn in his hotel suite when the phone rings and it is twins with whom he has been sexually involved in the past. In front of Hepburn he makes a date with them causing her to leave the room in distress.One could go on and on but I think this is enough to establish the point. Treating any woman like this is disgusting. Treating Audrey Hepburn like thisthe most exquisite delicate woman ever to have become a film staris unbelievable. It is like watching someone kick a puppy. The rave review for this film in the NY Times when it first appeared is an illustration of the male chauvinism of the time and the comments here from people who think it is a delightful romantic film show that this condescension to women and contempt for their feelings is still with us.Wilder had some talent for romantic comedy but his heart was really in the sordid and nasty as in such masterpieces as Ace in the Hole or Sunset Boulevard. The ending of this film might have been intended as a homage to the ending of Lubitsch's film Cluny Brown but is in fact a clumsy imitation of it. Both films end with the same device for bringing the hero and heroine together at the very last moment but in Cluny Brown with Jennifer Jones and Charles Boyer the device was extravagantly romantic and you felt thrilled that the two of them were together. In this film the scene feels completely phony and you think oh dear poor Audrey is letting herself in for a lot more mistreatment and humiliation.".

Predominate among them is millionaire jetsetting Frank Flannagan stealer of women's hearts.  The detective gets involved when the stolen hearts belong to married women.  One day the daughter overhears a jealous husband swear blood vengeance against Flannagan.  The daughter devises a plan to thwart the killing and in the process falls headsoverheels in love with him.  At first she's just another fling to him...but then love blossoms in his heart too.Shot on location in Paris Maurice Chevalier plays the detective and John McGiver the jealous husband.  They are both great.  Audrey Hepburn is wonderful as the daughter but.....a Gary Cooper looking every one of his 56 years is cast as the the playboy!This miscasting is just too much to overcome.  There are only four characters in the movie which runs over 2 hours.  When one is so unbelievable as Cooper the movie is irreparably damaged.  It's a crying shame.";

Daughter of detective Hepburn overhears this. The wronged Husband vows to kill Wife. The Daughter a romantic at heart decides to warn Wife and her lover about this set of events. When the Daughter arrives at the Ritz the angry Husband is staking the hotel room where the Wife is with visible gun in hand. Fortunately the Daughter is able to sneak in the hotel room next door and walks on the ledge outside of the hotel to the room where the lovers are and warns them about the Husband outside. When the Husband finally enters the lovers' room he finds the Lover Cooper in the arms of the Daughter who incidentally is wearing a chic givency black dress the Daughter was performing at a concert just before going to the Ritz. Got that?From there the sleazy Lover starts a romantic affair with the Daughter who knows well that the man is not to be trusted. How's that for a romance?The story could have worked if the tone had been sorta goofy fun but it wasn't the credibility of the story is stretched to the max that I just couldn't get into it. The set up I just explained takes a big chunk of the movie and by the time we finally see the Lover I didn't care for anything. The setup was the most convoluted setup I've ever seen in a movie with not a single laugh in it. But the setup is filled with so many improbabilities that once the story finally got going I didn't buy.For example1  The Husband staking the room at the Ritz with gun in hand. What hotel would leave a man staking a room for minutes on end without rousing any suspicion? What kind of security was there at the Ritz?2  The woman with the dog leaving the key to her hotel room. Amazing coincidence. 3  The Daughter who happens to wear the same kind of dress as the cheating Wife. Couldn't they have Audrey and the Wife swap dress before the Husband entered the room? It would have made more sense than having the Daughter walk the ledge in that dress. Just ludicrous. 4  Even though set in Paris almost everyone is English the couple is British the Lover is American and the Daughter who also sounds British why set the story in Paris? Only Chevalier was authentic to the setting. Couldn't the Lover had been at least French and not American? As much as I like Cooper hiring him for the Lover was wrong. They should have gotten someone who was not only younger but also French like Louis Jourdan? 5  The age disparity between Cooper and Hepburn was ridiculous. A definite misfire by everyone concerned.".

The stories that remain clear and true through the decades we call classic while some onceactual films look as if the only place they belong to today is some dusty shelf in a museum. And Love in the Afternoon seems like the latter type no matter how I had wished it to be otherwise.I'll be honest I quit watching this film halfway through  because of its total ugliness. No not because it was blackandwhite and with a mere stereo  the technical aspects hardly bothered me. It's the language the film used that was absolutely unbearable. The language of telling the love stories.Can't say it's totally this film's fault. I've seen other films from that era for instance My Fair Lady also featuring Audrey Hepburn. And all the films of that time are ugly when it comes to the portrayal of the interaction of two sexes. Women are always dumb as a door knob easily falling for the most ridiculously rude men while men are either ridiculously rude and abusive and proud of it of course or ridiculously weak and thoughtless. Either way a man is always the boss while a woman is always to follow and to adapt.Yet at least My Fair Lady had a certain competition between the gender archetypes with the woman not brilliant but at least streetwise and boisterous and with the man conceited but also ridiculed for that. That allowed for a much more realistic composition resulting in the story that stands relevant till the days of now. On the other hand Love in the Afternoon looks like a classic 50's flick where women still have no right to have brains or dream of anything but some guy. What makes it even worse is that here Hepburn is just 28 and her heroine seemingly even younger but the film postulates as her love idol a totally narcissist jackass pushing 60 and that jackass being Gary Cooper doesn't help a bit. The man is by the film's own decree utterly no good yet he seems to skim all the cream off the life and what it can offer women included.I have no idea if that abhorrent premise is to be reversed in the second act of the film. If it is well maybe my rating should go one or two points up. However from what I've seen it seemed that the only direction this film could go is to legitimize that nogood person yet again. Which might even have some outer gloss Audrey Hepburn being cute and all but an absolute absence of any balance between the gender roles and a total predictability of the characters turn Love in the Afternoon from a romantic flick it once was into a travesty and a caricature of the topic. Maybe this is how the guys and girls were supposed to act back then but nowadays the only way one can view this film is as an educational material on who NOT to be and how NOT to behave. Both in the afternoon and in any other time of day.".

But this is not a reason to find fault with the relationship. It's more that it is difficult to understand how an intelligent young woman albeit one who is somewhat naive and romantic could be infatuated by continue to be beguiled by and eventually fall in love with the unpleasant lecher played by Cooper. Despite the charm that Gary Cooper has shown in many of his films here he seems...well tired and not really acting as though he at all believes in the rancid character he's playing and he's right.The premise of the film is sour and cynical and the farce doesn't work. The ending injects a jarring sentimental note that only confirms the earlier implausibility of the relationship that the script would have you believe the two leads have. Doesn't work.Audrey Hepburn is her usual magical self but even she can't make me believe in her character. She is certainly worth watching however for the moments when she is indeed someone who might appeal to the Cooper character as more than a onenight stand. Maurice Chevalier is surprisingly appealing here and doesn't lay on the French accent and mannerisms that he continued to polish over the years. But again he's done in by the script. In his very last scene in the film he does a total flipflop in point of view again demonstrating the screen writers' Wilder and Diamond manipulation to ensure a romantically satisfying and totally unbelievable ending.

I liked this film much better than Sabrina which i thought was sort of overrated anyway. Some people have said Cooper was miscast in this film but i thought he did a good job. Humphrey Bogart was miscast in Sabrina and Cary Grant would of done a better Job.   The plot of this movie has to do with Cooper being watched by a private investigator and the husband of the wife Cooper is with is going to kill Cooper. Audrey Hepburn is the daughter of the private dick and wants to save him so he goes to the hotel to warn him. Hepburn falls in love with Cooper but he runs away every time a girl gets serious. There's more to the plot but just watch the movie.".

In short a beautiful young woman finds a much older man improbably irresistible. Whatever charm Gary Cooper had as a leading man was spent by the time he made this picture. In fact he was suffering with undiagnosed cancer and it shows. He seems exhausted pale and flabby. That Audrey Hepburn makes her enchantment with him at all believable is a tribute to her determination as an actress. In an interview she said that it was Chevalier who wouldn't stop ogling her and that he might have been better cast as her suitor than her father. The whole thing is very squeamish and gives you the idea of how invincible men believed themselves to be and how subjugated women were to them. They held all the cards so to speak especially if Wilder could make a smug distasteful film like this without having people walk out on it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time you taste brie or even champagne you may not like it. It isn't what you are used to it isn't what you expect. You educate your palette and eventually you learn to appreciate not just good wine or good cheese but the very best.Love in the Afternoon is one of the very best films ever made. As comments here reveal though uneducated viewers may not appreciate it.It is problematic primarily in that Gary Cooper obviously in his late fifties here is cast opposite a dewy Audrey Hepburn. The eyeballs of the average viewer are offended and they want to turn away.Too the movie like a great lover takes its time to achieve its delicious effects. Viewers trained on the rapidfire vapidity of TV sitcoms can't sit through this movie.Connoisseurs though will watch Love in the Afternoon again and again and find new aspects of it to love every time.First yes Gary Cooper is old here. His eyes are baggy his hair is receding and Wilder does his best to camouflage this by shooting Cooper in shadow or even in reflection. In one scene he is talking to Hepburn and we see her but see him only in his reflection in the surface behind Hepburn.I wonder if this was at all humiliating to Cooper who was in his prime one of the most beautiful  not just handsome but truly beautiful with his long eyelashes and lush lips  men on earth. Too Cooper did always tend to be more of a reactor than an actor best cast against live wires like Barbara Stanwyk in Meet John Doe and Jean Arthur in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.  It is hard to believe that he would be able to sweep women off their feet.Cary Grant would have been more believable.But do Cooper's flaws weaken the film or rather strengthen it?Cary Grant could have been simply too brutal in this part. He was still astounding looking and he did have an irresistable allure.Had Grant not Cooper mouthed Frank Flanagan's callous line I believe we should all act as if we are between planes. No connections. No complications Had Grant not Cooper callously dismissed the woman who attempted suicide over him Grant might have sounded like Mack the Knife.Coop on the other hand as an aging inept Lothario says these lines with a real poignancy. That Time's Winged Chariot can no longer be kept at bay in his life that Cooper so clearly shows what such a life does to a man's face and maybe his soul makes Cooper poignant as well as powerful here. Unlike Grant Cooper's face did show the wear and tear of his highly glamorous life. No Dorian Gray he. Audrey Hepburn  Ariane's love for obviously aging CooperFlanagan becomes not just her powerless surrender to his machineperfect seduction complete with his own Gypsy orchestra but also her empowered rescue of him.Hepburn's empowered Ariane shows Cooper's Flanagan real love before it is too late for him ever to experience it. Cary Grant would not have been able to carry off this aspect of the movie as is and Hepburn would not have achieved the stature opposite Grant that she does achieve opposite Cooper.Now as for the movie's pace.Wilder is a craftsmen and real movie lovers will drool over every frame of every scene. Wilder delivers sight gags throwaway lines fully developed secondary characters. I've seen this movie perhaps a dozen times and every time I see it I see something new it is that rich that packed with evidence of Wilder's craftsmanship and his determination to produce a worthy tribute to his own master Ernest Lubitsch. Wilder is wildly successful. Tiny bits reward me for returning to this movie. Maurice Chevalier's hand gestures. The black and white cinematography of Paris. The lovers who kiss through street sweepers.The Gypsies as they are listed in the title credits. The moment when one Gypsy stands out from his orchestra and steps forward sensing a heightening of romance and begins to play from his very soul.  Watch his face. It says so much. How many times has he stepped forward like that during one of Flanagan's seductions? And yet he no less than Flanagan's latest lover is fully in thrall to the True Romance of the moment. And and ... Audrey Hepburn. She is a goddess here no more no less. Gamine like and radiating the wisdom of the ages. I don't think Hepburn shines any brighter or hotter in any other movie and again it is exactly Cooper's obviously ravagement by time that makes Hepburn so strong here.This movie is funny. It is romantic. It is a salute by one master filmmaker to another. It is a rich display of craftsmanship. It is one of the very best.I'm grateful to Wilder for Love in the Afternoon.".

The pretentious sweetness is often nauseating. Chevalier is too old to be a young girl's father he overemploys his famous bedroom smile but what was sexy 25 years earlier opposite Jeanette McDonald is now downright creepy especially since the girl is supposed to be his own daughter. Cooper is too old too and knows it appearing very uncomfortable and letting some rather embarrassing moments slip in I've never actually seen him act badly before. Hepburn is the only one to enjoy but she doesn't really have very much to do. There are so many better romantic comedies... if you feel like saluting Lubitsch just watch a Lubitsch instead.".

An example of this is when Cory Heron decides to on purpose worsen her mathematics exam results because she wants a reason to ask for help to the boy she is attracted to. If she has good grades on the mathematics exams she obviously do not need to ask for help from him as he pointed out. Therefore her motivation is to do poorly in mathematics. Motivation is everything.";

	schema:headline " The unthinkable A good film in this day and age about high school.";
	schema:reviewBody "Though my own high school days are well behind me now this film received enough acclaim that I was convinced to give it a try. Mean Girls did in fact prove to be a rewarding experience. The film made a ton of money and launched some of its young stars into orbit.Our story deals with a previously homeschooled girl Lohan now having to brave a suburban high school for the first time. She is completely clueless as far as what it takes to be cool in this new world but she is pretty enough to catch the attention of the most popular girls in the school. The Plastics as they are called take the young lady into their world and over time she becomes one of them. The more popular the young lady becomes the more miserable her life becomes however.The film is very funny and it hits pretty hard with its depictions of the various cliques at modern high schools. Some would argue that the characters in this film are just stereotypes but so are most real life high schoolers. Nearly everyone fit into one category or another even back in my school days but things seem even more fragmented now.Tina Fey has written an intelligent script and thankfully the film was cast well enough to carry it. Lindsay Lohan is charming but nothing too exceptional. Rachel McAdams pretty much steals this film and she is likely the cast member who will have the best career of this bunch. I think it's safe to say her scream toward the end of act 2 is the best I've ever heard in any film.Lacey Chabert is also worth mentioning and she seems worthy of some better roles in the future. Overall there did not seem to be any casting problems.Mark Watters keeps things moving along at a brisk pace and it seems strange to see Lorne Michaels' name in the credits of any film this funny. From what I've heard the film had to be trimmed of more than a few parts that would have given it in an Rrating. BOO!!!!!! Hard to argue with the box office totals though! After watching this film I was reminded of a similar group of popular girls at my high school. They called themselves the Senior Bitch Patrol and behaved much the same way as the Plastics. Only back then 8891 it was mostly about the hair. The bigger the hair the more popular the girl. All of these girls have gone on to live boring and pointless lives since those days. Go figure....9 of 10 stars for Mean Girls. Too bad I never had any math teachers as pretty as Tina Fey!".

And it is this inherent understanding of teen life that writer Tina Fey has applied to the film which makes it stand out and such a pleasure to watch.Cady Herron played by Lindsay Lohan is starting her first day of school  and she's 16. She's been homeschooled all her life in Africa and is totally unprepared for and untutored in the ways of an American high school.

However after a chance encounter in the canteen with the plastics teen royalty otherwise known as Regina George Rachel Macadams Gretched Wieners Lacey Chabert and Karen Smith Amanda Seyfried Cady's world begins to change dramatically as she is sucked in by the rules and cliques of Girlworld.The dialogue in the film is sharp and witty not the OTT Dawson's Creek or O.C. teenspeak. The teenagers actually look like teenagers not like 30 year olds playing teenagers. And what holds the film together are the great performances from the actors. They're all perfect. Lindsay Lohan is perfect as Cady the clueless girl who gets a taste of popularity and has to have more. Lizzy Caplan is a revelation as Janis a punk character who would be sidelined either as a freak or as a candidate for a makeover in any other teen movie. But it is the actresses who play the plastics who truly stand out. Lacey Chabert is ideal as Gretchen the insecure 2ndin command girl who fakes her friendship with Regina just to be considered popular. Amanda Seyfried as the ultimate dumb blonde Karen has impeccable comic timing. And rising Hollywood star Rachel Macadams as Regina George is the standout in the film as the manipulative bitch who has to stay on top at all costs.Mean Girls isn't just a film for teen girls and gay guys. Most of my straight male friends love it and everyone I know who's seen it recognises elements of the film and the characters from their own secondary school experiences. Mean Girls is as Gretchen would say in keeping with British slang even though I'm English and the term just doesn't exist! that the film is just So Fetch.".

This girl is one of the best comic actresses of her generation and has created a fully rounded character it is difficult not to root for. Not that she carries the film alone.Of the adults Tim Meadows does sterling work in translating his character with relatively few lines. Neil Flynn familiar as the Janitor from 'Scrubs' is even better with some great facial expressions as a father as much at sea in suburban America as his daughter. As for Tina Fey... a terrific performance of course and she is still as cute as she was on Saturday Night Live but where she really shines is in the screenplay which sounds real enough at least for a teen film and has some razor sharp areas like Coach Carr's 'lessons'.Of course the key group is the titular Mean Girls themselves  Regina Rachel McAdams Gretchen Lacey Chabert and Karen Amanda Seyfried. Rachel McAdams creates a memorable High School tyrant malicous power mad and cruel but not entirely virtue free. She'd screw you over in a heartbeat if you stepped on her turf but the nonthreatening Gretchen is allowed some reward for loyalty. Gretchen herself played by the delectable Lacey Chabert is a character of her own not just a cardboard minion to follow orders. Neurotic shallow desperate beautiful loyal and rather uncertain she is perhaps the saddest and most sympathetic of the Plastics  a girl who certainly has the looks and money to make it to the top of the pyramid but who lacked the will or the certainty. Not a problem with Karen Amanda Seyfried who has an admirable certainty of herself and her abilities. In one of the films best lines after a telling off from Regina Cady tries to comfort herCady You're not stupid Karen. To which Karen replies thoughtfully without a hint of bitterness or angerKaren No I am actually. I'm failing everything. Indeed she is. Karen is an airhead and if not actively proud of it at least accepting. She doesn't seem cruel herself possibly because she is simply too shallow and dense but she doesn't seem a bad person. Which for the second minion Gretchen outranks her to the villainous is quite a remarkable achievement.Finally I must mention Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese as Janice and Damian respectively the outsiders we are rooting for in theory. They do good work though I found them slightly dry next to the endlessly dysfunctional Plastics though that may be something to do with me finding Lacey Chabert much more attractive than Daniel Franzese!Overall a very good piece of work from all concerned. If you like teen movies then you'll find this a very good one. If you don't well hold your nose and try it anyway you might be pleasantly surprised!".

	schema:reviewBody "The teenmovie genre returns with Mean Girls and it comes back with a vengeance. What could have been a tired and clichd retread of Heathers is actually a clever and witty flick thanks to the talents of screenwriter Tina Fey. Fey head writer for Saturday Night Live and coanchor of their Weekend Update has an amazing flair for satire and what better way to showcase it than with a analytical glimpse at the world of high school cliques? Lindsay Lohan is Cady the previously homeschooled daughter of two zoologists growing up in the African wilderness while Mom and Dad conduct their research. When the 'rents decide to settle down Cady gets her first taste of public schooling which is almost as wild as the jungles and safaris she's used to. Cady is introduced to the different factions that populate the cafeteriaincluding the nympho band geeks the nerdy Asians the cool Asians the varsity jocks and of course the Plastics teen royalty led by the manipulative Regina George Rachel McAdams.Cady is encouraged to infiltrate the Plastics by her new friends Janice Lizzy Caplan a gothy and arty outcast who possesses a Janaene Garafalostyle wit and the flamboyantly outandproud Damian Daniel Franzese who fears the Plastics but admires their fabulousness. Cady agrees to the sabotage scheme but it's not long before she succumbs to the glamorous life of the Plastics and starts to engage in their underhanded activities such as writing in their Burn Book in which nasty and hilarious things are jotted down about every girl in their high school.It all might sound like the typical teen fare but the result is nothing like that. The cast is surprisingly flawless from Lohan who brings a depth to her role that Hilary Duff could only ever dream of achieving to the entire supporting cast which is filled with current SNL members and alums. Fey herself shows up along with Tim Meadows as sardonic members of the high school faculty while Ana Gasteyer and Amy Poehler portray parents who just don't understand. Poehler steals every scene she's in as Regina's cool mom desperately trying to fit in by doing things like offering minors alcohol at her home because she'd rather have them drinking there than somewhere else.The younger members of the cast don't let the veterans walk away with the whole show though. Caplan and Franzese own their roles Franzese particularly when Damian displays his adulation for Christina Aguilera during a holiday talent show. The other members of the Plastics shine as well. Besides the deliciously vindictive McAdams as the Queen Bee the crew includes former Party of Five actress Lacey Chabert as the gossipy Gretchen and Amanda Seyfried as the clueless Karen who's not above making out with her first cousin because there's cousins and then there's first cousins and second cousins.Fey with the help of director Mark Waters Freaky Friday The House of Yes has infused the film with her trademark comedic brilliance. The jokes and gags come at a breakneck pace but the punch lines aren't the only hilarious aspects. Little touches such as Gretchen's dad being the inventor of Toaster Strudels and Regina's MTV obsessed little sister are details that will inspire laughter long after the movie is over. Even the particulars about the background characters should provide endless chuckles just try to think about Trang Pak the girl in wheelchair and her little personsidekick and the MiddleEastern hiphopobsessed mathleteBadAss MC after the movie without smiling.If there's anything to complain about in this film it's the overt sexualization of teenage girls. Of course the actresses are older than they play with the exception of Lohan who at 17 years old brings an R. Kellylike meaning to The Parent Trap. Parents might see the Disneyfriendly actress in the trailers and bring their young children but this movie is not for those under high school age girls are called sluts and whores throughout. However that doesn't mean anyone who's older than the class of 2004 shouldn't check Mean Girls out. Fey Waters and the entire cast have made sure the experience will be enjoyable for everyone.".

Cady is introduced to the different factions that populate the cafeteriaincluding the nympho band geeks the nerdy Asians the cool Asians the varsity jocks and of course the Plastics teen royalty led by the manipulative Regina George Rachel McAdams.Cady is encouraged to infiltrate the Plastics by her new friends Janice Lizzy Caplan a gothy and arty outcast who possesses a Janaene Garafalostyle wit and the flamboyantly outandproud Damian Daniel Franzese who fears the Plastics but admires their fabulousness. Cady agrees to the sabotage scheme but it's not long before she succumbs to the glamorous life of the Plastics and starts to engage in their underhanded activities such as writing in their Burn Book in which nasty and hilarious things are jotted down about every girl in their high school.It all might sound like the typical teen fare but the result is nothing like that. The cast is surprisingly flawless from Lohan who brings a depth to her role that Hilary Duff could only ever dream of achieving to the entire supporting cast which is filled with current SNL members and alums. Fey herself shows up along with Tim Meadows as sardonic members of the high school faculty while Ana Gasteyer and Amy Poehler portray parents who just don't understand. Poehler steals every scene she's in as Regina's cool mom desperately trying to fit in by doing things like offering minors alcohol at her home because she'd rather have them drinking there than somewhere else.The younger members of the cast don't let the veterans walk away with the whole show though. Caplan and Franzese own their roles Franzese particularly when Damian displays his adulation for Christina Aguilera during a holiday talent show. The other members of the Plastics shine as well. Besides the deliciously vindictive McAdams as the Queen Bee the crew includes former Party of Five actress Lacey Chabert as the gossipy Gretchen and Amanda Seyfried as the clueless Karen who's not above making out with her first cousin because there's cousins and then there's first cousins and second cousins.Fey with the help of director Mark Waters Freaky Friday The House of Yes has infused the film with her trademark comedic brilliance. The jokes and gags come at a breakneck pace but the punch lines aren't the only hilarious aspects. Little touches such as Gretchen's dad being the inventor of Toaster Strudels and Regina's MTV obsessed little sister are details that will inspire laughter long after the movie is over. Even the particulars about the background characters should provide endless chuckles just try to think about Trang Pak the girl in wheelchair and her little personsidekick and the MiddleEastern hiphopobsessed mathleteBadAss MC after the movie without smiling.If there's anything to complain about in this film it's the overt sexualization of teenage girls. Of course the actresses are older than they play with the exception of Lohan who at 17 years old brings an R. Kellylike meaning to The Parent Trap. Parents might see the Disneyfriendly actress in the trailers and bring their young children but this movie is not for those under high school age girls are called sluts and whores throughout. However that doesn't mean anyone who's older than the class of 2004 shouldn't check Mean Girls out. Fey Waters and the entire cast have made sure the experience will be enjoyable for everyone.";

	schema:reviewBody "Lindsay Lohan plays a teen girl trying to get along at a new high school. This time she plays a girl home schooled in Africa whose first experience at a public school is marred by a clique of nasty girls called the Plastics who use gossip and other torture techniques to try to ruin her social life.The story makes it sound like another generic teen film but this one is actually quite funny and realistic. The most cynical person will point out that this is a cheap rip off of Heathers and they are similar. While Heathers is a good movie mean Girls is an even better movie. I think Mean Girls is very good for a number of reasons. First the script is actually creative and smart. Tina Fey seems to understand that teens want comedies they can relate to and she did that with Mean Girls. Of course there were a few lame scenes but nothing that kills the film. Tina Fey should leave SNL and focus on her career in movies.Second the acting is very good and convincing. Rachel McAdams offers the best and funniest performance as Regina. Her character is very mean hence the title yet I found it so hard to actually hate her. She has this charm that sucks the audience in on her and its so hard to hate her. Lindsay Lohan also gives a good performance as Cady. Her best scenes are with Rachel. They have very good chemistry together. The other plastics are played by Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried. They also give good performances and the scenes that have all the plastics together are very entertaining. The rest of the supporting cast are pretty good and Tina Fey also has a small role as Cady's math teacher.Another reason why Mean Girls is so good is because it's actually funny for people over the age of 21. It's not just for teens but also for adults. Mark Waters is proving to be very good at directing harmless comedies like Freaky Friday and this one. He keeps the film short yet enormously entertaining. I really don't understand how someone could actually give this movie a one. I understand some people finding it over the top or stupid but it doesn't deserve a one. In the end this smart and funny teen movie deserves to be seen. Rating 810".

The movie basically takes a girl who has never been to public school until she was 16 as she's been in Africa with her parents and throws her into to her Junior year of high school.  Now that in itself is a decent plot that can either lead to a movie full of wisely placed cracks or a horrible flop.  This film is much more the former. The cast of actresses does a decent enough job and they do have enough timing to deliver punchlines with an effective manner.  One of the best parts however is Tim Meadows of Saturday Night Live who is the principal of the high school.  His dry style blends well into the movie to provide a great relief from the cliche jokes that can inhabit a film like this. Another great aspect is the subtle political jokes thrown in this movie knocking how kids in our society are raised by MTV and it's idea of what is cool.  The jabs aren't a main part of the movie but I found extremely funny.The movie has the trite ending as you would expect of a film like this however there is enough unexpected parts of the film that it doesn't really subtract from the film as an enjoyable experience.  So even though the film seems like it would be a pile of steaming dog mess it isn't.  It's a well blended strawberry margarita on a lazy Sunday afternoon at the beach. Definitely worth a watch.".

Going into it one expects that this will attempt to demonize the clique nature of high school culture. Instead it promotes it. All conflict in this movie comes from cliques clashing and the happy resolution has the characters disassociate from each other into their own cliques. The only thing this film does is address problem cliques like the skank army led by Rachel McAdams' Regina George ensuring that with their destruction the other cliques can live in peace. It's a wasted opportunity if nothing else that could've showcased just how ridiculous clique systems are.And then of course there's the blatant shallowness disguised as marketing. The lead is the attractive I think we can all agree Lindsay Lohan and while she's befriended by the averagelooking Janis and Damien they end up playing very minor roles.

And even when Cady tricks Regina into gaining weight which makes her apparently lose her hot body she still looks amazing. A couple of overweight students are thrown in so that Cady can in the profound conclusion assure us that you can still be beautiful without being a supermodel but the film ignores these characters just as much as the Mean Girls it vilifies do.Why does Cady have to desire the typical teenage heartthrob over say the quirky but kindhearted Damien? Why can't Janis be happily homosexual? Or at least ambiguous? Why does the film have to assure us at the end that she IS in fact straight? Why must every fat person persist to be a sponge for comedic abuse instead of an actual character? Why couldn't any of the pretty girls realize that being pretty doesn't or at least shouldn't matter and stop putting so much effort into it? What seems to be an effort to break down preconceptions ends up reinforcing all the stereotypes we've seen before.If you don't want to look into it it's entertaining enough. Many of the jokes are rather obvious but it has its moments particularly Rachel McAdams getting suddenly hit by a school bus during a heated confrontation with Lindsay Lohan. Watching it I was thinking to myself Man arguing in the road? Someone better get hit by a bus and lo and behold BAM. I laughed extensively and my vote would've been lower without it.".

So it was quite a payoff when it turned out to be quite fun film and nothing like the dreadful teen comedies we've suffered too much off in the past five years making love to pies losing ones' car and certain Scary Movies.The story has Cady Heron go through her first day of school...at sixteen. She's been homeschooled all her life and lived with her parents in the African bush. She has known nothing of the deceitful backstabbing and ugly world of high school. Upon arrival she makes friends with a levelheaded goth and a fat guy gay. They instruct her on who is naughty nice and full of vice. The 'in' group of the school are 'The Plastics' because they're so fake a trio of cheerleaders who make everyone's life hell.The leader is Regina George the nastiest girl in the universe and at her side and the dumb and airheaded Gretchen Wieners and Karen Smith played by the impossibly cute Amanda Seyfried. In order to take them down Cady must become one of them. She takes great pride in ruining Regina only to take her place. Much like Arnie did in Predator she became a monster in order to destroy a monster. With loads of observational humor and satire Mean Girls ends up being a very intelligent movie sort of a 'Clueless' that's not so nineties. A lot of attention is paid to character and performance not something hastily thrown together and chucked out there. Originally it ended up with an R rating and had to be toned down. I would have loved to see that cut of the film.Another interesting thing is that I've always though Lindsay Lohan looked like the character of Ginny in Friday the 13th Part 2. So it was weird when the movie was featured in Mean Girls and had Cady startle her pals watching it by bursting through the door as soon as Jason bursts through the window.I will probably buy this on DVD when it comes out and I suggest you see it on the big screen. My showing was pretty packed and everyone seemed to enjoy it a lot.".

Well to cut a long story short Cady befriends the 3 popular but manipulative teens after Janis tells her to quote on quote spy on them. However when Cady falls for Regina's exboyfriend Aaron Samuels Jonathan Bennet she is stung and now tries to ruin Cady's social life while at the sane time trying to ruin HER life. In conclusion after alo t of serious events with the burn book and Mrs.George Amy Poehler Regina's cool  mom the principal Tim Meadows decides to go ahead and give Cady a punishment making girl world at peace again.I am absolutely OBSESSED with this movie Lindsay Lohan did such a great job portraying the main Cady Heron as well as Rachel McAdams who played the queen bee herself because you have to have a nice girl to play a mean girl which was VERY convincing. Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried did such a great job too portraying their characters and for Seyfried's feature film debut well let's just say... it made her a really big breakout star i also love the addition of the SNL characters such as Fey Poehler Tim Meadows and Ana Gasteyer who played Cady's mom.Some of the stuff that interested me in this film was that Rachel McAdams was only 7 years younger than Amy Poehler and 8 years older than Lohan but i love how they managed to have her play a high school student and still make it work.In conclusion i recommend this movie to any teenage girls or just anyone who LOVES teenage films cause out of all the teen films chick flicks as i like to call them but this one takes the cake.".

We all WISH the real queenbees of high school could get hit by a bus and realize their evil ways but the fact of the matter is that things like that don't usually happen. Sure there are exceptions but I knew the queenbees in high school. They never changed. They stayed mean all through high school and out into the real world. I see them wandering around town years later and they're just as mean as they were back then. When they're mean in high school they usually don't change. They end up marrying someone mean having mean children and then running the PTA. No offense to anyone who's in the PTA. Anyway I really enjoyed the movie. Especially how Lindsey Lohan was able to get out of the mean group. I just wasn't to crazy about the fantastical ending. Lindsey Lohan was able to get out because she hadn't been in it for very long but for those who've made it in the plastic group all the way up until junior year there's usually no hope for them.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the opening scenes of Baby Boom set against a back drop of hustling and bustling women in the workplace Linda Ellerbee provides us the following commentary  Sociologists say the new working woman is a phenomenon of our time.  Take J.C. Wyatt for example graduated first in her class at Yale got her M.B.A. at Harvard.  Has a corner office at the corner of Th and park.  She works 5 to 9 makes six figures a year and they call her the Tiger Lady.  Married to her job she lives with an investment banker married to his.  They collect African Art coown their own coop and have separate but equal IRA accounts.  One would take it for granted that a woman like this has it all. One must never take anything for granted.And that my friends sets up Baby Boom in a manner far better than I could even begin to.  And why must one never take anything for granted?  Thought you'd never ask.  Just as J.C. Wyatt Diane Keatonis about to be made a partner in the company she works for and a few hours before she is to have the most important business meeting of her career J.C. is left an inheritance by some long forgotten relatives.  That inheritance turns out to be cute and charming Baby ElizabethKristina and Michelle Kennedy dumped on J.C. at the airport.  It seems since J.C. is the only known surviving relative it is left to her to care for Elizabeth. Thus we end up with the first half of our fish out of water story and it's a dandy thanks in large part once again to Miss Keaton's wonderful comedic timing and the fact that we like and admire her character. In a formulaic comedy such as this the value of that is inestimable. In the early going we know that much of what we see will be how well J.C. copes with being an executive while trying to raise an infant a job she is totally unprepared for.  As for her investment banker Steven whom she shares the coop with playing father is not his idea of a good time and he quickly makes his exit. This is J.C.'s and Elizabeth's story so obviously he is not needed.  The film could have easily gone off course in the early going making it strictly a comedy of slapstick but thanks to a good script by Nancy Myers and Charles Shyer it quickly steers away from that.  What we do see is J.C. not only quickly learning to care for her child but also figuring out how to juggle motherhood and an executive position at the same time.  Of course nothing in the film world is easy and circumstances soon force J.C. and Elizabeth out of New York City to the snowy country side of Vermont and we get our second fish out of water story.  It is here that J.C. meets Dr. Jeff Cooper Sam Shepherd the town veterinarian and a romantic interest for J.C.In order to move their film along at a nice clip Meyers and Shyer do take some licenses and shortcuts.  How J.C. obtains Baby Elizabeth is a little suspect as is how quickly J.C. purchases a house in Vermont just from a newspaper ad. In films of this nature there is nothing wrong with taking a few shortcuts if it helps to get from important point A to more important point B.  It's the same thing that happens later as we see J.C. try to build a new business.  There is no doubt that in the real world it doesn't quite work that way but again if this were a dramatic true life story things like that might matter. For this lightweight comedy it's just not important.  Another thing the director Charles Shyers does is make good use of the Kennedy twins as Baby Elizabeth.  In any film where a child is an important part of what is happening on screen many directors overplay the cuteness bits.  Shyers seems to know exactly when Elizabeth is important to what is happening in the scene and when she is not.  He never dwells or lingers too long on closeups of her and he does not develop what I call the cute kid syndrome whereas the director overplays overdoes or rams a child actor down our throats when it's not needed.  Shyers knows this is Keaton's film and never forgets that.  My hat's off to him.One could easily argue as some have that the Shyers have made a comedy about a women's place in the world.  Perhaps they have but I don't agree. At no point did I think they were telling us what women in general should or should not do with their careers.  What they are saying is that all of us women and men alike should be able to make personal choices that have nothing to do with our careers and be able to do it without being penalized for it.  It's a philosophy I happen to agree with and when I do that you get my grade which for Baby Boom adds up to a B.".

While it speaks to where women were in the corporate workforce in 1987 versus today it also displays well the fact that it is the baby that causes Keaton's character to grow up develop and become a more whole person than just the business tiger she was. The addition of Sam Sheppard as the veterinarian loveinterest for Keaton is very well done. Sheppard appeals to men as a masculine intelligent person willing to call his own shots when and where he wants. His ability to become valuable to Keaton who would have before seen him as valueless is priceless. This is a good snowy Sunday evening movie to go well with a good hearty stew and a good friend.".

The scene where she tries to put a diaper on the toddler is classic comedy. I was explosively laughing out loud at that scene. Another very funny moment is when Keaton interviews potenial nannies. Who would have ever thought that she would interview an Iranian woman for the position? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! The second half isn't quite as hilarious as the first. It does tend to sag just a tad bit but that doesn't hurt the film.

I thought the plot was terrific.  Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers really do an excellent job with the writing and directing.  Keaton brings life to the movie not to mention humor and light drama. The supporting cast including Sam Shepard Sam Wanamaker James Spader and Pat Hinkle are all outstanding.  Yet their performances in my opinion are inferior to Keaton's.  When she would enter the scene she would bring the life into it.  I also loved the way too cute girls who played Elizabeth.  Even though they were about two or younger at the time they were precious! I give this movie a 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love this film in particular Diane Keaton as JC Wiatt in perhaps her best performance obviously The Godfather was better but NOT because of her to the theme Everchanging Times which was done by Bill Conti of Rocky fame to some really standout nasty performances James Spader Harold Ramis and Sam Wannamaker. Spoilers ahead It is about JC Wiatt a career woman who was a tiger lady living with a boyfriend named Steve Buchner Ramis in an obviously loveless relationship. Then she finds out that her sister and brotherin law died in an auto accident and she finds she was given an inheritance which much to her surprise was her niece Elizabeth. She tries to raise the baby but Buchner tells her it is me or Elizabeth and her boss Fritz Curtis essentially says you much choose between the job or Elizabeth and she is being threatened by a younger coworker Ken Arrenberg Spader. She finally decides to give up Elizabeth for adoption but changes her mind when she feels guilty because the couple who was adopting just wanted her to use her to work on a farm. She then packs up Elizabeth and moves to a farm in Vermont where everything goes wrong from the heating to the plumbing but she sticks it out and eventually meets Dr. Jeff Cooper Sam Shepard who will eventually become her love interest. She then creates a baby food for Elizabeth called Country Baby that becomes such a hit that her old company and a rich investor Pat Hingle want to buy her out. She is going to take the offer but just like when she chose to keep Elizabeth she realized this was a mistake. As she pointed out to Curtis that I should not have to choose between a career and a family. no one should. And she took a look at Arrenberg and said The rat race will have to do with one less rat. The point behind the film is about JC sacrificing everything she has for someone who really needed her Elizabeth instead of putting herself first and being rewarded with not only Elizabeth but a better relationship more money and the opportunity to be her boss and not be around those who have no respect for her. The final scene of the film where JC returns to Vermont and Elizabeth says mama to her and the smile on JC's face as she holds her says it all. 1010 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Baby Boom is a very warm delightful funny romantic comedy that I absolutely love. I've seen it many times but I was channel surfing last night and came upon it about 20 minutes into the movie and I had to watch it again of course. Because today's workplace environment is much more momfriendly this movie seems a bit outdated to women who were born after 1970. Many of them probably will not appreciate the plight of the main character J.C. Wyatt played by Diane Keaton as much as we older women who worked through the 80's and beyond. But taken in this context this movie is great entertainment.I particularly enjoy the problems she encounters with her new home in Vermont reminiscent of Money Pit and Funny Farm and also the relationship that develops between Diane Keaton's character the that of Sam Shepherd the handsome country veterinarian. Some scenes are downright hilarious. Others sweet and tender. Although I'd consider this a chick flick my husband enjoys it and I think many other men would like it too. The morale of the story seems to be do what makes you happy and not necessarily what society dictates. Quite ambitious for an 80's movie.My recommendation would be to pop in this DVD pop some popcorn curl up on the couch and derive some guilty pleasure with this flick".

I think one of the things that makes this movie work is the fact that she meets the demands that cross her path and she has her priorities right.  I myself work in the corporate world and know how hard it is for any parent who wants to spend time with their kid.  Of course my favourite part is at the end when she turns down the very rich offer from the company that screwed her around.

	schema:reviewBody "As anyone who has walked a mile or two knows life is about choices and making decisions.  And a lot of that has to do with realizing and setting priorities because as a wise person once said You Can't Have It All. It's the lesson we all learn in our own way in our own time according to our own personal situation and director Charles Shyer examines one of them in his amiable comedy Baby Boom' starring Diane Keaton.J.C. Wiatt Keaton is a highpowered businesswoman on the fast track to success she knows what she wants has set her priorities and a partnership in the firm for which she works is on the horizon.  Her livein significant other Steven Harold Ramis is of a like mindset so they complement one another's life style perfectly.  Marriage andor having children is in neither of their respective vocabularies.  then one day J.C. inherits' a baby the child of a distant relative a cousin she'd met only once who has been killed in a tragic accident and suddenly J.C.'s world is turned upside down.  Keeping the baby is out of the question of course.  Or is it? For J.C. it just may not be as simple as it seems initially.  She's been living life on her own terms but now she is once again faced with choices decisions and setting priorities.  And along the way she learns one of life's most important lessons  The fact that the lesson never ends.There's some amusing moments and some insights to be gleaned from Shyer's film and overall it's a pleasant enjoyable experience.  It is not however an entirely original idea and Shyer laces it with stereotypes and cliches to boot.  This is not necessarily a bad thing though.  If his characters are stereotypical it's because they reflect a certain realism. J.C.'s boss Fritz Curtis Sam Wanamaker for instance typifies the image of a dedicated hardcore businessman whom you get the feeling has to consult his day planner to work in an appointment with his own family.  A stereotype?  Perhaps.  A reflection of reality?  Definitely.  The same can be said for Sam Shepard's character Dr. Jeff Cooper who personifies the general image of one in his situation.  And again it is a reflection of reality stereotypical though it may be.Even the cliches are handled in a way that makes them fresh enough to work within the context of the story and be appreciated especially by those in the audience who may have experienced any of the situations presented here. When J.C. fumbles with a diaper and becomes frustrated with her own inexperience and incompetence with such things it's cliche but it also rings truetolife.  The important thing is it's all well presented and actually pretty funny stuff even if it isn't anything new. Shyer wrote the screenplay along with Nancy Meyers and one angle they may have failed to cultivate fully has to do with Ken the character played by James Spader.  As J.C.'s inhouse adversary also striving to climb the corporate ladder it may have been intrinsically more interesting had the character been a woman.  The fact that Ken is a man again makes this particular situation fairly cliche whereas a competitive conflict with another woman considering J.C.'s predicament would have expanded the avenues of possibility to a much greater extent and certainly would have provided a more imaginative perspective.The main reason the film works as well as it does however is because of the engaging performance by Diane Keaton.  In J.C. she creates the antithesis of Annie Hall but even at her most demanding there is a hint of vulnerability in J.C. a softness to that hard exterior edge she uses to shoulder her way through the business world.  Keaton gives you a real sense of the conflict she's experiencing and though it's lightheartedly rendered for the most part you understand the underlying seriousness of it all.  And the scene in which she vents her frustrations and bares her soul to Dr. Cooper is classic.  Keaton's work is without question the highlight of the film and what really brings it to life.The supporting cast includes Pat Hingle Hughes Larabee Britt Leach Verne Kim Sebastian Robin Mary Gross Charlotte Patricia Estrin SecretaryVictoria Jackson Eve Jane Elliot Park Mom and Linda Ellerbee Narrator.  An upbeat entertaining film Baby Boom' may not be particularly memorable but it does provide some laughs and at the same time says something about the value of being given the opportunity to question the things we think' we want.  Kind of like saying Never say never.'  After all who can say with any certainty where destiny may lead any of us?  It's something a film like this may make you consider inbetween the chuckles.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 710.".

It is not however an entirely original idea and Shyer laces it with stereotypes and cliches to boot.  This is not necessarily a bad thing though.  If his characters are stereotypical it's because they reflect a certain realism. J.C.'s boss Fritz Curtis Sam Wanamaker for instance typifies the image of a dedicated hardcore businessman whom you get the feeling has to consult his day planner to work in an appointment with his own family.  A stereotype?  Perhaps.  A reflection of reality?  Definitely.  The same can be said for Sam Shepard's character Dr. Jeff Cooper who personifies the general image of one in his situation.  And again it is a reflection of reality stereotypical though it may be.Even the cliches are handled in a way that makes them fresh enough to work within the context of the story and be appreciated especially by those in the audience who may have experienced any of the situations presented here. When J.C. fumbles with a diaper and becomes frustrated with her own inexperience and incompetence with such things it's cliche but it also rings truetolife.  The important thing is it's all well presented and actually pretty funny stuff even if it isn't anything new. Shyer wrote the screenplay along with Nancy Meyers and one angle they may have failed to cultivate fully has to do with Ken the character played by James Spader.  As J.C.'s inhouse adversary also striving to climb the corporate ladder it may have been intrinsically more interesting had the character been a woman.  The fact that Ken is a man again makes this particular situation fairly cliche whereas a competitive conflict with another woman considering J.C.'s predicament would have expanded the avenues of possibility to a much greater extent and certainly would have provided a more imaginative perspective.The main reason the film works as well as it does however is because of the engaging performance by Diane Keaton.  In J.C. she creates the antithesis of Annie Hall but even at her most demanding there is a hint of vulnerability in J.C. a softness to that hard exterior edge she uses to shoulder her way through the business world.  Keaton gives you a real sense of the conflict she's experiencing and though it's lightheartedly rendered for the most part you understand the underlying seriousness of it all.  And the scene in which she vents her frustrations and bares her soul to Dr. Cooper is classic.  Keaton's work is without question the highlight of the film and what really brings it to life.The supporting cast includes Pat Hingle Hughes Larabee Britt Leach Verne Kim Sebastian Robin Mary Gross Charlotte Patricia Estrin SecretaryVictoria Jackson Eve Jane Elliot Park Mom and Linda Ellerbee Narrator.  An upbeat entertaining film Baby Boom' may not be particularly memorable but it does provide some laughs and at the same time says something about the value of being given the opportunity to question the things we think' we want.  Kind of like saying Never say never.'  After all who can say with any certainty where destiny may lead any of us?  It's something a film like this may make you consider inbetween the chuckles.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 710.";

If you're not annoyed by her screaming andor having multiple breakdowns on screen you'll most certainly be annoyed by her inability to multitask when presented with the obstacles of a child. She's supposed to be this big shot business woman in the 80's and yet for some reason can't seem to find a good nanny in all of NYC to take care of the damn kid. For god sakes 3 men and a baby worked it out  she can too.I won't begin to suggest this has been a very articulate posting but I assure you this movie is awfully irritating.

And when her boss reassigns her to a less stressful client account and she quits in a huff we're supposed to think he's a loathsome corporate shark and she's a gutsy role model. I didn't feel that way. From the moment Diane Keaton's character inherits the baby she acts like an idiot while the people around her are sensible and tolerant. This makes it very hard to root for her when her life is turned upside down and even harder to believe in her as a high powered businesswoman. This character as written and played couldn't find her feet with a flashlight. I'm a fan of Diane Keaton but this script does her no favours and her performance is an insult to working women working mothers and to the concepts of common sense and perspective.

	schema:reviewBody "One of Dome Karukoski's earlier films and certainly one of his funniest Lapland Odyssey is essentially a catastrophe roadtrip movie. A deadbeat man living in the months long night of Lapland gets an ultimatum from his wife. Either he gets her the digital television adapter he has been promising her for ages or they're through. And he only has until the morning to do so. The only problem? It's already late evening he has no car and the nearest allnight electronics store is hundreds of kilometers away.From that basic setting we end up getting one of the funniest Finnish films I've ever seen. And I think the reason why I found this to be so funny when Finnish film humour usually does nothing for me is the fact that the characters take it so seriously. For the man and his two equally deadbeat friends this is truly an odyssey. They're on a quest to save to man's marriage and they will go to extreme lengths to achieve their goal. No winking at the camera no forced jokes no pop culture or modern events references. Just great characters and them getting into trouble.The film is also beautifully shot wellacted and features some stunning shots of winter Lapland. If I had to name one problem I'd say that the Finnish stereotypes can be a bit forced from time to time. Oftentimes they're the best source of humour in the film but from time to time they wander into groan territory. Still a very minor problem in the grand scheme of things.Lapland Odyssey is certainly worth a watch for all fans of comedy and for all those that have liked one of Karukoski's other films.".

So she gives him an ultimatum  bring home a digital box by 9 AM tomorrow or she's leaving. Janne and his two buddies Kapu Jasper Paakkonen and Tapio Timo Lavikainen set off in a borrowed car to the nearest big town 200 kilometres away. Janne has no idea how he'll find the money to buy the machine but he's sure he'll think of something. In the meantime he doesn't know that an old flame of Inari's has decided to make moves of his own on her in Janne's absence....This is your basic winter road trip movie Finnishstyle. The men are all in their 30s and completely irresponsible the women are all longsuffering but willing to give their guys just a little bit more time in the hopes that they'll somehow grow up. There's various highjinks runins with cops naked men running around with paintball guns  oh and an underwater rugby team made up entirely of gorgeous Swedish women. Your tolerance of this movie will relate directly to your tolerance for all such movies I suspect men will find it funnier than women overall and women are more likely to just roll their eyes.

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen Napapiirin Sankarit or Lapland Odyssey once before in Middle School when we watched it in class. At the time I didn't have my blog nor did I think that much of movies and especially Finnish movies felt almost foreign to me so I rarely watched any outside of school at least.Someone actually talked about the way this film starts in school  because it doesn't start with the main character Janne. It starts with his friend and his narration. He talks about the tree many men in the area used to hang themselves from. It's an interesting way to start mostly because that's super dark  but it suits the movie and it suits Finland  but also because there has to be a shift in the point of view if you want to change from the side character to the main character. That shift works well though. It's smooth and it feels natural to start following Janne not getting the digital TV box.The story is fun and it's entertaining to see what kind of misadventures the main characters get themselves into. It's not the most original comedy out there when you consider it globally but at least around the time when it came out it stood out from most of Finnish comedies. Mostly it's not as bad as some since there are Finnish comedies I refuse to watch because of the cast and the fact that the movies are remakes of a Danish comedy. I'm not mentioning the movie by name but I think my Finnish readers know exactly what I'm talking about. Also Napapiirin Sankarit did win four Jussi awards for best direction best film best screenplay and people's choice award and a Silver Dolphin for best cinematography at Tria International Film Festival and two awards at Alpe d'Huez International Comedy Film Festival.Napapiirin Sankarit is entertaining and it looks amazing and it takes place in the north which is a plus since most modern movies seem to take place in the southern Finland. It's definitely worth seeing whether or not you're from Finland or elsewhere except most Finnish people have probably seen it already. However I'm not sure about the sequels. I haven't seen them and they are not directed by Dome Karukoski but at least the third one is directed by Tiina Lymi who also directed one of my favourite Finnish movies kkilht. Not sure if I'll ever watch them though since they feel forced. The first one is always the best right?".

We should all wish to have friends as dedicated as Antoine and we can all relate to Louis at some point in our lives.While the movie may not have been hysterical I found myself smiling or laughing most of the time.

In saving the man Antoine goes into extremes in order to give this man a second chance in life but at the same time he is taking on much more than what he bargained for.Pierre Salvadori's comedy could be considered a black one or at least in that genre. Mr. Salvadori seems to be telling us to watch out for those people that will soak up all our energy and good will as they will never be able to repay us for the kindness we extended to them in their hour of need or so it appears to be the case with this idiotic Louis the man that Antoine saved.In the process of trying to do good Antoine discovers that Louis had been dejected after his girlfriend the beautiful Blanche has told him to pack his things up because she's had it with him! That's the reason for his trying to do himself in. Antoine is kindness personified.

In a touch of Gallic sophistication the head waiter presents the couple a bottle of expensive champagne sent by Louis so they can celebrate their love.Daniel Auteuil's Antoine is perfect. One of the best things we have seen this actor lately. Sandrine Kilberlain is an elegant Blanche. Jose Garcia is the goofy Louis. Marilyne Canto and Michele Moretti are seen in minor roles.This is a comedy that Hollywood would probably try to re interpret in the not too distant future.

He ends up making his girlfriend Christine Marilyne Canto take second place to his humanitarian concerns and this puts a strain on his relationship. One evening in a rush to meet Christine he encounters Louis Jos Garcia who is in the process of hanging himself in the park his desired finale to a life of frustration and loss of his girlfriend Blanche Sandrine Kiberlain.

Antoine arranges for Louis to get a job at his restaurant despite Louis' depression and lack of training. Just when everything seems to be turning out for the best Christine leaves Antoine and the circumstances surrounding Antoine's salvage of Louis' life change and the ending is somewhat of a French twist! The acting is fine the pacing is fine the only problem is with the characters themselves we soon tire of Antoine's absurd selflessness and Louis' nerdy helplessness and that hampers the identification with these characters. Other than that the film is a brisk sweet little French farce that leaves you humming. Grady Harp".

This straightening out includes fixing up klux Garcia with a job as sommelier at Auteuil's restaurant which means in turn that Garcia must compete in an interviewaudition with people who have actually worked as sommeliers. Given that Garcia knows as much about wine as Ludivine Sagnier knows about acting with her clothes on the audition is a hoot with Auteuil sitting in natch on the interview and attempting to coach Garcia surreptitiously. The main reason that Garcia was interested in running out of breath was the fact that he'd been dumped by a girl friend and nothing will do but that Auteuil must intervene once more and attempt to win back the exgirl friend who is now involved with someone else. Not unnaturally Auteuil begins to fall in love with said girl friend which is not exactly hard given that she is played by Sandrine Kiberlain a great actress with an elusive beauty which is hard to classify. She doesn't do chocolatebox like Audrey Tautou she doesn't do chic like Catherine Deneuve she doesn't do warmth like Isabelle Huppert and Fanny Ardant and she most certainly doesn't do slut like Ludivine Sagnier whatever she does she does it to a faretheewell and if you don't believe me ask that swine Vincent Lindon who married her before I could get there first just kidding Vince you're a great actor yourself if anybody asks you but WHY did you have to take her off the market?. This complication gives the movie an extra fillip a touch of the Cyrano de Bergeracs with Auteuil pressing a claim for a guy who is now to all intents and purposes a rival although unlike Cyrano who has been in love with Roxanne all his life and is himself unattached Auteuil is  or was  in a happy relationship until these lifechanging events. All in all a very fine movie worth a couple of hours of anyone's time provided they are motivated by people and the Human Condition and not Matrixtype fx. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Antoine Daniel Auteuil is a head waiter in a chic Parisian restaurant and lives with his girlfriend Christine Marilyne Canto. His work occupies a lot of place in his life. One evening by going through a park to be more quickly at his apartment he saves from suicide a neurotic man Louis Jos Garcia. After vainly attempted to take him back to his close relatives he takes him under his wing and succeeds to find him a job as a waiter in his workplace. Louis wanted to kill himself because his love affair with his ex girlfriend Blanche Sandrine Kiberlain went unravel. Antoine found her again because he wants to reconcile them again. She's a charming florist and you guess it he becomes enamored of her. From then onwards his wellordered life starts to showcase signs of poor running.I'm a little surprised but glad to discover that this little high charged hilarious comedy enjoys a small reputation abroad. About twenty reviews have already been posted for this film and most of them gave the movie thumbs up. I will post another positive one in spite of minor flaws Pierre Salvadori's film showcases.Some will be probably surprised but the outset reminded me of Jean Renoir's classic Boudu Sauv Des Eaux 1932 perhaps because of the quite prestigious situation the main protagonists of the films occupy and maybe also because they save from suicide illfated men who are cracking up. And then the saved ones immerse themselves in their rescuers' lives and disrupt their living environment. But although both movies are comedies they don't belong to the same subcategory. Pierre Salvadori preferred not to follow the steps of the master which bestowed his own work with a strong social satire whiff.

	onyx:emotionText "Antoine Daniel Auteuil is a head waiter in a chic Parisian restaurant and lives with his girlfriend Christine Marilyne Canto. His work occupies a lot of place in his life. One evening by going through a park to be more quickly at his apartment he saves from suicide a neurotic man Louis Jos Garcia. After vainly attempted to take him back to his close relatives he takes him under his wing and succeeds to find him a job as a waiter in his workplace. Louis wanted to kill himself because his love affair with his ex girlfriend Blanche Sandrine Kiberlain went unravel. Antoine found her again because he wants to reconcile them again. She's a charming florist and you guess it he becomes enamored of her. From then onwards his wellordered life starts to showcase signs of poor running.I'm a little surprised but glad to discover that this little high charged hilarious comedy enjoys a small reputation abroad. About twenty reviews have already been posted for this film and most of them gave the movie thumbs up. I will post another positive one in spite of minor flaws Pierre Salvadori's film showcases.Some will be probably surprised but the outset reminded me of Jean Renoir's classic Boudu Sauv Des Eaux 1932 perhaps because of the quite prestigious situation the main protagonists of the films occupy and maybe also because they save from suicide illfated men who are cracking up. And then the saved ones immerse themselves in their rescuers' lives and disrupt their living environment. But although both movies are comedies they don't belong to the same subcategory. Pierre Salvadori preferred not to follow the steps of the master which bestowed his own work with a strong social satire whiff. There's no trace of it in Aprs Vous although there may be an inkling of it in the following sequence when Antoine takes Louis in the cellar and shows him the names of the different wines. Louis is afraid not to recognize the right wines and I think that Antoine answers him the customers ape the connoisseurs and don't know anything about wines.

Anyone got access to it? I can more or less translate the lyrics from my school days but would like to come across a literal translation if anyone has it.I think I might have to go again just for the song!

Louis needed a smart punch in the mouth and frankly when Antoine finally got to the end of his tether with the guy's stupidity and weaknesses I was looking forward to that as the high spot of the movie. Nothing could have upstaged the marvellous Andr Tainsy though who died only a few months after this film was released aged 93. She was une trsor absolue carrying off her role with finesse incredible humour so understated  and total aplomb. It is a funny film and if you know Fawlty Towers it's in that vein in an excruciatingly painful way where you just know everything is going to go wrong and there are a couple of laughaloud moments but given the mood throughout it has the unlikeliest ending you could imagine.Brilliant music by Camille Bazbaz all the way through and if nothing else his 'Papa Tango Charlie' should have been a massive hit.".

	schema:headline " Hilarious and firstrate French romantic comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "This really is a bundle of laughs and they never stop from beginning to end. Daniel Auteuil better known for serious roles here shows himself as a superb comedian with good timing and just the right touch. Pierre Salvadori is the director and after making this film he went on to direct Audrey Tautou the Elf twice in PRICELESS 2006 see my review and BEAUTIFUL LIES 2010 see my review. I noticed that this film was dedicated to the late Marie Trintignant who died tragically in this year at the age of only 41. Salvadori had directed her in WHITE LIES 1998 and it is very touching that he remembered her with a tribute. The female lead in this film is the omnipresent Sandrine Kiberlain who seems to be in everything. As she so often does she plays a slightly pathetic woman in this case she is a young widow who nevertheless sets various hearts on fire. The main story is carried to its full comic potential in a most amazing way. Auteuil is hastening through a park one dark night because he is late to work. He is the head waiter at a small brasserie called Chez Jean. Although the name is fictitious the film is shot in a real Paris restaurant though I do not recognise it and cannot say where it is unfortunately.

Garcia has no money no place to live no job and no prospects. So Auteuil takes him in and stands guard to stop him trying suicide again. He then gets him work in his own brasserie and commences a hilarious search for the girl who broke his heart by leaving him who turns out to be Kiberlain who runs a florist shop. The entanglements and complexities of the story and their comical results become increasingly astounding and it is impossible to stop laughing. Salvadori and four other people collaborated on the brilliant script and the result has all the polish of a muchrewritten and perfected comedy masterpiece. The film has an unexpected ending but with such a story the unexpected is expected. Hats off to all concerned!".

	onyx:emotionText "This really is a bundle of laughs and they never stop from beginning to end. Daniel Auteuil better known for serious roles here shows himself as a superb comedian with good timing and just the right touch. Pierre Salvadori is the director and after making this film he went on to direct Audrey Tautou the Elf twice in PRICELESS 2006 see my review and BEAUTIFUL LIES 2010 see my review. I noticed that this film was dedicated to the late Marie Trintignant who died tragically in this year at the age of only 41. Salvadori had directed her in WHITE LIES 1998 and it is very touching that he remembered her with a tribute. The female lead in this film is the omnipresent Sandrine Kiberlain who seems to be in everything. As she so often does she plays a slightly pathetic woman in this case she is a young widow who nevertheless sets various hearts on fire. The main story is carried to its full comic potential in a most amazing way. Auteuil is hastening through a park one dark night because he is late to work. He is the head waiter at a small brasserie called Chez Jean. Although the name is fictitious the film is shot in a real Paris restaurant though I do not recognise it and cannot say where it is unfortunately.

Unfortunately these plans don't go quite to plan and Antoine finds his own life falling apart.It takes a while to get into this typically Gallic comedy and there is never anything particularly memorable taking place on screen but it does reward the patient viewer with an ultimately sweet view of human nature and displays a positive attitude to life irrespective of the setbacks encountered by us all which results in all the main characters left in a better position at the end of the movie than at the start. While the character of Antoine is perhaps a little too saintly to be truly believable  many would have decked Louis at the point when he accuses his saviour of being selfish  Auteuil makes him an immensely likable person which is just as well as it's up to him to carry most of the film. Garcia is suitably stricken as the hapless Louis traumatised by the breakup of his relationship with Blanche Sandrine Kiberlain and frightened of things falling on top of him. The idea of having these two main characters slowly exchanging their situations and to a lesser degree mental quirks has you suspecting that things are heading towards a much darker conclusion than they actually do but the writers manage to manufacture a more uplifting  if less likely  conclusion.".

	schema:headline " Sweet charming film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a sly thoughtful and honest rewarding romantic comedy done French style. It is the story of a lovelorn Parisian named Louis Jose Garcia whose hurt over his rejection by his love Blanche the graceful elegant Sandrine Kiberlain has prompted him to attempt to take his own life. Fate intervenes however and a good Samaritan in the form of nice guy maitre d' Antoine Daniel Auteuil prevents the success of the suicide attempt. Antoine feels pain for Louis and takes him in offering him a place to stay attempting to boost his spirits find him a job and reintegrate him into society in an effort to rehabilitate him. The search for a job is short and madcap. The restaurant where Autueil is maitre d' is a highend restaurant called Chez Jean and they are looking for a sommelier. Louis is set up to succeed in the interview and hilarity ensues. However obviously the greatest harm done to Louis was the hurt done to his heart by the breakup. It turns out via one of the daffiest wildest scenes you're likely to see that Blanche did not dislike Louis and that outside factors undid the bond between the two 'nuff said. Wackiness and heartache ensues once Antoine ventures to try to put his new friend back together with the lovely Blanche. He finds himself fighting his own desire to pursue her. This largescale effort to help Louis put his life back in order obviously puts a strain on Antoine's relationship with his girlfriend the reasonable but not unreasonably longsuffering Christine the capable Marilyn Canto. Obviously the crux of the film is Antoine's loyalty to his girlfriend his ability to restrain his affection for Blanche and thereby his fealty to his friend Louis. The resolution of the film is fair it is complicated but while perhaps it is not the optimum result for all parties how often does this happen in life? The film seems to me largely plausible which is always satisfying I can suspend my disbelief for a brief period of time but if a film really wishes to simulate reality it should not test this suspension of disbelief too much. Perhaps the only or certainly by far the most unrealistic part of the film was Louis sudden success as a sommelier after a very undistinguished start. Given such ineptitude from the outset it seems unlikely he would have been kept on and certainly would not have become as well trusted as he eventually became. That said the vast majority of the characters and the plot development seems quite reasonable. The performances Louis' neuroticism Antoine's desire to be an everyman and Blanche's welldisguised insecurities are revealed well. This is a grownup satisfying bittersweet romantic comedy that.....gasp even men and certainly this one did might like.".

Taking pity on him Antoine invites Louis to stay with him and his girlfriend for a while until he can get back on his feet. This act of kindness however inadvertently opens the door for all sorts of social disasters especially when Antoine takes it upon himself to reconcile Louis with his exgirlfriend Blanche...The result is one incredibly funny if occasionally rather sad film.

Thankfully it's not heavy handed but sometimes when Louis is wandering around with sadness etched on his features it's hard not to feel sorry for him. It pays off though his transformation from a rather pathetic little boy into the cool confident and professional restaurant wine expert is incredibly uplifting and should raise a smile to even the most hardened cynic's face.The star of the film though is definitely Antoine. Daniel Auteuil's performance is nothing short of spot on imbuing his character with a mixture of everyday charm and a tendency to blunder into cackhanded stupidity. As events pile up on him in a BasilFawlty style string of calamity his good nature and enthusiasm make him a very likable comic hero indeed.Fans of screwball comedy then will be in hog's heaven. It may be geared more towards those who understand the French sense of humour but fans of Fawlty Towers Meet the ParentsFockers and Cary Grant's farcical romps from the 1940s should find plenty to keep them entertained.".

A sort of thinner version of Gerard Depardieu. If you have never heard of Depardieu either then just jump in and watch this lovely french comedy. It is hilarious from beginning to end. One of my most favorite comedies ever. I must have seen it dozens of times by now and the jokes stay fresh.Wnat makes Apres Vous special is the excellent acting which make the characters to die for. I just love these characters who stumble fall and climb up again all struggling with a broken heart and fortunately they fall in love again. An hilariously feelgood comedy. Big hit in Europe. Modern comedy classic.".

This suicidal man gets saved by another man who unfortunately falls in love with the woman who caused the broken heart of the suicidal man.Daniel Autteuil if you havent heard of the man he is one of the most popular and acclaimed actors in France since decades. A sort of thinner version of Gerard Depardieu. If you have never heard of Depardieu either then just jump in and watch this lovely french comedy. It is hilarious from beginning to end. One of my most favorite comedies ever. I must have seen it dozens of times by now and the jokes stay fresh.Wnat makes Apres Vous special is the excellent acting which make the characters to die for. I just love these characters who stumble fall and climb up again all struggling with a broken heart and fortunately they fall in love again. An hilariously feelgood comedy. Big hit in Europe. Modern comedy classic.";

Direction by Anees Bazmee is very good.Music is okay.Dialogs are very good.Performance wiseIts Anil Kapoor who rocks the show.His comic timing is just so amazing.Salman Khan is good.Fardeen Khan is also funny. Among the 4 ladies.Lara Dutta is the best.Followed by Celina Jaitely who has screen presence.Bipasha Basu looks gorgeous.Esha Deol is weak. Boman Irani is wasted.Overall No Entrydeserves a watch.";

Salman Khan is at ease playing a womaniser with charm. Anil Kapoor is on form playing the frustrated husband. Lara Dutta is equally good playing the untrusting wife. Fardeen Khan is a pro for his first time in comic role. Celina and Esha have minimal roles but are adequate in their performances. Bipasha is at her sultry best as nightclub dancer paid by Salman to seduce Anil Fardeen is also roped in under her spell. The wedding story the AnilLara combo and ending are the high points.

The madness starts when the sizzling hot Bipasha Basu comes into the picture. Sallu promises to pay Bips 2 lakhs if she can get Anil to sleep with her. Lara thinks Bips is Fardeen's wife. Celina thinks Bips is Anil's wife. Thus starts the crazy circle of life that ends in a dramatic cliffhanging scene and a 'nagina' and some funny remarks about Sunny Deol  As far as the soundtrack goes the ONLY good song is 'No Entry'. All others are quite forgettable. My favorite scene in the movie is where Fardeen comes to save Sallu who is hanging off a cliff. The rest of the cliff scene is just hilarious!! Altogether the movie is worth the ticket money.".

What happens at the end is anyone's guess.Acting is tepid why do they even bother casting Esah Deol?? with Khan and Kapoor clearly looking overage. They don't come across as marriedguyslookingtosettledown or as enjoying married life. No wonder they fall for the dancing damsel.

In this hastily written story no plot of course otherwise it can't be Bollywood a guy who it seems is notsohappily married to his suspicious wife is lured into tasting the forbidden fruit by his BIL broinlaw and his photographer colleague who also conveniently happens to be an employee searching for a place to stay. What happens at the end is anyone's guess.Acting is tepid why do they even bother casting Esah Deol?? with Khan and Kapoor clearly looking overage. They don't come across as marriedguyslookingtosettledown or as enjoying married life. No wonder they fall for the dancing damsel. All in all it is a bogus farce that only Bollywood can cook up.Could be much better on stage likely where its stolen from.";

	schema:reviewBody "but there's something to be said about films that glorify men having scandalous affairs and getting away with it. Salman Khan Anil Kapoor and Fardeen Khan are three friends with very different views on life and relationship. Fardeen just wants to mind his own business and dish dirt on men who cheat Anil doesn't want to even think about cheating and Salman lives to cheat. Esha Deol Lara Dutta and Celina Jaitley play their wives. Esha is married to Salman Lara is married to Anil and Celina marries Fardeen during the course of the film. It is important for you to note this arrangement because if you blink something might have been switched around on you and you would end up thinking that you're going crazy but it's just the characters having fun or lack there of. Bipasha Basu plays a sex kitten vixen type as usual. She is a mistress to Salman's character but is then introduced to Anil's character by Salman when Anil gets tired of his wife always accusing him of cheating. He decides to actually cheat. Unbeknowst to him Salman is paying Bobby Basu 200000 to make sure she seduces Anil to the point of no return so when Anil tries to back out Bobby is unrelenting. The songs and some of the costumes are very nice. The film has many plots twists and turns but sends a very bad message to women about men. At least Indian women who worship their husbands. The message here is that men are dogs and there is little or nothing women can do to change that. Sad!".

Nathan Fillion is brilliant as Abe a man who is revived from death after attempt at suicide over the murder of his family. He now can see a light on people who may die within the minute or the next day. He sets out to be the hero only to find out that meddling with deaths plan will result in disastrous consequences. This film is visual impressive well paced for its 97 minutes and is very strong in the drama department the acting is great and there are no cheesy moments within range. I loved every minute of it and I recommend you see this psychologicalthrillerdrama.".

However even that was visibly stymied by the horrible script and story.

Hackneyed predictable and tied so tightly to generic conventions White Noise 2 is barely worth the effort let alone the admission fee.Having seen the first film I must admit that I didn't harbour much hope of this being a quality sequel.

Unfortunately at times White Noise 2 feels like plagiarism of not only 'The Ring' but also 'The Eye' even worse it uses elements of both films to create inferior scares. White Noise 2 suffers from the same problem the first instalment. The final sequences of both films jar with what precedes  thus undermining the audiences suspension of disbelief and in the case of the first film ruining a perfectly decent setup.White Noise 2 is a largely unoriginal by the numbers popcorn muncher. It prefers flashes of grotesque figures accompanied by loud aural jolts as opposed to suspenseful moments. Furthermore the plot is littered with unexplained happenings. The condition and symptoms with which the protagonist is suffering are never fully diagnosed or explained. The acting is 'allright' and the characters are given enough screen time to develop yet they can do little to save the film from its script. However If you want an easy to digest bland and average horror flick then give White Noise 2 a try  but like myself expect to walk away disappointed. The film itself isn't terrible it just has nothing at all to distinguish it from everything else in the genre. Try 'The Ring' or 'The Eye' instead.".

He is not easily scared whereas I get scared if someone comes up behind me and surprises me! I got nightmares from Gremlins and The Ghost in the Darkness for christs sake! I'll admit most scary movies these days scare me more when I allow myself to be frightened as opposed to expecting the movie to do all the work most people who go into a movie expecting it to be lame are rewarded with a lame movie but this movie was so predictable I could actually count down to the scary parts! Really!? DEAD PEOPLE?? Wow. And the scene where the girl gets groped by some perv cuz she spills her drink on him?? Show me in what business district in the middle of the day does some welldressed group of guys beat up and shove some guy off of a bridge and threaten to rape a woman because of a spilled drink? Bad st happens in this world every day but that was not believable AT ALL. And using a bunch of actors from SciFi didn't help lol. At least in the original they explored the whole EVP aspect and showed how communication with the dead may not be a good thing. This was lame effects mixed with some of the worst dialogue ever written! The fact that the main chick had hair that looked like she ripped it off of Brittany Murphy's head from 8 Mile and couldn't get that dn smile off her face didn't help the case that the love of her life was dead and she sympathised with the guy's situation. You saved my life...I'd love to return the favor what? by going to a bar and throwing yourself at the guy? Wow...thank you everyone who said to see this. Honestly if you liked this at all go waste your money on the movie The Damned Thing. Saw that last week thanks to reviews like this movie got. Very VERY disappointed and will have trouble trusting this site for reviews. Hope I stopped a few people from wasting money on this!!".

He is not easily scared whereas I get scared if someone comes up behind me and surprises me! I got nightmares from Gremlins and The Ghost in the Darkness for christs sake! I'll admit most scary movies these days scare me more when I allow myself to be frightened as opposed to expecting the movie to do all the work most people who go into a movie expecting it to be lame are rewarded with a lame movie but this movie was so predictable I could actually count down to the scary parts! Really!? DEAD PEOPLE?? Wow. And the scene where the girl gets groped by some perv cuz she spills her drink on him?? Show me in what business district in the middle of the day does some welldressed group of guys beat up and shove some guy off of a bridge and threaten to rape a woman because of a spilled drink? Bad st happens in this world every day but that was not believable AT ALL. And using a bunch of actors from SciFi didn't help lol. At least in the original they explored the whole EVP aspect and showed how communication with the dead may not be a good thing. This was lame effects mixed with some of the worst dialogue ever written! The fact that the main chick had hair that looked like she ripped it off of Brittany Murphy's head from 8 Mile and couldn't get that dn smile off her face didn't help the case that the love of her life was dead and she sympathised with the guy's situation. You saved my life...I'd love to return the favor what? by going to a bar and throwing yourself at the guy? Wow...thank you everyone who said to see this. Honestly if you liked this at all go waste your money on the movie The Damned Thing. Saw that last week thanks to reviews like this movie got. Very VERY disappointed and will have trouble trusting this site for reviews. Hope I stopped a few people from wasting money on this!!";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen. First It has absolutely nothing to do with white noise so why name it white noise II? Second the acting in this movie was sup par. And the 'special' effects as in a bunch of mentally deranged monkeys were hired to do them were just way too ridiculous and overdone! The movie starts off with potential and then horribly crashes. There is no sense of time in the film and it feels like everything happens in a disorganized flash of mind numbing ridiculousness. Random black and white people who are supposed to be ghosts pop out of nowhere for no reason whatsoever to harass Abethe main character for who knows why! Once Abe learns that the white light means that the person is going to die he decides to save people. So the first people that he tries to save is a bum. Who is probably the stupidest bum man you've ever seen. Seriously I bet that if you let bums see the bum scene they would tell you that the bum in the film was obviously out of his mind and deserved to die too. The second person he tries to save is the most crotchety and annoying stupid old man you've ever encountered. Seriously if your car breaks down on the road and you need to go under it to fix something you put out flairs AND YOU DON'T LAY DOWN WITH YOUR LEGS STRETCHED OUT INTO THE LANE!! If someone tries to help you you don't call them a freaky metrosexual.Also why would ONE person saved from death need to then go on and KILL MANY people? It just doesn't make sense! It doesn't balance anything and its ridiculous.EVERY transition in the film is either some random cross upside down crossa random Jesus painting or a fade out of the main character with a random cross upside down cross or a weird Jesus painting in the background. The connections to Lucifer are ridiculous I don't even understand the point of any religious connection or the need for any religious connection to this film.Basically if you want a very warped tripped out movie that takes ideas from white noise poltergeist the exorcist pulse and blends them all together to make the most incoherent jumble of random crap with loud noises and a team of mentally deranged monkeys special effects guys this is the movie for you.Bottom line don't watch this movie unless you're trying to ruin your nightdaterelationship with your in laws etc  because after seeing it you'll feel like you wasted your life and the people watching it with you will wonder if you're on crack.".

Here he's playing a different kind of role but you never get to see that side of him come through. This movie has its moments and the premise had a lot of potential. However the actual film didn't measure up. About 1 of this movie is character development and that sucks because I actually wanted to get to know these characters before the weird events of the movie took place. The other 99 is the director trying to cram this story into an hour and a half long movie. Also seeing as how this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the original I really don't see why it's called White Noise 2. I guess they just wanted to get the whole transmission after death thing off the ground quick and weren't interested in a new franchise. At any rate the pacing seems rushed which is a bummer because it could have been cool. I am a big fan of religious fiction movies and that's what this movie is. Also it's not really a horror movie. It has scary jump scenes but it's more of a thriller and it tries too hard at times to scare you when the story line isn't really supposed to be that kind of scary. If they had called the movie something else and if the director had had free reign over the production I think it could have been good but we don't really get to see Fillion or any of the actors become their characters. If you get into the story even a little bit it works just not for very long.".

	schema:reviewBody "Do you even remember White Noise? It was a January 2005 release that grossed a very surprising 24 million in its opening weekend ranking it second only to the megahit Meet the Fockers. Starring Michael Keaton who had not had a hit since he hung up his bat cape some 12 years earlier the movie was about a grieving husband whose wife is trying to contact him through EVP's  Electronic Voice Phenomena.Sure the movie grosses petered out in the weeks that lay ahead but there was no escaping the EVP craze as everything from CNN to TLC had shows dedicated to the existence of the deceased communicating through television and radio frequencies.Have memories of it or nay there was no doubt that its 91 million worldwide take would generate an eventual sequel. Enter White Noise 2 The Light which went straight to DVD but deserves better in that it is a much spookier film than its predecessor.White Noise 2 starts off by revealing that 'Nearly ten thousand people die every day in the United States the majority of deaths occurring in urban environments. As such a resident of a metropolis might encounter up to 1.7 people per day who will be deceased by the day's end.  North American Statistics Institute  2002.' Barely do you have time to ingest these interesting words of ponder when we are introduced to the Dale Family  Father Abe Nathan Fillion of Serenity fame Mother Rebecca Kendall Cross and their son Danny who are in the wrong diner at the wrong time when a shooter walks in and opens fire killing both Rebecca and Danny before turning the weapon on himself.Abe takes the deaths hard go figure! and tries to take his own life with an overdose of pills that produces a NDE Near Death Experience. After his release from hospital Abe starts to hear and see all sorts of electrical stuff that has his attending doctor interested in investigating. Lucky for Abe the good ole doctor just happens to have an EVP room that looks like a command center for NATO. In a matter of mere seconds the doctor is able to determine that due to Abe's NDE that he is now an EVP receiver keep up with the acronyms will ya'!.It takes a great leap of faith to believe that Abe can now see people illuminated before they die or that television sets are sending him messages but if you ignore the illogic behind the expressed phenomena you might just be able to get through the film with more enjoyment than a straight to DVD release usually allows.Seeing the original White Noise is not a prerequisite to enjoying the sequel. There is no tie in to the first film and where the original story was a man's quest simply to understand EVP's and then his obsession exploit it to find his wife's killer the White Noise 2 The Light spends more time with Abe running around acting as a superhero in the city  saving people from impending death thanks to his visions of disastrous futures.Although there are many reasons not to like White Noise 2 Nathan Fillion gives us a character so rich in turmoil and humor that his performance alone is worth spending a couple of bucks at the local rental shop. Even as the film takes a turn at about the 45 minute mark with a reveal that leads Abe to revisit the circumstances of his family's tragedy and his similarities with the killer the film still maintains its eeriness.White Noise 2 is directed by Patrick Lussier who directed three Dracula films and is in preproduction of the My Bloody Valentine remake happy happy joy joy. Although no Carpenter  hell he ain't no Joe Dante  he does show promise in this production and is able to spook his audience without the use of gore. It will be interesting when he gets a script that holds better material than anything presently in his biography.The ending of the film is something that might turn some from the recommending to the soon forgetting but this is exactly the kind of film that they have been making in Japan for years that the western world keeps remaking.www.robertsreviews.com www.killerreviews.com".

After his release from hospital Abe starts to hear and see all sorts of electrical stuff that has his attending doctor interested in investigating. Lucky for Abe the good ole doctor just happens to have an EVP room that looks like a command center for NATO. In a matter of mere seconds the doctor is able to determine that due to Abe's NDE that he is now an EVP receiver keep up with the acronyms will ya'!.It takes a great leap of faith to believe that Abe can now see people illuminated before they die or that television sets are sending him messages but if you ignore the illogic behind the expressed phenomena you might just be able to get through the film with more enjoyment than a straight to DVD release usually allows.Seeing the original White Noise is not a prerequisite to enjoying the sequel. There is no tie in to the first film and where the original story was a man's quest simply to understand EVP's and then his obsession exploit it to find his wife's killer the White Noise 2 The Light spends more time with Abe running around acting as a superhero in the city  saving people from impending death thanks to his visions of disastrous futures.Although there are many reasons not to like White Noise 2 Nathan Fillion gives us a character so rich in turmoil and humor that his performance alone is worth spending a couple of bucks at the local rental shop. Even as the film takes a turn at about the 45 minute mark with a reveal that leads Abe to revisit the circumstances of his family's tragedy and his similarities with the killer the film still maintains its eeriness.White Noise 2 is directed by Patrick Lussier who directed three Dracula films and is in preproduction of the My Bloody Valentine remake happy happy joy joy. Although no Carpenter  hell he ain't no Joe Dante  he does show promise in this production and is able to spook his audience without the use of gore. It will be interesting when he gets a script that holds better material than anything presently in his biography.The ending of the film is something that might turn some from the recommending to the soon forgetting but this is exactly the kind of film that they have been making in Japan for years that the western world keeps remaking.www.robertsreviews.com www.killerreviews.com";

A couple of days later the grieving Abe misses his family and commits suicide ingesting many pills at home but is rescued by his friend Marty Bloom Adrian Holmes and saved by the doctors. His Near Death Experience makes him see white light in some people and to hear Electronic Voice Phenomena i.e. manifestations of voices of ghosts or spirits through static on electronic devices. Sooner he discovers that the white light means that the person is going to die and Abe saves three lives including his nurse Sherry Clarke Katee Sackhoff. While watching to a video recorded by his son Abe finds that the killer had save the lives of his wife and son three days before the murder. He investigates the incident and finds that when you save you must kill otherwise many innocents will die three days later.I rented White Noise 2 The Light with a lower expectation but as a fan of horror movies I decided to give a chance to this film. What a great surprise! White Noise 2 The Light is scary having a creepy story with characters well developed and with good explanations for the most different situations. The concept recalls the Final Destination franchise if you cheat The Ripper he will chase you but with a different approach through NDE and EVP. The actress Katee Sackhoff has a sweet and nice smile and I liked her character. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Luzes do Alm Lights from Beyond".

	schema:reviewBody "Words lose me on how atrocious this film truly was. It was so bad I think it gave me cancer. White Noise was bad enough it started as an interesting concept but quickly descended into the depths of farcical nonsense. This film got going right from where its predecessor left off. Despite being a nonbeliever in the afterlife occult ghosts etc. as I'm sure many of you are I still enjoy a good horror film about them  The Grudge being a good one or many other Oriental horror films. This film however relied solely on its use of the cheap fright much in the same way the Final Destination films tried to. It doesn't even set the proper atmosphere before a decent fright or any clever way of introducing it  the film just simply stuck the lead character in situations many of which reminded me of the 6th sense and gave the audience no doubt as to when a scare was about to come. For me the lead actor was also about as into the role as the script would let him. He seemed to come to terms with his new found gift extremely quickly despite even losing his seeming mentor after just two scenes. At least the mentor in the first film got at least 20 minutes of screen time before being killed off. This film is really more of a disaster movie than a horror. I even only signed up for IMDb just to warn people away from this piece of expletive. Stay away folks the end is near if you watch this one. Most likely because you're gouging your eyes out after to relieve the pain.".
