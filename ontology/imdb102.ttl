	schema:reviewBody "Trust and betrayal have been a recurrent theme in several of Alfred Hitchcock's works. The 39 Steps made in 1935 has the all the classic elements of the master filmmaker that set the standard for later Hitchcock films. The 39 Steps has the classic Hitchcockian theme of an average innocent man caught up in extraordinary events which are quite beyond his control. The sexually frustrating institution of marriage is another major motif present in the film. The strained and loveless relationship between the crofter and his wife the placid relationship of the innkeeper and his wife the physical bond between Hannay and Pamela can be examined in terms of degrees of trust between the couples. In fact the short 'acquaintance' between Hannay and Smith and Hannay and the crofter's wife are also built completely upon trust. It is these couples and the chemistry between them or the lack thereof that drive the entire film.Over a span of four days the smart and unflappable protagonist Richard Hannay Robert Donat is involved in a circular journey to prove his innocence and expose the hive of intrigue.  He is involved in chases and romantic interludes that take him from London to the Scottish Highlands and back again and he assumes numerous identities on the way  a milkman an auto mechanic a honeymooner a political speaker among others.The opening of the film the first three shorts do not show him above his neck. With his back to the camera he is followed down the aisle to his seat. He is then assumed to be lost in the crowd. This gives the audience the feeling that he could be anybody. Later when he takes in the identities of a milkman a mechanic a politician one realizes that he is Hitchcock's archetypal 'everyman' who unwittingly finds himself in incredible dilemmas.In one of the brilliantly managed sequences on the train Richard Hannay throws himself at a lone girl and forces a kiss just as a detective and two policemen pass by their compartment. It reveals his desperation to remain free until he can prove his innocence. In the scene after Annabella staggers into his room with a kitchen knife in her back Hannay sees her ghostly image which is superimposed talking to him What you are laughing at right now is true. These men will stop at nothing.' The double exposure achieves a result which is a tad chilling and sad. The hallmark of Hitchcock's style is his ability to completely shock his audience by deliberately playing against how they would be thinking. In such episodes as the murder of the woman in Hannay's apartment or when the vicious professor with the missing finger casually shoots Hannay the action progresses almost nonchalantly leaving the viewers stunned.A great story interesting and likeable characters slyly incongruous wit classic Hitchcockian motifs and a great MacGuffin are just a few things that make the The 39 Steps the quintessential Hitchcock.".

If he had turned up the comedy a tiny bit it would be just as hilarious as the best 1930's screwball comedies like Bringing Up Baby and The Awful Truth. Imagine Katherine Hepburn handcuffed to Robert Donat as they wander the Scottish moors. But the chemistry between Madeleine Carroll and Donat is too good to replace her. Hitchcock cast a great ensemble for The 39 Steps. Lucie Mannheim Godfrey Teale and John Laurie are outstanding. The supporting cast are all excellent. Yet in the midst of all this it is Peggy Ashcroft who absolutely shines.Donat's misadventures while ontherun from the law are the original series of unfortunate events. It seems that he just can't go anywhere without being identified and chased. Hitchcock's technique is to lull you into thinking it will be an ordinary scene and then to casually throw something menacing into the scene so the viewer can never relax. These are like getting a slap in the face before you have a chance to set yourself up for the blow. By comparison with the sinister delicacy and urbane understatement of The Thirtynine Steps modern melodramas are obvious and crude. There are many cool things to watch for CAMEOAs Donat and Mannheim board a bus early in the film director Hitchcock makes his customary cameo appearance as a passerby who tosses litter onto the sidewalk.MATCH CUTOne of the most revolutionary edits in cinema history is in here after the maid finds Lucie's body her scream dissolves into the hissing of a train whistle. MISE EN SCENEIf you ever wandered what this was puttinginthescene is a single shot sequence without cuts to another camera or transition to another scene Hitchcock's closing shot is probably the alltime best example. As Donat Carroll and the police gather backstage around the dying Mr. Memory onstage behind them visible from the wings and performing for the Palladium audience is a chorusline of girls highkicking to the tune of Tinkle Tinkle Tinkle from the film Evergreen 1934. After Mr. Memory confirms the espionage plot the camera angle changes slightly and Donat and Carroll fill the frame facing away from the camera. Donat still has the handcuffs dangling from his wrist.

There are amazing shots of the characters weaving their way through crowds close ups used strictly for the purpose of moving the plot. With Hitchcock there is no excess. He is a poet with a camera. As the tension mounts and Donat's character becomes swept away in its arms we are taken with it. His wisecracking character is out of words and must act just as Cary Grant did in the aforementioned film.

I am a hardcore Hitchcock fan and started watching oldies when I almost got deprived of good plots from modernday flicks and started craving for more original plots.Thus began my visual journey of great movies starting from Hitchcock's later Movies of 60s and then 50s and then 40s ..... and then 30s ! Although personally I had a halt there on watching Movies of the 30s as I could hardly enjoy some of the movies made during that decade.But this Movie struck me so hard that it left a great impact on my Mind. Undoubtedly The 39 Steps1935 remains as the greatest movie ever made till date. Its still a step ahead then other great classics such as Vertigo  North by Northwest.Amongst the many reasons why this Movie is great are its almost flawless  moving script precise editing  great dialogs. And finally the impact which it creates on us through medium of various emotions of all the characters.Its a story about a Charming Young Man 'Mr. Richard hannay' played by Robert Dannat who gets entangled in a spy chase when he tries to shelter a counterespionage agent in his house. When the Agent is killed by the Spies he is on his run from the Police and the killers from London all the way to Scotland country side. Almost after the second half he gets handcuffed to the lead lady 'Pamela' played by Madelline Carol who also thinks that he is the murderer. In his aggression to claim his innocence together both the leads continue the journey further resolving the clues which they get and finally arriving to the memorable end with dramatic twist.The detailed thought which was put in while drafting the screenplay of this Movie is surely remarkable. Like how Hannay directs Pamela to fill the registration book of the Hotel as he cannot write since his right hand was handcuffed to her And Like how good Hannay delivers a great speech in a political gathering telling only the truth being misunderstood as a political addresser And like the perfect handling of the conversation between Hanny and the Unhappy Housewife during their very short acquaintance And many many more.The Beauty of the Movie is that it creates a strong bond with the viewers. We get involved into the Movie and enjoy the charm erotism fear  curiosity throughout. This is the Magic of Alfred Hitchcock.Watch it on priority. Relish this magnum opus of perfect 1010 thriller ever made in the history of cinema !".

	schema:headline " The film which launched Alfred Hitchcock's career";
	schema:reviewBody "Film history was made in 1935 when Alfred Hitchcock who was at the time an active but little known and somewhat run of the mill film director received a contract to create a low budget potboiler type spy thriller and used the opportunity to provide his studio with a masterpiece which has never been forgotten. In addition he established his reputation as the master of suspense something which remained unchallenged throughout the remainder of his career. In style this film is quintessimal Hitchcock and those who know his films can pick out sequences in any of his later ones which were based on or inspired by his work in this early thriller. Similarly sequences from this film have also been imitated by many other directors  for example Richard Pearce in the thriller No Mercy 1986 included sequences that imitated a famous sequence in Hitchcock's film where Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll were handcuffed together and on the run  by showing Richard Gere and Kim Basinger fleeing pursuers whilst handcuffed together. Because of this The 39 Steps has become a must see classic that most movie buffs still regard as an essential element in their personal film collection.There are two criticisms commonly made of this film. The first is that there are logical imperfections in the story. This is true of almost all Hitchcock films as well as those of most other directors. The point is that Hitchcock had an unsurpassed ability to maintain a flow in the unfolding of his story on the screen which totally distracts his audience from the type of mental agility required to even be aware of them. Only when dissecting the story on a sequence by sequence basis will such imperfections become significant. The second criticism is that this film whilst based on John Buchan's novel of the same name departs very considerably from the story in the book. I am not a purist about this books and films are totally different media and must be judged independently. In some cases it must be recognised that a book is structured so that it is almost impossible for a film to remain true to the original book. What I do believe is important is that the filmgoer should be entitled to know how true a film is to a previously read and perhaps long loved book. If a film is described as the film of the best selling novel........ then it should be as accurate a dramatic presentation of the story in the book as possible. Where the original is a play not a book the dramatic medium is already much closer to the movie form and I believe such a description should only be used when most of the original dialogue from the play is accurately reproduced in the movie. By contrast if a film is described as based on............ then the filmmaker should have considerably more freedom and if the phrase used is inspired by........ then a largely independent dramatic presentation should be expected. In the case of The 39 Steps Hichcock's film comes into the latter category but a later and in my opinion generally inferior 1978 film of the same name can legitimately claim to be much more closely based on the book. In this instance I personally do not regard the original book as sufficiently important to be sacrosanct but those who differ from me about this may feel they have an adequate reason for preferring the 1978 film.Today The 39 Steps is seldom shown in movie theaters and when a home video rather than the actual film is under consideration attention needs to be given to the medium and technology with which it has been reproduced. The catch phrase digitally remastered is often used to reassure a purchaser that he is buying the best possible product but this may be totally irrelevant. The nuances of shade in a good black and white photograph can often be artistically more significant than those of colour in a colour print and the same is true for many early movies. But home video versions of black and white films are usually disappointing as these nuances are seldom reproduced accurately if at all. It is regrettable that largely because of this many young people today have no appreciation of the artistic appeal a really good black and white movie film can have. Home video versions of The 39 Steps as both DVD's and videotapes have been released by a number of different distributors and these vary in quality enormously. In general DVD's are capable of better rendering of these subtle shade differences than videotapes but either can be satisfactory. The first requirement is that the distributor has used a high quality master for the material copied not an old tape that has already been played numerous times. The next is that proper equipment designed for copying from black and white masters is used. Too often copies of old black and white films are made with equipment that is designed only for copying colour films. In such cases the nuances of the multitude of grey shades present in the master are likely to be totally lost. Many of the copies of Hitchcock's film still being sold are particularly bad in this respect with highlight areas that are totally burnt out instead of containing a mass of detail. The best advice is to consult a website such as that of Amazon.com where the various versions available are listed and priced with user comments that indicate how satisfactory the final product has been found by the purchaser concerned. My advice is DO NOT LET YOURSELF BE HAD  THIS WILL ONLY ENCOURAGE THE MARKETING OF SUBSTANDARD MATERIAL.".

If anyone needs to see some of Hitchcock's finest moments this should be among them.Playing fast and loose somewhat with John Buchan's 1916 novel Hitchcock nevertheless directs a fastmoving riveting story of political intrigue and paranoia with some truly hairraising scenes the Forth rail bridge scene springs to mind.Hitchcock makes his usual cameo appearances. Apart from the one noted here he's also in one of the early scenes after Arabella Smith fires the pistol. The music hall audience panics and make for the egress 'Hitch' being one of the crowd. He's also one of the detectives seeking Hannay after he leaves the train on the Forth bridge.There are some really sparkling lines of dialogue cold hungry and tired after tramping across the moors in what I suppose is Fife Hannay encounters a crofter played by John Laurie later famous as Fraser in Dad's Army Crofter to Hannay who has asked him for a bed for the night Can you sleep in a box bed? Hannay I can try Crofter Can you eat the herring? Hannay I could eat half a dozen right now.Once inside the crofter's much younger wife asks Hannay the following after hearing that he lives in London Is it true that the women in London are beautiful? Hannay Some of them are but they wouldn't be if they stood next to you. My word what a charmer! In case you were wondering the thirtynine steps in the original book referred to the steps down to the sea at a secluded bay the spy involved arranging to be extracted by a submarine when the tide had covered up to the thirtyninth step from the top. This is not alluded to in the 1935 film version other than to give a name to the network of spies involved. Hannay was a mining engineer and Arabella Smith in the book is a man! It's a shortish film too coming in at about an hour and a quarter. It's occasionally on British terrestrial telly and never fails to please. Why they tried to remake this in 1953 and 1978 is anyone's guess as you can't improve on perfection.".

Hitchcock must have had a particular fondness for this film because I see elements of it North By Northwest Saboteur and Torn Curtain.There is no director in the history of the cinema who liked a good chase film better than Alfred Hitchcock. This one's a beauty with a wrongly accused of murder Robert Donat running from London to Scotland and back again to find some spies to clear his name. Along the way Donat picks up a lovely and first unwilling traveling companion in Madeleine Carroll who is arguably the first of his blonde heroines.Donat and Ronald Colman rivaled for roles somewhat they seem always to be cast as the same type of characters. Of course Donat worked primarily in the UK and on stage while Colman was strictly a movie actor since the silent days. Colman is the only other guy who could have done this and other Donat parts. It's a pity there are none like either of these guys around today.When Geoffrey Tearle thinks he's disposed of Donat by shooting him Donat's life got saved by a hymn book in his breast pocket. Whether that was a device in the original novel by John Buchan or something Alfred Hitchcock improvised the inspiration for it was definitely taken from the attempted assassination of former President Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. While running for president on the Progressive ticket that year Roosevelt was shot in the chest in Milwaukee. What saved his life was a copy of his speech and an eyeglass case in his breast pocket.The whole thing here is how the espionage is being carried out and I won't reveal it. But if you've seen Torn Curtain remember why Paul Newman was the only guy they could send on that espionage mission.This is probably Hitchcock's best film from his preHollywood period and shouldn't be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 39 Steps is one of Hitchcock's most economical and greatest films. In this plotheavy film Richard Hannay  a young bachelor  experiences a series of very improbable events starting with the murder of a mystery woman in his apartment by what he believes to be foreign agents and a picture perfect frameup. Dogged by the police Scotland Yard and jealous husbands Hannay runs for his life. Catapulted from one humorous quasiromantic encounter plot twist and narrow escape to another our protagonist searches frantically for a way out and ends up with much more than he could have expected.A lot of good intellectual analysis has been written here on IMDb and elsewhere about The 39 Steps. And the film deserves it. The 39 Steps is not only a great romantic adventure with the usual Hitchcock humor blended seamlessly into the mix but it is also rich in allegory metaphor and even subtle symbolism. Many of Hitchcock's typical themes appear throughout the film  marriage in its various forms human relationships and the many varieties and scales of deceit. But the purpose of this review is not to indulge in the metatext of The 39 Steps but rather to discuss its entertainment value.It is lovely to look at but lacks much of the cinematographic experimentation and play of Hitchcock's earlier films. It is perfectly scripted  each character has a distinct personality and predicament and they are all very believable and very well acted. The plot provides suspense comedy a powerful but unexaggerated analysis of belief paranoia and propaganda. Suffice to say that the film can be seen from many perspectives and tends to hit its audience at many levels.The camera work is more consistently focused on the story than many of Hitchcock's films and the script offers a lot of activity jammed into a relatively short length. No time is wasted and the film zips by. Despite the lean and economical style The 39 Steps is easily followed and doesn't require a great deal of thought or interpretation. However as previously stated the film can certainly inspire interpretive and critical thought if that's what you are looking for.The 39 Steps is a gift and never a burden. Highly recommended.".

Anyone who doesn't mind slightly old blackandwhite movies will be enraptured by this Hitchcock classic which was one of the first films to present sophisticated and witty banter between two illmatched characters. What makes it even more extraordinary is that it virtually totally alters the source material John Buchan's novel yet still comes across as a work of ingenuity.The story concerns Richard Hannay Robert Donat a handsome young man who owns a London flat. A mysterious woman comes to him for help claiming that she is being hunted by some spies. Hannay helps her but when she is murdered in his home it look like he is to blame and he has to go on the run from the police who obviously want him for the crime and the spies who want him to find out how much he actually knows. En route he has many adventures as he flees across the South Scotland landscapes including being handcuffed to a woman Madeline Carroll who happens to think he is guilty of the murder.This is splendid from the word go. It has enough memorable set pieces for a dozen films its pace is invigorating the plot is constantly turning up new surprises and the performances are just about perfect. Hitchcock spent his career narrating tale of innocent men on the run indeed many consider it to be his favourite theme and this is one of the very finest examples of that. Anyone interested in Hitchcock or cinema of the '30s simply must must must see this film.".

Hannay helps her but when she is murdered in his home it look like he is to blame and he has to go on the run from the police who obviously want him for the crime and the spies who want him to find out how much he actually knows. En route he has many adventures as he flees across the South Scotland landscapes including being handcuffed to a woman Madeline Carroll who happens to think he is guilty of the murder.This is splendid from the word go. It has enough memorable set pieces for a dozen films its pace is invigorating the plot is constantly turning up new surprises and the performances are just about perfect. Hitchcock spent his career narrating tale of innocent men on the run indeed many consider it to be his favourite theme and this is one of the very finest examples of that. Anyone interested in Hitchcock or cinema of the '30s simply must must must see this film.";

After all it was only recently that I really started enjoying movies from the 50's.But as I was adjusting to the classic black and white visuals and the abrupt editing I began noticing the same Hitchcock themes and flourishes that I've seen in the later favorites like North by Northwest. The train scenes the cases of mistaken identity and being in the wrong place at the wrong time the innocent man on the run who meets an icy blonde it's all here. The 39 Steps is Hitchcock through and through that's for sure.I thought the story was pretty good if a little abrupt in places. There's lots of tension a bit of occasional sexually charged humor and another thrilling escape for the protagonist always seems just around the corner. Any fans of Hitchcock's other movies will probably appreciate this.".

The Women and Stage Door are maudlin weepfests Birth Of A Nation and Gone With The Wind enjoy their greatest popularity with the whitesheet crowd. Chaplin's not all that funny. Musicals are nearly all insipid. Movies are an instant form of entertainment and what works for crowds in one era won't often do as well decades on.So when a film like 39 Steps comes around you really feel a burning need to say something positive. Not because it's a brilliant film a shining example of early Hitchcock etc. It's because The 39 Steps hasn't lost a step since it was made 70 years ago. When does that ever happen? Even most great novels from the 1930s or paintings or music falter down the stretch.We have all the elements of movie thrillers in times to come to the point of parody. Lone innocent man on the run from something he doesn't understand. Strange woman appears at his doorstep and whispers vague warnings of a deadly plot. Strange woman turns up the next morning with knife protruding from the exact center of her back. Man on the run from the law finds himself bumping into a woman who may be able to help him if she can get herself to trust him first.It's all very clich and even though The 39 Steps gets credit since this was much more original when it was released we the jaded viewers of today would still find it a tired exercise to watch a film loaded with clichs whether or not they were novel at the time. But The 39 Steps takes these elements and does strange things to them playing with audience expectations and throwing a curve. Just when you think something is going to happen it doesn't.In one funny scene Robert Donat confronts a milkman while trying to escape his apartment building under the baleful eye of two sinister men. He tells the milkman he needs help a woman has been murdered in his apartment and now they are after him. The milkman shakes his head. Donat realizes he needs a change of tack. He explains he is a bachelor who has been spending the night with a married lady friend and one of the two men outside is her husband.Well why didn't you say so in the first place the milkman says with a conspiratorial grin pulling off his white coat so Donat can put it on and get away unnoticed. I only wanted to be told.These curves grow only more clever and outrageous as the show rolls along. And roll it does with very little stopping for breath. There's one poignant pause at a crofter's cottage in rural Scotland where the tenant is a nasty sanctimonious cheat with a sad young wife a woman of soulful beauty played hauntingly by Peggy Ashcroft not yet a Dame. Things happen between the Scotsman and Donat in the usual notasyouexpectway but just as things are looking their bleakest the woman steps in and saves him risking apparent cruelty from her husband down the road.Do all the women in London paint their toenails? the Scotsman's wife asks and Donat's Richard Hanney seems like he'd be one to know. He speaks in a singularly tweedy and underthebreath way that suggests a sleazy schoolmaster trying to seduce a teenager while her parents sleep in the next room. All this JackTheLad stuff's out the window when the fuzz arrives and he finds himself up against suspicious sheriffs an FDR lookalike with a missing digit and a nagging tune he can't get out of his head. Finally there's Madeleine Carroll a woman who gets handcuffed to him and finds herself believing his shaggy dog story against her better judgment.There's so many great scenes in this movie and a lot of them verge into spoiler country. Best advice here is to see the film for yourself and see what I mean. But my favorite moment is Hanney's improv stump speech for candidate McCrocodile. It's a classic moment because while Hanney is an impostor everything he says in his speech is true. When was the last time you saw a politician do that? No wonder they lead him from the stage in handcuffs...".

She tells him she's a spy and that she needs his help. He's skeptical of her story but he goes back to his London flat with her. Hannay is brilliantly played by actor Robert Donat.

The newspapers accuse Hannay of murder so he knows he's a wanted man.

	schema:headline " Vintage Hitchcock comedy thriller with innocent man on the run theme";
	schema:reviewBody "The 39 Steps was one of Hitchcock's very early film successes 1934 before he left for Hollywood where he achieved even greater fame and cult status. Written by John Buchan The 39 Steps contained all the elements of Hitchcock's favourite theme of the innocent man on the run which he returned to time and time again  notably in Saboteur 1942 and North by Northwest 1959.Richard Hannay Robert Donat is in the audience of a London theatre enjoying the performance of Mr Memory Wylie Watson  Am I right sir? when he meets the mysterious Annabella Smith a young woman in trouble Lucie Mannheim. He takes her back to his flat where she gives him some important information about a gang of spies who are trying to kill her. During the night she is murdered and Hannay is of course the chief suspect. On the run from the police he heads for Scotland which is where Annabella has told him the spies are located. During the train journey he meets Pamela Madeleine Carroll who turns him in to the police. Upon arrival in Scotland Hannay manages to find the ringleader of the spies Professor Jordan Godfrey Tearle which places him in even more danger but he escapes only to fall into the hands of the police. He gets away from them and is reunited with Pamela who reluctantly teams up with him she doesn't have much choice as she has been handcuffed to him. However she eventually begins to believe his story and realises he is innocent after all so helps to clear his name. Pamela and Hannay return to London where they see Mr Memory who is once again performing in a theatre. Professor Jordan is also there but Hannay spots him and the film is brought to a dramatic but satisfying conclusion.Some favourite lines from the filmRobert Donat to Lucie Mannheim It sounds like a spy story. Mannheim That's exactly what it is.Mannheim to Donat I had to get away from the theatre quickly. There were two men there who wanted to kill me.Godfrey Tearle to Donat Well Mr Hannay I'm afraid I've been guilty of leading you down the garden path  or should it be up  I never can remember.Donat to Madeleine Carroll There are 20 million women on this island and I've got to be chained to you.Donat to Carroll May I ask what earthquake caused your brain to work at last?.Donat to Wylie Watson What are the 39 steps?.The film was remade in 1959 with Kenneth More and again in 1978 with Robert Powell but neither of these remakes can compare with the original Hitchcock version. For anyone looking out for Hitchcock's regular cameo appearance this comes as Hannay and Annabella board a bus to go back to his flat. Hitchcock is seen as a passerby throwing some litter into the street. 1010.  Clive Roberts.".

	schema:headline " extremely entertaining even by today's standards suspenseful and probably Hitchcock's first great sound movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The 39 Steps which is based on a novel and now has become the basis of a hit Broadway show is full of the kinds of things we love about Alfred Hitchcock's films and in a rough awesome form. It's got a MacGuffin sort of or rather the title itself is something that doesn't even matter ultimately in what it really means it's got a wrong man scenario where the lead character is chased as a suspect with spies and daringdo escapes and the interaction between a classy leading man here Robert Donat and a leading lady here though for a shorter time Madeline Carroll up to par with him as a screen presence.True it's also a little less 'polished' if you will compared to Hitchcock's 50s and 60s work but considering how so few years it came out after the advent of sound many sequences are rather incredible if only for what little is used. I loved seeing the chases one on a train another through a mountainside and another that is more like a hidedon'tfind moment after Richard and very reluctant Pamela escape from the spies and hide under a bridge covered with sheep. Even the climax of the picture speaks to Hitchcock's unequivocal gifts at painting suspense but also throwing in a sliver of pathos watch Mr. Memory in the final shot explaining about a formula or other and see how Hitchcock regards such silly things as plot details unless it's at the expense of something of a joke i.e. on the train with the Hard Day's Night 'old man' and the other guy joking about the paper.What matters is that the story keeps moving and under the circumstances makes some sense. And here we get somewhat a preNorthbyNorthwest tale where average Joe Richard brings to his home Miss Annabella Smith who's a spy and is running after shooting someone at the Memory show they both just left from. Morning after he finds she's dead with a knife in her back he's the blame and has to run to find people she's mentioned to him which Hitchcock shoots eerily in a faded closeup over a map of her face repeating things she said earlier in a different tone of voice. Throughout this short but invigorating film we get lots of comedic bits like Richard's stumble into a town hall meeting and giving a speech to buy some time. Or even a lovely romantic piece that's like a slice of a silent film as Pamela almost escapes but decides to curl up on the couch instead.It's overall a beautiful tense but very funny movie by a filmmaker who knows his stuff inside and out and isn't worried about showing a good time in the midst of some unconventional technical choices.".

I mean a huge disappointment especially compared to any other Hitchcock film. As another reviewer has mentioned I think this is an example of people giving good reviews simply because they are supposed to and it shows their Love  Understanding of Fine Cinema. My guess is many have not seen the movie. Where do I begin to tell you why this movie is such a disappointment? Ridiculous overacting implausible change of heart by main character forgettable milquetoast of a leading man Donat and repeated coincidences to push the seriously weak plot that are so unbelievably silly that everyone in my viewing laughed.The capper was the ending. After I watched it I went to the National Archives in D.C. I live there to find original reviews on the movie which I do often. The 1935 critical reviews are far more diverse in their opinions than the glowing writeups on this board would lead you to believe. Many major critics of the day hated the movie and many more were confused by the silly and convenient ending which Hitchcock himself was forced to explain many times. I recommend that those interested do their own research into the opinions of Hitchcock's contemporaries without the modern hindsight and positive baggage the director's name conveys.I'm sorry to say this but the 39 Steps is without any doubt on my part Hitchcock's worst. I recommend you take 39 Steps away from this movie and move down the isle to get any other Hitchcock movie especially Torn Curtain Rear Window Lifeboat and The Lady Vanishes.".

	schema:headline " Hitch and the Music Hall";
	schema:reviewBody "The 39 Steps is a neatly made thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock and a nice companion piece to the director's The Man Who Knew Too Much made the previous year. As is so often the case with Hitchcock the plot revolves around a someone in flight from people he doesn't know for reasons he doesn't understand. In this case it's a Canadian named Hannay who finds a murdered woman in his flat and is then pursued by the police ending up in Scotland where he runs into a pack of spies who also begin chasing himhe's now handcuffed to a beautiful womanand the two flee to London where the film concludes as it began in a music hall. There's much humor in the manwoman situation which due to the strict censorship of the time leaves much to the viewer's imagination such as how they deal with matters pertaining to the bathroom.The script coauthored by frequent Hitchcock collaborator Charles Bennett has somewhat more serious situations than was typical of the director at this time and there are certain scenes that seem almost to have been written by Hitchcock such as the one in which the criminal chief shows Hannay the stump of his missing little finger.Robert Donat makes a dashing hero though he can't conceal a certain dourness. To paraphrase a friend of mine's comment on Jeff Bridges He's a fine actor but not a fun one. Madeline Carroll makes a gorgeous heroine and nice counterpart to Donat as she at least seems more in tune with the director's intentions. Also good is FDR lookalike Godfrey Tearle as Mister Big. A nice touch. Peggy Ashcroft has a small part as the wife of a morally rigid highly religious Scottish farmer whose baleful and suspicious disposition makes Donat look like Danny Kaye.The exteriors in the film are none too convincing though the editing and photography are first rate. There's a rhythmic musical quality to the picture that's difficult to pinpoint. Hitchcock was still in the process of finding a style and here as in The Lady Vanishes we see him working somewhat apart from the story constructing his film almost as a composer puts together a symphony. There's humor suspense drama surprise sadness and joy as we can sense the director working on how to present his work to maximum effect and rejoice with him as he finds just the right angle pace and mood to nail down a particular scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "What is drama? Alfred Hitchcock once reflected but life with all the dull parts cut out. For Richard Hannay the unwitting hero of The ThirtyNine Steps all of life's dull moments are suddenly all pulled together.The plot of The ThirtyNine Steps is simple and like all of Hitchcock?s films entirely subordinate to the development of characters and theme. The film concerns the adventures of a Canadian Richard Hannay  the handsome Robert Donat who while visiting London becomes involved in a deadly game of espionage when a murder is committed in his flat. To establish his innocence he must discover and bring to justice a ring of spies known as ? the thirtynine steps.? Throughout the entire film there are two major themes the disparity between appearance and reality and that theme of trust. For example throughout the entire film Hannay assumes at least four different ?roles.? First he avoids the murderous spies by pretending to be a milkman. Another is the scene in which he tries to avoid the police by posing as a political candidate and of course gives a speech. However my favorite is the scene in which a handcuffed Hannay and Pamela Madeleine Carroll give off the appearance that they are newlyweds.Perhaps the most striking example is the fact that the spies themselves are able to masquerade as police and their leader the dangerous spy with part of his small finger missing isn't exactly who he claims to be either. To everyone else he is the wellrespected member of society Professor Jordan but to his fellow spies he is their dangerous leader.The theme of trust is all over this film. Should Pamela trust Richard? Should Richard even trust her? These are also similar to the relationship of Cary Grant and EvaMarie Saint in North by Northwest. The fact is Hannay is forced and compelled to trust others in his attempt to establish his own innocence. The scenes involving the farmers and innkeepers wives also carry this theme as they both insist on helping. It is their husbands who are reluctant.One of Hitchcock's most entertaining films and my um personal favorite. My favorite scene is when the two lead characters Hannay and Pamela are handcuffed and on the run and not a minute passes and they are already bickering and she says to him How far are you going to get shackled to me? Donat instantly fires back Save that question for your husband!?".

It may seem strictly an entertainment but that episode involving the dour Scottish farmer and his lonely compassionate wife is like a little short story in itself and blended effectively into the overall story.What's also impressive about it is how much it presages Hitchcock's later favorite kinds of scenes. The man stuck in a public space the exits covered by his pursuers who must try to improvise his way out of danger. In this instance Robert Donat sneaks into a political meeting and is mistaken for the keynote speaker. He stands at the podium and gives a rousing speech full of political malarkey that has the audience on its feet clapping and shouting. His pursuers still manage to nail him and lead him away in manacles but as the police escort him through the door the audience turns and cheers him again while he waves his grinning farewell with a shackled hand. A situation nicely handled in North by Northwest too at an auction. The fact that it works is evidenced by the thousand times it's been copied. Vide The Prize. The script is quite funny and sexy too. Scotland looks so barren and windswept. It's hard to believe those bens were once covered by natural forests.The performances are up to par. Poor Donat died of asthma which is an unpleasant way to go. Madeleine Carrol was a beautiful blond one of Hitchcock's first. He seemed to like frosty blonds but he was never a sentimental mope. Years later he was shooting at a location only a few blocks from where Carrol lived and never bothered to visit her. Peggy Ashcroft as the farmer's wife gives a firstrate performance. And she has an inner beauty that transcends anything resembling glamor. She looks almost compellingly homely in this part. One wants to be a kitten and curl up in her lap certain of being treated gently.Great stuff here.".

He is soon caught and a man testifies against the killer. Soldo soon escapes from prison with the aid of his fellow mafia members and vows revenge on the man who helped convict him. He and a friend kidnap the man's young daughter and make it appear as if the child drowned. Despondent the man and his wife leave Italy and return to Americaassuming their daughter was dead. However the child was dropped off to be raised by a poor family and she after she grows up now played by Mary Pickford she thinks these are her real parents and her stepbrother Jack Pickford is her brother. But when her parents try to force her to marry a jerk she runs off and stows away on a boat heading to America. What happens next is made up of one coincidence after anotherI know the viewer might groan a bit at this. However the film is well made and Mary gives it her best. An interesting film even if so many coincidences may not sit well with everyone today. Plus it was nice seeing Mary play a boy during part of the film. Worth your time but not nearly as good any many of her later fulllength films.".

	schema:headline " Pastafazoola for Little Mary";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS SPOILERS'Poor Little Peppina' is not one of Mary Pickford's better efforts although it's a creditable attempt at a change of pace for Little Mary. There's a long prologue in which she doesn't appear at all her screen character being only an infant. Peppina's father is a wealthy landowner who helps send a Mafiosa to gaol. Seeking revenge the gangster escapes and abducts Peppina. When a man and a child are rumoured to be drowned Peppina's father assumes that the dead child is his daughter and he makes no attempt to find her. He sounds a devoted dad he does...Fade out fade in years later and now the girl Peppina is Mary in a long black wig. When she finds herself heading for a forced marriage she escapes with the aid of a duchess who gives her enough money to reach America. Peppina is also given the address of the duchess's brother in New York City who will help Peppina become an American citizen.For safety's sake Peppina disguises herself as a boy like Shakespeare's Rosalind for the trip in which she stows aboard an ocean liner with her paisan buddy Beppo. Instead of cutting off her long tresses Peppina becomes a 'boy' by tucking her hair under a cap. In New York she easily finds work as a messenger 'boy' ... but she loses the address of her patroness's brother.SPOILERS COMING. This film's plot has many many MANY coincidences. In New York Peppina meets ... none other than the villain who snatched her in the first place. Seeking protection she asks for help from a handsome district attorney who turns out to be the duchess's brother. Mama mia!I give Mary Pickford credit here for one of her rare attempts at playing a sexually mature woman rather than the little girlcharacter who could always be relied upon to get the cash registers ringing in Mary's box office. Also this is one of Mary's rare attempts at an ethnic role. Her boy disguise is almost convincing ... though not quite as convincing as in 'Little Lord Fauntleroy' in which she played a biological male.Cesare Gravina is excellent in a supporting role. A fatal flaw is the casting of Mary's brother Jack as her peasant friend Beppo. Jack Pickford was an actor with decent looks but no talent whose career was entirely due to his sister's stardom. In the scenes between Mary and Jack Pickford their physical resemblance is quite obvious ... which is unfortunate here as their characters aren't meant to be siblings. And the plot of this movie is unbearable. I'll rate 'Peppina' one point out of 10. Marron'!".

Her brother Jack playing her thoughttobe brother Beppo is good in their scenes and Eugene O'Brien playing Love Interest for Miss Pickford gets through his scenes without embarrassing himself.

Gene Wilder was the star that was one more reason for me to see it as I had greatly enjoyed his performance in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein. Stuff like that attracted me much more than movies with Robert Redford or Charles Bronson who then were the big male heroes of the screen.Now a good 30 years later I watched Silver Streak a second time. It is an unusual mixture of comedy action thriller and disaster movie. Characters like the ones played by Wilder Clayburgh or Pryor seem to have become extinct  in the movies I mean. They just seem to be so ... ordinary and normal and also kind hearted. Everything about Silver Streak is so unpretentious seeing it today that really was a kind of a revelation to me.A lot of the movie deals with masculinity and the assertion of it. It all happens in a very relaxed manner. Nothing and nobody is taken too seriously conquests are made without effort failure is accepted with grace. In a strange way this movie really represents a better unattainable world. I doubt if someone like Gene Wilder wold make it as a movie star today  the public it seems needs the grimaces of Jim Carrey to be amused. Pity.Come to think of it in France they had a movie comedian who looked very similar to Wilder. His name was Pierre Richard and his fame reached its zenith at about the same time as Wilder's before fizzling out somewhere in the eighties when the Stallones and Schwarzeneggers took over.Silver Streak is an entertaining and  in a positive way  forgettable movie. It has a pleasant musical score by Henry Mancini this great eclecticist of the 20th century. The older I'm getting the more I enjoy his music and respect his enormous body of work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Silver Streak was released the very same year the Master of Suspense Sir Alfred Hitchcock released his blackcomedy swan song Family Plot. Though Hitch was in the very twilight of his long illustrious career his playful style was alive and well and well appropriated in Hollywood. The Master didn't make this movie  Canadian Arthur Love Story Hiller did  but the unmistakable fingerprints and shophewn template of Hitchcock's North By Northwest amongst other classics are in great display thanks to writer Colin Foul Play Higgins in the cheery breezy action comedy Silver Streak.Silver Streak is the first of four Gene Wilder  Richard Pryor matchups and certainly in retrospect one of the best. Wilder is an ordinary Joe taking the titular Amtrak train across country. In the midst of his journey he befriends and beds fellow passenger Jill An Unmarried Woman Clayburgh ends up witnessing a murder then is wrongly accused of the crime and is thrown off the train many many times in his pursuit to clear his name save the girl from a mysterious villain and get to the other side of the country.This is a very gentle but funny comedy that plays with the conventions of one of Hitch's favorite themes the mistaken identity of everyday man in extraordinary circumstances. Wilder is wonderful fitfully funny as usual and shines as both a romantic lead ! and does his patented crazy guy when things start falling apart. Just watching Wilder's eyes as he exasperatedly tries to explain out the fantastic plot he's wrapped up in to unbelieving characters along the way is one of the film's funniest simplest rewards.The film's masterstroke however is the addition of Richard Pryor as a parttime thief. Pryor was in the midst of a very hot career in 1976 and although this film seems to restrain some of the imagination and language of his stage presence and TV specials this is a PGrated movie after all he still creates an indelible extended 'cameo' that fuses film with a hip perfectly cool counterbalance to Wilder's mania and confusion. When Pryor is on screen he not only steals the film but also elevates this oldfashioned adventurecomedy concept to something otherwise original... and you can't take your eyes off the guy.Filmed all across his native Canada thanks IMDb for confirming this! director Hiller pulls this fun little audiencepleasing gem along the rails to a bright and exciting climax. The supporting cast is loaded with wonderful character actors including Patrick MacGoohan Ray My Favorite Martian Walston Ned Beatty and Scatman Crothers amongst others. A very luxurious and memorable score by Henry Mancini is the capper to this sparkling comedy perfect as a primer for and a loving compendium of many of the Hitchcock classics that wait for you to discover them on DVD VHS or on the tube.".

Unlike their later movies together this one isn't simply a buddy flick. Its also a romantic comedy thriller and nails every genre it aims for. It was written by Colin Higgins the guy who wrote Harold  Maude. He is a genius at witty dialog which is most apparent in the first act where Wilder meets Jill Clayburgh on a train the two get drunk and seduce one another. Despite the fact that no nudity is involved the sophisticated verbal exchanges between Wilder and Clayburgh and Henry Mancini's lovely theme combine to make for a really gorgeous love scene. Who would have thought Gene Wilder could be sexy?A very similar film and almost as good is Foul Play written and also directed by Colin Higgins in 1978. If you liked this one you should see that as well.".

She doesn't believe him and when he tries to look into it further he's chucked off the train as well...but alive.  He finds his way back to the train with the help of crackup wacko farm lady Benson.  More problems ensue when he catches up with Clayburgh as the killers reveal themselves.  Pryor is later thrown into the mix as a goodhearted thief who helps Wilder in his quest.  For 1976 this was pretty well advanced in terms of racey dialogue and stunts and still holds up nicely today.  The most memorable thing is Wilder's classic line when falling off the train.  Sadly you're reminded of the age of the film because of so many of the cast members that have died and how it makes you think that others probably aren't far off.  But it also makes you think of how great they all were as an ensemble that provided a good amount of laughs and suspense.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you like movies that are set on trains then this one will be up your street. It's one of the best train movies around and if you are a Gene Wilder fan then it's a real treat. Wilder and his brand of humor were no better than in this film. He was at his best in the 70's and early 80's to so all in all you can't go wrong with this great 70's classic. But that is not just it Richard Prior joins in about a third of the way through the film and Patrick McGoohan who revels in playing mysterious or devious characters is in his element as the the smooth but the cold and ruthless Roger Devereau who'll go to any length to get what he wants. Also for James Bond fans there is a small role for Clifton James playing a very similar character than he played in the Bond movies and also Richard Kiel who played one of Deveraux's heavies. The 7 foot actor would go onto play Jaws in two upcoming bond movies. Also in support are character actors Scatman Crowthers Ray Walston and Ned Beatty with Jill Clayburgh playing the heroin.Wilder plays George Caldwell an average Joe who has a dull job in publishing who decides to take Amtrax's Silver Streak from LA to Chicago so he can catch up with some paper work and reading. However he somehow finds himself involved in a romantic relationship after clicking with fellow passenger Hilly Burns but that's just for starters. While in Hilly's coach he sees a body being thrown from the train strangely enough it turns out to be Hilly's boss professor Schreiner who is traveling with her. Caldwell starts to investigate this but soon finds himself way in over his head and is unceremoniously thrown off the train because of his meddling. Fortunately he manages to reboard the train further down the line much to the surprise of Deveraux and co. He soon discovers that Deveraux also knows Hilly Burns but the most shocking discovery is that the professor is alive and well and none the worse for wear. Maybe he did have too much champaign that night perhaps it was the light playing tricks and he just imagined it? Then again why was he thrown from the train?There are more questions than answers here and Caldwell not going to be put off decides to continue his investigating now knowing that he has to be less brazen and more cautious than before. So this publisher who was looking for the quiet life now finds himself getting more than he bargained for as he gets involved in espionage and intrigue. Nobody appears to be who they say they are and in the end he puts himself in more hot water as things unravel. Another body turns up but this time Caldwell himself is implicated in the death so not only are Deveroux's men after him it turns out the police are too!Some would say that this is a spoof from a Hitchcock movie there are similarities from a couple of Hitchocks movies I would say that this is an adventure and not a spoof like AIRPLANE. It's more an adventure with the awkward and hapless George Caldwell. This type of performance was right up Wilder's street being at the same time up against the serious Patrick McGoohan this is why the film works! In the end everybody gets their just deserts and although the finale is somewhat predictable the last scenes are quite spectacular. Good entertainment all round great outdoor shots of the train and the surrounding country with an easygoing yet distinctive music score to boot. Not a bad watch at all!".

He visits Prof. Schreiner's cabin aboard the silver streak to see what he can uncover and is manhandled off the train by the beloved Jaws. Reace in this production. George manages to get himself back on the Silver Streak and tries to convince Hilly of the reality of her boss's death. But there seems to be a misunderstanding as Prof. Schreiner is there in his cabin seemingly fine and dandy.This is a really nice whodunnit with a delightful romance intrigue and lively comedic action with scenery and lovely cinematography.For me this movie is a bit reminiscent of Murder on the Orient Express. While Wilder's character is no Hercule Poirot there are some similar factors. It also contains the same serious but comedic effect found in Foul Play Chevy ChaseGoldie Hawn vehicle also written by Colin Higgins in which a man is murdered his body subsequently disappears and it is up to Goldie Hawn's character to puzzle out who the man was what happened and why. It also reminds one a bit of Seems Like Old Times another HawnChase collaboration. Gene Wilder is absolutely wonderful in this role. I honestly love each and every one of the productions in which he has starred from Death of a Salesman 1966 to The Lady in Question 1999. It is my opinion however that this is one of his best although Haunted Honeymoon is its superior.Wilder is a serious comic with no prattfalls and no stupid oneliners just intelligent witty and lovable dialog much of which is adlibbed and classic Wilder. His portrayals are genuine honest and forthright. You get the sense of knowing his characters which is a key element for any successful film. His honest portrayals make all of his characters believable familiar and lovable even when his character is a hapless schmuck.The introduction of Grover Pryor happens in a creatively unorthodox manner and once again George manages to get back on the Silver Streak this time with Grover in tow. Now with all remnants of the evil facade aside George begins to extract the answers he needs in order to fit the pieces together.This is an absolutely enjoyable production with a great cast turning in professional performances good strong dialog a coherent plot cohesive story line imaginative direction excellent scenery and brilliant casting.This movie receives a strong 8.410 from...the Fiend .".

I loved it in the theater when I was a lot younger and all the language the loudness and sexual innuendos didn't phase me in the slightest. I still can tolerate some of that if I know it's coming but NOT in a PG movie. I was shocked seeing this in the '90s and once again fooled by the PG label which included a lot of material that would bump it to a PG13 or R rating today.The duo of Wilder and Richard Pryor however always was a good one even if in retrospect they are a pretty sleazy team in a decade of films that was very irreverent. Wilder yelling S.O.B! all the time gets tiring too. He tended to play very loud abrasive characters. Did he think all of us were deaf in the theater. Check out Young Frankenstein with Wilder screaming throughout the film. Speaking also '70s irreverence Jill Clayburgh isn't exactly the girlnextdoor either. These '70s WilderPryor films were popular but not exactly high class stuff. The ending of this film is still spectacular with the big train crashing through the railroad station in Chicago. Also I still laugh each time Wilder gets thrown off the train. Still  for a PGrated film this a disgrace moralswise.".

Gierasch is on his way to a convention of art historians where he is about to deliver a speech that will discredit and disenfranchise another passenger Patrick McGoohan. So McGoohan and his goons simply shoot the professor in the head throw his body off the train and capture Jill Clayburgh with the intention of killing her later after she's been forced to put some effort into the service of their cause.Wilder takes passing notice of the professor's dead body as it drops past his window and seeks to solve the mystery. Richard Pryor is drawn into the story or rather hauled in by his ears. McGoohan and Goons finally wind up with the McGuffin but it's too late. The Feds have twigged. The story ends with the bad guys dead and a locomotive smashing through Chicago's Union Station but happily missing the waiting room on whose benches I've spent so many happy hours asleep and waiting for my next connection. I recommend the wonderful Greek restaurants a few blocks to the north. Avoid the taramasalata. If you find this recommendation useful note that I accept donations.  None of this story is to be taken seriously for a moment. It could have been lifted straight out of an inexpensive 1938 blackandwhite comic mystery with Bob Hope Chester Morris and Mantan Moreland somewhere in the cast. Only this is in gorgeous color more expensive and the humor is updated. Richard Pryor could be outrageous in his own relatively quiet selfdeprecating way and he was a fine mimic. Jill Clayburgh is very appealing  compellingly beautiful but in a goofy way that undercuts the conventions that sustain the illusion of perfection. She has a slight endearing lisp and her cheeks are tucked up just beneath her lower lids.Gene Wilder has a big head of fuzzy hair and his eyeballs seem ready to pop out on coiled springs like a Halloween mask. He's always either indignant or awed at the goingson around him. I enjoyed him most when he swore because the curses stand in such contrast to his meekness. Thrown off the train for the first time but not the last he climbs to his feet gestures wildly and shouts SON OF A ! He's very easy to identify with.Patrick McGoohan is not. Nobody could ever identify with Patrick McGoohan because nobody has ever been so unflappable  him and his serene blue eyes and his cracked incisive baritone. One of his Goons is Richard Kiel the ambulatory pituitary gland nine feet tall and sporting a mouth full of golden Chiclets.It's kind of silly but it's absorbing too because any viewer would want to see how the silliness turns out to be satisfying. Enjoyable and diverting. Kids who are old enough to appreciate say Bill Murray but who have outgrown Jerry Lewis should get a kick out of it.".

An average Joe played by Gene Wilder gets caught in the middle of criminal activities in this case murder and a milliondollar art fraud scheme. Similar fair include North By Northwest with Carey Grant and The Lady Vanishes starring Margaret Lockwood both directed by Alfred Hitchcock. George Caldwell Wilder in every sense a meek everyman who writes books on gardening is taking the Silver Streak train to Chicago to see his sister's wedding. He meets Hilly Jill Clayburgh a secretary to a brilliant art historian traveling in an adjacent train compartment and they end up having dinner together. They're spending a lovely evening in her train compartment when George sees a dead body fall outside the window. At first he thinks it's a hallucination and Hilly doesn't believe him. The next day George glances at the book by the art historian and realizes he's the man who was murdered. From there nothing goes as planned.Devereau played with sly subtlety by the incomparable Patrick McGoohan is engaged in an art heist of epic proportions. He's faked Rembrandts he's sold for millions but his jig has been discovered by the art professor who can prove the artworks are fake with authentic letters by Rembrandt. The art historian was on his way to Chicago for an art conference in which he was going to prove the Rembrandts were fakes which is why Devereau hatched the elaborate scheme to take him out. Devereau then needs the Rembrandt letters in order to destroy them thus ensuring his art fraud will be successful. In point of fact original letters by Rembrandt especially ones discussing his artworks would be worth millions nearly as much as any of his paintings. However now there's been a witness to the murder foiling Devereau's plans.After several confrontations with the baddies George ends up off the train and inadvertently befriends Grover Richard Pryor. After Grover believes George's story he's willing to help his white friend reboard the train but it's now being staked out by police and federal agents. Then Grover contrives a way for George to reboard the train without being discovered in one of the greatest comedic scenes ever shot on film. What makes the scene so outrageously funny is it how it taps into the gross stereotypes of race and yet it works on all levels and is not offensive. Apparently one aspect of the scene was changed from the original script at the request of Pryor and Wilder and the result is a perfectly acted and shot comedic scene which is both playful and telling. This alone is well worth the price of admission.Ultimately a fun actionmysterycomedy which takes it's self seriously enough that the viewer runs with it and the comedic moments never seem out of context. Both Wilder and Pryor developed a unique chemistry and they would work together in several subsequent films. Jill Clayburgh makes a wonderful woman in distress and McGoohan is perfect as a British godfather type. Some parts are a little bit dated and the final resolution was rather weak. Still the one scene with Wilder and Pryor is one of the great moments in cinema and makes an interesting yet inoffensive statement about race relations and perception.".

	schema:headline " A forgotten gem of the 70s!";
	schema:reviewBody "Although they did 4 films together it is this film SILVER STREAK 1976 that is probably my favorite pairing of the 2 famous comedy icons Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor! Also it is one of my personal favorite 70s movies. It is their first outing together and it is sublime from start to finish. A perfect mix of action comedy drama mystery and thriller and even a touch or romance it's one of those rare movies where every element works. Silver Streak stars the aforementioned Gene Wilder in probably my favorite ever role of his. Wilder plays George Caldwell a nebbishy magazine writer on a crosscountry train trip to Chicago trying to get to his sister's wedding. Once on board the first night George meets Hilly played with immense sex appeal and radiance by Jill Clayburgh. The duo hit it off immediately and as they are making love in Hilly's cabin George thinks he witnesses a man being thrown off the train. Hilly tries to convince that it's only in his mind. The morning after George sees a book on Rembrandt and on the back of it is the author Prof. Schreiner who Hilly is assistant to and who George recognizes as the man he thought he saw being murdered. George investigates and the mystery begins!During his investigation George meets several memorable characters a mysterious man named Devereau played with panache and class by Patrick McGoohan of 'The Prisoner' fame and his 2 cronies Whiney played by the great character actor Ray Walston and Reace played by the iconic Richard Kiel of Bond movie fame Rita played by vet Lucille Benson reprising her offbeat snakeladyinthemiddleof nowhere role from Duel travelling salesman Bob Sweet reliably played by vet Ned Beatty train conductor Ralston played with comic aplomb by the iconic Scatman Crothers country Sheriff Chauncey hilariously played by Clifton James reprising his bumpkin sheriff role from Live and Let Die and last but not least thief Grover essayed by the great Richard Pryor in a scenestealing role. George teams with Grover at about the film's halfway mark to finish solving the mystery and this where the WilderPryor chemistry begins.Much as I enjoy their zanier comedies I think it's here where Wilder and Pryor's chemistry shines the most. Not too OTT neither trying to upstage the other but rather complementing each other's rather opposing comedy styles to create a memorable pairing. Also Wilder and Clayburgh have great romantic chemistry with Clayburgh being at her absolute hottest in this film!Of course this is really Wilder's film all the way as he is the film's protagonist and is in virtually every scene of the film and we are following George's journey. Silver Streak is most probably reminiscent of the Hitchcock classic North by Northwest man falsely accused of murder on the run train action mistaken identity international intrigue but also there's the reminder of several James Bond films of the 70s with actors like Kiel and Clifton playing similar roles from those and of course is kind of a microcosm and preview of the buddycomedyaction film that would become so prevalent in the 80s. A memorable fun comedymystery from the 70s. Watch it you won't be disappointed!".

	schema:reviewBody "This crowdpleasing suspense comedy was chosen for a Royal Film Premiere in 1977 and marked the first  and best  teaming of Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. 'Silver Streak' was written by Colin Higgins author of the splendid 'Harold  Maude' and directed by Arthur Hiller responsible for  yuck  'Love Story'  also 1971 . Had it been made fifteen years earlier it most likely would have starred Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint or Grace Kelly. Wilder plays 'George Caldwell' a mildmannered book editor who boards the Silver Streak express in Los Angeles hoping for some peace and quiet. He does not get it. Firstly sexy secretary 'Hilly Burns'  the late Jill Clayburgh  gives him the come on and after they have made love he spots a dead man falling past his compartment window. Nobody believes him especially when the 'victim'  'Professor Schreiner'  Stefan Gierasch   turns out to be still alive. The Professor is in the possession of 'the Rembrandt letters' proving beyond a doubt that a major art swindle has taken place and that Roger Deveraux  Patrick McGoohan  is behind it. Schreiner has been murdered and replaced by an impostor. After finding evidence George is attacked by 'Reace'  Richard Kiel a year before menacing Roger Moore's 007 in 'The Spy Who Loved Me'  and thrown bodily from the train...'Silver Streak' goes through several stylistic changes of gear but they all work. The allusion to Hitchcock continues as George is suspected of having murdered federal agent 'Sweet'  Ned Beatty . Its about an hour into the picture when our hero steals a police car only to find smalltime thief 'Grover'  Pryor  is a passenger. Immediately they establish a comedic rapport becoming probably the screen's funniest comedy duo since Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Scenes like the one where George impersonates a black man in order to board the train would not probably have worked with anyone else. As international crook 'Devereau' McGoohan is both smooth and menacing  as one would expect . Another plus is Henry Mancini's music that opening theme will stick in your head for days afterwards.Higgins stayed in pseudoHitchcock territory for his next picture  which he directed  'Foul Play' starring Goldie Hawn Chevy Chase and Dudley Moore. Wilder and Pryor did a further four pictures together the best of which was 'Stir Crazy'  1981 . They reteamed with Hiller in 1989 for the dire 'See No Evil Hear No Evil'.Comedy adventure film love story disaster movie  'Silver Streak' is all these things and more. In some ways its the ultimate '70's movie.".

Silver Streak surpassed all assumptions and stands as my favorite film by the comedic duo. Amazing sound editing a compelling adventure and interesting and well developed characters are the key to make a great action film. Silver Streak has it all.I've never not found a Richard PryorGene Wilder film funny. They were one of the funniest comedic duos of all time. See No Evil Hear No Evil is my second favorite by them. Yeah it was corny and the plot wasn't too great but the plot of having one deaf guy and one blind guy as friends opened a world of possibilities. It was a funny film. Enough said. Another You would be my second favorite. Even though Pryor was sick and clearly not well it was still a great comedy. Stir Crazy is my least favorite of their work but even that still had it's funny moments. PryorWilder never got their big film break. But the four things they did were strong and deserving of more recognition.The plot George Caldwell Wilder is traveling on a train named Silver Streak from Los Angeles to Chicago. George meets an undeniably gorgeous woman named Hilly Clayburgh who is a secretary for her boss also aboard the train. The first night George witnesses Hilly's boss' corpse being thrown from the train. He freaks out and goes to his room the next morning to see if he is there to assure he saw what he thought.When asking to see the boss two goons throw George from the train. George gets lucky and hitches a ride from an old lady on a biplane back on the train. This starts a series of silly but funny encounters with danger and trouble.After being kicked off the train for a second time George meets Groover Muldoon Pryor a thief he finds in the back of a cop car he steals. The hilarity only picks up when Pryor and Wilder meet. Their lines are great their acts are welcome and they are not but a pleasure to see on screen.When it comes to comedic duos besides Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson Dante and Randal of Clerks Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder were one of the best. It's almost shocking to hear they weren't real life friends. If they were I think we would've seen a lot more films with them together. Another You released in 1993 was Wilder's last theatrical release. One of my wishes is to have him or Rick Moranis come back to do one more film. It'll never happen but one can always hope.The action in Silver Streak is the perfect balance. This is the kind of action film I love. Actioncomedy. Very few are done right but they are nothing but clean cut raw enjoyable entertainment when they are. The fact this is done right and has a great setting and a fantastic duo is just a match made in heaven.Silver Streak is a fast paced comedy that does pretty much everything right. Going into this with expectations a tad lower than average I was very surprised with the execution. If Gene Wilder came out of retirement to come back to films like this one right here it would be a dream.Starring Gene Wilder Jill Clayburgh and Richard Pryor. Directed by Arthur Hiller.".

The latter joke is way overdone but it's okay. The most likable human is the father played by Keith Carradine. The kids are somewhat spoiled but the little one the star Tina Majorino isn't bad.THE BAD  Too much typical Hollywood families in which 1 there is a stupid teen romance with a rebellious pouting female teen 2 the nasty foe who makes trouble for no apparent reason 3 the niceguy husband who gets unfairly blamed or is proved wrong in family affairs the Liberal mother always winning out.OVERALL  A little more of the seal and less of the teen girls and other annoying people would have made this a lot better.

The kids are somewhat spoiled but the little one the star Tina Majorino isn't bad.THE BAD  Too much typical Hollywood families in which 1 there is a stupid teen romance with a rebellious pouting female teen 2 the nasty foe who makes trouble for no apparent reason 3 the niceguy husband who gets unfairly blamed or is proved wrong in family affairs the Liberal mother always winning out.OVERALL  A little more of the seal and less of the teen girls and other annoying people would have made this a lot better. As it is one viewing was enough.";

The story of a seal and the family who takes him in is amazing all of the details which are added make it even better. All of the characters are interesting. The movie will make you laugh and cry but you'l'l be smiling all the way through. It makes you want to find a seal of your own if thats possible. The characters are people you will want to meet if not for their great personality then for your own amusement. When I have children I will show them this movie at least as many times as I have seen it. You should watch this movie it's my absolute favorite and you will definitely love it.".

The movie starts with a young girl marrying off a sparrow or some kind of birdand a chicken. it ENDS with the little girl giving up her pet at last and letting it live in the wild but Andre still returns. He made 24 trips home.  I loved the movie and i definitely recommend watching it.Spoiler time...It comes time in the movie that Toni finds out by mistake that the seal is going to be taken back to the wild. You see her in bed that night saying good night to her mom and crying exclaiming he's my best friend. we're best friends. you may find it odd that she would say this but Toni is shy and she doesn't have very many friends. I wouldn't say she's shy as does the movie reviews on the back of the case... but... well you'll see what i mean when you watch the movie yourself.Keep in mind that this story is about a fourthgrader not a fouryearold yet this little girl doesn't seem to have ever been separated or had a sleep over or anything. Until along comes Andre an orphaned seal. How was he orphaned? you'll see when you watch the movie. I highly recommend seeing the movie. it's one that isn't just for young but old people too.  i promise you'll love it.Another Little Note FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DO NOT REALIZE IT THIS MOVIE CANNOT AND I REPEAT CANNOT!!!

	schema:reviewBody "Andre is based on a true story about a seal who's mother died and is raised by a little girl called Toniplayed by Tina Marinjo and her father played by Keith Carradine and his wife played by Chelsea Field. Toni of course is a very shy girl who hasn't got any real friends and is bulled in school with some girl called Mary.Of course she meets Andre as her father brings him home because his land is in trouble and its to dangerous for him to be left in sea. So Andre becomes part of the family. But Toni's sister is jealous of Andre and hates him because he ruined her day as she was doing something in the festival and has boy trouble with a boy played by a very young Joshua Jackson from Dawson Creek. So will Andre get back to his own sea and go into the wild or will he be left at the Aquarium?Bottom line I own this on VHS since I was a little girl and I really enjoyed this movie.I seen it about 2 nights ago as I normally watch it every year once and I love animal movies anyway so if you love animals than check it out. The story is very endearing and heartwarming and the cast was great especially the girl Tina Majorino who was in Grey's Anatomy in 2013 for a few episodes. Also the backgrounds are nice too as the film is set in Maine New England.Overall its a 7. And if you haven't seen it yet than get it in Amazon at a reasonable price.".

There's a little bit of human drama involved but mostly it's the story of Andre and especially his relationship with young Toni Tina Majorino the youngest daughter of the family who develops a special bond with Andre who eventually ends up spending his winters in the Boston Aquarium and then returns to the family in Rockport every year until he dies of old age 24 years later. The story is basically told from Toni's perspective.It's a fine family film. Most of the cast aren't especially well known but that's fine because the star of the movie is really Andre. It's a movie you can sit down and watch with your kids for an enjoyable evening at home. Nothing more than that  but sometimes that's quite enough. 710".

I like this film because I'm an animal lover and this film is filled with animals.Andre is about a little girl Toni Whitney played by Tina Majorina who lives with her parents Harry and Thalice played by Shane Meier and Chelsea Field her sister Paula played by Aidan Pendleton and her brother Steve played by Keith Carradine. They have an assortment of animals and decide to adopt an orphaned baby seal that that they name Andre. Andre lives with the Whitney's for a few years until a man from the health department shows up and wants to take Andre away!My favorite character in this film is Toni's mother Thalice. I like Thalice because she is very loving toward her kids yet also knows how to discipline them. My favorite scene in this movie is when Andre learns funny tricks and performs them for people on the pier. I like this scene because Andre is so cute and fun. An interesting fact is that Andre is played by a sea lion not a seal in the movie.Andre is directed by George Miller and produced by Annette Handley. The music in this film sets the mood. The movie is filmed in a beautiful harbor in Rockport Maine and I especially love the cinematography when the seasons change. This movie is a tearjerker and Toni learns that despite how much she loves Andre she may have to let him go. This is a familyfriendly movie and I recommend it to people of all ages. I give this film fiveoutof five stars because I thought that the movie was really welldone overall and had a great plot. I am pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this movie so much because the picture on the cover made me think that it would appeal to a younger audience.".

The cinematography is beautiful the scenery is magical and the music is lovely.What makes Andre though is the seal Andre played in reallife by a sealion. Andre is one lovable character he is so cute endearing and funny. His scenes with Majorino were very touching and he just steals the film from everybody else with effortless ease. Overall a very sweet but enjoyable family fare and I just want to add I noticed no ripoff of anything then again I am not as observant as some people. 710 Bethany Cox".

The cinematography is beautiful the scenery is magical and the music is lovely.What makes Andre though is the seal Andre played in reallife by a sealion. Andre is one lovable character he is so cute endearing and funny. His scenes with Majorino were very touching and he just steals the film from everybody else with effortless ease. Overall a very sweet but enjoyable family fare and I just want to add I noticed no ripoff of anything then again I am not as observant as some people. 710 Bethany Cox";

On the positive side it had all the elements that one would expect and possibly enjoy in any romantic comedy. In addition Helen Hunt did a spectacular job in a quite average role with her acting basically providing the highlight of the movie. However the film lacked good characterization and character believability. Clifford is forced to choose between the dumb blonde but beautiful Amanda and the perfectly balanced and pleasant Clare. As it becomes overwhelmingly obvious that Amanda is just a complete flake it becomes less believable that Clifford has truly failed to realize this fact and that he will continue to adore her without acknowledging her flaws. In addition Amanda's character is so over the top one wonders if she is anything more than a stereotype even in the eyes of the author. And if so how are we expected to believe that Clifford will time and again return to her? I was additionally disappointed with the setting  an anonymous Caribbean resort that could have been beautiful but instead struck me as simply washed out. There are many superior romantic comedies you could watch with the same basic plot but better acting settings and characterization. I would recommend skipping this one unless you are a huge Helen Hunt fan an unashamed chick flick aficionado or just simply don't care about good quality characterization.".

He has teamed up with Vanessa Kensington to stop the evil Dr. Evil who was also frozen in the past. Dr. Evil stole a nuclear weapon and is demanding a payment of when he realises its the 90's 100 billion dollars.

	schema:reviewBody "In a time when we are almost constantly barraged with goofy spoof films it's amazing that no one had come out with a spoof of the James Bond films until 1997. Those movies have been coming out and just BEGGING to be spoofed since the early 60s and Mike Meyers is the one who finally steps forward to do what simply has to be done and he does a wonderful job at it.Fans of the James Bond films will have a blast looking for all of the allusions to the old Bond films and trying to determine which Bond film is being spoofed at any given time but it's important to keep in mind that the film pokes fun at the Bond series in good taste. Austin Powers International Man of Mystery is never disrespectful to the films that it makes fun of which is probably the single most important thing about a spoof film that makes it good. This is why the Scary Movies as just a couple of examples were such dismal hideous failures. They try to be funny by viciously making fun of all kinds of movies and end up looking stupid because they have such a nonexistent right to do that. You can't make a stupid stupid movie and make fun of a lot of great movies and some not so great admittedly and try to pretend to be respectable at the end of it all. That's the recipe for a crapfest.While it's true that a lot of the comedy in the first Austin Powers film is slapstick and obviously contrived I think it should be a testament to the quality of the film that it is still so funny! We see all of the traditional Bond clichs in this movie such as the usual oneliners which are made fun of extensively and with spectacular effect here the fancy cars the goofy cockiness the teethgrinding theme song and the occasionally inexplicable popularity with the women this allusion makes most sense when compared to those Bond films that starred Roger Moore.The plot involves a rivalry between Dr. Evil an evil mastermind bent on world domination and Austin Powers a mockish caricature of James Bond bent on stopping Dr. Evil's world domination schemes. Meyers portrays both characters with hilarious skill making Austin an awkward womanizer with some serious dental problems and Dr. Evil an evil schemer with a hilarious cutesy side. Neither character really seems like they belong in the role that they serve as a spy and a doctor of evil which is where a lot of the comedy comes in. There is also of course the fact that they both spend most of the movie 30 years in their future completely out of touch with the new world that they live in.This is not a movie to be taken seriously and quite frankly I can't understand all of these reviews that I've read on the IMDb that are constantly complaining that Austin Powers is so cheesy or so childish. I've heard this same complaint about lots of other movies that are also not meant to be taken seriously but this one is especially confusing. I trust that all you people complaining about how childish Austin Powers is realize that it is a spoof based on a whole series of movies that are also not meant to be taken seriously right? I mean that would be a hell of an oversight to miss that little detail. Austin Powers is one of the most refreshing comedies to come along in years and it's sad that there are so many people who completely missed the boat on this one just because they pretend that the movie is something that it's not and was never meant to be. It's true that the movie is immensely immature and that it has unfortunately little rewatch value one of the biggest problems with the film but the quality of the comedy is unmistakable.".

I was a Mike Myers fan but AUSTIN POWERS INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY looked like the stupidest and least creative movie of the year. But after hearing of a few of the hilarious scenes of the movie I decided to test my faith in Myers and give it a try. It turned out to be one of the funniest movies I'd seen in a long time.The swinging hipster from the 60's Austin Powers Mike Myers puts himself in deep freeze for thirty years to pursue his archenemy Dr. Evil Mike Myers. He is thawed out in the 90's when Dr. Evil finally reappears and plans to drill a missile to the center of the earth and destroy the planet core and then the world. Austin Powers with the help of his true love Vanessa Kensington Elizabeth Hurley must find a way to stop Dr. Evil and shag Vanessa. But Dr. Evil has some very dangerous customers working for him such as Number Two Robert Wagner Frau Farbissina Mindy Sterling Mustafa Will Ferrell and his son Scott Evil Seth Green who thinks his father should just kill Austin rather than make a complicated plan to get rid of him.The plot of this movie is a big spoof of movies such as the JAMES BOND films so it's not expected to be anything but funny which it certainly is. Don't listen to people who say this is for middleschool kids people of all ages can enjoy this movie. It should also be said that Dr. Evil is a terrific character because in addition to being very funny is the stereotype spymovie bad guy.The acting in this movie is pretty good. Mike Myers plays both Austin Power and Dr. Evil two very different characters very well. Elizabeth Hurley does a very good job as Austin's girlfriend. Both Seth Green who I think has a long successful career ahead of him and Mindy Sterling are very funny. Robert Wagner and Michael York two Hollywood veterans do good jobs with the small parts they have. Will Farrell is underplayed in this movie but it very funny in the scene he is in. The Fembots by the way are terrific.This movie is destined to become a movie classic and Yeah baby! will be a catch phrase that will be remembered years from now. Austin Power and Dr. Evil are both stereotype symbols of past movies. Basically these two guys are symbols of American film at least for that particular genre. Don't expect much out of this movie except for a good laugh and a good time and you won't be disappointed.".

I think everyone could say that they laughed at least once to this film.Paroding of the James Bond flicks Austin Powers is an international spy who is a lady's man. Dr. Evil is Arch Nemesis goes into the future of 1997 and now Austin must travel through time to find him. When he gets to 1997 he has a beautiful assistant Vanessa who happens to be the daughter of his former flame in the 60's. Vanessa resists Austin's charm and wants to stick to business while Austin is wasting no time to get to his business with her. Dr. Evil learns that he has a son Scott played by Seth Green. When Scott isn't as excited to have Dr. Evil as a father Dr. Evil tries anything he can to get Scott to love him including a hilarious scene in a counseling group for father's and son's. But back into action Austin must find Dr. Evil before he rules the world with his kitty Mr. Bigglesworth. But can he do that and have Vanessa at the same time? You'll just have to see! My favorite characters that worked so well together was without a doubt Seth and Mike as Dr. Evil and Scott. They are just beyond hilarious and work so well together. I think a lot of the other Austin Powers fans would agree. There first scene together meeting is just really funny Give Daddy a hug! I'm down with the kids ducka ducka ducka! No! Get away from me you psycho!. Classic! Like I said Austin Powers is just a great and funny movie that I think you can get into if you're looking for a decent comedy. Come on! We still say Yeah baby! to this very day after all! Let's give Mike some credit here! 810".

Get away from me you psycho!. Classic! Like I said Austin Powers is just a great and funny movie that I think you can get into if you're looking for a decent comedy. Come on! We still say Yeah baby! to this very day after all! Let's give Mike some credit here! 810";

This is the best thing to watch if you've seen a typical bythenumbers Bond movie one of the old ones for example and thought it was ridiculous or at the very least something other than great. The plot is directly spoofing the old Bond movies with an evil villain trying to take over the world. The acting is pretty good for a spoof movie the characters are mostly caricatures and stereotypes to further parody the Bond movies but they add to the humor of the film. Mike Myers is great in this movie pretty much anyone who likes him will probably enjoy him in this. I loved how it was spoofing the Bond movies sometimes even mentioning the ludicrousness of the characters actions in details. If you're into 60's stereotypes crude sexual humor and some great Bondspoof action you'll most likely enjoy this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys spoof movies and who's seen at least one Bond movie and thought it was a bit ridiculous. It's filled to the brink with crude sexual innuendo and Bondspoofing. 810".

	schema:headline " Dirty funny spoof if you're in the mood";
	schema:reviewBody "In the 1960's Austin Powers is one of the UK's best secret agents. He  works as an international playboy who also fights international  terrorists. However when Dr Evil tries fails to kill him Dr Evil  escapes into space where he is frozen until a time when he can return.  Austin Powers also freezes himself to be defrosted later. In the late  90's Dr Evil returns to wreck havoc on the world and only a defrosted  Powers can stop him  if he can adapt to the new world order.  Mike Myers is very much an acquired taste but he did seem to hit it big  with this series of films. The original film set the tone with not very  basic jokes but certainly plenty of crude ones. The main film is split  between a fish out of water film with Austin trying to come to terms  with the 90's and also a James Bond spoof with Dr Evil as a more  frustrated Bond baddie complete with cat and bald head. The fish out  of water stuff works well as Austin is a funny swinger and the 60's  stuff is cool however the best bits for me all relate to Dr Evil   whether it be his relationship with his son or the asides where the see  the consequences of the death of his henchmen. The spoof on Bond movies  gets the best laughs from me.  Myers is good in both roles and clearly has fun with both. Hurley is OK  but a bit wooden as Vanessa while Robert Wagner is good as number one.  Michael York whoooooo? is good as control and there are some good  cameos  Rob Lowe is funny but I still don't understand why the whole  Christian Slater bit was put in the final cut?!  Overall it may be rude and slightly crude in places but there's still  plenty to enjoy. It's 90 minutes long but it's very funny and rushes  by. You may not remember much of the plot but at least you go away  chuckling.".

That's why the raunchy Austin Powers International Man of Mystery' was so popular upon its release. It accomplished its mission of successfully spoofing the James Bond phenomenon in almost every way. The two sequels didn't do quite as well but I was quite pleased with the second film especially.Saturday Night Live' veteran Mike Myers plays Austin Powers a groovy British spy in the swingin' sixties. 1967 to be exact. His looks resemble the orangutanmeetshuman look that British are stereotyped with and his clothes are fresh outta' 60's London.Mike Myers also plays Dr. Evil Powers' archnemesis.

It is probably the best spy spoof to emerge out of Hollywood for years. One of the most interesting aspects is that it does not spoof James Bond film as openly as one might expect there are tiny minute details that you only pick up on after multiple viewing. I really expected every other gag to be a satire on Bond films but alas! They were not! Yes the film is a spoof on Bond but not to a sick extreme. Just minute things that audiences may  or may not  pick up on depending on how knowledgeable they are on the Bond movies.Powers is of course a spoof on James Bond. He's sexobsessed like Bond but does not come across with the same coolness and ease of James Bond. At least not in the nineties anyway.Dr. Evil is a spoof on Blofield Bond's archnemesis from the Bond films. He is shrouded in mystery and when revealed boasts a bald head a big crooked nose and a cat like Blofield's which is unfortunately naked  without fur  because it didn't thaw out so well in the Big Boy rocket.Number 2 is a spoof on.well.Number 2 from Thunderball'  from the name to the eye patch which I only picked up on after viewing Thunderball' recently.There are some very clever scenes in Austin Powers.' Some of the gags spoof the spy genre very easily. Others fall flat mainly because they try to get the audience to be sickened. Yes the film needs to be raunchy to a certain degree  it is a Bond spoof  but they went a bit OTT on some of the jokes the whole Jacuzzi scene got a bit prolonged..Perhaps the greatest thing about this film is that it is not directly geared towards Bond geeks. We've seen satires that were targeted at a small audience range  like Galaxy Quest.' I really disliked the film the first time I saw it because I do not watch Star Trek'  but on second viewing I found it to be a clever satire on the Trekkies and equally so on the television show. I guess if I saw the film I would have enjoyed it more the first  and probably second  time. It was a good comedy but if they had not geared it towards such a small range of audience I feel they would have received more of a response to the film.But the exact opposite is the case with Powers.' Bond geeks and regular moviegoers alike can enjoy this film. It brings two very different audiences together  they may laugh at different things but they are still laughing together.Perhaps that is the film's biggest achievement. Sadly it is its most overlooked as well. I think that many people don't really understand WHY they like the film so much. I've heard people say Why do you like the film so much?' and the other person will say Well.umm.gee I just do.' They themselves know the jokes are not always the greatest. Many of the gags DO fall short.But deep down they know that the cleverness of the film is what makes them like it so much  and they are either subconsciously afraid to admit that or literally don't know how to.Be warned Powers' is not a film for everyone. If you don't like raunchy laughs I wouldn't recommend it. But if you want to see a clever parody of the spy genre  well I might as well say it a clever parody of the James Bond genre let's face it  there's no such thing as a spy genre anymore  James Bond has its own genre  then I would recommend Powers.'

I never went to see the flick and then when it became a pop culture phenomenon I didn't really feel like seeing it. Heck since it was around everywhere and everyone thought they had an Austin Powers impersonation I felt like I'd already seen it by extension. A few years ago I managed to catch it on a bus trip but I must've fallen asleep or was too busy talking because a lot of the movie felt unfamiliar. So this is a review from someone watching it in full for the first time a few days ago.Which is a bit unfair to the film since it was such a huge part of pop culture when it came out there's no way to view it unbiasedly now. To use the horribly tired phrase this movie is so 1997. Like the title hero and his nemesis it's practically frozen in time itself and watching it brings you back to the horrible time when everyone was saying shagadelic baby or one million dollars. shudder So jokes that may have made me laugh were I to have seen it when it first came out make me roll my eyes now. I've seen so many clips of this flick that the jokes are already old. But the thing is I'm not sure if they would've been that great anyway. Mike Myers' style is to push a joke two or three or four or five beats past it being funny in the hope that the pushing of the joke itself will be funny. It's a knowing wink to the audience that has made him a very successful man but got old with me around the time of Wayne's World.In fact pretty much all of Austin Powers' shtick got old for me very quickly. Like many films from Saturday Night Live clever comedic premises like the James Bond of the swingingsixties parody that would or have worked great in five minute segments fail to connect for a feature length film. The jokes are pretty obvious and juvenile bodily humour jokes that I've never really enjoyed well not since making noises with my underarms stopped being the height of comedic genius. The parody of the film is clever but the jokes fall flat.Well I should say that most of the jokes fall flat. While Austin Powers himself does little for me I do find Myers other character in the film Dr. Evil to be quite funny most of the time. Dr. Evil saved the movie for me I loved his outdated plans for world conquest I loved his interactions with his son Scott Seth Green and loved the scene where he and Scott go to group therapy. That all made me laugh even though I knew of most of the scenes.But he wasn't funny enough for me to give the flick a passing grade. Again who knows if I had caught the movie back when it meant something I may have thought more of it. But that speaks to the staying power of the film which is to say that there isn't much.".

Not to be outdone British Intelligence cryogenically freezes Austin Powers because he's the only man capable of dealing with Evil in their service.Both men have to adapt to a culture shock. Doctor Evil has mixed feelings about the test tube baby son he fathered in Seth Green. As for Powers he's not quite fathoming the fact that his Emma Peel like partner Mimi Rogers from back in the day has a daughter in Elizabeth Hurley doing her bit in the family spy business.Michael York as the M character and Powers boss and Robert Wagner as Number 2 in the Evil Empire both look like they're having a really good time hamming up their parts. There's also a nice unbilled part by Tom Arnold as a cowboy in the men's room with Powers when one of the Evil assassins tries to get him.A lot of good laughs in this first Austin Powers film I do so hope Mike Myers does make still another one.".

As for Powers he's not quite fathoming the fact that his Emma Peel like partner Mimi Rogers from back in the day has a daughter in Elizabeth Hurley doing her bit in the family spy business.Michael York as the M character and Powers boss and Robert Wagner as Number 2 in the Evil Empire both look like they're having a really good time hamming up their parts. There's also a nice unbilled part by Tom Arnold as a cowboy in the men's room with Powers when one of the Evil assassins tries to get him.A lot of good laughs in this first Austin Powers film I do so hope Mike Myers does make still another one.";

	schema:headline " Neat blas comedy which gets the little things right on top of being a fun energetic experience.";
	schema:reviewBody "The humour at the centre of Austin Powers revolves around the stupidity of its two predominant characters that is to say its eponymous hero and scheming chief villain. Neither character possess the requisite cans one needs to make up a six pack and yet in this film's mixed up universe both of them have attained somewhat of a powerful position and the top of their respective fields. The pair both of whom are depicted with ample relish by Mike Myers embody a string of physical western traits often synonymous with fictitious heroes and villains but with boundaries blurred in regards to their emotional states. In Austin Powers the idea of the heroic cultural icon who makes friends easily and exudes patriotism via his sports car decked out in the Union Jack is cruelly undercut by distorted facial features and rampaging nymphomania. Likewise his arch nemesis Dr. Evil is hideously hunched scarred and intent on world domination  yet melts when he realises he possesses offspring. The pair of them are complete idiots and they go about their business incompetently and badly  Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot.Jay Roach's 1997 film is an amusing spoof one which predominantly targets that of the spy thriller more specifically the James Bond franchise although Powers himself resembles Michal Caine's Harry Palmer another lead from a British spy series of the 1960s. It remembers that getting the narrative right in these sorts of things is just as important as sending up as much visual material as possible. The tone and excessive use of the voiceover in something like The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad! are as important to the comedy as anything visually amusing in that film. Likewise with 2009's Black Dynamite wherein a narrative regarding the death of the lead's brother and the ridiculously complicated plot to do a governmental drug coverup was just as crucial in its homage to poorly constructed grindhouse of the 1970s as anything else.It isn't a wellkept secret that at the worst of times stories in James Bond movies have often been derivative and simplistic. Bond movies are in spite of their prestigious reputation and huge budgets often mere Bmovies dressed up as Amovies. Powers depicts a madman looking to erupt each and every volcano in the world for profitable means something not too far removed from a Bond villain's idea but here played with the sort of happy absurd energy often missing from a Bond film out of that fact if they don't play that for grimaces they're going to look quite silly. The film begins in the 1960s and our resident lead's superiority over all whom attempt to vanquish him is reiterated by Dr. Evil in his conversing with several of the world's lead assassins a ragtag bunch of Arabs Latin Americans and paraplegics  none of whom have been so far able to kill Powers. Powers himself is a man introduced to us with his own exuberant song and dance number on a London street a street so free of anything wrongful or nasty you'd think they were paved with gold had there not been so many instances of a midshot being applied.After a skirmish at a local nightspot Evil decides to freeze himself so that he may wreak havoc and chaos in the future Powers additionally so in order to be able to thwart the man  the plot is essentially Demolition Man. Social issues arise when both men are thawed in 1997 as life in each of the respective decades for the film's lead is pointed out as being very different. While far from a deeply engaging social critique of attitudes towards sexuality and communication there is a timely sense of realisation during a montage whereby Powers learns of this newfound decade whereby everything he stood for in the past speech attitudes and even finger gestures have effectively been rendered irrelevant. These scenes might very well be the film's best. On one hand the film has things the wrong way around people are far more prone to easy anonymous sex in the present day when compared to forty years ago where chaste attitudes were encouraged and people often subscribed to it. Furthermore the sort of dialogue synonymous with Powers in the 60's would be far better suited to this incumbent climate where the ongoing rape of the English language in the form of abbreviations and acronyms makingdo for words is the norm.Unfortunately the film pulls its punches on any social scientific study in regards to the streets of London where marching bands warm smiles cars decked out in the national colours and dance numbers have seemingly been replaced by swathes of immigrants that has rendered parts of the city as unBritish as possible. The film itself is riddled with childish humour and inert remarks but so what? Powers acts like a maniac in regards to sexual interaction but resists taking advantage of women when they're drunk and is visibly nervous even frightened when the silhouette of a seductive young woman nude dominates his field of vision. My favourite scenes take place at the card table wherein Powers loses a hand of blackjack with a five following a mean exchange with a baddie and double takes when he hears Alotta Fagina's name for the first time. The film isn't smart but it's smart enough it knows its limits and never oversteps the mark it's colourful and loud but never aggressive. There is a competent madness to International Man of Mystery and it's quite hard not to enjoy.".

Other differences with most spoofs are that this film has a quite subtle form of humor unlike for instance Scary Movie and that this film does not get toot crazy and 'over the top' with it's jokes like Hot Shots and any Leslie Nielsen film. This spoof actually gets you involved in the characters and the story and never produces an awkward moment when a joke falls flat which does not even happen if I remember it right for myself. All of this is the achievement of the great cast and the director who also did a splendid job not to mention the casting people who provided the necessary' eye candy. International man of mystery is a good film in it's genre spyadelic spoof but no overall classic.7 out of 10P.S. Next week I'll comment on The Spy who Shagged me".

	schema:reviewBody "What a great premise 1960s hero and arch villain both frozen then unfrozen after thirty years to resume their global fight for power. A satire of the James Bond series Austin Powers ... played by Mike Myers is a real disappointment. I laughed a couple of times. Otherwise I endured the crude gags stilted gimmicks and the repellent character of Powers with that grimaced smile and those ugly teeth.The problem here is the writing. The script just isn't funny. The humor is all forced. And there's a lot of missed opportunities. For example Austin opens up a laptop a device that wasn't available in the 1960s. Yet he has no problem using it to chatter with Number Two Robert Wagner. What an ideal setup for some laughs about changes in technology. But no the script passes over this opportunity for some real comparisons to the 60s. Instead we get way too much time spent on Porky's style bathroom humor that has nothing to do with cultural changes.The film is certainly colorful as was the style for much of the latter half of the 1960s. Cinematography dazzles with flashy glitzy glittering visuals. But for what purpose? Probably the best element is the music. At least they brought back a couple of pop songs from the 60s. And the score is quite reminiscent of the earlier era.Casting is what it is. If you like Mike Myers you'll no doubt like the film since Austin Powers ... is basically a Mike Myers vehicle. Otherwise the casting is largely irrelevant. Performances beyond Myers' silliness are neither good nor bad since they're all exaggerated.I had hoped for humor that was more natural more organic and some clever comparisons to the 1960s. I got neither. This film is a blunt inyourface cinematic example of shallow puerile trashy insignificance that I suppose Mike Myers has become known for. Too bad.".

Somebody which was an expert on the subject put us off by stating we needed a lot of timefull dedication and financial resources to do that. We had none of that and gave up but I always had in my mind a film about Heleno. And this I can say This film came out much better than what I had in mind. Most important point I dreamed about a film showing a lot of the football game itself and I learned with time that although a game in real life is one of the most exciting feelings you will ever experience it does not work the same way in a movie. And the film Heleno shows everything else so well Heleno 's character above all which did not combine with the rest of the team too individualistic. His womanizing he had it all fame and beauty. And above all how glory comes to people at certain moments and some cannot accept that it is not eternal. A great film showing so well the Rio of the 40s in great black and white cinematography.".

By the fourth time I was able to view it more objectively specifically to see if there were not enough soccer scenes. The balance of scenes on and off the pitch is about right but I agree with others that more soccer would be better. The contrast of black and white gave the film an edginess not possible with color. The photographs at the end contributed to the overall balance of emotion. Rodrigo Santoro was unbelievably superb and the actresses Aline Moraes and Angie Cepeda complemented him well. Would we like to see more of him playing soccer? Sure in another movie or as an added feature on the Heleno DVD. I recommend all of Santoro's films.".

	schema:reviewBody "The downfall of the great Italian cult cinema was largely caused by an endless stream of hopelessly inept SciFiaction flicks during the second half of the 1980s. These were shameless imitations of blockbuster hits like The Terminator Blade Runner Robocop Rambo or Predator but unlike during the seventies or early eighties the Italians somehow became uninspired lazy and exaggeratedly amateurish so that their once glorious ripoffs suddenly became pathetic lowbudget flicks that almost were almost instantly exiled to the lowest shelves of insolvent video stores! True story I assure you and CY Warrior is the prototypic example of this sad trend. This was supposed to be a fun and exhilarating The TerminatorRobocop ripoff but due to the imbecilic script and unimaginably clumsy postproduction work it turned out to be a B movie disaster that even soiled the career of the great Henry Silva. Blond poster boy Frank Zagarino stars as a hitech and secretly developed cyborg that escapes from his freezer on a military research vessel. The US government promptly sends out a team of soldiers to destroy him led by the sadist Hammer Silva who doesn't mind using heavy artillery in places crowded with innocent civilians and making lots of collateral damage. The incredibly annoying teenage kid Brandon discovers the wounded cyborg in the woods and takes it back home to his 18year old sister Susan. Instead of wondering what the hell a cyborg is doing in their living room they teach him how to eat hamburgers by the way this has got to be the single most retarded sequence of the entire eighties how to shop for ugly clothes and  of course  how to dance! The girl naturally also falls more or less in love with the cyborg and repeatedly states that she  and I quote  keeps forgetting that he isn't a real human being. Personally I find that rather impossible to believe especially since the cyborg makes a conspicuous mechanical noise every single time he turns his head. So we are to believe that he is a stateoftheart piece of intelligent engineering whose stomach is even adapted to processing actual food but somehow they can't make his head move in silence. Meanwhile Henry Silva keeps annihilating innocent bystanders and shouting I don't give a good God damn! The shootout sequences are pretty tame and there's a shortage of gore with the exception of a blatant imitation of a famous Terminator scene where the cyborg fixes the burning wounds on its own face. Writerdirector Giannetto De Rossi delivered fantastic work as principal makeup artist for the films of Lucio Fulci The Beyond Zombie 2 and other acclaimed horror directors but perhaps he shouldn't have moved to the director's chair himself. In short if you're looking for a Bmovie disaster with laughable stunts horrendous English dubbing and an absolutely retarded melodramatic climax I highly recommend CY Warrior.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes it's terrible but what sort of terrible is it? I'd say it's a stupid sort of terrible instead of an inept sort. FX genius De Rossi does quite a good job for a first time director it's just that as is on occasion with Eurocult clean cut visual execution is completely soiled by a godawful English dub. Same thing with frequent Rossi collaborator Lucio Fulci's Contraband. Everyone sounds as robotic as the lead especially poor Henry Silva who is visually doing a better job then what's coming out his mouth is suggesting like the angry American tourettes suffering cousin of HAL. What doesn't help as well is that cowriter Sacchetti whose blackly witty and pessimistic signature is all over this dog of a screenplay is clearly writing beneath himself. Obviously trying to appeal to the American market as the dying Italian film industry of the day had no choice but to he and Rossi the other cowriter attempt to craft some cyberfolk tale ala Terminator that is just too progressive and sentimental a narrative for their post Red Brigade Roman sensibilities to grasp. What we end up with is inane humour and clich plot points. The best thing the two get away with is a comment on civilian slaughter by American sanctioned troops such like Vietnam and Reagan's Contra cocaine cowboys. Besides that the story belongs more in a kids TV special than an ItaliaExploitation piece. The ending though is quite effective in its pathos. Thankfully as those who are aware of Rossi's work from Ferox and Zombi 2 would expect the FX on Cy are quite good. There's also the trademark scenes of carnage that typify Italian action a half decent score and also moments of obscene awkward badness to guide you comfortably enough to the 90 minute mark. Overall though CYWarrior Special Combat Unit is a bit of Ed Wood a bit of Bruno Mattei a bit of Rossi's own Fulci inspired lunacy and is a worthwhile 'bad' movie to enjoy with friends.".

It isn't. Based on the cover art and posters I saw online I figured I was in for another bizarre Italian action flick with Frank Zagarino playing an unstoppable cyborg in the lead. However the biggest surprise for me was that this is in fact NOT AN ACTION MOVIE. It's more of a lighthearted kid's film with very little action though the violence would probably be a bit much for kids.Basically we have a young boy finding an escaped cyborg as he flees his government creators and the boy decides to take him in. The boy's dubbed voice is  I believe  the same actoractress who voiced Tommy in 'Pod People' coincidentally. Along with the boy's older sister they teach the cyborg what it is to be human and help him start a new life away from corrupt government agents. Henry Silva plays the main bad guy. I loved him in 'Above the Law' so it was fun to see him in something else.There is a bit of a shootemup ending but it's nothing special. Other than that the film was largely forgettable. EXCEPT FOR The ending. I'm not going to spoil anything but I WAS NOT expecting the ending we were given. It truly was... Well... Touching and endearing. No joke. I found myself strangely moved and surprised that this type of film could find such a sincere note to end on.While 'CyWarrior' is by no means a classic it's worth checking out if you're into the genre.".

The characters are stereotypical they act as badly as possible it's pathetic special effects suck bad and are superfluous too. Believe me watching Cyborg guerriero d'acciaio the original title is more painful than watching Turkish Star Wars or some productions from India because while most of those hilarious films seem directed by Borat this one lacks even such a questionable bonus. Everything seems spoiled on purpose like in The lost skeleton of Cadavra but isn't. It is just the ultimate apotheosis of idiocy bad taste lack of ideas exploitation crappy acting no budget and shamelessness .

	schema:headline " It will grow on you";
	schema:reviewBody "I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Still I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo but upon further investigation they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel  or was it a broom  was so sidesplittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. I own a copy of this film too The Coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany you will always find that in some strange way they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.This film has everything in it from a jail break crooked southern politicians muses references to what I can only assume are historical figures riverside baptisms bank robberies violence towards animals singing flocks of religious fanatics KKK lynch mobs and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey in here as well but I wouldn't know that because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spooflike quality towards it makes the film that much better. Well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it I can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. There were times when again as is usual for a Coen film I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughing but I was.This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.I like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscemi but that is a different story all together. But back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.Now after heaping all this praise on the film let me just say this as well. I didn't really enjoy the film at first. I found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. But then the film began to grow on me. It took a while but it did grow on me. I don't think this is their best film but it is still a good one and I am giving it a 8.5. But the reason that I do recommend this film is for one reason only.Every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself seen it seen it oh seen it last year that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. Most films have been recycled in some form or another. Not the Coen's films. They have not been recycled and if they have I don't know about it. That is reason enough to see something that they put out. Originality counts for a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that is not common in todays cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. Because you don't get vision like this in many films so when you do enjoy it!".

	onyx:emotionText "I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Still I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo but upon further investigation they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel  or was it a broom  was so sidesplittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. I own a copy of this film too The Coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany you will always find that in some strange way they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.This film has everything in it from a jail break crooked southern politicians muses references to what I can only assume are historical figures riverside baptisms bank robberies violence towards animals singing flocks of religious fanatics KKK lynch mobs and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey in here as well but I wouldn't know that because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spooflike quality towards it makes the film that much better. Well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it I can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. There were times when again as is usual for a Coen film I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughing but I was.This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.I like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscemi but that is a different story all together. But back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.Now after heaping all this praise on the film let me just say this as well. I didn't really enjoy the film at first. I found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. But then the film began to grow on me. It took a while but it did grow on me. I don't think this is their best film but it is still a good one and I am giving it a 8.5. But the reason that I do recommend this film is for one reason only.Every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself seen it seen it oh seen it last year that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film.

It's difficult to pinpoint what makes this such a magnificent movieprobably because there are so many details that add up. The first thing that sold me like so many others was the music.

There are so many things that make this movie worth seeing. My only complaint that sticks is that it could so easily have been made PG. As it stands it is one of the most harmless PG13 films in a long time and I wish the filmmakers hadn't opted to put in the extra dammits to elevate the movie into the more profitable bracket.

The story won't always be gripping unless you know Ulysses' original adventure.  If you do then the story will be a joy as you recognise the parallels between the two tales.  Even if you don't there is plenty to enjoy here the story is so full of funny imaginative and original characters that you can't help but be drawn in.  From Badalucco's Babyface Nelson Oh George not the livestock' to Durning's Pappy everything is handled with such an edge of surrealism that it's captivating.Clooney has never been better and is truly excellent here with his eccentric hick character with a taste for hair cream.  Turturro is also excellent but Nelson's childlike Delmar is the best character and a great performance. Hunter is as good as she usually is in Coen stuff and the support cast of Durning Goodman Badalucco etc are all great.  The music is fantastic even if you not a fan of this type of music it still fits so totally with the mood of the film that it all works well together.This is a wonderful film  yet another from the Coens.

	schema:reviewBody "Oh Brother Where Art Thou?'  is ostensibly based on Homer's The Odyssey' but I have no reason to doubt the Coen Brothers when they say that they've never actually read it.  The film really has nothing to do with that epic poem other than the fact that the filmmakers throw plot elements from the original haphazardly into the mix every now and then.  Need a Cyclops? Dress John Goodman up in an eye patch to no point or purpose.  Sirens?  Have the main characters stumble across three beautiful women singing and washing clothes by a riverside even though the scene seems totally contrived and arbitrary in the context of the story.  The Coen Brothers' lack of familiarity with the original is only too apparent.Actually this is one of their worst films no doubt about it  slow arch disjointed and heavyhanded in both its plotting and its humor.  The original Odyssey' was an epic tale filled with adventure high drama and great themes involving issues of courage pride commitment and love.  Oh Brother' is none of these.  It is in fact silly cramped and trivial.  The role of Ulysses has been assigned to George Clooney as the leader of a trio of convicts who escape from a chain gang in the Depression Era Midwest.  As they roam the countryside they encounter a myriad of bizarre eccentric characters some derived loosely from The Odyssey' and some not.  None of it really works partly due to the arbitrariness of the plotting and partly due to the fact that the humor is not very well executed.  In fact most of the wit consists of having the actors overplay their facial expressions and accents.  As a result of these two factors the strain never ceases to show.So are there any good things to be found in Oh Brother'?  Well the movie does look good thanks to fine cinematography and art direction which beautifully capture the look of the dusty rural countryside of the 1930's. And there is of course the occasional joke or idea that actually does work despite the fact that the film as a whole is a major disappointment. Perhaps in the case of this particular Coen Brothers film the title is inadvertently symbolic.".

The Legendary Actor who used to play as Kamen Rider V3 Hiroshi Miyauchi... it was NICE to see him in this movie. I hope he comes back in the sequel If the rumor is true. Hiroshi Miyauchi FOREVER!Bat looks very interesting and it reminds me of Agent Aburera from Dekaranger.ConOne thing that bothers me it's like something went go fast. I wish they put the UNCUT version in that movie just like Hakaider Movie. But heck it was very enjoyable to watch.Overall this movie gets an A. Good plot and subplot as well.

	schema:reviewBody "Next to Ultraman Godzilla and possibly Tetsuwan Atom Kamen Rider is probably one of the most recognized of the Japanese heroes. Ever since his debut in 1971 Ishinomori Shoutaro's insectthemed motorcycle riding bugeyed hero has become an almost iconic character to millions of fans not only in Japan but also across the world. The original Kaman Rider series ran for an amazing 98 episodes and spawned a long running franchise which lasts to this day. Nagaishi Takao's Kamen Rider The First is the first attempt to revisit the original hero in nearly two decades although several new Kamen Riders have appeared since. While Kamen Rider The First does a good job at attempting to reinvent and update the original Kamen Rider character for a 21st Century audience it also tries its hardest to appease fan boys of the original 1973 series who are now probably now in their early 30s . The resultant movie is however an odd hybrid that doesn't quite know what it wants to be  tribute redo or reinterpretation? By looks alone it would seem that director Nagaishi wanted to go with a tribute to original TV story. The subtle changes to the Kamen Rider costumes for example are not striking and stay very true to the original costume designs of the hero characters. The global evil organization Shocker is back again as the main antagonist with even one of its original leaders Shinegami Hakase portrayed by the late great Amamoto Hideo making an appearance interestingly Nagaishi's decision to use stock footage of Amamoto in character in the movie parallels Bryan Singer's similar decision to use stock footage of Marlon Brando in the upcoming Superman Returns film. There are also other casting winks at the franchise with several actors from other Kamen Rider TV series playing parts in this movie the other most notable cameo being Miyauchi Hiroshi who portrayed Kamen Rider V3 portraying Rider mentor Tachibana Tobei.Yet as with Kitamura Ryuhei's recent Godzilla Final Wars KRTF is also quite a bit different from the original not all for the best. While the original Kamen Riders 1 and 2 were cyborgs these new Hoppers are alluded to be biologically altered humans with no cybernetic enhancements quite possibly to make them more akin to SpiderMan. In fact much emphasis is placed on the fact that these Kamen Riders needed to undergo periodic blood transfusions in order to survive although it quickly becomes forgotten towards the ending half of the movie.While the opponents are updated variants of his past villains albeit with more modern touches they are revealed to be just elaborately costumed humans with genetically enhanced bodies unlike the TV series in which they were altered human fused with the DNA of animals and given cybernetic weaponry.As with some recent Hollywood adaptations of superhero characters Daredevil Fantastic Four a lot of the more fantastical elements that made the Kamen Rider TV series so endearing to viewers the grand conquest schemes the diabolical costumed monsters the cheesy SFX the tongueincheek banter all seem to be purposely suppressed in favor of more adult drama and realism. Unfortunately as was the case in Fantastic Four KRTF also suffered from the tweaking. The Shocker organization of the movie seemed more like a criminal cartel or mob than a global menace. I missed the likes of the ExNazi reject Col. Zoru and the flamboyant whip wielding crazy Ambassador Hell and the sneering despot Black Shogun. As young and attractive as both Sada and ISSA are they made Shocker look more like the Brat Pack than a terrorist threat.There were some missed opportunities with the story as well that I wish were explored further.One of the most interesting aspects of the film was Shockers' exploitation of the characters of Haruhiko and Miyoko. Shocker used their terminal conditions as a meaning of recruiting them into their organization with the promise to ending their suffering. I wish this angle could have been expanded and elaborated further as it brought an interesting dimension to the story. What if Shocker had used the hospital as a front for its sinister recruitment and abduction plans? Cobra and Snake while not seen much in their kaizou altered forms are much more interesting if not ultimately tragic villains. In fact their stories made them even more sympathetic characters than the heroes. Nagaishi must have felt a connection with their plights as he devoted almost as much screen time to them as he did the main protagonists which unfortunately made the heroes even more onedimensional. It would have been interesting if similar back stories could have been applied to not only Hongo and Hayato but perhaps even to both Bat and Spider who unfortunately were just relegated to atypical shadowy movie ghouls.The overall acting from all the principals was passable if not undistinguished and the action was serviceable but not extraordinary given other similar films like Cutie Honey and Casshern. I was halfway expecting the almost titanic struggles that faced the original Kamen Riders in their Toei movies of the 70's but alas this newest movie left me somewhat under whelmed and disappointed with its somewhat low key approach.".

You can see that their review 'usefulness rating' are very low anyway meaning most people don't agree with their baseless reasons for bashing something new.I watched the original Kamen Rider series as a kid back in the 70s and it was really good entertainment for the time. Rewatching these classics about 30 yrs later I feel the nostalgia but understandably not too impressed with the old fashion FX and fight choreography. So pulling this franchise into the 21st century is a very good idea to me. I just couldn't get into the other Rider series because the story isn't about Hongo. And the Riders only look derivative of the original and therefore not as good.It really brought back fond memories when the classic title theme was played at the beginning of The First. I totally love the introduction of Kamen Rider 1. Since the character is introduced during the night the lightup eyes effect was an excellent idea! The use of CG effects in the movie was well...very effective. Some good examples include when Kamen Rider 1 jumped off the building landing on the ground with all the broken window glass around him. Also when Kamen Rider 1 and 2 are fighting each other the concrete busting punches and kicks are really powerful looking. These are not just eye candy FX but used very effectively to show the invincibility of these superhuman characters.As for the villains the intricate wirework was very well done. I especially liked the battle with 'The Spider' where highflying moves are done in conjunction with speeding motorcycles and among trees. The original series if watched today lacked some of these FX scenes to thoroughly convince me that Kamen Riders have any real special powers. Well other than the big kick that ends the show every time. But for a youngster in the 70s that was enough to keep me roleplaying Kamen Rider endlessly with my friends during recess. One other cool idea in this new franchise we can see that the grasshopper heads of the Riders after transforming is really just a helmet. They can take it off to reveal their real human faces. This allows the actors a much greater range of emotions while they are Riders. It also confirms for me that the Rider transformation is just changing into the suit not changing into another being like Ultraman. For Kamen Rider I rather like the idea that they are still human inside.Overall if you were a fan of the original I think The First is a must see but still good entertainment if you just happen to like superheroes and anime. I hope that I'm not offending any fans of the other 'Rider' series when I say that they're just not the same as Kamen Rider. But The First successfully captures that magic from the past and relaunch it with modern film production values. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Kamen Rider the First is a refreshing way for me to be reintroduced into the series that started it all the original adventures of Takeshi Hongo and his partnerincrimebusting Hayato Ichimonji. After all I was only knowledgeable of the series from Black onwards.Contrary to the position that this was a lame excuse to create a ripoff movie this presentation of the original plot is according to the people involved themselves more than a remake it is a reimagination of the plot giving it a much more darker twist but still containing elements of the original show.Looking at the production cast costumes and probably everything else anyone who witnessed the original Kamen Rider and is open enough to socalled upgrades would appreciate the movie very well. After all though Kamen Rider the First is still most probably targeted for kids it indeed also included the original viewers who are now most likely adults and are ready to witness darker themes. Basically this is what Shin intended to project unfortunately the disturbing graphic content offed even adults. We might be even able to say that The First is Kamen Rider's successful attempt to cater to both kids and adults accomplishing what Shin did not.To be candid about it the movie tells the story of Hongo as not a savedatthelastminute brainwashing tobevictim but as someone who was turned into a puppet of evil but was redeemed before doing more damage to others and to himself as well. And Ichimonji is not the kidnappedtobebrainwashed that he was in the series but again an almost Shadow Moonlike figure through Hongo's fault as well but also someone who finally became a hesitant ally. The movie also contains a subplot which does appear cheesy from the beginning and might make people wonder why it had to be included in the movie but I have one thing to say about it when you understand it after watching the movie you might understand as well why there are Orphenochs like Yuji Kiba.I defy the initial review that the movie is crap I hate to say this but probably there are some people who thinks gold is crap and viceversa that's why they bashed on this. Or maybe they are also on the same line as the idiotic purists who are against Hibiki. Kamne Rider the First is one worthy watch and is probably the best means for someone to be initiated into the real world of Kamen Rider.".

Most of these good points have to do with reviving old rider traditions and aspects of the original. The scarves for instance are an awesome token that we have not seen since ZX appeared. I must say the movie is more enjoyable if you have done your homework on the original series. So many things are from the original. The Double Riders the Cyclone motorcycle the first two Kamen Rider villains i.e. Spider and Bat even the rider mentor Tachibana Tobei. Although some of these are hard to notice. Unless you really really have an open mind you probably wouldn't think that the spider and bat mutants from the series have any connection to the spider and bat in this movie. Also Tobei is kind of swept under the rug. But the movie is still good. My one problem is the confusing subplot that details the origin of Cobra and Snake. It's boring and doesn't make much sense. The music is good though especially the theme. It's simple and easy to remember. Also I love the redesigned Rider suits. They actually look like bikers. Overall not too shabby.".

Kamen Rider has been childhood hero since I was 6 and I'm still very fond of themTo get to this film I have to stay that it was good but everything just seemed to be like going just too fast and it was more like the creators were focusing on Hongo more than Ichimoji rather than having both of the riders fight along side by side together most of the time. Apart form that there were also a lot of parts which were not explained in the film like Kamen Rider 2's background where did he get his bike and what was his real connection to Katsuhiko However these flaws did not stopped KR  THE FIRST from being a great movie. The love triangle plot between Hongo Asuka and Ichimoji was great and I really liked the part when Kamen Rider 1 saved Asuka from the spider monster defeating him in the process. The final fight was also great and I really like the choreography crew who worked out so well in making the fights very entertaining. The ending with KR 1 carrying Asuka in his arms on the beach in the end was really romantic indeed as well as the one when they were riding together on Hongo's bike Overall Kamen Rider THE FIRST is a great film and should be enjoyable for all the fans and its even better than its sequel THE NEXT. Its definitely something for the fans to enjoy".

	schema:headline " The First What? Nothing to Do With Real Kamen Rider";
	schema:reviewBody "I had heard of this film only after witnessing the true horror that is the more recent series of the Kamen Rider franchise most infused with far too much prettyboy angsting by actors who are so poor they couldn't convincingly appear on a soup commercial coupled with female leads whom we're apparently supposed to consider ingratiatingly cute but who in fact are at least as incompetent as their male counterparts in terms of acting. While the traditional Kamen Rider series may not have been masterpieces themselves many of them at least managed to convey the darkly fascinating world in which the Kamen Rider series is rooted and to boot they had excellent and exciting fights. Not so in this film which purports to be an homage to the original Kamen Rider series. In fact that claim couldn't be farther from the truth.As with many of the more recent Kamen Rider series this film is one that falls flat on its face for the attempt to inject 'adult drama' into essentially a children's series. And as always with 'adult drama' the 'drama' in question consists of rather puerile acts and activities childish participants and seemingly arbitrary angst that prevents more or less all of the characters involved from being anything approaching sympathetic or interesting. Any real character development is eschewed in favor of attempts at artsy shots and sequences which the director never once manages to pull off successfully contrived plot devices that have no basis in the original material this claims to pull from or totally superfluous scenes that make this seem much longer than its 1.5 hour running time. And in that seemingly interminable time not one plot point is resolved to any satisfactory conclusion. In my mind that spells utter failure and I find it unlikely that this little terror will be sequelized.As with other films of this director who seems only able to disgrace old and wellrespected series with his unimaginative plodding the focus on the human angst in favor of things actually happening brings down the film considerably. When we do get the marked relief of someone actually fighting it's over too quickly and usually comes off as boring and too CGedup to be anything but gaudy and confusing. Further as usual with this director unwelcome changes are made to the already perfectly adequate source material and then hastily discarded partially through because quite frankly they don't work perhaps he saw this and decided they should be done away with but if so he shouldn't have included them in the first place. As usual a shoddy job.The actors fit into the aforementioned mold of being physically attractive but not much else. Further every time they're actually required to do anything physically demanding it's patent that they have no idea what they're doing. They are entirely unconvincing doing anything that doesn't involve sitting around whining which they don't even manage to do that well the acting talent gulf in this is obvious when veteran actors terribly underused and misused for this travesty of film outshine the entire rest of the cast simply by appearing for a few minutes in a throwaway scene or two. Films like this shouldn't go to the trouble of getting older and respected actors involved with the franchise in question because they're only potent reminders of superior works. If they believe that it will bring in fans of the original series they can think again. And while I have nothing against feminineacting men I do wish the director had given a bit more direction to some of the main actors who were supposedly very close to some of the generic females that paraded across the screen they seemed much more interested in each other. While that's not a bad thing in my opinion we shouldn't then be expected to believe they have any relationship at all with these girls.Movement and so forth also managed to be amazingly awkward with one scene sticking out where a girl faints in a way so unlikely that it made me laugh. Certainly not the intended tone for that scene but it unfortunately wasn't the first or only incident of people moving or acting in ways that were incongruously unlikely and implausible. How exactly can people do this? It's through bad direction and that makes the horrid director's taint on this even more laughably obvious.Honestly I can only hope this talentless hack is barred from sullying the name of any other old and respected series. Kamen Rider has been slighted enough by the recent series purporting to be faithful to the original source material. They're hardly little more than asinine soap operas with some flashy costumes and the occasional fight. If you're going to claim that your film is a return to the original Kamen Riders' era and tone at least try to capture it. If this incompetent horror had decided to do his own original Kamen Rider film it still would've been terrible but not quite as insulting as claiming he was trying to redo the original series. Anyone who wants a real idea of what the original Kamen Rider series were like should seek out those series and not this pathetic excuse for filmmaking.".

I heard this movie was the remake version and thought of going to Hong Kong to catch the movie and turn out the cinema did not have it but at least I went shopping and waited for the DVD. When I watched it I realize that we should wait for the DVD to come out. You can just turn on your speaker loud and get some popcorn and sit down to watch. I don't despite the movie but I think the movie is a bit too short to watch it in the cinema. I don't know whether the old version is longer but the bad guys die too fast and the action scenes are  I think less than 5 minutes. Just the whack! the bad guys just flew off the screen so maybe if there is another remake of it I think they should improve the action scenes. But overall the movie is worth a watch.".

With a deeper and darker storyline less protagonists and without cheesy humor aliens crazy weapons that give the heroes an advantage and giant robots or powerful vehicles that that the heroes could also use to lay waste to their foes.The plot of the film jumps around quite a bit and when it's not expanding on the main character's story you're often left bored or just dead confused at whats going on although by the end bits and pieces will have all come together not that the plot twists these make are that significant to the story. Although the rising action portion of the film is a long one and the good action scenes are short few and far between when it gets good it really gets good. Essentially its still acrobatic martial artists wearing costumes fighting either each other or hordes of evil minions which are the human equivalents of grunts from Halo the moves that the main characters can pull off are amazing. But I can't critique the film based on action so Pros Excellent Action Cool looking costumes most of them at least Interesting plot Cons The plot jumps around a lot The good scenes are spread out throughout the film separated by long scenes of diologue and other characters".

The subplot drags the viewers away from the main story Takeshi Hongo get's kidnapped by the evil Shocker and turned into a grasshopper cyborg and renders what should be an action movie into a drama.The special effects seem rather lousy Hongo and Ichimonji don't seem to have a true henshin.

But anyway the suits look baddass. In the original 1971 Ichigo and Nigo looked rather simple and round in the 2005 movie they look much more detailed and much more complex in design the monstersinhumanoids also look much creepier than the original 1971 television series.The story itself is both sad dramatic and romantic.

While Cape Fear can't even hold a candle next to Taxi Driver Raging Bull and Goodfellas it is still a fabulous remake of the 1962 noir classic and it keeps the viewer on the edge right through until the closing credits.Robert De Niro in yet another brilliant teaming with Scorcese behind the camera plays Max Cady a psychopathic rapist who was sent to jail 14 years earlier for such crimes.  He leaves prison with vengeance.  Not for his victims or his prosecutor but his defence councillor Sam J. Bowden played by Nick Nolte.  It seems Bowden did not defend Cady to the best of his ability.  Cady knows this and wants some payback.Cady's initial return into Bowden's life could not have come at a worse time.  Bowden has been forced to move his family to Florida after his infidelities threatened his marriage and career.  His wife is distrustful and worst of all Bowden is on the verge of beginning another affair with a female workmate.  Added to that his daughter is at the difficult age of 15.Almost by ozmosis Cady understands these problems in the Bowden household and acts on them.  He begins terrorising Bowden and his whole family taking it from one extreme to the next.What makes Cape Fear such a good film is the rapidly increasing sense of claustrophobia.  Scorcese makes a point of using almost only close up shots towards the end of the film.  It is a great touch that makes the viewer that much more scared as the film goes on.Along with that Robert De Niro is superb as Cady.  Only occasionally does the role slip into parody.  Mostly he is expertly evil.Nick Nolte is good if not great the same for Jessica Lange as Leigh Bowden. It seems as if they were void of any great lines in this film which is unfortunate given their immense talent.  Julliette Lewis is absolutely brilliant as the young daughter Danielle.  She slips effortlessly between curious sexual awakenings rebellious teen and straight thinking woman.  Add in small roles for Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck the leads of the 1962 version and you have a great ensemble cast.So not the best Scorcese film ever but some tight editing great camerawork a haunting theme and devilishly overthetop  acting help make this a frighteningly fun movie to watch.  Strongly recommended.".

His performance as rapist convict and allaround notaverynice fellow Max Cady is certainly one of his most memorable performances for its stamina strength and excessiveness.  The film by Martin Scorsece is a remake of the classic film starring Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck.  Although Scorsece keeps the spirit of the film intact he does make some very modern changes. He changes the role of Sam Bowden and family from one of harmony to dysfunction.  No character is the epitome of a universal good but rather flawedvery flawed goodness.  Nick Nolte does a fine job as Bowden and Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis both give deep emotional performances. The film is really a sea of emotion...most of that emotion being fear. Scorsece adds some arty touches with the camera but it is his gritty style that really dominates the film's impact.  Scorsece also is ever the protector of film as he gives cameos to Gregory Peck Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsamall in the original film.  The other acting standout goes to Joe Don Baker as a hired private investigator.  But make no mistake....this is De Niro's film all the way.  He has some of the best lines as he harasses the Bowden family terrorizes the Bowden family and strips the Bowden family of all civility pretense and dignity.  This film is definitely a keeper!".

	schema:reviewBody "The climaxes are emblematic of the differences between Scorcese's version and the original.  In 1962 Mitchum was ordinary ironic sneaky.  Peck was Peck.  And the climax was quiet.  Crickets chirped.  There was no wind. Bodies crept around in black shadows or splashed together in shallow water. In this one Nolte is a lawyer who has broken the code and DeNiro is his nemesis tatooed obscene half his face burned off a raving maniac.  Not sinister just absolutely loco. And the confrontation is situated in a howling gale earsplitting noise rushing rapids the groan of fiberglass hull splitting on rocks blood all over the place.I don't know that one version is in any objective sense better than the other although I vastly prefer the earlier version.  I liked Mitchum's character better.  He was quite ordinary in an extraordinary way.  But from the beginning DeNiro seems to overplay the role.  His accent redolent of grits and redeye gravy seems to sit uncomfortably on him maybe he's played in too many New York movies whereas Mitchum's sly Southern drawl comes out oh so naturally.  And that sinister grin of Mitchum's is worth a dozen lessons at the Actor's Studio.But there is one scene in which DeNiro outdoes Mitchum in terms of sheer impact.  It's when the wrecked houseboat is being swept out into the raging river with DeNiro shackled to a stanchion about to be drowned.  DeNiro launches into this fit of screaming nonsense and singing gibberish hymns insane in a way you'll never be.  It's an explosive performance.Juliette Lewis is remarkable too.  Her umms and ahhs and other hesitations fit her barely nubile personality exactly.  Her scene with DeNiro in the mock Schwarzwald of the high school auditorium is impossible not to admire.  Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange turn in professional performances as do the other principal actors.I'm not sure why I like the earlier version better.  Maybe because it was so awesomely simple a story compared to this one.  There was good and there was evil.  We all know the world doesn't work that way but it's fascinating to watch a simpleminded tale being spun out like a welltold fairy story. This one invites us to think about things.  Unlike Lori Martin in 1962 Juliette Lewis gets a temporary case of the hots for the wellread and manipulative excon.  And unlike Peck in 1962 Nolte has committed sins. He held back information that might have helped his client DeNiro because he was convinced that DeNiro was guilty and should be put away.  I can't figure out what Jessica Lange or the dog did but everybody has to be redeemed anyway because of original sin.  Scorcese's Catholicism may be showing.Overall this is flashier in every respect than the original  more guns more blood more force majeur  and maybe that's part of the problem. At times it looks as much like pandering to an audience of kids raised on MTV's quick cuts and sexy bodies and on Sly Stallone's action movies.  I mean that at times it felt like the movie was talking down to the audience.Still it's an interesting movie in its own right.  Not badly done.  But I wish they'd stop pushing out remakes of classics.  Leave well enough alone because otherwise you're liable to find yourself in Dante's Purgatorio.".

Unlike Lori Martin in 1962 Juliette Lewis gets a temporary case of the hots for the wellread and manipulative excon.  And unlike Peck in 1962 Nolte has committed sins. He held back information that might have helped his client DeNiro because he was convinced that DeNiro was guilty and should be put away.  I can't figure out what Jessica Lange or the dog did but everybody has to be redeemed anyway because of original sin.  Scorcese's Catholicism may be showing.Overall this is flashier in every respect than the original  more guns more blood more force majeur  and maybe that's part of the problem. At times it looks as much like pandering to an audience of kids raised on MTV's quick cuts and sexy bodies and on Sly Stallone's action movies.  I mean that at times it felt like the movie was talking down to the audience.Still it's an interesting movie in its own right.  Not badly done.  But I wish they'd stop pushing out remakes of classics.  Leave well enough alone because otherwise you're liable to find yourself in Dante's Purgatorio.";

He's an excon yuppie lawyer Sam Bowden smugly says with fatuous selfsatisfaction. But gradually it becomes apparent that things are not what they seem. The wholesome superior middle class family is rotten with corruption while the vicious psychotic excon is a man of extraordinary courage intelligence and spiritual strength. Even his most horrible acts of violence are connected to the corrupt and selfserving behavior of his betters. What makes this movie work so well is that director Martin Scorsese breaks away from his usual mean streets milieu. If Max Cady had been an Italian wise guy the movie would have made excuses for him. The outcome would have been predictable. But here the great director remains an impartial observer of criminal behavior rather than a sentimental apologist for ethnic violence. As in GANGS OF NEW YORK. Max Cady is pure evil but he speaks the truth about the evil of allowing class distinctions to flourish in a socalled democracy. When it came out this movie was reviled by critics especially by effete yuppies like Terence Rafferty at GQ and VANITY FAIR. Most of them whined about the violence but it was painfully clear that what really disturbed them was the possibility that an ugly excon really could be smarter tougher and more virtuous than a spoiled yuppie lawyer.Shocking!!!".

So I knew I had to rent this movie if it was good enough to parody on The Simpsons. And it was very disturbing to watch. Robert DeNiro is one of my favorite actors and he completely freaked me out in this film. Especially the scene between him and Juliette Lewis. Even though in some ways this film is done a little over the top it all adds together very well. I was very impressed with this film and would recommend it to Martin Scorsesse fans of course. Even though I wouldn't say this was his best work it is one of his best thrillers though.910".

Mitchum was billed second to Gregory Peck the upright attorney who Mitchum threatened and stalked along with Peck's family. Then again Peck was producing the original Cape Fear so of course he was first billed. Part of the problem was that with some 20 to 30 minutes additional running time Scorsese used it to make his characters a bit more complex. DeNiro was a real basket case as Max Cady in this one whereas Robert Mitchum was just plain no good.Nick Nolte plays attorney Sam Bowden and he's also far more complex and not such a good guy. In the original film Peck was an attorney but he was a witness in the trial that convicted Cady of rape. Here he was Cady's attorney and he tanked the case because Cady was such a psycho he deserved to be behind bars. Cady in fact does have a grudge of sorts against him. And it's not good to get a psycho mad at you.Also Peck and his whole family which consisted of Polly Bergen and Lori Martin back in the original was your basic all American white bread family. Their very wholesomeness made the scope of Mitchum stalking them all the more frightening.Nolte and Jessica Lange have marital problems and their daughter Juliette Lewis is not Mary Poppins.

I was only a kid back then but even after all these years I felt again that this movie gives great doze of fear. Mostly it is because of brilliant portrayal coming from Robert De Niro Max Cady is definitely not kind of guy who you wanna meet and great Martin Scorsese ability to 'manufacture' terrifying scenes for example when Nolte is hiding behind trash cans and when De Niro says 'Counselor could you be there?'  that one reminded me of Walter Hill's The Warriors and Luther in the same movie. Scorsese  De Niro his all time favorite never fails to deliver when they have as good script as this. Here there is relationship between lawyers and clients parents and children also law in America is comprehended where are holes in system what can or cannot man do to protect his family and so on. I also read some of the comments that compare this one with the original and spits on this movie. To those people I say that this is an Oscar winning picture for some remakes I have seen in my life. If Mitchum and Peck stars from the original gave their blessing why can't you? So I advise you to take a look at this Scorsese picture because it's scary with Hitchcock elements and great acting coming from all actors involved. This is a great horrorthriller!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert De Niro plays Max Cady an illiterate criminal who has been  imprisoned for fourteen years on rape and battery charges. Nick Nolte  plays Sam Bowden Cady's lawyer who intentionally buried a valuable  document which may have allowed Cady's prison sentence to be  significantly shorter. Cady learns to read while in prison. He starts  with 'See Spot Run' then proceeds to study law books. Cady's rage and  desire for revenge grows with each additional day that he is in prison.  Although Cady's original prison sentence was only eight years it is  increased to fourteen years due to battery of another inmate. He  memorizes the Bible and tattoos his body with scripture referring to  vengeance. When Cady is finally released from prison he immediately  seeks out Bowden and his family. Cady has become a scripture slinging  psychopath hell bent on revenge. The director Martin Scorsese is  attempting to prove that everyone has skeletons in their closet. Bowden  might appear to be a terrific lawyer and loving family man on the  surface but underneath the perfect image lies a cheating husband and  corrupt lawyer. Scorsese also shows how powerful the emotion of revenge  can be and how it can distort ones version of what is right and wrong.  Scorsese demonstrates this by showing Cady's knowledge of scripture and  his acceptance of the terror that he is inflicting on the Bowden  family. Scorsese's use of cameo appearances by Robert Mithcum and  Gregory Peck was brilliant. The fact that they played such opposite  roles in the original film was an interesting twist. I enjoyed the  original 1962 version more than this remake but I feel that the blood  being in color definitely added to the terror that this film inflicts.".

Cady learns to read while in prison. He starts  with 'See Spot Run' then proceeds to study law books. Cady's rage and  desire for revenge grows with each additional day that he is in prison.  Although Cady's original prison sentence was only eight years it is  increased to fourteen years due to battery of another inmate. He  memorizes the Bible and tattoos his body with scripture referring to  vengeance. When Cady is finally released from prison he immediately  seeks out Bowden and his family. Cady has become a scripture slinging  psychopath hell bent on revenge. The director Martin Scorsese is  attempting to prove that everyone has skeletons in their closet. Bowden  might appear to be a terrific lawyer and loving family man on the  surface but underneath the perfect image lies a cheating husband and  corrupt lawyer. Scorsese also shows how powerful the emotion of revenge  can be and how it can distort ones version of what is right and wrong.  Scorsese demonstrates this by showing Cady's knowledge of scripture and  his acceptance of the terror that he is inflicting on the Bowden  family. Scorsese's use of cameo appearances by Robert Mithcum and  Gregory Peck was brilliant. The fact that they played such opposite  roles in the original film was an interesting twist. I enjoyed the  original 1962 version more than this remake but I feel that the blood  being in color definitely added to the terror that this film inflicts.";

I was a teenage girl at the time and it was quite a shocking experience to feel attracted to the masculine magnetism of Robert Mitchum as Max Cady while knowing his character was a dangerous violent rapist. It got me thinking whether I would be smart and strong enough not to play with fire if I came face to face with somebody oozing the same kind of overwhelming sexiness as Robert Mitchum in this movie even if I felt at the same time the hidden menace emanating from him like from Mitchum's Max Cady in every scene. I didn't know the answer to that question and it scared the hell out of me.The original was scary because it brought the menace so close psychologically. You didn't know where Max Cady was going to show up in the big chase scene you didn't know for sure whether it was really Cady or just somebody harmless after the girl and you didn't know whether he was going to find his way to the family in their hideaway and how he'd find them.The remake on the other hand was bad from the start. The first scene with overly tattooed and crazyeyed Robert De Niro training in his cell already got me thinking that the movie was going to go from bad to worse. De Niro's Max Cady was a onedimensional overly obviously crazy and dangerous guy with little or no sex appeal. He was so over the top stereotyped cartoon bad guy that it was laughable not menacing. And what's with the hanging under the car scene? Can a scene be any more unnecessary than that? A huge part of the scariness of scary movies is that you don't know how and where the monster will appear. And Scorsese tells us exactly how the bogeyman gets to the hideaway. The mistake of telling how the bad guy gets to the hideaway could still have been excusable if the movie makers hadn't chosen such an unrealistic way of transportation for Max Cady. I mean hanging under the car for several miles? Are you kidding me? Did Scorsese really expect the viewers to buy into the concept? Nick Nolte and his family were all unlikeable people so I found myself wondering why I should sympathize with those people. I'm not a big fan of Juliette Lewis anyway and with her voluntary flirting with the unattractive De Niro and her dysfunctional family relationships it was difficult to believe that her father would be willing to go to extremes to protect her. No it felt like it wasn't about protecting the family it was a pissing contest between Nolte and De Niro about which guy was the toughest and baddest. Nolte cared less about keeping his daughter and wife safe from a violent rapist than he cared about oneupping De Niro by making sure he wouldn't get to mess with what was Nolte's.All in all a movie not worth all the hype it got when released.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cape Fear 1991  out of 4 Martin Scorsese's remake of the 1962 Gregory PeckRobert Mitchum thriller has a flaw here and there but overall I feel it's one of the best of its kind and the director's most underrated film. Robert DeNiro plays the crazy excon out to seek revenge on the lawyer Nick Nolte who he feels misrepresented him. This was the first ScorseseDeNiro film I ever watched and it made me the diehard fan I am today. I saw this thing four times in the theater and only God knows how many times since then but it remains one of my favorite thrillers as I feel the director hits all the right notes when it comes to the suspense but he also sprinkles in some very dark humor as well. DeNiro is simply wonderful in his role and comes off very threatening and at times downright scary. Nolte and Jessica Lange also turn in strong performances as does Juliette Lewis. Peck Mitchum Martin Balsam and Joe Don Baker also add great support. It's strange but I still remember the four screenings of this in the theater and I remember them quite vividly. I still remember all the suspense and terror that was running throughout the theater and all of this came back as I picked this film to show my buddy and our dates. The film went over very well with them but it also worked extremely well for me even after all these viewings. The stakeout scene towards the end remains one of the most suspenseful scenes from any movie I've seen but there's also the equally disturbing scene where DeNiro goes to visit Lewis at school. I also gave the original film four stars but overall I prefer this remake. The original was pretty much good guy Peck versus bad guy Mitchum which was a lot of fun but I like the changes made to the story here. We've got the evil DeNiro against the bad boy Nolte. I like the fact that Nolte's character wasn't very likable and I enjoyed the changes that made the wife and daughter connect to DeNiro's character. The level of strong characters in classic Scorsese film's in here to be seen and with the strong performances this just adds to the overall greatness.".

	onyx:emotionText "Cape Fear 1991  out of 4 Martin Scorsese's remake of the 1962 Gregory PeckRobert Mitchum thriller has a flaw here and there but overall I feel it's one of the best of its kind and the director's most underrated film. Robert DeNiro plays the crazy excon out to seek revenge on the lawyer Nick Nolte who he feels misrepresented him. This was the first ScorseseDeNiro film I ever watched and it made me the diehard fan I am today. I saw this thing four times in the theater and only God knows how many times since then but it remains one of my favorite thrillers as I feel the director hits all the right notes when it comes to the suspense but he also sprinkles in some very dark humor as well. DeNiro is simply wonderful in his role and comes off very threatening and at times downright scary. Nolte and Jessica Lange also turn in strong performances as does Juliette Lewis. Peck Mitchum Martin Balsam and Joe Don Baker also add great support. It's strange but I still remember the four screenings of this in the theater and I remember them quite vividly.

In this remake Robert De Niro gives one of his most electrifying performances as Max Cady an excon out to terrorize the lawyer Nick Nolte who sent him to jail not to mention his wife and daughter Jessica Lange Juliette Lewis. My review is based on the merit of this film alone as I have never seen the original however after seeing this I wanted to. Nolte gives an equally strong performance as the milquetoast lawyer pushed to his limits by this madman. Lange and Lewis offer strong support as Nolte's family Lewis received an Oscar nod for this her first starring role. I also thought it was nice of director Scorcese to salute the original film by casting original stars Mitchum and Peck in supporting roles. but above all De Niro is worth the price of the rental here.".

Add on the cheesy music DeNiro's completely unrealistic tactics and ability to take a beating and you have yourself a crappy movie.

They are expected to settle to get married and to start a family. All very important decisions and we never feel very comfortable making them. Do we want to give up life as an irresponsible bachelor will we try to spend the rest of our lives with only one woman are we ready to raise kids...If you expect any answers from this movie than I'll have to disappoint you because you won't really find any good ones. It shows how four male friends desperately try to be free. One of them meets an 18year old schoolgirl at a wedding party falls in love with her and betrays his pregnant fiance jeopardizing his entire future and family. One of the others only fights with his wife the third one wants to escape form his dying father and the last one wants to keep living as a hippie. They all have their reasons to leave their actual lives and they start making plans to make a trip around the world but will they leave or finally accept the real life...In a way this is a very typical Italian movie. Personally I love that but I guess there are several people who don't. The style the music the acting it all can be found in similar Italian movies and less in other European productions. So if you absolutely hate Italian movies than you better don't even start watching it. In my opinion this isn't a movie for very young people either. I'm not saying they shouldn't watch it but I think an 18year old probably can't understand all too well why it's so difficult to make that important step once you're thirty just because he or she doesn't have to think about it yet. Being almost 27 myself I know all too well what it means.All in all this is a very nice movie that I would recommend to most people. Despite what you might think this isn't a very corny movie and has absolutely nothing to do with how most Hollywood comedies with such a message would look like. It's wonderful it's realistic it's everything I need in a movie and that's why I give it an 810.".

Being almost 27 myself I know all too well what it means.All in all this is a very nice movie that I would recommend to most people. Despite what you might think this isn't a very corny movie and has absolutely nothing to do with how most Hollywood comedies with such a message would look like. It's wonderful it's realistic it's everything I need in a movie and that's why I give it an 810.";

	schema:headline " 'The Last Kiss' is a beautiful Italian film...";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Last Kiss' is a beautiful Italian film a romantic comedy and drama told in multiple storylines reminiscent of 'Magnolia' or 'Short Cuts'.  It is one of the best films ever to deal with twentysomething males who haven't really grown up and accepted the responsibility of an adult life and also about the women who have to deal with them.  Most of the men in this film have commitmentphobia.  Babies are being had weddings are taking place apartments are being purchased but all these men can think about is escape.  They are planning on buying a beat up old van and traveling the world in search of an adventure.  Anything will do as long as it doesn't involve growing up becoming an adult and assuming responsibility for the direction of their lives and relationships.It sounds weighty and significant.  Perhaps it is.  But the movie is so effortless lighthearted energetic and funny that time seems to fly by.  It is one of the most entertaining films of the year.  It's no wonder that 'The Last Kiss' won so many Audience Awards at film festivals in 2002 including at Sundance.  The film also became one of the biggest box office successes in European cinema history.  This film which Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Sex in the City with men garnered tons of 3 and 4 star reviews hit dozens of Top Ten Lists and will easily become a favorite for those who are lucky enough to see it.The performances are all stellar.  The primary couple in the film supremely played by Stefano Accorsi Carlo and Giovanna Mezzogiorno Giulia are fascinating to watch.  They are emotionally polar opposites at different stages in their lives.  The film builds around this couple and the explosive crescendo that seems imminent from the opening scenes.  Carlo is immature and irresponsible.  Giulia is calm methodical and assured in her wants and needs.  She loves Carlo despite his flaws but tells him that the one thing she won't abide is infidelity.  Needless to say the temptations present themselves during the film and we get to watch one of the most explosive arguments in the history of cinema as Giulia has a melt down when she finds out the truth.The film dances around to other storylines from time to time but it always returns to the central couple.  All the other vignettes are interesting but serve primarily as breathers and changesofpace.  You won't be as invested in those characters as you will be with Carlo and Giulia.  Giovanna Mezzogiorno is spectacular here.  She bounces effortlessly between calm and rage trust and jealousy romantic and pragmatic.  It is one of the best performances of the decade.  Special note must also be given to a new Italian starlet named Martina Stella who is vibrant and mesmerizing as the object of Carlo's lust.  She plays a lovestruck young girl named Francesca who is so painfully unaware of life's cruel hardships and realities.  Her naivet and wideeyed innocence makes it easy for us to understand why Carlo might stray.  Martina Stella is a wonderful new talent that we should keep our eyes on over the next few years.I pointed out the structural similarity to Paul Thomas Anderson's 1999 masterpiece 'Magnolia'.  However there is more than just a passing resemblance.  'The Last Kiss' is obviously inspired by it's predecessor.  It looks and sounds a great deal like that classic.  The camera movement is energetic and dynamic.  There are a ton of complex 'steadicam' scenes.  The score is that anticipatory and frenetic string ensemble that allows us to flow from moment to moment as the editing shifts us from one storyline to another.  In fact the scores are so similar that I initially thought it had been borrowed.  The way I see things if you are going to emulate a film you can't do much better than emulating 'Magnolia'.This film has the ability to make you laugh and cry with the absolute recognition of your own life .  There are so many scenes that will hit home. Virtually every viewer over the age of 25 will be able to see themselves at some point in their life manifested in one of these characters.  It is a witty and observant script that deals truthfully and hysterically with the complexities of modern relationships.  I think that is the main reason it has become a fan favorite.The cinematography and lighting are first rate.  These stunningly gorgeous Italian thespians are made even more resplendent than previously imaginable. Gabriele Muccino directs the film and seems to make every single shot count.  You could take any stillframe from this movie and have a photograph to hang in an art gallery.I've already mentioned the wonderful score but I would also like to point out another lovely sound in this film... the Italian language.  Never before have so many words been crammed into a two hour movie.  It is a lovely language to behold.  It sounds beautiful whether it is being whispered or screamed.  I know it may seem a little meaningless to state such a thing but I believe that a great film can be enjoyed with either the sound or the picture off.  This film assuredly looks gorgeous but it sounds even better!There are many things to love about this film.  Giovanna Mezzogiorno's performance is miraculous.  The stories are poignantly truthful.  The character arcs are rich and full and complete.  The technical aspects of the film are immaculate.  The resolution is satisfying and honest.  You will cringe you will laugh you will be joyous and angry... this movie will take you on an emotional rollercoaster.  You will almost feel Italian If you aren't already.  And the final few moments of the film will leave you smirking to yourself as you contemplate the resounding irony of it all.  How cruel these directors can be!'The Last Kiss' L'Ultimo Bacio is easily one of the best films of the year.  I suggest you make a special effort to seek this film out... you won't regret it.".

	schema:reviewBody "s p o i l e r sYou have to admit there's much that's life affirming and technically accomplished in Gabriele Muccino's movies about superficial Italians coupling and uncoupling. His scenes never stop moving and his camera has learned to keep up with the flow. Undoubtedly his most polished effort so far is L'ultimo bacio The Last Kiss. A box office success in Italy and abroad though not a critical one The Last Kiss is a splendid operatic swirl of melodramatic ensemble acting and liquid editing. Its succession of slick fasttalking emotional roller coaster scenes is a beautiful thing to watch. It's got irresistible rhythm if you don't mind that the high energy leads to an awful lot of yelling. The episodic structure and musical links may owe something to P.T. Anderson's Magnolia but this is Italy and it all works differently. It isn't about anomie and chance encounters everyone's connected. The Last Kiss is a welloiled machine with jawdropping energy.Its action is so lively its motion so perpetual you may fail to notice what a stagnant society The Last Kiss represents  how complacent the characters and their creator are. The way they buckle down and accept the mindnumbing comforts' and intellectual limitations of Berlusconi's Italy. It's a place they all seem destined to accept as the best of all possible worlds.The Last Kiss revolves almost literally the steadicam pans from scene to scene while operatic music swims across the transitions around five young men about to turn thirty in a provincial town. At the center is Carlo Stefano Accorsi. His fiance Giulia Giovanna Mezzogiorno is pregnant and he can't face the prospect of a wife a child and a house. He's not ready to grow up. Most of Carlo's buddies have the same problem. Paolo Claudio Santamaria goes through the death of his father right after he's had an angry breakup with his girlfriend and he can't face going into the family religious object business. The mercurial Adriano Giorgio Casotti has a young child and a ballbuster wife Livia Sabrina Impacciatore and these challenges have him fed up with his marriage and ready to leave it. Alberto Marco Cocci a dreadlocked jointsmoking Greenpeace hippy amuses himself seeing how many women will jump into bed with him he's a sciupafemmine a Don Juan who chews them up and spits them out marriage is not on his horizon.But Marco Pierfrancesco Favino is getting married he's buying into the normal life. Marco's four friends are all at Marco's wedding and it's there that Carlo meets Francesca Martina Stella a tantalizingly delicious blonde schoolgirl who successfully puts the make on him. Meanwhile Giulia's mother Anna a simpatica Stefania Sandrelli is fed up with her taciturn psychiatrist husband Emilio Luigi Emilio and goes through her own period of rebellion trying to revive an affair of three years ago with a college professor Sergio Castellitto.Carlo gets his wild night with Francesca his last kiss' which turns into more than that after Giulia finds out and they have a big fight where the movie's yellfest reaches fortissimo. He runs back and sleeps with the 18year old and then spends the rest of the movie trying to patch things up and get his life back on its track. Meanwhile Adriano Alberto and Paolo are planning to run off to Africa or somewherean escape that's really a last fling but their whole series of tantrums and complaints are background noise an obligato to the main themes. The focus is on Giulia's mother Adriano and Carlo. Where the movie is really headed for its finale is to Carlo and Giulia reuniting and a soothing voiceover from Carlo about how nice it will be to have grass and a suburban house and kids. . .and all the rest and the two of them are reconciled at her parents' house where Anna is back with her father. It seems that Adriano really has left his wife for a while anyway but that subject is dropped.Closely examined despite its Magnolialike intercutting of related subplots its splendid cast and beautiful look The Last Kiss reveals a worldview that's numbingly vapid. Its young men on the verge of thirty and one older woman in revolt against the ordinary paths they've chosen only play at escape the final sequence is a corny affirmation of comfortable bourgeois family life big house big car perfect bambini. Anna is back with Giulia's father. Her little revolt is over.What is the theme that unifies Muccino's movies? Is it coming of age as in Come te nessuno mai or is it playing at revolution as in that same rather charming first film about high schoolers staging a Sixtiesstyle strike while what the boys really want is only to get laid? If Come te is Muccino's freshest and most unassuming effort Ricordati di me his most recent one is his cheesiest again a swirl of stories about individuals in a family who are all in revolt against their lives  and come back to conventionality at the end  but with much tackier subplots. He's made a trilogy 1 first sex 2 last infidelity before marriage 3 first infidelity after with being aTV gogo dancer treated as a viable life choice. The theme is simply revolt a little it'll make you feel better. Normality is the true revolution.'Italians who remember the great directors of the past shake their heads at such stuff. The idea that all temptations to rebel end in a little reconciliation is complacent even for TV sitcoms. It's as if Muccino has all this promise as a filmmaker  he can orchestrate his subplots in such an entertaining way and the editing is inspired  he's a real Robert Altman with a Tuscan accent  but his head is too empty there's no there there.Muccino's characters for all their charm and good looks are pretty silly people. Carlo Last Kiss's main character is attractive in his way but his shitfaced grin palls he's an airhead to be tempted by Francesca the blonde Lolita because she's an airhead too just a pretty schoolgirl who confuses wanting to get laid with finding the love of her life. There's no edge to the temptation because Francesca's pull on Carlo was so superficial. It's lively and glossy and it has moments of flirting with satire and farce the sheer energy of it can be lots of fun to watch but when you get down to it Last Kiss is on the level of a TV sitcom. In fact American cable network dramas arguably go deeper than this. Is Muccino the best that mainstream Italian cinema can now produce? Let's hope not.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning Ending revealed  discussed.I enjoy foreign films and prefer original movies to their remakes. I really dislike when foreign films are remade for American audiences and changed usually sugarcoated with a happy ending tacked on. I loathe this need to pander to our sentimentalism and our refusal to accept more realistic films.However after seeing this film I'm curious to see the American remake of this film to see if it's sensibilities are more in line with my tastes. Maybe I'm being unrealistic in thinking American guys wouldn't have quite the same reactions.I was looking forward to these 30something characters exploringstruggling with what it meant to be in a relationship. However I didn't like any of the characters. The women barely existed except as foils for the male characters. They were onedimensional. All of them were portrayed as wanting nothing more than a marriage and kids. They were shown as jealous shrewlike and clingydependent. The men on the other hand with one happily married exception who was barely shown and one unhappily obsessed w his ex were shown as feeling trapped by womenrelationships. I really disliked the main storyline of the guy who is about to have a child with his girlfriend and yet suddenly decides he needs to screw a high school student. I was even more mad the way the film let him have his cake and eat it too. In effect the film said it was OK to cheat on your pregnant girlfriend because if you really apologize she'll take you back. I don't feel like he felt guilty for the act. He was just sorry he got caught. I don't feel that he learned anything from the experience. Nor did I feel is he unlikely to do it again.I was sad that his girlfriend took him back. She admits he killed her lovetrust and that it would never be the same. I was even sadder at the end that to me seemed to imply she was going to cheat on him too.I thought the film was going to be about finding contentment in a monogamous relationship  to show that it's OK to give up the chase the desire for others because the committed relationship would be a more rewarding experience than a series of onenight stands. This is not to say it also can't show that people can be perfectly happy as single and free  I had no problem with the dreadlocked guy who openly admitted he was just in it for sex. Instead it showed relationshipsmarriage as suffocating and unhappy for both parties. It showed that straying out side the relationship seemed to be normal at least for the men.I wasn't asking for ALL the characters to be blissfully happy and not have any doubts  or for everyone to feel they needed to be in a relationship. clearly the obsessed guy needed to learn to be on his own. I was merely hoping for a exploration of both sexes dealing with these doubts and issues  and I feel what I got was onesided and very biased towards a particular conclusion. I'll admit I was biased too I'd hoped for a ending that showed the people in a relationship as seeing that giving up others for a committed relationship is worth it. Instead I feel like I got the reverse. Perhaps it's my fault for coming with certain expectations.I simply couldn't relate to any of them being in the same age having entered a long term relationships thinking about these issues  I'd really hoped it would resonate and make me think. Instead I found it rather depressing and disheartening.And while I hate to stereotype I'm sort of hoping that was an Italian mentality that would not translate to a different culture's version of this filmthese issues. So I'm going to break my cardinal rule of not seeing remakes and watch the American version called Last Kiss to see if it plays out in the same manner.".

When we laugh we laugh out loud!  When we love we do it with passion! The film is very good.  Martina Stella the 18yr old high school girl who falls in love with the 29yr Marco in her featured debut is very good and simply delightful to watch since she is actually very pretty and sexy. I saw this film on DVD in the same session along with Bella Martha also writtendirected by a woman Sandra Nettelbeck check it out.  Even when the latter is superior L'ultimo baccio Italian for The Last Kiss is nevertheless a very good film.  This film mixes a firstrate modern cinematography with what used to be called Italian realism of the 50s and 60s.  The mix is great and works fine.".

What I really could not stand are Stefano Accorsi and Giovanna Mezzogiorno!!! I don't know if it is a personal dislike for Accorsi it may be since I hate him in almost all the films he makes instead I liked Giovanna Mezzogiorno very much in La finestra di fronte.

What's most surprising about the film is how little the writerdirector injects his own ethical judgments into the action. One might argue that the whole movie disapproves of the universal infidelity portrayed but there are several sequences in the movie that call this into question. Muccino seems to enjoy most poking fun at everyone's hypocrisy and this is always great to watch especially with an expressive passionate Italian cast. The movie has just enough of a traditional romantic centre to make it all hang together and yet a great enough diversity of characters to make a wide range of witty points.Well worth seeing. 810.".

Otherwise it doesn't make sense why would Carlo betray Giulia at the first chance he gets. The only way it could be understood would have been to have cast a different actress than Giovanna Mezzogiorno in the role. Not only is Ms. Mezzogiorno gorgeous what man in his right mind would even consider having a fling with anyone else?Stefano Accorsi's Carlo is obviously dazed and confused by the young girl he happens to meet. This is the message of the film gamble with your happiness and you'll lose everything. Beautiful Stefania Sandrelli has a small part as Giulia's mother with her own marital problems. We don't get to see Ms Sandrelli enough on the screen. She's an elegant and welcome sight whenever she graces a film.Cheaters beware Don't risk losing someone who loves you unconditionally for a quickie no matter how gorgeous that quicky might be or even if she's an Italian Lolita.".

As a late 20something male I can identify with most of the questions the characters in the film are facing for example have I found the right partner for life?  Will we be faithful?  How can I possibly live up to my family's expectations?  I can't say much more without spoiling it but I highly recommend this film.".

The tag line the story of every love story' perfectly conveys the sense of this film it is a universal story. I mean that even though I'm younger than the protagonists I'm 21 I feel the same as them. During the projection I was overcome by a stream of emotions. I felt that this movie was about my life the life I'm living now in the same way as it seemed to me that Come te nessuno mai' told the story of my schooldays. Moreover the actors Giovanna Mezzogiorno Stefano Accorsi Stefania Sandrelli as well as all the others are excellent. I just want to congratulate Muccino on his success.

He shoots in a very traditional way but he edits the movie giving it a furious pace. If at first it succeeds in catching the attention soon it starts to bore. Actors are screaming for most of the movie  and well they do their job but they are however little more than acceptable. But the real problem comes when we get down to the script. The story has been told a lot of times and almost always in a better way. The moral of the movie note we are in the third millennium. is normality is the true revolution. thanks Muccino might I add that life's a box of chocolates or have you got better commonplaces that you want to scream about? You may well ask why this movie has had such a huge success in Italy. well in my opinion that's because it is very conservative and  under a false faade  full of clichs. It speaks of the importance of the family in a very trite way and people love to watch movies that let them not think at all. I might compare this movie with Casomai of director Alessandro D'Alatri. Where Casomai is a gentle story about young families in Italy wonderfully written well directed and with a pair of intelligent twists The last Kiss is poorly written poorly directed overhyped and annoyingly screamed. and when you scream you generally have nothing to say.".

Carlo and Giulia are a couple in their late twenties who realize they've crossed the final threshold into adulthood when Giulia discovers she's going to have a baby.

Carlo's friends are also having mixed feelings about the onset of maturity Adriano can't decide if he should go through with his marriage to Livia  Paolo is trying to find a way out of going into business with his father and Alberto seems to be waging a oneman war against monogamy by seducing as many women as possible. Meanwhile Giulia is having her own misgivings about parenthood and her mother Anna is torn between happiness for her daughter and dread that she's now old enough to be a grandmother Anna's malaise isn't eased by the lack of compassion shown by her husband. The Last Kiss is a film that is characterized by great performances of the cast.Special mention should be given to Giovanna Mezzogiorno and Stefano Accorsi as they did portray brilliantly on how immature adults fear growing up and facing responsibility. Gabriele Muccinowriter and directorkeeps things very energetic with fluid and complicated camera work capturing characters who are bursting with personality. But the film falls short in terms of interest nor care that the viewer would sympathize to the characters involved as it boils down into having a formulaic and predictable conclusion when the end credits roll.

Is married life and fatherhood what they really want to do? We don't know they just settle as it said at the end of the movie very clearly... the message is maybe settling is not that bad  we gave up our REAL dreams Escape  have an infatuation with a young and sexy woman etcAnd the end is clear She castrated you now she will go sleep around... isn't that typical machist?

If I'm wrong then the ending is a drippy copout and the worst of any good movie I've ever seen. How else does one account for the central character being arguably the most reprehensible of a nearly irredeemable lot. True not all these guys are unsympathetic but they do exist in a tiny continuum of male bondingwhich is invariably a superficial enterpriseand arrested development. They pose two choices to themselvesthe boring safety of a loveless marriage or an endless allmale safari in Africa. The only exception to this group is Giulia's mother's exlover who is capable of both love and thought. The rest are child men who experience unaccommodating women as the pressure of unfreedom and traps. yes there's far more drama here than comedy The three worst men in the group are Carlos Alberto and Paulo. Paulo is a fasttalking fasteracting cad who can't settle for anything less than ownership of his partner. He expresses public hostility and violence toward both her and her new boyfriend. To him she is a ballbreaking bitchshe wears glasses no less. Jealousy is the only real emotion he experiences. He's so caught in this swirl that he's hardly aware of his own dying father. What he needs is to escape the whole female world and so he signs on to the deserter's expedition.Alberto is a brazen womanizer. Unlike Paulo he has no moments of softness. He has no problem with starryeyed lies to sincere lovers. His long hair hipness and cool signify nothing in terms of breaking any gender molds. In fact he is more detestable than his more conservative buddieswho he really likes more than women interrupting his lovemaking on their account and as ready for the African adventure as any of them. His difference may fool enough chicks to keep him satisfied but his is a phallic worldview which offers him prerogatives and privileges he is only too willing to embrace.Carlos as more like everyman showing what the average guy is capable of when his ideals are subject to a slight amount of pressure is perhaps the most insidious of the lot. He is a skin deep kind of guyknowing enough but passive. He has a wandering mind a wandering intent a wandering consciousness. And these are what he brings to his moments of crisis. First he half cheats on a courageousand soon ferocious wife then he tries to lie his way back then takes direct revenge on her by sleeping with the just discarded Francesca and then adopting a desensitized Alberto posture checks out on this loving teen with nary a glance or a word. Finally borrowing from fasttalking Paulo he playacts the wounded lover and ingratiates himself with his wife who eventually caves not convincingly for form's sake. Now Giulia has two childrenshe is pregnant with a girla daughter and a husbandson. The child man has arranged a for a child life. For the order safety and emotional certainty that wife and mother represent for him are now his. Of course Giulia might soon disturb this placid scenario as the final note seems to implylooks like another child man though".

But Galaxy Quest had everyone in the theater laughing including my companionwho hates science fiction.  It cut across ages and backgrounds with a very simple premiseyou are what you believe yourself to be.As a fifteen year veteran of science fiction conventions I've seen the phenomenon from both sides of the stage.  I've met the getalifers the justforfun guys and the notsorare I'monlyinitforthe profit gang. I've met actors who loved the whole shebang actors who loathed it and actors who didn't have a clue what was going on.  Fandom is a very big place with room for all sorts.And Galaxy Quest got it rightthe conventions the costumes the geeks the groupies even the mocking mundanes who attend cons looking for kicks. It took notice of all the science fiction cliches acknowledged them and then twisted them to its own comedic purposes.Galaxy Quest captured not only the silliness of fandom but the inspiration of it.  In the end the demoralized and cynical actors found strength and meaning in the same characters which stereotyped them.  The geeks saved the day.  The good guys won.  The bad guys provided entertainment to masses of fans.  Things blew up.  And isn't that what science fiction is all about?The entire cast was excellent especially Tim Allen and Alan Rickman doing their best Shatner and Nimoy impersonations.  Special credit must go to the four actors who played the naive aliens.  Their wideeyed innocence reminded me of the quality that drew me and draws children of all ages into the world of science fiction.This movie didn't rely on vulgarities or overt violence.  It didn't need to resort to meanness or cruel jokes either.  While it poked fun at science fiction and its fans it never resorted to the kind of mockery you see in other films.Galaxy Quest is a solid funny movie.  Go see it.  Take the kids.  Go see it twice.".

The script is inventive the special effects are vivid and powerful especially when the actors see the real ship for the first time and when the rock monster rampages through the ship and the characters are incredibly well drawn.I'm also puzzled by the negative reactions some people have to the film. Does the film fail to register because the Trek social phenomenon is unfamiliar to them thus there's no frame of reference? I'd really like to know.Comedy is possibly the hardest genre to get right because line delivery timing direction and character shading all have to be pretty much perfect or the movie just won't be funny. GQ nails these elements  right on the head and in virtually every scene  and keeps up the pace by constantly moving its characters forward. Tony Shalhoub Fred Sam Rockwell Guy Fleegman and Enrico Colantoni Mathesar in particular are so deadon perfect in their scenes that lack of box office and the Academy's traditional indifference to comedy are probably the only reasons these guys didn't get Oscar nods. Okay well 1999 was also an incredibly strong year for American cinema.But GQ is also strangely moving  particularly in the way it derives comedy from despair. The actor characters' lives are in ruins not unlike the aliens they eventually save from extinction. Perhaps this is why  even though the characters don't know it yet  the two groups get along so well and why the actors make the decision to actually become their TV characters in the end. This may also be why the dismay in Mathesar's face when he learns the truth is so painful.I suspect GQ also got lumped in with the likes of Scary Movie and The Naked Gun movies in the public's collective conscious It was perceived as just another spoof and therefore not worthy of significant attention. I hope the movie develops enough of a cult following that it one day reaches that wider audience it deserves.".

	schema:reviewBody "I generally rate films highly based on how often and how much I'd like to watch them again. I can watch most films more than once but only a few have the necessary qualities to watch over and over again. Comedy films are never that high on my list of watch agains. After seeing a joke or comic scene once it's hard for it to have the same impact again and again. I well recall being in tears of laughter when I first saw Airplane at the cinema. But now I find it hard going and even the inflatable pilot only raises a smile.So it's rare that a film like Galaxy Quest a scifi comedy comes along but very welcome when it does. There's a lot of homage paid to Star Trek of course and old scifi shows in general and fans of those will have no trouble spotting the moments culled from those shows.The cast are all exemplary in their roles as ex scifi stars who get catapulted into the real thing and have to save the galaxy. Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver give good solid performances here. In particular Weaver shows a talent for comedy here that was lacking in Ghostbusters. Tony Shalhoub's bumbling outofhisdepth technician is also a nice addition.But out of all of them two really shine for me. Alan Rickman whose facial expressions throughout the film just have you laughing out loud without needing to listen to what's being said. And Sam Rockwell who plays the extra crewman who's always convinced he's going to get killed because he's a nobody and not one of the regular cast.The whole film is chock full of delightful silliness and memorable scenes such as where they enlist the aid of geeks to navigate them through their own ship as the geeks know the plans off by heart.A great film much underrated at the boxoffice and destined to become a classic.".

Tony Shalhoub's bumbling outofhisdepth technician is also a nice addition.But out of all of them two really shine for me. Alan Rickman whose facial expressions throughout the film just have you laughing out loud without needing to listen to what's being said. And Sam Rockwell who plays the extra crewman who's always convinced he's going to get killed because he's a nobody and not one of the regular cast.The whole film is chock full of delightful silliness and memorable scenes such as where they enlist the aid of geeks to navigate them through their own ship as the geeks know the plans off by heart.A great film much underrated at the boxoffice and destined to become a classic.";

I never thought it would arrive and so in GALAXY QUEST I found one of the best films in cinema history. Everything is spot on.  The story is fantastic and telling it from the point of view of normal people was great.  Making them play those stereotypes that we know and love was just the tip of the iceberg and everyone played the parts superbly. The special effects speak for themselves.

The score is also great capturing the adventure of the old Star Trek shows and the epic scope of the story at hand. And then there's the way everything just comes together at the end into a sensational package of laughs thrills sometimes bitingly moving scenes and a genuine feeling of warmth inside.

Darryl Mitchell is great as Tommy Laredo Webber and Sam Rockwell is hilarious as Guy the hack actor stuck in the middle of something that scares him silly.The two actors who really stand out are Tony Shalhoub and Enrico Colantoni. Tony plays Fred Kwan with understated glee while Colantoni plays Commander Mathesar with a smiling earnestness that makes you firmly believe everything he's saying.The supporting cast is incredibly talented. Robin Sachs is perfect as Sarris Patrick Breen essays his role as Quellek beautifully and Missy Pyle amazes as Laliari.But it's still Tim Allen's movie above all else and he makes the most of it.A final note this movie wouldn't have worked nearly as well if not for the production design work of four of the greatest artistic talents in science fiction Simon Bisley Brom Wayne Barlowe and the lengendary Berni Wrightson. Barlowe is an expert in xenobiology and designed the Thermian's native form. Wrightson's quite possibly the best horror illustrator of all time and Sarris and his minions are his work.My favorite moment in the film? the point where Alan Rickman gets his first look at the NSEA Protector II for the first time... his look of astonishment is a joy to behold.Like The Last Starfighter this is a popcorn movie with a message.

	schema:reviewBody "GALAXY QUEST 1999 12Starring Tim Allen Sigourney Weaver Tony Shalhoub Alan Rickman Daryl Mitchell and Sam Rockwell Directed by Dean Parisot written by David Howard. Running Time 104 minutes. Rated PG for action violence and some gore mild language and brief sexrelated material By Blake French As I walked out of the theater in which I screened Galaxy Quest I thought how surprised I was to have enjoyed what seemed as a cheesy family spoof. But the film turned to be an action adventure with some really hilarious moments. I loved the film. It has qualities of a successful science fiction drama but also contains a variety of comical characters that had the whole audience overwhelmed in laughter. Galaxy Quest is right up there with Toy Story in merit it entertains adults and children alike standing out as one of the year's best family films. The story details the adventures of a canceled television science fiction fantasy cast similar in content to Star Trek. Galaxy Quest is the name of the program. In their years the stars including Jason Nesmith Gwen DeMarco Fred Kwan Alexander Dane and Tommy Webber were some of the biggest most popular names in TV. Now their means of making a living is signing fans' autographs for a price and being cast in amateur presentations. There is very detailed character development here. The characters are wonderfully cast and brilliantly portrayed. Unfortunately most family films don't contain the patience for such necessary material. We bond with these characters they are likable funny energetic and independent.  These individuals are the key of success to this kind of movie.The real plot begins when strange people come to Jason beging for him to save their existence from a powerful evil force who wishes to wipe them out of the universe forever. Naturally at first our television star is skeptical but when the strange people turn out to be humble aliens and transport Jason to their spaceship he realizes this is something serious. The aliens begin to explain that they think he and his Galaxy Quest team are the only people in the universe who can save their race. He rushes to the members of his old cast and tries to justify his experience. He says that there are extraterrestrial creatures who require the help of their Galaxy Quest characters. None of his friends believe him but once again give in when they find themselves transported off earth onto the creature's spaceship.  Of course the aliens don't realize that their hopeful heroes are simply out of work actors but who needs to tell them? So it is up to Commander Peter Quincy Taggart Lt. Tawny Madison Tech Sergeant Chen Dr. Lazarus of Tev'Meck and Lt. Laredo to save the day for our innocent and haunted alien life forms. Galaxy Quest is a slapstick comedy that is smart and does not go over the edge with its humorous material. It leaves room for several other essential elements such as happiness romance honesty excitement and contains a dramatic purpose. The story is very original and contains a firm theme of action in its premise. It also has lots of outstanding visual effects and sight gags that are effective and interesting to watch. Although the film gets a little offtrack near the end Galaxy Quest is still  high energy laughs audiences will come to the theater expecting. This is one of the most victorious movies of this year in its execution of the script because we anticipate what we are going to view is a silly comic spoof. Even though parts of the film fit that definition in the end we end up with a lot more than that.Brought to you by DreamWorks Pictures.".

Galaxy Quest is right up there with Toy Story in merit it entertains adults and children alike standing out as one of the year's best family films. The story details the adventures of a canceled television science fiction fantasy cast similar in content to Star Trek. Galaxy Quest is the name of the program. In their years the stars including Jason Nesmith Gwen DeMarco Fred Kwan Alexander Dane and Tommy Webber were some of the biggest most popular names in TV. Now their means of making a living is signing fans' autographs for a price and being cast in amateur presentations. There is very detailed character development here. The characters are wonderfully cast and brilliantly portrayed. Unfortunately most family films don't contain the patience for such necessary material. We bond with these characters they are likable funny energetic and independent.  These individuals are the key of success to this kind of movie.The real plot begins when strange people come to Jason beging for him to save their existence from a powerful evil force who wishes to wipe them out of the universe forever. Naturally at first our television star is skeptical but when the strange people turn out to be humble aliens and transport Jason to their spaceship he realizes this is something serious. The aliens begin to explain that they think he and his Galaxy Quest team are the only people in the universe who can save their race. He rushes to the members of his old cast and tries to justify his experience. He says that there are extraterrestrial creatures who require the help of their Galaxy Quest characters. None of his friends believe him but once again give in when they find themselves transported off earth onto the creature's spaceship.  Of course the aliens don't realize that their hopeful heroes are simply out of work actors but who needs to tell them? So it is up to Commander Peter Quincy Taggart Lt. Tawny Madison Tech Sergeant Chen Dr. Lazarus of Tev'Meck and Lt. Laredo to save the day for our innocent and haunted alien life forms. Galaxy Quest is a slapstick comedy that is smart and does not go over the edge with its humorous material. It leaves room for several other essential elements such as happiness romance honesty excitement and contains a dramatic purpose. The story is very original and contains a firm theme of action in its premise. It also has lots of outstanding visual effects and sight gags that are effective and interesting to watch. Although the film gets a little offtrack near the end Galaxy Quest is still  high energy laughs audiences will come to the theater expecting. This is one of the most victorious movies of this year in its execution of the script because we anticipate what we are going to view is a silly comic spoof. Even though parts of the film fit that definition in the end we end up with a lot more than that.Brought to you by DreamWorks Pictures.";

But the film isn't mere silliness as it does have a soul and tells an action adventure story of 5 hasbeen stars of a famous StarTrektype TV show that got cancelled two decades ago. The screenplay is great and the dialogues are witty fun. There is no crude humour or overthetopoutofcontext joke.The special effects wonderfully add to the spoofiness.

	schema:reviewBody "I like a good spoofcomedy movie when it is done right. As far as spoof movies go though there are those that are really unfunny and a waste of time which applies to 2001A Space Travesty and anything by Friedberg and Seltzer. There is also the kind that has hit and miss moments but reasonably entertaining Spaceballs in my opinions belongs under this category. And there is the spoof that work on every level of which Young Frankenstein and this underrated gem Galaxy Quest fits like a glove.Do I have any problem with Galaxy Quest? Not with the movie itself. But I do have a problem with the way it was marketed. Like Bridge to Terabithia Lilo and Stitch Tangled and Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame Galaxy Quest was marketed terribly. For example watching the trailer I thought I was in for a mediocre comedy with substandard effects and corny dialogue. When it came to seeing the movie finally in trepidation I was shocked at how much that wasn't the case! Galaxy Quest is just brilliant and one of my favourites and has been since I first saw it.For one thing Galaxy Quest has wonderful production values. The cinematography and editing are crisp and smooth the costumes are inventive and the sets and scenery are colourful. The real revelation are the special effects which are just sublime. These special effects do not look as though they were made in a hurry or in a halfhearted fashion care has gone into constructing them and it shows. Also they enhance the story and the like in alternative to distracting from it.Galaxy Quest is not the sort of movie where the visuals are the only asset going for it. There is also David Newman's score which with its rousing energetic and clever themes and motifs compliments everything beautifully without distracting from the mood and composition of each scene. Galaxy Quest also has a strong story this story is not a predictable one instead it is fun and exciting making the most of an inspired premise not to mention it bounces along at a furious pace.The film's humour also helps elevate. Galaxy Quest's script is fantastic. No badly explored clichs or crude humour and all that in sight. It is hysterically funny very smart and quotable. Not only that the dialogue is thoughtful with a lot of heart. The references to Star Trek the movies and its fans are clever sly and wonderfully incorporated in the story and writing the characters are immensely likable and engaging as well as being alive to every character nuance and the direction is done with precision.Galaxy Quest couldn't have had a more perfect cast either. Tim Allen seems to be having a ball Sigourney Weaver is charming not to mention very very hot Alan Rickman is hilarious doing what he's best at bagging all the best lines and an endearing sense of bitterness Tony Shalhoub is the wonderful Tony Shalhoub he always is with a deliberately burnedout character and Sam Rockwell is also very good. Also Sarris is a wonderful villain an utter bastard and very ruthless with a cool demise appropriately sinister voice and awesome makeup.All in all a wonderful film and the ultimate salute to the genre it pays homage to. But there is also something special about Galaxy Quest it flawlessly satirises the acting profession and parodies fans of scifi and Star Trek without being rude about them and it is an engaging and original space saga in its own right. 1010 Bethany Cox".

His crew in this film is strong Weaver turns in a wellpreserved performance as Gwen DeMarco Lt. Tawny Madison on Galaxy Quest the show's eye candy who dutifully repeats whatever the computer says out loud and who more than exceeds the show's cleavage quotient. Rickman the villain from Die Hard among other roles is convincing as Alexander Dane Dr. Lazarus on GQ a onceserious actor who almostsuicidally laments his decision to leave what he considers a meaningless mark on history. The supporting cast is notable as well Sam Rockwell plays Guy Fleegman who gets dragged along for the ride when the crew suddenly finds itself aboard the alien ship based on their show and Tony Shaloub from the TV series Wings does well as Fred Kawn Tech Sargent Chen on GQ.Now for the plot while at a convention the Thermians confront Nesmith who is convinced they are just another group of obsessed fans in character as they inform him that their race is about to be obliterated by an evil space villain Sarris played by an overthetop Robin Sachs. Enrico Colantoni as Mathesar stands out among the Thermians a goodnatured highly intelligent species who do not understand subtle social communication such as body language sarcasm insult misdirection disinformation and deception or...the difference between reality and a TV show hence the plot. Mathasar is convinced that only Cpt. Taggart can save the Thermians from Sarris and Nesmith proudly accepts the gig the first time alone.While negotiating with Sarris Nesmith decides to end matters by firing on all cylinders and when it appears he has won he returns to earth triumphantly. All is not well however as Mathasar and company return to inform him that Sarris has survived and wants to continue negotiating. The rest of the crew is invited to join and refuses at first but decides that they won't let Nesmith steal the limelight and go along. Pretty soon they realize that they really are aboard an alien ship and soon after they realize that Sarris is a genuine threat not only to the Thermians but the entire universe as well thanks to his pursuit of the Omega 13 a reactor that could destroy the universe if used maliciously.Once the battle begins anyone who has ever seen a Star Trek episode could write the plot you have good against evil in space with the usual assortment of aliens. There is of course the token hottie alien Missi Pyle as Lailari who seems to have been based on Kirstie Alley's Savvik from Star Trek II. This movie was obviously designed for everyone who grew up on Star Trek and who pondered if the universe and the future really were the way they were depicted on the show. I give this movie a 10 simply because the writers left very little out. The movie is neither too long nor too short too serious nor too funny and it manages to explain an alien subculture the Trekkies to the general population all in the space of an hour and a half. As can be expected one of the show's most loyal fans gets to take a special journey with the crew that no one would believe if he ever tried to tell them and the ending is unapologetically overthetop in a way that captures the essence of the atmosphere at the conventions. To that extent the story is also a comingofage tale about a group of actors who when all is said and done realize with a new appreciation that there are many worse fates for an actor than to be typecast such as being forgotten without fans and without work and who seemed by the end of the film to have finally accepted that GQ is all they will ever be known for.Some scifi movies are so bad they're good. This movie is just so good it's great. A mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Star Trek is a worldwide phenomenon. Watched by millions around the globe the many series own a gigantic following and some of the most obsessive fans going. With regular conventions full of fans in costume the whole Trek universe is one long opportunity for ridicule. In 1999 therefore we were finally given a film which does it justice. Both spoofing the obsession as well as paying tribute to it Galaxy Quest is a hilarious under rated movie with an amazing comedy cast and some magnificent scenes.Jason Nesmith Tim Allen is a washed up actor who used to play Captain Peter Quincy Taggart in classic science fiction programme Galaxy Quest. Hated by his former costars Nesmith is a drunk who is living in the past. When a group of naive aliens believe Nesmith to actually be the real captain however Nesmith recruits the remainder of the cast to join him on a Galaxy Quest mission with a difference. This time it's real.Blatantly poking fun at the original cast of the first series of Star Trek this wonderful film is a piece of hilarious ingenuity. Referencing so many cult ideas from the world of science fiction it inspires humour by pointing out things which any fan knows and loves.Led by a truly brilliant performance by Allen the film is also aided by comedy turns by Sigourney Weaver Alan Rickman and Sam Rockwell. All pull their weight and add to the story especially Weaver who excellently pokes fun at the use of women in classic science fiction.In fact it's hard to really find flaw with the film. The Thermian race might be a bit annoying at times but then they're meant to be. The film is so funny throughout though a scene involving a corpse and the viewscreen in particular is enough to make you fall off your chair that if you have ever been interested in Star Trek you just can't help but love it.Definitely designed as a treat for fans this wonderful comedy is brilliant at paying tribute through spoof of one of the biggest television series of all time.

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS Star Trek is a worldwide phenomenon. Watched by millions around the globe the many series own a gigantic following and some of the most obsessive fans going. With regular conventions full of fans in costume the whole Trek universe is one long opportunity for ridicule. In 1999 therefore we were finally given a film which does it justice. Both spoofing the obsession as well as paying tribute to it Galaxy Quest is a hilarious under rated movie with an amazing comedy cast and some magnificent scenes.Jason Nesmith Tim Allen is a washed up actor who used to play Captain Peter Quincy Taggart in classic science fiction programme Galaxy Quest. Hated by his former costars Nesmith is a drunk who is living in the past. When a group of naive aliens believe Nesmith to actually be the real captain however Nesmith recruits the remainder of the cast to join him on a Galaxy Quest mission with a difference. This time it's real.Blatantly poking fun at the original cast of the first series of Star Trek this wonderful film is a piece of hilarious ingenuity. Referencing so many cult ideas from the world of science fiction it inspires humour by pointing out things which any fan knows and loves.Led by a truly brilliant performance by Allen the film is also aided by comedy turns by Sigourney Weaver Alan Rickman and Sam Rockwell. All pull their weight and add to the story especially Weaver who excellently pokes fun at the use of women in classic science fiction.In fact it's hard to really find flaw with the film. The Thermian race might be a bit annoying at times but then they're meant to be. The film is so funny throughout though a scene involving a corpse and the viewscreen in particular is enough to make you fall off your chair that if you have ever been interested in Star Trek you just can't help but love it.Definitely designed as a treat for fans this wonderful comedy is brilliant at paying tribute through spoof of one of the biggest television series of all time. With so many glorious scenes and some terrific acting it starts well and never lets off. A must watch for science fiction fans around the world.";

	schema:headline " Successful Quest to Parody SciFi Conventions";
	schema:reviewBody "A long time ago I read a very entertaining  humorous short story in a book collection of Star Trek stories by fan authors a whimsical piece about how several of the real Trek actors such as Shatner  Nimoy get zapped into the Trek universe as if it was real and are forced to enact their TV roles in a real setting. This movie captures that whimsy and is very entertaining as a result. It begins rather mundanely  on purpose  during a standard science fiction convention in which several actors whose careers nosedived after starring in a canceled scifi TV show are relegated to these cheesy appearances signing autographs and hiding their disgust at what they've been reduced to. Well except Tim Allen who starts off very cheery until he has some ice water thrown in his face a surprisingly effective moment. All the actors playing the actors fill out their roles very well. Tim Allen used to be the Capt.Kirktype commander on the TV show Weaver played his communications officer like Uhura and always repeated computer statements Rickman was the alien doctor Shalhoub was the Scottylike tech man below decks Mitchell was the pilot like Sulu. Rockwell ends up along for the ride even though he only appeared in one episode as an expendable crewman.When everything shifts about 20 minutes in it's not very subtle. All of a sudden these hasbeen actors are thrust into a very real galactic adventure. It's kind of a jawdropping scene meant to inspire awe and at the same time the humor is quite clever and thought out. The actors' reactions when they're first transported over several light years are priceless. And even in already good moments like these the filmmakers throw in an extra little slice of comedy as one of the actors does not react as expected. Rickman stands out a bit as the huffy British actor showing exasperation in almost every scene he's in but it's never tiresome. Weaver  Allen exceed expectations however we're not used to seeing them in roles such as this. Allen is known for comedy but here he's expected to draw out a character with a long history as a pretentious sometimes failed actor and he succeeds nicely. Rockwell nails the role of the nervous 3rdstringer a throwaway part usually which he somehow manages to use to steal a scene or two. And Shalhoub who we're used to being interesting by now is very much so as the somewhat oddly serene member of the group. But the biggest surprises are Mitchell  Colantoni whom I was unfamiliar with Mitchell is terrifically funny attempting to navigate the real starship while Colantoni offers the most unique interpretation of how a real alien would act  speak.There was obvious tinkering just before release of this movie to avoid a harsher rating or reduce the length but these changes could not remove the charm of this scifi parody. And simply labeling it parody may not do it justice. I think only those Trekkers who regard Star Trek as their personal religion may be offended by it otherwise any Trek fan should applaud this as mostly a tribute to such entertaining TV shows recognizing all the little reminders of what made them such great shows. The theme of tolerance for example is represented by the strangely different but similartous aliens who the audience cannot help but grow very fond of by the end of the story. On top of that the socalled scifi geek fans usually the object of scorn are made the heroes by the end of the film. Everyone has their value in such a universe.".

It settles for witty anecdotes and good tasteful material instead of riotous sex related jokes and cheap visual gags.

You will have an idea of the quality of this movie. I wrote this comment only to add something I didn't saw in the others comments The movie is so good that its 1h40 duration seems too short. So if you buy or rent the DVD don't forget to look at the deleted scenes. They are all worth it and some of them are excellent. Usually when I look at deleted scenes from other movies I understand why they have been cut most of the time because they don't bring anything interesting to the movie. But that's not the case here. The deleted scenes of Galaxy Quest are so good that a question arise who is the half wit who decided to delete these scenes ?! OK the film would have reached more than 2 hours. So what ? 2 hours of quality is better than 1h40 !".

On a purely visual level though some comment has to be made regarding what is perhaps Sigourney Weaver's most glamorous screen role far more reminiscent of Barbarella than Ellen Ripley. Comedy drama and a feelgood ending  this film really does have it all.

That's what the writing instructors tell you. But a novel about a writer makes it seem like writing is all you know. Who except other writers would want to read it?  The opening scenes of Wonder Boys however buried whatever hangups I had.  This story is less about writing than it is about the tortured souls that produce it.This film is a departure from anything I've seen before. Really has there ever been another major studio movie set in Pittsburgh? It's about time. Here's another departure Wonder Boys triumphs as a character study. How many comedies can claim this? And a great comedy it is. Who can't appreciate the fact that one of the most important characters driving the story is a blind dog that's locked in a car trunk for most of the movie?Not to be upstaged by said dog Michael Douglas turns in his best performance since Wall Street. Douglas plays the ultimate tortured soul Grady Tripp a muchrespected awardwinning and soontobe divorced University of Pittsburgh writing prof wrestling as many artists do with a novel that refuses to end. One of his students James Leer Tobey Maguire in his best performance ever is trying his hardest to be a poor struggling artist and is looking to be inspired. James all but cons his way into Grady's life and the scenes between these two crackle with life. James has his own novel he's finished and Grady's editor Terry Crabtree Robert Downey Jr. believes he's found a true wonder boy' the next big thing. The film then dangles these questions in front of us How will Grady find a balance between helping James fulfilling James' expectations of his hero and dealing with the fact that this kid is On The Verge while he himself is on page 1163 and counting?  Always poignant and dazzling the film's writer never strays from his characters in favor of overdramatization. Many opportunities exist and Mr. Kloves always wisely passes.Grady's relationship problems are also piling up. The story takes place over the course of one weekend and Grady is faced with one dilemma after another involving his married girlfriend Sara Frances MacDormand the school's chancellor his boarder and student Hannah Katie Holmes who will shine once she finds that good meaty starring role and of course his estranged wife played by no one at all.There's a lot to love about Wonder Boys and I assure you I've merely grazed the surface. The real reason I went to see it though it looked interesting enough from the trailers was Curtis Hanson. I liked parts of L.A. Confidential enough to see what other tricks he has up his sleeve. I must say that his work here is much more accomplished than Confidential despite the fact that most critics thought it deserved to beat Titanic a couple of years back. I hope this gives you an idea of just how good I think Wonder Boys is. Unfortunately this is an earlyyear lowbudget comedy about scholarly people and Mr. Hanson will most likely be recognized for the mystery thriller that came before it.I want to be wrong so don't miss Wonder Boys.Grade A".

Man was I wrong. Wonder Boys is the kind of small oddball little film with a definite quirky dark sense of humour and a cast of eccentric characters that are never colourful for the sake of it. Michael Douglas disappears completely into the role of Grady Tripp a burnt out English professor who once wrote a much celebrated novel but has since been having a hard time with his followup. He just keeps writing and writing with no end in sight current page count sits around 2100 pages!. the film starts at the beginning of a truly hellish day for Tripp as his wife leaves him his girlfriend tells him she's pregnant and he almost gets killed by her husband's blind dog. throw in an eccentric writing protege Tobey Maguire Tripp's bisexual literary agent Robert Downey Jr. and his transvestite date and you've got quite an interesting mix of characters. in some ways Douglas' character is a potsmoking burnout like the Dude from THE BIG LEBOWSKI. he is content to live outside of society putt around write his novel teaching his classes but when he crosses paths with Maguire's character he realizes that he's got to change. Douglas is more than up for this role. i'm not a huge fan of the man's work WALL STREET and THE GAME excepted but he's perfectly cast in this film. he hits just the right note of worldweary cynicism but with a romantic streak buried underneath. you can tell that he's got the capacity to do something about his miserable lot in life and during the course of the film his character undergoes a fascinating arc. the real stand out of this film though is Tobey Maguire. i've only seen him in a few things here and there and i never really noticed him all that much before although he was great in PLEASANTVILLE. everyone in the film keeps harping on what a genius writer Douglas' character is but it quickly becomes apparent that Maguire's character is the true genius. he writes pages and pages of beautiful prose in minutes. and like any true talent it just comes pouring out of him effortlessly. Maguire nails that kind of visionary talent perfectly. his character is so different from his peers and you are never sure what makes him tick until 34 of the way through when another side of his intriguing personality is revealed. at first you think his character is pretty onedimensional  the oddball genius  but Maguire provides all sorts of layers and subtle nuances to his character that are great to watch. it doesn't hurt that Steve Kloves' script is a solid piece of writing. clever insightful dialogue that tells you volumes about these characters. the dialogue is humourous and offbeat in one scene touching and thoughtful in the next. Kloves also wisely avoids the usual cliches... ie. the romance between the older man and younger woman. just when you think it's going to go there the film veers off to something different and better. every character has their moment to really define themselves with the possible exception of Katie Holmes who seems to be sorely underused. which is too bad really because the scenes she does have are good. it's nice to see that she can do more than just DAWSON'S CREEK. and lastly the mood and atmosphere of this movie is so magical. to me the best films are ones that you lose yourself in completely. the characters and the world they inhabit are so real so threedimensional that you can't help but get sucked in. WONDER BOYS does that so well. the attention to detail  a snowy winter in Pittsburgh  is beautiful realized. esp. the night time scenes like one in which Douglas and Maguire talk outside in a backyard while the snow falls gently around them... are so well done i felt like i was right there. and isn't that what a good film should do? make it able for you to escape for a couple of hours? hard to believe that the guy who made L.A. CONFIDENTIAL did this one. a complete change of pace and mood and... everything. amazing stuff. anyways i reallly dug WONDER BOYS. it's the first film i've seen this year that has really affected me in a profoundly personal way. a film that as soon as it was over i wanted to go right back in and watch it again.".

	schema:headline " WONDERful";
	schema:reviewBody "Not many people have heard of this film. It's not what the masses want they yearn for Men In Black II Legally Blonde Die Another Day and so on. This minor gem is strange unconventional rich and moving. It is a classically written character study with unexpected comic twists and turns from every angle. You feel warmer for having watched this movie and it is a shame that films like these only occur once or twice a year.Grady Tripp Michael Douglas is a middleaged professor of English and is writing his second novel The Wonder Boys'. However this character is not a stereotypical teacher but a fantastically original creation emphasized by Douglas' winning performance. He smokes weed and lives with a student of his Katie Holmes he is in the midst of his third divorce and is in love with his married boss Sara Gaskell Frances McDormand and that second novel is forever incomplete and has been for seven years. One of his pupils is James Leer played to perfection by Tobey Maguire who writes amazingly obtuse stories and is obsessed with the death of film stars. James and Grady become partners in crime when they shoot Sara's blind dog and steal the coat Marilyn Monroe was married in. From here on in we are absorbed into the life of Grady and those around him from his publisher terry Crabtree Downey jr to his writer rival Q. we see lives slowly fall apart relationships blossom a novel disappear into the wind and a black dude who refuses to be called Vernon Hardapple all in one weekend.Wonder Boys never disappoints. It's dry humour and bizarre imagination never stops for a second and we are glued with a grin on our faces. Hardly realistic the audience can still feel for the characters as their lives spiral into a comic frenzy. Grady and his offbeat world crumbling around him as he searches for happiness Terry the flamboyant homosexual who puts on a brave face believing in others as he searches for a comeback novel which he will not get from Grady James the loner who needs to release the genius within himself. These are the wonder boys. Frances McDormand and Katie Holmes gladly take a back seat in the story as this film refuses to be weighed down by sap.The acting is flawless with at least two superb supporting roles. Robert Downey jr sparkles in his greatest role since Chaplin but it is Tobey Maguire who makes us feel he has always been that awkward deadpan student that is James Leer.

	onyx:emotionText "Not many people have heard of this film. It's not what the masses want they yearn for Men In Black II Legally Blonde Die Another Day and so on. This minor gem is strange unconventional rich and moving. It is a classically written character study with unexpected comic twists and turns from every angle. You feel warmer for having watched this movie and it is a shame that films like these only occur once or twice a year.Grady Tripp Michael Douglas is a middleaged professor of English and is writing his second novel The Wonder Boys'. However this character is not a stereotypical teacher but a fantastically original creation emphasized by Douglas' winning performance. He smokes weed and lives with a student of his Katie Holmes he is in the midst of his third divorce and is in love with his married boss Sara Gaskell Frances McDormand and that second novel is forever incomplete and has been for seven years. One of his pupils is James Leer played to perfection by Tobey Maguire who writes amazingly obtuse stories and is obsessed with the death of film stars. James and Grady become partners in crime when they shoot Sara's blind dog and steal the coat Marilyn Monroe was married in. From here on in we are absorbed into the life of Grady and those around him from his publisher terry Crabtree Downey jr to his writer rival Q. we see lives slowly fall apart relationships blossom a novel disappear into the wind and a black dude who refuses to be called Vernon Hardapple all in one weekend.Wonder Boys never disappoints. It's dry humour and bizarre imagination never stops for a second and we are glued with a grin on our faces. Hardly realistic the audience can still feel for the characters as their lives spiral into a comic frenzy. Grady and his offbeat world crumbling around him as he searches for happiness Terry the flamboyant homosexual who puts on a brave face believing in others as he searches for a comeback novel which he will not get from Grady James the loner who needs to release the genius within himself. These are the wonder boys. Frances McDormand and Katie Holmes gladly take a back seat in the story as this film refuses to be weighed down by sap.The acting is flawless with at least two superb supporting roles. Robert Downey jr sparkles in his greatest role since Chaplin but it is Tobey Maguire who makes us feel he has always been that awkward deadpan student that is James Leer. For those who have seen Pleasantville and The Cider House Rules will recognise Maguire for the talant he is it almost makes one feel he sold out when taking the SpiderMan role and here he has been sadly overlooked for a Best Supporting Actor nomination.

	schema:reviewBody "At a recent Dylan concert my friend Charlie pointed out a shiny gold statuette placed unobtrusively atop one of the speakers way in the back of the stage. It was the Oscar which Dylan won for his Best Song Things Have Changed from this movie from The Wonder Boys. I was glad that my friend pointed out that gold thing in the background because it added a whole other dimension to the concert. There was a story behind the statue  the whole Wonder Boys story and I was glad to be familiar with it. No Bob never mentioned the statue. Why should he? He's Bob Dylan. He just did his thing played his music. Life presents us with the absurd as much as it does the mundane. Watching the way people handle the good and bad drama in their life is a hobby of mine. I liked the way Bob Dylan kept his Wonder Boys gold quietly present. Michael Douglas' Grady Tripp doesn't call attention to his abnormally odd weekend either. Douglas' Grady always maintains his cool even with a transvestite's tuba and his mistress' husband's dead dog and the Crabtree pharmacopoeia in the trunk of his assmarked car. Grady deals with all of it. Grady deals with everything this peculiar weekend shows him  with a calm voice and an attitude mellowed from either age or experience or pot. In the here and now he is calm and quiet but we all know that he'll have his anxiety or heart attack quietly near offstage with as few crowds and drama about them as possible. Grady speaks lines like gimme the gun James matter of factly the same way that his married girlfriend tells him she's pregnant the same way he'd order a drink from Oola. Why add drama and histrionics to the mix? He is what he is. Things are the way they are  even though things have changed. One of the things that separates one human from another is the way we deal with change. isn't it? Personally? I want to hear about the absurdities of life. I like observing how people deal with it all. I like those stories. Tripp's fellow travelers are in flux too  it's not just Grady going through change  his wife unseen his mistress France McDormand his editor Robert Downey Jr. his students Tobey Maguire and Katie Holmes  all of them are experiencing an extraordinary weekend but there's hardly a voice raised in the storytelling. The soundtrack alone is worth the viewing thanks Bob Dylan! And Curtis Hansen Michael Chabon  tell me another story please! If you can manage to bring a similarly wonderful ensemble cast  even better!".

The great Curtis Hanson which for my money is the one of the most consistently excellent director working makes this film have a wonderful feel which is important because the words on a page have texture feeling and purpose.

Robert Downey Jr. devours this character up and becomes another memorable quotable relatable entity on film. How does he do it? And of course two solids Michael Douglas and Frances McDormand. It's funny how smaller lesser known films that are of great quality like this don't need an ad campaign that leaves everyone nauseous with dilution I've seen the preview so often if they were showing the film I would be out by now destroy the drum to let you know what great singers cum actors are in this spectacle or how extreme we can be for the sake of a plot. Wonder Boys is about people. People who are at the juncture. It's like a group of friends that came to school live together in a house share great times and will part only to have the memories. The time will never be genuine again only the memory. This film is about that juncture. What's more to say except if more films were like this I would be seeing more films in the theater. Simple not trying to overextend everyone has a story or in the right hands they can make a up a great one for you. Even the President of the James Brown Hair Club.There's a reason the best films at the academy awards are the ones up for Best Screenplay 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "If I could write a screenplay with the quality of one tenth of the movie Wonder Boys I'd be enormously happy. If I could write a novel with a smidgen of one hundredth of the source material Wonder Boys by Michael Chabon I'd have died and gone to literary Heaven.This movie is literally perfect and is directed by Curtis Hanson director of another one of my all time favorite movies L.A. Confidential. I love stories that take place in 24 or less hours but willing to accept movies that span a lifealtering weekend in which this is.This movie is about growing realizing waking up making choicesbut mostly about characters.I side mostly with Prof. Grady Tripp played elegantly by Michael Douglas. NO ONE could have done better. He's the college professor who everyone wants who I would want. Not perfect by any means He smokes more pot than he eats munchies he had a onehit wonder hence the title of the movie a true wonder boy but has hit a brick wall since and he's attempting just to make it through life without making a choice to make him think. Though it appears on the surface he doesn't care he does have a dash of humanity left. There's something in him some spark that's still alive but barely.I see a lot of myself in him  even though I don't partake in the pot smoking. We both carry the empty shell of the person we were once. Only this is fiction and in his lifechanging weekend as portrayed in the film he grows and the spark gets brighter. If only we could imitate fiction.Then there's Terry Crabtree the sometimes gay played beautifully by Robert Downey Jr. This is LONG before his career began again that is. I admired him so much in this his quick wit his neverending believability in his acting and that all shot Downey Jr. straight to the top ten of my Best Actors list. In addition I began noticing another up'n'comer little closer Tobey Maguire. Though he was really good in his James Leer role he seemed like he wasn't quite there yet. Read the book and you'll experience the depth this character really had. In Wonder Boys Maguire did add humor humility and originality but he eventually would show all of those qualities greater in later projects.The remaining crew were good but were always in the shadows of the above mentioned characters. Rip Torn was wonderful in his Great Writer Extraordinaire role. Frances McDormand was acceptable as the mistress Sara with issues of her own. The weakest link but still watchable was Katie Holmes as Hannah Green as the seductive student housemate of Tripp with blatantly obvious motivations though she really set the tone and balanced the Leer character when they joined the screen or mentioned each other.Beyond the fantastic characters was the excellent script the cinematography the freeness and freshness of the characters the great symbolism of the bridges  really notice how many there were and why the dialogue was pitch perfect the humor makes me roll each time and the pacing absolutely dead on. It's slow but it makes you really fit into these lives. They couldn't have sped it up a second more or slowed it down any further. You get enthralled in growing with them experiencing and seeing what they endure and yearn for a better outcome for all involved.Let's jump back to Tripp. He's a middletolate aged male. He's got it together prior to the weekend in the movie but he's also VERY human. The movie begins as the Professor defends his student Leer in his dark tales of literature. Prior to this his wife has left him for good supposedly. His mistress is both pregnant and married to his boss and she disavows not only his pot smoking lifestyle but his aimless ambition. He tries to make the right decisions but fails then just acts like someone half his age to make up and continue what his younger self would've done. Have a fun adventure.His mission is to save James Leer from self destruction. It's painfully obvious he's really in it to save himself but nevertheless leaves a good enough impression on the boy Leer to do some good in the world while balancing his love Sara the nagging of his failing publisher keeping his job and his roommate at bay. Heck I didn't even mention the dog or car. There really is a lot packed in to this movie and in reality if he were to step back this would not have been the weekend to change. Butthere we go.All this depth all this wonderful filmmaking with heart and yet it still manages to fit in a fantastic soundtrack which includes one of my alltime favorite songs let alone one of my alltime favorite moviesongs Things Have Changed by Bob Dylan. I didn't grow up Dylan but this like Johnny Cash's The Man Comes Around from Dawn of the Dead opened my eyes wide.As I began this review I pointed out I couldn't write anywhere near the quality of this film. In reality I don't care. I write what I write. They write how they see fit. Stepping aside I truly admire both this screenplay and performances. They captured enough of one of the greatest books I've ever read to truly capture what the essence of the original story portrayed. My advice See the movie and then experience the book. Your life will be enhanced.".

	schema:reviewBody "2000 was a great year for Michael Douglas.  He hit pay dirt with two critically acclaimed movies.  The box office hit Traffic and a notseenbymanygem Wonder Boys.  And that's a shame because this is one terrific movie.  Douglas who usually plays arrogant characters is a down on his luck professor who has been trying for seven years to write a follow up novel.  But he spends much of his time smoking marijuana that is when he's not fooling around with the dean's wife.  All this comes to a head in one hellish weekend when his wife leaves him his girlfriend Frances McDormand tells him she's pregnant his zany editor Crabtree is in town Robert Downey Jr. from New York and wants his novel he's nowhere near being finished and he gets involved in a hilarious crime with his talentedbuttroubled student James Leer Tobey Maguire.  This is one of those rare movies where everything works.  Everything.  The screenplay is brilliant.  We find Douglas caught in one funny situation after another. Take note of where the movie is shot.  It's set in Pittsburgh during the winter and the inclement weather is a reflection of the doom and gloom that inhabits the Professor's world.  It's great to see actors who've established themselves by playing certain type of characters flip it around and convincingly portray characters that are the exact opposite of all those established roles Think Jim Carrey in the Truman Show or Robin Williams in One Hour Photo.  Douglas absolutely shines.  Gone is the vanity the cockiness.  His Professor Tripp is haggard wears frumpy clothes and walks with a limp I won't explain how.  Maguire is perfection as Leer.  I literally forgot I was watching the future SpiderMan.  I truly respect him as an actor because he never overacts.  Most young actors would have tried to force emotion into the characer but he didn't.  He constantly kept me on edge because he's so mysterious.  I didnt know if I was to like the guy or to not trust a single word that came out of his mouth.  Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene he's in.  Because he's constantly in the news due to his drug problem I actually forgot what an amazing actor he is.  To round it out McDormand Katie Holmes and Rip Torn were all great too.  This is one of those movies where it's funny because of the performances.  The nuances of the characters it's very subtle.  It's an antiFarrelly Brothers comedy.  And that's a good thing.  A very good thing.  My only disappoinment is the fact that it's not ranked on IMDB Top 250.  One of the best movies of 2000 and it's nowhere to be found and yet the latest brain dead installment of Star Wars Attack of the Clones has cracked the top 250. How bizarre!!!   10 out 10".

This was especially apparent in the 2000 ceremony where a summer blockbuster a popcorn movie won the coveted best picture Oscar. Gladiator was entertaining a movie with a large head but no brain. It was a movie you watch and forget about the next day and it won. Truth be told the year 2000 was not a great year for the movies. Coming off a spectacular 1999 year in which we saw at least 15 great films 2000 was rather uneventful. But there were 5 great movies and only two were nominated for best picture. Traffic and Crouching Tiger were nominated and the other three were almost completely snuffed in every category. Almost Famous You Can Count On Me and finally Wonder Boys were the rest of the best and were ignored by the fools at the academy. It's almost a toss up as to which film was THE best but my personal favorite was Wonder Boys Though I treasure the other four greatly. Michael Douglas is stunning in what is in my not so humble opinion by far his best performance and role ever. He is spectacular and with each scene he out does what he did in the last one. The supporting cast is also stellar and compliments Douglas perfectly. I loved the screen play. I even read it twice after viewing the movie and I've never read a script in my life. The cinematography is also excellent and the directing is flawless same guy who did L.A. Confidential another classic. Well just watch this movie if you haven't seen it and enjoy a great film also check out the other 4 I mentioned.".

	schema:headline " Literary Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Films about writers present directors and screenwriters with a rather unenviable task. Writing is an internal activity thereby the rendering this activity in a visual medium can prove tedious for the audience. Most films about writers then tend to focus on biographical developments writing is secondary to the overall plot. When these films also explore writing they are gussied up like Secret Window with the trappings of other genres or they're dull like The Hours.Sometimes though a director and screenwriter create a magical film about writers and writing that is not only entertaining and intelligent but also fairly indicative of the writing process. The Man From Elysian Fields a terrific contemporary morality play that has not received nearly enough attention and this film are perfect examples.Wonder Boys is an absolute trip on every level it's also an absolute treat. Curtis Hanson as the director reveals that his surehandedness in LA Confidential was no fluke. He's even better here eliciting fantastic performances from every actor and treating a rather zany concept with realism and dignity. This juxtaposition serves the story brilliantly for though it at times seems absurd the absurdity never wanders overtakes the genuine and palpable emotions and perfect realism of the characters. Individual events occur in this movie that without the previous 10 events would be implausible. Given the narrative though the most insane developments follow the film's own logic. In this way Wonder Boys is a screwball comedy for the 21st century carrying on the spirit of Bringing Up Baby without really referencing those types of films overtly which is whY Wonder Boys is far more successful than the Hudsucker Proxy. That Hanson can keep this situation under control is amazing.As mentioned above Wonder Boys is also filled with amazing performances particularly by Michael Douglas who though always a favorite of mine never seems to pick roles that demand much of him. He gives Grady humor and humanity which is precisely what Mr. Tripp needs. The other actors Frances McDormand Robert Downey Jr. Katie Holmes and Tobey Maguire all give performances that rival their best work. Though this is not surprising of Downey McDormand and Maguire Holmes truly astounds. Sure her portrayal of Libbets in the Ice Storm was excellent but what about those other movies? She was okay but they were undemanding roles. Thankfully she has started taking on some more mature roles Pieces of April for instance and will I think surprise everyone in a couple years.I also have to commend the screen writing. As I said writing a movie about writers and writing is difficult and Steven Kloves does an admirable job. What's even more impressive is his adaptation of Michael Chabon's great novel. Kloves cuts judiciously from the original text and maintains the spirit of the novel. That rarely occurs and this adaptation should be required reading for any budding screenwriter.Wonder Boys is a great and underrated film for me it's one of the five best released in this decade. It's sad serious funny and bizarre. It's everything a relatively mainstream movie should be.".

	onyx:emotionText "Films about writers present directors and screenwriters with a rather unenviable task. Writing is an internal activity thereby the rendering this activity in a visual medium can prove tedious for the audience. Most films about writers then tend to focus on biographical developments writing is secondary to the overall plot. When these films also explore writing they are gussied up like Secret Window with the trappings of other genres or they're dull like The Hours.Sometimes though a director and screenwriter create a magical film about writers and writing that is not only entertaining and intelligent but also fairly indicative of the writing process. The Man From Elysian Fields a terrific contemporary morality play that has not received nearly enough attention and this film are perfect examples.Wonder Boys is an absolute trip on every level it's also an absolute treat. Curtis Hanson as the director reveals that his surehandedness in LA Confidential was no fluke. He's even better here eliciting fantastic performances from every actor and treating a rather zany concept with realism and dignity. This juxtaposition serves the story brilliantly for though it at times seems absurd the absurdity never wanders overtakes the genuine and palpable emotions and perfect realism of the characters. Individual events occur in this movie that without the previous 10 events would be implausible. Given the narrative though the most insane developments follow the film's own logic. In this way Wonder Boys is a screwball comedy for the 21st century carrying on the spirit of Bringing Up Baby without really referencing those types of films overtly which is whY Wonder Boys is far more successful than the Hudsucker Proxy. That Hanson can keep this situation under control is amazing.As mentioned above Wonder Boys is also filled with amazing performances particularly by Michael Douglas who though always a favorite of mine never seems to pick roles that demand much of him. He gives Grady humor and humanity which is precisely what Mr. Tripp needs. The other actors Frances McDormand Robert Downey Jr. Katie Holmes and Tobey Maguire all give performances that rival their best work. Though this is not surprising of Downey McDormand and Maguire Holmes truly astounds. Sure her portrayal of Libbets in the Ice Storm was excellent but what about those other movies? She was okay but they were undemanding roles. Thankfully she has started taking on some more mature roles Pieces of April for instance and will I think surprise everyone in a couple years.I also have to commend the screen writing. As I said writing a movie about writers and writing is difficult and Steven Kloves does an admirable job. What's even more impressive is his adaptation of Michael Chabon's great novel. Kloves cuts judiciously from the original text and maintains the spirit of the novel. That rarely occurs and this adaptation should be required reading for any budding screenwriter.Wonder Boys is a great and underrated film for me it's one of the five best released in this decade.

	schema:reviewBody "WONDER BOYS  2000 Starring Michael Douglas Tobey Maguire Frances McDormand Katie Holmes Robert Downey Jr. Rip Torn and Richard Thomas Directed by Curtis Hanson. Written by Steve Kloves based on the novel by Michael Chabon. Running time 112 minutes. Rated R for strong drug use and for language.I have always dreamed of becoming a professional writer for a living. Curtis Hanson's new comic drama Wonder Boys is as accurate and enriching to my opinions and hopes as any movie I have seen. This is a wonderful inspiring motion pictureone of the years best. It is a movie that enlightens our culture and moves us passionately while at the same time provides the audience with laughter and moral aspects. This is a great movie to start out the new year. The film stars the extraordinary Michael Douglas as a college professor named Grady Tripp who is around fifty years old. He has written an award winning novel Arsonist's Daughter  seven years ago. Since however his follow up is drifting and unfocused wondering over 2600 single spaced pages in length. Although he does not believe in it everyone thinks he has writer's block. There is an assortment of characters and events brilliantly portrayed within the film's setup all surrounding Grady. His third wife recently left him due to her loneliness. He is having an affair with the University's chancellor Sara Gasket Frances McDormand who has become pregnant after several implied encounters and happens to be the wife of his boss the chairman of the English department Walter Richard Thomas. A foreign loony man Vernon Richard Knox is furious over something to do with Tripp's automobile. His bisexual and antsy editor Crabtree Robert Downey Jr. appearing with the company of a transvestite desiring to take a look at Grady's long overdue writing piece but uses the towns writer's conference as an ulterior motive. Also present a high held writer named Q Rip Torn who raises the stress for Tripp and two students of his Hannah Katie Holmes who rents a room out of his house and may even be willing to sleep with Grady and his most brilliant author James Leer Tobey Maguire who bonds with him as the movie progresses. A lot occurs in Wonder Boys and the plot is very labyrinthine although it never becomes confused and always keeps its cool. The characters are perfectly defined and cast. Their intentions and motives are clear and developed with shape and gradual effectiveness. Curtis Hanson pays close attention to each separate character giving them dimensional qualities intelligence and depth. Complications arise when several key events take place. There is a Monroe artifact stolen from the chancellor's closet and her pet dog ends up shot to death when James defends Grady who is being attacked. These occurrences lead to bondings between Grady Tripp and James Heather and just about every other character in the film. Heather says in one scene that Tripp's novel would be much better if he would lay off the marijuana usage. She is correct. Grady often lives under the influence and this is just one of the ideas the film looks at along with family dysfunction adultery abortions theft abuse severe loss and even violence. All these concepts apply to the morality of the movie.The narrative through line enhances the story and characters thoroughly. Each scene propels the plot forward either creating a new conflict or complicating a previous one. This film contains one of the most stolid structures I have seen all year. The conclusion of Wonder Boys is effectual and sums up everything in an apprehensive manorand is of the same standards as its previous material. How rare is it to screen a movie when the finale is just as engaging as the overall story.Wonder Boys contains dialogue that is decisive and smart. It has a wickedly witty mood but is still beautifully written and portrayed. Improving the production is the moody atmosphere of a light thrillerand it still overlaps with comic travesty. Although the film is more conceptual than actual and empowered with overtones rather than reflexive relief the laughs are still frequent the intrigue is constant and the statement is clear.I also liked the film's visual style and cinematography. From the fitting soundtrack to the story's presentation the atmospheres is absolutely mesmerizing from start to finish. Especially wonderful are the sequences in which it snows in the evening. The way the glistening white flakes drift gently down onto the ground from a peaceful and dark sky captures the characters emotional aspects is just stunning. Even the costuming scenery and tone are skillful. Michael Douglas known for characters more active than Grady Tripp is utterly marvelous here. James writes in a page of his work that Grady who was once capable for inspiring a world is now unable to inspire himself. This painfully true scene in captured flawlessly by his Oscar worthy performance. As he and the other earth shattering performers entice the audience we feel much emotion for these characters. So much that we do not realize it until the closing credits role past. Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.".

To make is life harder his wife leaves him his lover announces she is pregnant his protg goes off the rails or claims to and his editor turns up with his transvestite lover looking for a book.I missed this at the cinema but had heard good things about it and the cast seemed to suggest a very good film.  The plot summary is a little more than a summary of the various little happenings within the film as that is as close to a narrative flow as I could do.  The plot here is not that good and is spread over characters who come and go like players in a sketch rather than people.  What the film actually does well is a look at the character of Grady and the learning experience that these various little events bring him to.While this is weakened by the lack of a strong traditional plot it is not weakened to the point that it doesn't work  it would only have worked better with a better plot.  As it is it still manages to be quite bitter sweet and interesting enough to keep watching.  I considered it a disadvantage that the sketchlike events were more comic than anything else when the central character had more of a touch of the tragic to him  these were not balanced very well and the comic took something away from the more tragic character but it still worked reasonably well.Douglas gave one of his best performances here  he is sensitive and understated and he plays it without glamour the whole way.  The support cast are also all good even if some of them have very little to really do in the grand scheme of things.  Downey Jnr is in fine comic form but his actual character is more of a mystery.  Maguire is a good actor but he plays his cards too close to his chest and the script isn't as interested in him as it suggests by the first half of the film leading to the feeling that he has just been forgotten in the later stages.  Holmes is cute but very sidelined and it is very much Douglas' film in line with the characteroverplot focus of the film.Overall this is a rather more lowkey film than the heavy cast list would suggest and it may prove a bit disappointing to some viewers as a result.

That is what ultimately ruined this movie for me.Which is why I am so surprised to see such an the inordinate amount of highpraising reviews. Did we all see the same movie here? Were you all seriously tricked into thinking this movie was as clever and witty as it so shamelessly boasted? It was NOT clever or witty. It was unrealistic and scattered.";

	schema:reviewBody "Respectable early entry in the King Solomon's Mines sweepstakes. No need to recap the plot. Except for a few scenic shots of the overland trek the movie doesn't really come alive until the last halfhour but from then on it's nearbrilliant. The sweeping shots of warrior armies advancing across the veldt the closein shots of the defenders with their magnificent shields the pageantry and tomfoolery of the royal court but most of all the ghastly assassination squad led by the whims of a humpback hag who moves like a creeping disease. I've seen nothing like her Sydney Fairbrother before or since but her crablike crawl over the gateway rock may make you rethink the pace of evolution. Also the whitehot caldera with the clinging ledge above amounts to a spinetingling effect for any movie period. I'm not even sure Technicolor could have improved on the staging of these remarkable scenes.Now there are no seams that I can spot during this stellar last halfhour. I couldn't tell whether the scenes were done on location in Africa or maybe even Great Britain. However the earlier scenes of the trek are marred by obvious intercutting between longshot locations and closein exterior sets poorly done. For me this breaks the spell and indicates a curious lapse in an otherwise well produced adventure film. Lee and Robeson are spirited and commanding as central figures. However I agree with a reviewer's observation that Loder would have made a more convincing Quartermain than the stiffbacked Hardwicke. Also Hardwicke and Young behave more like they belong in a gentleman's smoking club than footloose in the wilds of Africa while Young's wry asides are strictly a matter of taste and in my view a lame attempt at comic relief.Nonetheless this 1937 production is definitely worth catching up with especially for those who have never seen or heard the great Paul Robeson.".

Natives find them and after a battle for the throne the mines are eventually reached and the young woman is reunited with her dad.

This also stars Cedric Hardwicke Roland Young and Anna Lee. The special effects were good for their time especially the cave scenes with the volcano.This movie has since been remade several times and the best version is the 1950 one with Stuart Granger which I also have in my movie collection.This movie is worth checking out.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a rousing adventure story that has only a few flaws that keep it from an even higher scoreamazingly good for a film that has somehow been allowed to slip into the public domain! The film begins with a really dumb girl Anna Lee and her even dumber father Arthur Sinclair hitching a ride along with the famous Allan Quartermain Cedric Hardwicke as he goes to meet a client. It seems that Quartermain's exploits as a great white hunter are legendary though he seems a pretty likable guy who really is so unlike the two Irish idiots he happened upon. By the way I have absolutely nothing against the Irishit's just that the characters really overdo the 'I'm Irish' bit through the first part of the film.Along the way they happen upon a dying man and his cotraveler Paul Robson and they learn about some sort of treasure of King Solomon's mines. Almost instantly the father takes off in search of the treasureeven though it's blinking insane to travel through unknown African territory and through deserts to do thisalone!!! And it turns out his daughter is also an idiot as soon she steals one of Quartermain's wagons and sets off in search of her father and the treasure. Oddly Quartermain's client who has hired him for a safari Roland Young decides that he and Quartermain should follow her and try to save her from herself. I say they should have just let her die and then celebrated with some pie...but that wouldn't make a very interesting movie would it?! Eventually their insanely difficult journey brings them to a strange land where there really is an honesttogoodness treasure. But they have to battle the tribesmen AND nature to get the treasure and hopefully find the idiots and save them from themselves.Overall this is a really good African adventures story because the natives really do appear to be Africans the scenery sure looks like Africa and there is no trace of the usual stock shots of animals from Asia or South America like you'd usually see in the countless lowbudget films set in Africa that were the rage from the 1930s50s. And the story and acting are quite good though I was a bit surprised to see Hardwicke as an actionherohe's got a lovely voice and was a good actor but 'macho' is not normally a word I'd associate with him! About the only problem with the film is all of Paul Robeson's gratuitous singing. Yes he has a wonderful voice in the film but the songs seemed irrelevant to the plot and were simply tossed in because he had a great voice. Also oddly his first song sure sounded a lot like a reworking of Old Man Rivera song he made famous on Broadway and film in Showboat 1936.".

The simple story is bare bones and tells of an Irishman Patrick O'Brian Patrick Sinclair who learns of a fabulous treasure in the African Mountains and sets out for it leaving his daughter Anna Lee Kathleen O'Brian to chase after him. The famous adventurer Allan Quatermain as played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke reluctantly joins her Cmdr. John Good Roland Young Sir Henry Curtis John Loder and returning warrior Umbopa who seeks his rightful place as tribal Chief. The movie is a bit slow but expected for early Hollywood. Some dry humor accompanies the interesting tribal conflict and traditional formula.

Things only get interesting towards the end when there is a battle for control of the kingdom guarding the mine until then its mostly travel. For me the real problem is that hero Allan Quartermain is given very little to do but look stoic. To be certain Cedric Hardwicke is the perfect Quatermain there is no doubt he is completely in control no matter what is going on the trouble is he doesn't do much to back up the stance though to be fair I have no doubt he could do whatever he had to. Worth a look if you run across it but not something one need search out".

Its got Cedric Hardwicke in it who has done other Africa themed films making you right at home with this one. I personally liked the Deborah Kerr and Stewart Granger version better but again the book is the best bet and makes for interesting reading as you can't wait to find the fabled King Solomon's Mines. The premise is that Solomon not only possessed wisdom never before seen but immense Godsupported wealth making him use gold for everything as he had no money considerations whatsoever. Apparently his mines provided a great deal of this or so they would have us believe. It is a good story when told and this movie tells it good enough. I enjoyed a snack with this plus a tasty drink on standby. Imagine all that wealth sitting there and the locals paying it no mind because their spear and their hut are more important than shiny stones. The Native Indians in America had no use for gold either remarking that the little yellow nuggets drove white men mad making them want it even less. Its only as good as we say it is".

	schema:reviewBody "In reviewing people of color in film in chronological order for Black History Month we're now in 1937 when once againlike the last two of his I reviewedPaul Robeson is involved in a movie that takes place in a jungle with several tribal natives. Among them are Robert Adams and Ecco Homo Toto both of whom previously appeared with Robeson in Song of Freedom. Anyway the singeractor is traveling with several Caucasian explorers like Allan Quatermain Sir Cedric Hardwicke Kathy O'Brien Anna Lee and her father Patric Arthur Sinclair. As usual Robeson provides many compelling moments whenever singing especially when up a mountain that provides echos. Things don't really pick up until the last 30 minutes but if you don't mind some of the exposition that comes before that you won't be bored. So on that note this version of King Solomon's Mines is worth a look. P.S. The director is one Robert Stevenson who was married to Ms. Lee at the time and would later provide Walt Disney with some of his most successful live action features of which one of those Mary Poppins would get Stevenson his only Oscar nomination.".

	schema:headline " The Granddaddy of Indiana Jones but not British imperialist propaganda";
	schema:reviewBody "Note to Thinker If a movie begins with a seminaked guy banging a gong it's a British movie if with a virgin holding a torch it's from Hollywood. To spell it out this is a Gaumont British Picture Corporation picture studio of Hitchcock's The 39 Steps and The Man Who Knew Too Much 1934 as well as Supersonic Saucer Transatlantic Tunnel Mister Hobo and First a Girl which all sound absolutely fascinating. They really do. British movies of the 30s generally didn't have the budget or polish of Hollywood productions and it shows here in the weak editing of early scenes and the slender script. However they've assembled a first rate cast except for an annoying Anna Lee. Gaumont did two things you would not have seen in a Hollywood movie of the time Location shooting in Africa and giving a black man lead billing. It was a joy seeing Paul Robeson starring in a dignified role. And the African footage is probably better done than the studio scenes. Britain had regularly scheduled flying boat routes to Africa carrying British Imperial mail and passengers in luxury so the producers would have felt more comfortable shooting in Afria than their California counterparts. This is the sort of movie I would have watched as a kid on a black and white TV. The slow pace would have benefited from the commercial breaks  six minutes an hour back then unlike today when the movie provides a break from the commercials. As a kid I did not feel compelled to rate everything I watched but if I did I would have rated it It's OK. I wonder if kids could bear to sit through it today?However there is a reason that adults should watch this and a way to get kids interested maybe. King Solomon's Mines 1937  and the book  is the granddaddy of all those adventure lost world movies like the Indiana Jones franchise. Watch this and then Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade 1989 back to back. Then consider what they have in common and you will find the secret formula kids. No I'm not going to spell it out it's a secret. As a follow up ask the kids which is better and why and not just the latter's colour and special effects. Now if you really want to get creative ask the kid to write a story based on the secret formula. Who knows? H. Rider Haggard wrote this story on a five shilling wager with his brother that he couldn't write a story half as good as Treasure Island which I haven't read lately so I can't judge whether King Solomon's Mines is indeed half as good. No word on whether his brother paid up. But maybe you will raise the next Spielberg. King Solomon's Mines is no gem but it is historically significant. I have noticed of late say the last 15 years or so many British posters complaining about American movies on the slightest pretext if they are war movies because they don't provide sufficient credit to British soldiers for whatever battle is portrayed and if they are the story of an American horse that they don't mention British horses or Australian horses if the reviewer is an Australian. One British reviewer had the gall to call Seabiscuit American imperialist propaganda. Perhaps I am missing something here such as when it was that America became imperialist holders of colonies and what this has to do with a race horse in the Great Depression?Of course King Solomon's Mines is not British imperialist propaganda. Britain is not an imperialist power that holds colonies around the world and never was. Britain never waged war to protect its colonies against rebellion and revolution and it certainly never killed innocent unarmed men women and children engaged in peaceful protest. Instead this movie shows how noble and kind these rich British nonimperialists were at heart unlike the poor Irishman who would have stolen the treasure map from a dying man and the poor Irish woman who was a chronic liar and thief not to mention the homicidal maniac tribal chief. Umboba was a good man but then he was educated by the British and knew how to speak English with a Jersy accent so he was civilized. But even so he only was able to gain his rightful throne with the help of the British noblemen. No King Solomon's Mines is not British imperialistic propaganda. It just fell through a wormhole.This however does not solve the problem. The only solution is for Britain to ban the importation and viewing of all American movies because according to a consensus of British viewers they are all American imperialist propaganda no matter what they are about. While we are waiting if you are British please please please stop watching Hollywood movies. You obviously don't enjoy them. May I suggest some classic British gems like Leave It to Smith Britannia of Billingsgate East Lynne on the Western Front A Cuckoo in the Nest and Turkey Time?As a footnote the documentary series Queen Victoria's Empire  2001 an excellent programme has some scenes of traditional African native dancing. It is at night around a campfire so it is hard to see the details but the costumes have some of the elements shown in King Solomon's Mines and the drum rhythms are very similar.".

Actually Dachau wasn't even used as a POW camp. At any rate that aside they are depicted as a group of nincompoops much like the ones in the TV program Hogan's Heroes. I always thought that Stalag 17 spawned the idea for Hogan's Heroes but now I think that Hitler Dead or Alive may have been the movie that influenced Bing Crosby to air that TV classic!!Simply put this movie is nonsensical moronic and unrealistic.

Watching all this now in 2003 I can only imagine how people watching Hitler Dead or Alive back then in 1942 would have wondered just how Hitler and his Nazis got as far as they did in the first place.Totally insane plot even for a movie made during wartime where there was stories going around that Hitler had doubles. With this in mind the boys from the mob had to make sure that they caught the real Hitler they brought along someone with them who knew Hitlerfrom back in the beer hall days of the 1920's. The Hitler expert as well as former friend recognized him by a scar that he had over his upper lip that resulted from a bottle thrown at him during a beer hall brawl! Believe it or not were told that's the reason he grew a mustache! Oh really! When Hitler is caught the gangster's in order to find out that he's the real McCoy or Hitler shave his famous mustache off and there's the scar! At that point Hitler knowing that the jig is up as well as mustache off cries out hysterically to his captors Please spear my life and I'll give you half of my kingdom. This movie is even funnier then The Producers which is a comedy about Hitler and the Third Reich made for laughs years after Hitler and his regime was history and no longer a threat to anyone. Unlike that film Hitler Dead or Alive that was made in all seriousness as a moral boaster for the War Effort. Where the ending of the movie could well have lost the war for the allies if it was taken seriously just for the false and moronic information that it presented. Just before Hitler is shot by is own troops because they didn't recognize him without his mustache I kid you not the commander of the SS execution squad that was about to do Hitler in says disgustedly to him how did Germany produce a piece of scum like you. A moment later at the same time thinking that Hitler got away from the gangsters he says triumphantly about his beloved Fuhrer whom he's just about to have executed in complete awe The Man Is Pure Genius! I had to take my heart medication pills to keep from getting a heart attack just from laughing! Oh yes the end of this ridiculous movie tells us that Hitler was actually killed in 1942 and the Hitler you see in the papers and newsreels is just a double. I guess that's how in the end the allies won the war according to this outrageous film Hitler wasn't around to lead the Germans to their final victory!

	schema:reviewBody "Aesthetically speaking this is not a good film in the least. The plot is stupid the dialog is beyond just stupid and the film can only be enjoyed as a silly piece of kitsch. However I liked it because it represents the extreme in how bad an American propaganda film can be. Like First Yank in Tokyo any attempt to make a believable story went out the window with this one! The film stars some actors who are usually there for supportWard Bond Paul Fix and Warren Hymer. While I liked them as colorful characters in films without a strong and more competent leading man the film is a bit doomed at the onset. The three play gangsters who lead a Three Stoogeslike covert mission to kill Hitler. And as for Hitler and his henchmen they are about as smart as you'd expect from a Stooges' film! It's all very dopey and silly but I could also see someone today watching it precisely because it's so badso over the top.This film has nothing going for it other than goofiness. It is so weird and wacky that it makes for a wonderfully strange evening of movie watchingand it's easy to as the film is in the public domain and can be downloaded for free.".

However I liked it because it represents the extreme in how bad an American propaganda film can be. Like First Yank in Tokyo any attempt to make a believable story went out the window with this one! The film stars some actors who are usually there for supportWard Bond Paul Fix and Warren Hymer.

	schema:reviewBody "Reportedly in April 1865 upon hearing the dreadful news from Washington D.C. Benjamin Disraeli made the comment that Assassination has never changed history!.  A brave statement but dubious.  Lincoln's murder took a first rate political mind and spirit out of an office that needed him and put in a misguided ill prepared man with some sense of his office's importance.  The result was that Lincoln's hope to restore the Union with a benign peace was wrecked by the inept President Andrew Johnson and the Radical Republican Congress which sought a harsher peace on the South.  John Wilkes Booth had changed history indeed.Same happened in 44 B.C. when Julius Caesar was killed.  Same happened in 1914 when Archduke Franz Ferdinand was killed and World War I broke out. Assassination does effect history.In 1942 two Czech patriots were parachuted into their homeland to carry out a mission.  They did  they killed Reinhart Heydrich the Hangman Protector of Bohemia and creator of the Final Solution. Heydrich was in a car that was blown up and it is pleasant to announced that the creep actually died from being skewered by eight heavy springs in the seat that he was seated in  it took him over a week to die.  Given his involvement in the Holacaust and other atrocities one can only say he died the way he deserved.  Unfortunately the Germans destroyed two villages and killed hundreds of people in retaliation.  Because of that the Allies did not carry out any other assassination plots in Europe against Nazis.But the notion of killing Nazi leaders was instilled in the air and I think that is why this film was made soon after.  To Americans Heydrich was vaguely known after the destruction of Lidice and the other village interest in the Hangman led to two films being made Fritz Lang's HANGMEN ALSO DIE and Douglas Sirk's HITLER'S MADMAN.  HITLER DEAD OR ALIVE is not a good film  it is really rather stupid.  The idea of hiring three American criminals to kill Der Fuhrer is outlandish.  But to be fair this idea of criminals fighting the good fight against Nazis was fairly common in Hollywood films.  Nazis never fought fairly so we needed someone who also fought unfairly.  Witness Humphrey Bogart and his cohorts in ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT against Conrad Veidt or Alan Ladd in THIS GUN FOR HIRE admittedly against traitors working for Japan not Germany or LUCKY JORDAN.  Still if you want to kill the most vicious government leader in history why use three gunman instead of working out a plan with the government.  So if you have problems with this you will have problems with the entire film.The only thing I liked about this movie was when Bobs Watson as Hitler makes a comment to a cohort that he eventually plans to doublecross Mussolini.  Perhaps it might have happened sooner or later but Der Fuhrer actually had a high regard for Il Duce and later in the war sent his leading special agent Otto Skorzeny into Italy to rescue the imprisoned exhead of the government.  Still it was amusing to hear that.  Otherwise the film was a total washout.".

And yes America did make Propaganda films just as Germany and Japan did its just harder to see an American propaganda film.The plot is somewhat silly the Nazis are portrayed as buffoons but honestly who would want to see a film with clever Nazis anyway? and the film today does not hold up well. But the honesty of the performance of Ward Bond an actor who is best known for his Western roles is worth watching. Yes the Nazis are seen murdering innocent children and Ward Bond does give a heartfelt speech that he manages to choke out even though he is shot and dying but this film is American propaganda and is a very interesting piece of what patriotic movie making was like in 1942. Silly yes by todays standards but if you watched this film in 1942 while the war was going on you would not have felt the film was silly but hopeful.".

If I remember correctly Herr Schicklgruber was of the left persuasion. We also cannot forget about characters such as Else the German Duchess with a sometimes German sometimes French accent from London who doubles as a double agent. Have you noticed Germany looks a lot like California? Yeah I've had enough already. How about you ?Ward Bond worked on 25 movies with John Ford and who knows how many with John Wayne.

This is a collection of celluloid film which adds up to a ridiculous premise that is remarkably forward thinking considering the idiocracy of the 26th century to come. It has influenced numerous movies from the Dirty Dozen to Invasion U.S.A to Delta Force. Ward's Anti NaziPro Child message at end would go on to influence a certain man from Cuba.

	schema:reviewBody "This isn't really very good but is nevertheless a historically fascinating film that needs to be seen to be believed if only for the incredible ending which is no more farfetched than that dreamed up by Quentin Tarantino for 'Inglorious Basterds'. The previous year Geoffrey Household's prewar novel about stalking Hitler 'Rogue Male' had already been filmed by Fritz Lang as 'Man Hunt' and I had settled down to this expecting another piece of crass hokum like 'Desperate Journey' with Errol Flynn which had recently treated killing Nazis as a bit of a lark. At first it seems as if we're in for more of the same but the tone darkens considerably as the film progresses with obvious references to the massacre of civilians at Lidice the previous spring. Despite being warned that in Germany they speak German this proves not to be the case and absurd inaccuracies like the claim that Hitler grew his moustache to cover a scar acquired in a Bavarian brawl in the early 20's presumably the First World War photographs of Corporal Hitler sporting an enormous Kaiser Wilhelm moustache were less familiar to the American public at the time of the Second World War nestle side by side with depictions of cozy confinement in Dachau and children going before a firing squad that would seem offensive in a mere 'Z' budget quickie were the serious intentions of the film's makers to bring in under the radar a passionate piece of antiNazi propaganda under the guise of a simple minded action movie not increasingly evident. All the actors give of their best and Ward Bond in particular grows in the lead and when he later disguises himself with a moustache to look older he bears a remarkable resemblance to how he actually did look in his later years. All in all it compares favourably with 'The Dirty Dozen' and 'Inglorious Basterds' on a fraction of the budget.".

	schema:headline " Wanted Dead or Alive Hitler Dead or Alive is a mustwatch. A whacky WWII propaganda film that will make you laugh.";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the most unusual U.S. WWII propaganda films Hitler Dead or Alive isn't your typical wartime film. This movie is so over the top that it's so bad it's good. Inspired on an actual true event in which a businessman promised a reward of one million dollars to anyone to bring Adolf Hitler to justice dead or alive. The movie took the idea and place a story about three gangsters Steve Maschick Ward Bond Hans Dutch Havermann Warren Hymer and Joe The Book Conway Paul Fix accepting that challenge. Bond was the sturdy rock of the gang Hymer the comic relief and Fix the brains. Seeing how film noir and Warner Bros gangster films were popular at the time it was no surprised that the film director Nick Grinde  writer Sam Neuman made the controversial choice of portraying American criminals as heroes than the soldiers fighting overseas at the time. It's kinda upsetting in a way as hundreds of servicemen were dying in the battlefields during the making of this film. You can tell that the movie is so absurd and preposterous that the movie has a series of improbable scenes that lead them to Hitler Bobby Watson like jailbreaking and hijacking a plane. The gangsters are lumpheads idiots who somehow found a way not to get themselves killed within 10 minutes in Germany. The Nazis in the film are portray like Col. Klink dummies allowing them to last that long into 70 minute film. In real life this movie would had ended once they paratroop into Germany. The movie is full of dumb things happening like Ward Bond taking down an airplane with a tommy gun while flying. Do not question the probability of one man standing in the open door of a flying aircraft and successfully shooting down another plane. Don't ask. Another highlight of the film is the gangsters shaving off Hitler's mustache and cut off that big lock of greasy hair that hangs in his face. It was funny as hell. The movie recent got back in the public eye due to that director Quentin Tarantino quoting that he got some influence from this movie to help him make his masterpiece film 2009's Inglourious Basterds. You can honestly see the influences as both movies have Americans going behind enemy lines causing chaos like prison breaks and trying to kill Hitler. There are also the same type of female German characters that helped the Americans get closer to Hitler as in this film it's Countess Dancer Greta Fee 'Faye' Wall. What a dame! More dangerous than a pocketful of loose razor blades. The movie also influence Mel Brooks whom got the idea for 1967's The Producers. The acting is mediocre. Ward Bond's pathosladen delivery is laughable. The studio had to make due with Bruce Edwards who may look the part but can't convincingly read dialogue. Bobby Watson Hollywood's 1 Hitler. Between 1942 and 1962 Watson was cast a record ten times in the role of Best Fascist Dictator. Call about being typecast. Gees. He sounds like a cartoon German stereotype. The professional good actors were either off fighting or unattainable due to budgetary limitations. The movie is bit dated even at the time. There was a preinfamous Dachau scene that was a bit haunting. It really shows that Americans really were that clueless on what was really happening in concentration camp around Europe. The quasicomic tone of the film turns serious at the end when a desperate Hitler got a weird irony death. I love that speech by the SS guard. To think that Germany could produce a piece of filth like you. It made my day. The movie did had a bittersweet ending but it was needed for the time. It still present a powerful wartime message. The movie had a low production budget as there wasn't much action in this supposedly action pack film. Germany sure looks a lot like Southern California. Most of the sequences were taken from stock footage that didn't match well. The movie hasn't aged well. Since it's in the public domain most DVDs that copy or transfer this footage had fuzzy or grainy condition. It's hard to find a great copy of this. The audio is at less decent. You can also find this movie on Youtube or the Internet for free. Overall Its hammeroverthehead patriotism is indeed funny. It's a so bad it's good type of a watch makes it appealing.".

The gangsters are lumpheads idiots who somehow found a way not to get themselves killed within 10 minutes in Germany. The Nazis in the film are portray like Col. Klink dummies allowing them to last that long into 70 minute film. In real life this movie would had ended once they paratroop into Germany. The movie is full of dumb things happening like Ward Bond taking down an airplane with a tommy gun while flying. Do not question the probability of one man standing in the open door of a flying aircraft and successfully shooting down another plane. Don't ask. Another highlight of the film is the gangsters shaving off Hitler's mustache and cut off that big lock of greasy hair that hangs in his face. It was funny as hell. The movie recent got back in the public eye due to that director Quentin Tarantino quoting that he got some influence from this movie to help him make his masterpiece film 2009's Inglourious Basterds. You can honestly see the influences as both movies have Americans going behind enemy lines causing chaos like prison breaks and trying to kill Hitler. There are also the same type of female German characters that helped the Americans get closer to Hitler as in this film it's Countess Dancer Greta Fee 'Faye' Wall. What a dame! More dangerous than a pocketful of loose razor blades. The movie also influence Mel Brooks whom got the idea for 1967's The Producers. The acting is mediocre. Ward Bond's pathosladen delivery is laughable. The studio had to make due with Bruce Edwards who may look the part but can't convincingly read dialogue. Bobby Watson Hollywood's 1 Hitler. Between 1942 and 1962 Watson was cast a record ten times in the role of Best Fascist Dictator. Call about being typecast. Gees. He sounds like a cartoon German stereotype. The professional good actors were either off fighting or unattainable due to budgetary limitations. The movie is bit dated even at the time. There was a preinfamous Dachau scene that was a bit haunting. It really shows that Americans really were that clueless on what was really happening in concentration camp around Europe. The quasicomic tone of the film turns serious at the end when a desperate Hitler got a weird irony death. I love that speech by the SS guard. To think that Germany could produce a piece of filth like you. It made my day. The movie did had a bittersweet ending but it was needed for the time. It still present a powerful wartime message. The movie had a low production budget as there wasn't much action in this supposedly action pack film. Germany sure looks a lot like Southern California. Most of the sequences were taken from stock footage that didn't match well. The movie hasn't aged well. Since it's in the public domain most DVDs that copy or transfer this footage had fuzzy or grainy condition. It's hard to find a great copy of this. The audio is at less decent. You can also find this movie on Youtube or the Internet for free. Overall Its hammeroverthehead patriotism is indeed funny. It's a so bad it's good type of a watch makes it appealing.";

White Bondage director Nick Grinde and a stalwart cast headed up by Ward Bond combine chuckles with cringes in this outlandish World War II thriller. Scenarists Karl Brown of White Legion and Steve Neuman of The Hoodlum have a blast ridiculing the Nazis as these jailbirds field one lucky break after another. Hollywood made its share of propaganda potboilers during World War II to bolster morale at home and paint a portrait of America as a bastion of democracy to the world abroad. Naturally nothing about Hitler Dead or Alive is remotely credible but it is fun to watch. The Office of War Information objected to wartime melodramas like Hitler Dead or Alive because they contained more fiction than fact. Typically the Nazis were depicted as morons who were as easy to knock over as tenpins in a bowling alley.When Steve Maschick Ward Bond of The Searchers Joe 'The Book' Conway Paul Fix of Red River and Hans 'Dutch' Havermann Warren Hymer of Police Bullets meet Samuel Thornton Russell Hicks of Scarlet Street they cannot malinger because the local police have given them 24 hours to clear out of town. They want to take Thornton up on his deal to knock off the Fhrer. Basically Thornton wants Hitler dead because the Gestapo murdered his brother while he was serving as an exchange professor in Germany. Thornton's attorney draws up a contract for Steve and company and they enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force cross the Atlantic in a convoy and train as paratroopers in England. Later they commandeer a transport plane and compel the pilot Johnny Stevens Bruce Edwards of Bombardier to fly them to Germany. When an enemy fighter attacks them Steve shoots the German plane down with his tommy gun. Reluctantly Stevens has to bail out with Steve and his stooges and they figure that they are 200 west miles of Berlin.Our intrepid heroes steal a Nazi transport truck. No sooner have they stolen the truck than the Gestapo stop them. Joe and Steve explain that they have just flown from England and must see somebodyincharge. The cretinous Gestapo officer agrees to top off their gas tank get them some grub and escort them to headquarters. The Gestapo take them to Dachau. Camp commandant Colonel Hecht Felix Basch of None Shall Escape refuses to believe their story about a secret message for Hitler. Hecht places them under protective custody in a cell until morning. It doesn't take Steve long to locate a hidden microphone in their cell. The commandant confides in his girlfriend Countess Else von Brandt Dorothy Tree of The Asphalt Jungle that he wants to obtain the message so he can deliver it personally to Hitler. She convinces Hecht to let them carry out their mission. As it turns out Else is none other than a notorious antiAxis resistance leader codenamed 'Rosebud' hiding out in Germany. She has an Ace of Spades poker card slipped in with their meals with instructions. Our heroes break out of Dachau masquerade as Nazis and steal a car with Else in it. During their flight for freedom Dutch is crouched on the running board when the sentries kill him. Steve and company manage to breakout. Else leaves them in the woods and arranges for another resistance agent to help them. She returns to Dachau and tells Hecht that the Americans terrorized her. Hecht and his troops examine Dutch's body and find that the Americans have come to the Fatherland to murder Hitler for a million dollars.Later Else meets Steve Joe and Stevens in a cellar at her estate. Steve reveals his designs to kill Hitler. Naturally Else is skeptical about Steve's chances of rubbing out the Fhrer. Moreover she believes that slaying Hitler will not stop the war because his generals would continue fighting. The following morning our heroes learn that Meyer Frederick Giermann of Hotel Berlin the guy who guided them to the cellar once knew Hitler. Meyer tells them about how he saved Hitler's life after the future Fhrer was beaten up in Munich. Hitler's assailants carved him up broken beer bottles and left a permanent scar on his upper lip. Hitler grew his Charlie Chaplin mustache to conceal the scar. Steve assures his pals now he will not be fooled when he gets his hands on Hitler. Upstairs Hecht shows up with troops at Else's house to search the premises for the escapees. During the search Steve eavesdrops on Hecht as he talks about how Hitler will kill children in reprisal for attempts on his life. Finally Steve's patriotic impulses trump his mercenary ones. Anyway Hecht looks forward to his date with Else at a party thrown for Hitler. The Nazi High Command invites Else and she insists her own personal orchestra accommodate her.Hitler Bobby Watson shows up during the final quarter hour for a dance at his headquarters with Steve and company masquerading as musicians. Everything go awry but Steve abducts Hitler. He shaves Hitler's mustache to be sure he has the dictator. When Hecht's men captures Steve Hitler and the others they refuse to believe that Hitler is who he claims to be. In route to the firing squad Hitler pleads for mercy and runs. Hecht shoots him in the back. They line up Steve and Meyer and kill them. The action concludes with Thornton telling two newspaper reporters that it was unrealistic of his part to believe that killing Hitler would end the war.The last four minutes of Hitler Dead Or Alive bristles with patriotic speeches. Mind you it is doubtful the Royal Canadian Air Force would have let exconvicts like Maschick Conway and Havermann join up. Nevertheless logic has little to do with this kind of fantasy.".

He had an enormous screen presence  personality  he could've easily became a leading actor if he really wanted to but he was content in small  distinguished supporting roles. He was quite versatile  is often associated with John Wayne in the John Ford directed films.

The cast is solid with established actors like Paul Fix  Warren Hymer who often played stupid gangsters. Sure the plot is far fetched but it was 1942  WW2 was a very popular war inspiring national patriotism. The film was obviously a wartime moral booster while at the same time trying to sustain  save a dying genre the gangster film  in 1942 what better way to sell a gangster movie than to turn the gangsters into patriotic American hero's on an improbable mission to knock off Adolf Hitler. It may be a little campy today but in it's day this movie was probably taken seriously by 1942 audiences. Think about it the film was obviously intended to be serious  it's not a bad watch  I would watch it again  it's by far superior to the Ed Wood films.There is really no comparison  there is a lot worse movies out there than this. Don't forget Ed Wood was voted the worst director of all time an honor  title he fittingly deserves. It doesn't get any worse than Ed Wood not even an Elvis Presley movie.".

Why will they succeed? Because they previously assassinated a fellow gangster. If you can accept that premise then the other contrived actions and subplots will be immaterial.This film is farremoved from Plan 9 From Outer Space not that it is better. This film was produced in 1941 or '42 which was in the early days of the War long before the German Army retreated from North Africa Sicily Italy Greece Romania and France. This is a simple story exploiting the hopes and dreams of many Americans.It is especially interesting that gangsters are cast as heroes and at the end proclaimed great Americans. J. Edgar Hoover and his star agent Eliot Ness at the FBI must have been livid after spending the 1930s claiming bootleggers and minor gangsters were the greatest threat to America since abolitionists.While some scenes provoke a smile this is far from the lunacy of Plan 9. The writer producer and director of this film are mere apprentices or hacks compared to Ed Wood Jr. To even compare the two films is a travesty. Unlike Plan 9 I recommend renting this because one viewing is more than enough.This would have been great comedy if the Three Stooges had been cast as the lead actors. But they were not and therefore this is merely a mild broth that is less than filling. However it does have one redeeming characteristic and that is the ending when war lords and profiteers are proclaimed a greater threat than Hitler. It is mindboggling that the screenwriter foresaw Dick Cheney the president of Halliburton corporation who loudly advocated during 2003 invading Iraq allegedly to destroy nonexistent weapons of mass destruction. And subsequently out of sheer coincidence received contracts totaling more than 12 billion to rebuild Iraq.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not a remake of The Gauntlet though the theme is a familiar one. There are in fact several movies with similar plots 310 to Yuma and Narrow Margin come to mind. A reviewer emailed me that Midnight Run not only has a story like 16 Blocks but Bruce Willis' character Jack Mosley has a name that is a composite of the movie names for two of the leading roles in Midnight Run Robert De Niro's Jack Walsh and Yaphet Kotto's FBI Agent Alonzo Mosely. This of course may be mere coincidence. Though the story may seem like dj vu the action is fast paced making this an exciting film to watch.Anyone who doubts that Bruce Willis can act needs only watch his standout performance in Pulp Fiction to see what depth this actor can bring to a demanding role. The role of Jack Mosely may not be challenging to Willis but he still gives it all he's got which is plenty. Playing the part of an over the hill New York cop with a game leg nothing to live for and a drinking problem seems easy for Willis to make it all believable.The criminal Eddie Bunker Jack must deliver to testify within a certain time frame is played with gusto by hiphop artist Mos Def. Eddie is the most verbose prisoner ever. He rattles on and on about anything that comes to mind some of it funny some of it trite. He also has a riddle that is not answered till near the end of the film.A standout performance is delivered by David Morse as the leader of the dirty cops Frank Nugent. Morse is in danger of becoming typecast as a dishonest lawman. I'm hopeful he will become more diversified in his roles since he is such a talented actor.This is another winner from action director Richard Donner. If you like his other successful concoctions such as the Lethal Weapon flicks Superman Conspiracy Theory and The Omen then you will certainly enjoy 16 Blocks.".

Your first look at Bruce Willis as the burntout over the hill cop tells you this will not be the normal shootemup cop drama. The plot starts building almost instantly unlike many movies where you have to wait through thirty minutes of fluff before the story goes anywhere. The characters in the movie are surprisingly endearing honest and genuine. They're just normal enough to identify with. Not the standard super evil villain and valiant good guy. Bruce Willis is awesome in his role as the tired underdog struggling with the morality of torn loyalty. Mos Def whose character's voice was a little aggravating played an excellent supporting role. The relationship he develops with Willis'character is both surprising and humorous. Overall the movie was tense from the start and is filled with suspense humor and a great deal of drama. It takes some unexpected turns and has a great ending. I highly recommend it.".

Willis plays Jack Mosley a drunkhungover cop that seems to have lost his touch. He gets all the scrap jobs that no one wants and one of these jobs brings him straight to Mos Def who plays Eddie a very hard to understand very talkative guy who has apparently witnessed something and is due to testify at 10 sharp. It's about 2 hours until he has to be at the court house which is 16 blocks away and a hell of a lot of cops standing in the middle. Mosley doesn't entirely know what to believe the kid or his ex partner of 20 years but he puts his faith into the kid and the thrill ride begins. Hands down the best dirty cop film I've seen in a while.".

Bruce Willis portrays Jack Mosley a alcoholic cop who after a long day of work has to escort a prisoner to a trial for a testimony. Mos Def plays Eddie Bunker the prisoner with a dream of becoming a baker. They have to go 16 blocks in a little bit over a hour. They encounter multiple attempts on Eddie's life and Mosley begins to suspect other cops of this. 16 Blocks is an intense thrill ride with multiple twists. Great camera angles that create more suspense help you really understand what they are going through. David Morse did a great job playing the dirty cop. The only problem is that it has some parts that would make you laugh. This may take away the seriousness of the movie from some viewers. It can be corny and predictable at times but 16 Blocks is a good flick and you should see it.".

Best job is by David Morse who is completely believable as a NYC cop though somewhat unbelievable in terms of what he will go through to do what he feels he must do.

The beginning started off fast and the ending came on slow. in my opinion the way a movie should come on. About the pg13 though F bomb was dropped once twice if you count a replay of it saying The musical score also did a nice touch to the scenes. Dropping to low sad tones when death is about to occur and jumping to a pulsing drum run when escape is occurring. Overall i give an 910 as very little was wrong if anything at all.

	schema:reviewBody "16 BLOCKS is a neat little Hollywood thriller that might not offer the bulldozing excitement of a DIE HARD movie or the fantastic stuntwork of a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE flick but which still generates plenty of suspense from its straightforward premise. It tells the story of a cop and a criminal two men who have to cross New York before their deadline runs out. Of course there's a lot more at stake than it first appears and gradually director Richard Donner weaves a story of friendship betrayal skeletons in the closet and above all else the need to do the right thing. It's a story that's characterfocused throughout with the emphasis on the developing relationship between Bruce Willis' detective and Mos Def's criminal. Some might find this emphasis off putting but I for one thoroughly enjoyed it.Bruce Willis is much as we met him in DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE and indeed there are many parallels and references to that movie in this one he's washed up past his glory except here he's even worse saddled with a paunch and a gammy leg. Once the bullets start flying Bruce's character takes a turn for the better and he becomes the everyday hero we all know and love him for. I was prepared to dislike Mos Def's hightalking criminal but surprisingly enough he's one of the best things in the film and he really makes the criminal character his own adding warmth to the feature. David Morse off our screens for too long is as great as ever as the corrupt cop who becomes the nemesis of the heroes.While the film is not actionfocused there are some highly impressive setpieces which strive for realism  the standout scene being the bus hostage rescue of course. Elsewhere the layer of gritty realism  no pyrotechnics here  and the endless copsvsrobbers stealthy sneaking around generate plenty of tension and also excitement. My only real complaint is with the ending which could have been handled a little better but then it chooses emotion over action and it's a characterfocused finale rather than one with big bangs. I remember a few years back when the film S.W.A.T. attempted a similar storyline the difference is that film was a piece of crap and this one is rather good.".

Only those dirty cops make it very difficult for them to make this seemingly simple short journey.Since the film runs 102 minutes and they have 118 minutes to get to the courthouse it's not strictly in real time. But it did very much remind me of Phone Booth in terms of brisk pacing and bustling New York backdrop. A suspension of disbelief is seriously required as a few completely implausible things happen.I mean how the hell do the dirty cops constantly manage to catch up with them. Do they have secret homing devices and teleport machines? Why did Willis not shoot any of them in the foot so they couldn't follow? Why didn't he identify himself properly on that bus full of complete moron passengers? Richard Donner has proved himself a master of action in the past but this PG13 rated movie is just packed full of jittery blurred badlylit incomprehensible shootouts. A harder nature and bad guys that DID more evil instead of talking about already doing it would have made a better movie.Rent this.

But no that's not my main complaint.The main story in the movie is that he Bruce has roughly 2 hrs to transport a prisoner from the cell block to the court house yet the cops are trying to stop him. OK good idea. I'd watch the movie based on that.The movie is slow from start to finish. I don't mind slow movies with a purpose. King Kong for example is slow in the beginning yet I love it. 2001 A Space Odessy and The Birds are very slow yet I find them good movies. This movie was slow because of poor writing. If you want to see some well done writing that is done in real time 1 hr video is 1 hr of story watch 24.But it goes down hill rapidly. Bruce Willis plays a depressed detective that really doesn't give a rip about his job. He's always tired. He's old and run down. He doesn't snap out of it enough to make his character interesting.The prisoner Mos Def. What the crap? Does he have mental problems? Is he a little eccentric? Is he just annoying? It's not clear. And what is up with his voice? The story was not written well. There were a lot of continuity errors. Like Bruce calls for some help yet not only do they never show up but they're never mentioned again. It's like it never happened. Then there were times where they acted like they had 5 minutes to get to the court house times where they acted like they had 5 hours and time where they acted like they'd given up on making it or the time had already passed.Far too many times the bad guys were able to guess exactly where Bruce was going yet it seems way to perfect. Almost like he's a white male aged 40 I bet he went to his old friend from college that works at Kmart for advice. That's not what happened but it was way to precise of a guess to be written off as smart bad guys.O and the ending was predictable. There was a slight twist that I didn't see coming but nothing huge. In the end Bruce's character is still his old tired self except he now likes his birthday.The only movies I've seen that are worse are Bulletproof Monk and Sphere. Bruce I hope you get back to some real movies soon like Sin City Six Sense and Pulp Fiction.".

	schema:reviewBody "When we first see Bruce Willis dragging himself up the stairs his weariness as a human and a cop is evident. He is a spent man a drunk a Schmo uncomplainingly taking on the scut work his brothers hand out to him. As it is Bruce Willis and as we have seen the preview we know that there is going to be an Epiphany moment around the corner. It comes when he is asked to look the other way as his buddy's most prominently David Morse as the sociopathic ex partner rub out an informant that Willis is dutifully transporting to the Court house.When it comes Willis keeps the brakes on and continues to move slowly up to his crowning moment. Perhaps too slowly. For an action movie there is much down time time enough for Def Moses to steal the movie which is O.K. because in this movie Bruce is content to let his Co Star have all the best lines and most of the best scenes. Thankfully both stay in character so that the unexpected ending fits into the movie without jarring the mood of the piece. The mood is just like Willis's character dark weary and dispassionate. It is in the end a movie that focuses on character rather than action. Just when I thought that the movie was going to have me accepting the epiphany as a typical Hollywood clich it offers an explanation that is quite believable.I like my action movies to go at breakneck speed with occasional breaks to catch my breath. This one takes so many breaks that the pace often slows and my interest started to wander but it had enough twists and unlikely moments that allowed our heroes to escape that it kept the interest from waning too much.Too often I had a hard time hearing Def as he speaks in a street patois that like most popular music is ironically lyrical it has a beat but the lyrics are hard to focus on. Like Bruce he keeps the brakes on and I am grateful he did not go down the road of playing his role in the obligatory street wise hyped up smart ass jive mother. He lets his character grow likable and has the patience to let us catch up with him.SPOILERThe premise of the movie is too laughable.

	onyx:emotionText "When we first see Bruce Willis dragging himself up the stairs his weariness as a human and a cop is evident. He is a spent man a drunk a Schmo uncomplainingly taking on the scut work his brothers hand out to him. As it is Bruce Willis and as we have seen the preview we know that there is going to be an Epiphany moment around the corner. It comes when he is asked to look the other way as his buddy's most prominently David Morse as the sociopathic ex partner rub out an informant that Willis is dutifully transporting to the Court house.When it comes Willis keeps the brakes on and continues to move slowly up to his crowning moment. Perhaps too slowly. For an action movie there is much down time time enough for Def Moses to steal the movie which is O.K. because in this movie Bruce is content to let his Co Star have all the best lines and most of the best scenes. Thankfully both stay in character so that the unexpected ending fits into the movie without jarring the mood of the piece. The mood is just like Willis's character dark weary and dispassionate. It is in the end a movie that focuses on character rather than action.

Without ruining the movie for anyone who wants to witness this trash for themselves I will say that the bus scene is the most absurd and annoying of them all.Mos Def ruined the movie all on his own but Willis didn't really do anything stop him. He could play this part the way he did in his sleep and it looks like he did. The man playing the archetypal bad cop was just as lazy adding nothing to the hackneyed script and even contributing to its unoriginality with clichs of his own. This character's mindlessness particularly in his final scene was idiotic to the point of insult.To be fair the plot was interesting enough. If it were a little less clich and unrealistic and much better done this movie would be as good as any run of the mill action thrillertype. I did find myself trying to add complexity and originality to the story as it went though. As it is it has to be one of the biggest wastes of time and 7.00 available to the general public.".

The scene where Mos and Bruce get chased into the Chinese dude's apartment and the elevator scene  those were filmed in my building.It was definitely interesting to see how Hollywood works up close example painting over our ancient stairwell only to repaint it with fake handprints and grime  like the original wasn't grimy enough. I even got to briefly meet Bruce Willis which was a cheap thrill although there was no eye contact  his gaze was downcast the entire time. I guess he was getting into character... I also found it interesting that a 10 minute sequence in a movie would inconvenience our entire building for several weeks  no elevator cables and equipment strewn everywhere etc.In any event I was pretty pumped about getting to see my humble abode on the big screen. Unfortunately that's the only enjoyment I got out of this terrible terrible movie. It almost doesn't bear discussing it's simply that bad.The plot is clichd as allfrigginhell. Everything reeks of paintbynumbers scriptwriting and characterization. Trust me this is nothing you haven't seen fifty million times before. There's absolutely no suspense drama or interest. I just wanted it to be over as quickly as possible. And Mos Def is simply maddeningly annoying and deserves to have his Screen Actor's Guild membership revoked.This movie is beyond bad. In fact it surpasses bad and achieves the status of disturbingly bad. What can you say about an action movie where the most exciting scene consists of a bus speeding down an alley destroying air conditioning units? Avoid this tripe at all costs.".

The archetype works so this story isn't bad but it just feels adequate and lifeless. C Acting Mos Def's character annoyed me so badly that I kept hoping his character would die in this movie and the worst part is that I know he can do better like he did in Be Kind Rewind. Bruce Willis does an effective job of playing an alcoholic cop but nothing terribly memorable here. The real show stealer was David Morse as one of the most likable villains in the history of movies. He's doing a horrible thing but he just seems like such a nice guy while doing it and he'd probably even invite Willis over for supper after the dust settled assuming he got his way. He's good... and he bumps the acting category up to C level.Direction The atmosphere is very depressing which was probably by design for this story. There are lots of awkward pauses lots of Willis giving confused looks and looks of disdain for his life instead of a reply to of character's dialog. Again this is perfectly acceptable but not exceptional. It's average and average direction gets a C.Visuals This is probably the strongest part of this movie. The visuals make use of lots of shadow which assist the atmosphere of depression. The Godfather has no worries of losing it's title of best use of shadows in a movie but this is really this movie's strong point. BOverall This movie is okay. Average. If it's on TV and you've got nothing better to do watch it. If your local library has it rent it. I wouldn't pay anymore than about five dollars to watch this one.

A film that starts beautifully and then spends an inordinate amount of time meandering to finally arrive to its soft but beautiful center. Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette have wonderful moments as the star crossed sisters. Their feelings as genuine as they are never seem to find a common ground until Shirley MacLaine makes her entrance. I must confess I was very moved by her by her performance. Her most human and real in many many years. She is the glue that keeps all the elements together and presents them to us with that unmistakable flair of hers for feisty truths and uncompromising tough love. I don't know quite how I feel about Curtis Hanson as a director. Personally my favorite of his films is Wonder Boys and in a way In Her Shoes is closer to that one without being as good than any of his other movies. However I'm recommending it wholeheartedly specially to my sisters.".

This Maggie is a mess but what caused her to be that way? One keeps wondering how she could even be related to the meticulous Rose a lawyer who seems to be in control of her life. That is until Maggie appears at Rose's door and disrupts her life committing the ultimate sin messing around with her sister's lover! The only thing these sisters have in common is the passion for the fancy shoes Rose loves to buy and Maggie a penniless girl can't afford.Curtis Hanson directed this film in which the main characters are women. Men only play a small part in this tale about two young sisters that in spite of loving each other grow distant because the carelessness of Maggie. Adapted from the Jennifer Weiner novel of the same title the movie version was adapted by Susannah Grant.The main reason for watching this uneven film is Toni Collette who as Rose gives one of her most detailed performances in recent memory. Ms. Collette makes us believe she is this woman whose life unravels because her irresponsible sister. Ms. Collette is perfect as the mousy Rose who secretly would like to be like her sister but can't bring herself to do it.Cameron Diaz goes into a transformation in the film. We get a hint of her problems as she auditions for an MTV spot. She has grown into a wild young woman because her mother was not around to supervise or pay attention to the sisters. But whereas Rose goes to make something of her life Maggie rebels and does destructive things to herself. It is not until she gets to meet her unknown grandmother that she begins to put her life to good use and in the process discovers what's wrong with her.Shirley MacLaine is seen in one of the most sedate characters of her screen career as the grandmother Ella. Family problems intervened between her and a son in law that didn't want to have her around at any cost and alienated Ella from her granddaughters. Ms. MacLaine disappears into her role and gives an underplayed performance that sets well with her two costars.While the film could have used some trimming the first half has a little more spark than the second part which turns into a formula picture. Curtis Hanson doesn't break any new ground with this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Her Shoes is noteworthy for its crisp dialogue lively repartee and multidimensional characters For her novel and for her screenplay Jennifer Weiner and Susannah Grant respectively both deserve an extra curtain call for exemplary work.Because of the careful scripting all three of the leading characters played by Toni Collette Cameron Diaz and Shirley MacLaine were strong roles with no single character dominating the script. The two sisters Rose and Maggie shared the focus in the first half of the film and MacLaine's grandmother Ella provided a strong impetus in the latter portion.While all three performances were superb the trickiest role was Maggie the tomcat. Cameron Diaz brought depth to the role and one scene especially stood out when Maggie's learning disability was revealed. As she struggled with her reading of the poem in the hospital room a new dimension of the character suddenly emerged. The scene was sensitively played by Diaz and the dialogue was once again dynamic sustaining dramatic interest at a point when the impetus of the film could have been lost.It was impressive as well that the screenplay offered some delectable dialogue for the small parts especially in the members of the retirement community of Florida. There were many delightful and humorous moments. Yet the screenplay provided depth and detail in a rich emotional tapestry.One character that deserves special acknowledgment was the Professor blind and dying in the Florida hospital. The role was played with great understatement by Norman Lloyd a veteran character actor who performed with Orson Welles' celebrated Mercury Theatre. Prior to his stunning success in Citizen Kane and even before his notorious War of the Worlds radio broadcast Welles was a luminary in the New York theatre. One of the great Shakespearean productions in America in the last century was Welles' 1937 production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar that was part of the Federal Theatre Project. Norman Lloyd played the small but crucial role of Cinna the Poet and although Lloyd battled with Welles during the rehearsals the death scene of Cinna the Poet underscored the theme of fascism that Welles wished to evoke. In Her Shoes provides Lloyd with another small but memorable role. Lloyd's was a riveting performance and the film would not have been the same without it.Part of the genius of Shakespeare was his ability to individualize and make memorable even the tiniest roles in his plays. This was the strength as well of In Her Shoes and an example of some of the finest screen writing in recent years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having previously tackled a wide range of themes in his films Director Curtis Hanson delves into the lovehate relationship of two disparate sisters in the film In Her Shoes. The result is an enjoyably entertaining comedydrama featuring a number of topflight performances and some hilarious dialogue.Maggie Feller Cameron Diaz is an irresponsible practically illiterate alcoholic who sleeps around and mooches or steals to get by in the world. Her sister Rose Feller Toni Collette is a self conscious workaholic lawyer who is dating her boss and indulges in her one passion fashionable dress shoes. Maggie's obsession with Rose's sexy heels recalls an ongoing theme of television's Sex and the City. Both sisters lost their psychologically impaired mother to a supposed car accident that affected their family over the years. One day Maggie is thrown out of her house by her step mother and dad. Finding refuge with her sister Rose she proceeds to make life miserable with her carefree attitude and interference that ends in embarrassment and anger for both. As Rose's romantic and professional life is turned upside down Maggie is sent packing and turns to one last hope her maternal grandmother she never knew namely Ella Hirsch Shirley MacLaine. Ella works in a retirement community in Florida and Maggie's appearance causes quite a stir. When she lost her daughter Ella lost touch with her granddaughters and Maggie's 'visit' serves as a catalyst for reconnection. Maggie's visit becomes a reawakening of sorts for herself and a chance for Ella to rediscover her lost family. Meanwhile Rose is at a crossroads in her life and decides to change course in her job and finds romance from an unlikely source. Anxious to reunite her granddaughters Ella resorts to extreme measures to bridge an emotional gap as her two girls begin to discover their own identities in unique and unexpected ways.This is a gem of a film. It says something when you realize early on that you are watching something special. Curtis Hanson L.A.Confidential Wonder Boys has struck gold with Susannah Grant's Erin Brokovich adaptation of the best seller by Jennifer Weiner. The film is really about the secrets and lies that cripple a family over time and how a strange course of events revisit the relationships or lack thereof. Hanson and the company do a marvelous job of balancing some very funny dialogue with more serious dramatic scenes. There are some great memorable lines some of which are funny and smart without losing sight of the context of the story. A number of scenes are touching and affecting in their sensitive handling of real emotions without becoming clichd. It's nice to see real people who change over time and how seemingly inconsequential supporting characters gradually come to the forefront.The acting by the entire cast is strong and you appreciate the little nuances in facial expression and inflection of dialogue that enrich each character. This may be Cameron Diaz's best performance. That's saying something as the glamorous model has been more star than actress in her most popular films Charlie's Angels There's Something About Mary and she is given a juicy role with sharp direction. Toni Collette has always been a solid actress in any film Sixth Sense The Hours but she has found a wonderful character in Rose and makes the most of it. Shirley MacLaine Terms of Endearment The Turning Point is terrific in what is a change of pace role where she eschews makeup to look her age and shows a maternal wisdom that is the stuff of Supporting Oscars. You wish there were more of her in the film but what's there is delicious. It's nice to see an old pro like Norman Lloyd still displaying his acting chops in what is a minor role of a bedridden patient who has a profound influence on Diaz's character.The performances are complemented by seamless editing which not only captures the right reactions but effortlessly switches back and forth between the two sisters especially during key scenes that are thematically linked. Although the running time goes over two hours the pacing is good and everything seems integral to the storyline. The musical score by Mark Isham is quite effective in complimenting the emotional moments without ever being intrusive.Despite its strong script the film never fully explores Maggie's transformation which while uplifting and remarkable is never totally convincing given her origins and tendencies. Things get wrapped up in a dreamy sendoff which is perhaps too good to be true but those same qualities also make for a more upbeat film.Hanson displays a very keen eye in relating what is essentially a woman's film. Yes this may be considered a woman's film in its theme and target audience but considering the fact it is also a well made funny and heart rending film about love and family the women ought to bring along the men. In Her Shoes is not just about rival sisters but rather it is about a family yanked apart and slowly brought together again in ways that are not altogether apparent at the start. How these lost souls meld together is the stuff of high entertainment and substance.".

Confidential brings a reality to the film that prevents it from ever sinking into Beaches muck. The three lead actors are all outstanding. Cameron Diaz flashes some real ability as party girl turned soul searcher. Shirley MacLaine is terrific as the longlost grandmother who has wised up and is thrilled to be rediscovered. The always great Toni Collette The Sixth Sense mom is the heart of the the film despite her character's lack of confidence which usually sends me into a coma. This overused female trait is handled quite differently by writer and director and actor thereby creating a great deal of interest for the viewer.The dialogue is real the characters are real and the settings are real. These are people and families and relationships that we can all relate to. The script proves that most family dysfunction is the result of poor communication not bad people. Regrets can eat away and just become part of the fabric of a family. Once they are hit headon there is much to gain by all involved.Two supporting cast members really stand out. Francine Beers as Mrs. Lefkowitz a retirement community neighbor of Ms. MacLaine's character shows wisdom and color beyond her many years. Shouldbe Hollywood legend Norman Lloyd has a warm and heartfelt role as a hospital patient who has much to offer. Mr. Lloyd has quietly put together an incredible career as Actor Director and Producer and should receive more recognition for his accomplishments. My personal favorite was his role as the head of TV's underrated St. Elsewhere from the 1980's.I hope the trailer does not prevent men from seeing the film as I believe this is one of the best of the year.

That's my biggest criticism of the film but it was enjoyable in general and I had a wonderful time watching. A few other things I enjoyed the Rocky reference my favorite and the opening sequence during the credits. I have to credit this last one to both screenwriter and director for this incredible opening which in completely visual terms sets up the film's themes.

Toni Collette bears the brunt of having to carry the film because her character is central to the story and she does a great job. She is convincing as the frumpy older sister of Cameron Diaz who always gets the guys but who is illiterate and an alcoholic. Shirley MacLaine is the feisty estranged grandmother. The film starts kind of slow but gets much better when MacLaine shows up.This film has a lot in common with a film that came out last month called Proof. That film had a good story but had poor photography and directing. In Her Shoes looks like every frame was done with meticulous detail. The directing is done with confidence and the film does not suffer from the rapid cut camera angles that so many films suffer from these days.It's no secret that this year's box office has suffered due to the poor quality of the films. The success of In Her Shoes will be a good yardstick to tell if people will go to the theater for a quality film.If you've been waiting for an intelligent moving film without the gun shots and helicopter chases In Her Shoes is a film you should see.".

There was good chemistry between all three. Some of the minor characters especially in Florida were quite good.

What else could you possibly expect from a movie about sisters that involves shoes and a search for their grandmother? That's all you need to know. You either like the genre you don't like the genre or your girl forces you to watch the genre with her. Accept which one applies to you and go with it. If you're chickflicktose intolerant then this obviously isn't for you.That being sad I must admit that thanks to good character and relationship development good acting and believable characters set within a believable story I enjoyed it. Granted Cameron Diaz's long legs might have had something to do with enhancing my enjoyment but I was entertained nonetheless.Things start off a little slow as the relationship between the sisters is allowed to grow but once Maggie finds herself in Florida working at an old folks' home the story and laughs start to pick up. There's one old woman who is particularly funny. I don't know her name you'll recognize her by the fact that she's in a wheelchair most of the time but she reminded me of my grandmother commenting on how Diaz puts a postage stamp on her bottom and calls it a swimsuit and acting shocked that there are now pants that exist with 'juicy' written across the hiney. How can you not be entertained by a crotchety old woman's outlook on how the times have achanged? If reading comprehension has got you down and you're still struggling with whether or not you want to see this let me break it down even further. This is a story about the love between sisters. They fight they drift apart they find out their grandmother is still alive and they make their way back to each other. All sorts of lessons on love selfdiscovery romance and who owns whose heart are explored. There's even some sappy poetry reading thrown in for good measure. I know that this all sounds like a huge shot of estrogen but thankfully things never get as syrupy as you might expect.That doesn't mean there's any shortage of attempts to strain a tear out of the female and nonmanly eyes. I almost missed out on some dialogue thanks to the sniffling of the four ladies sitting in front of me. So gals bring your tissues. Guys if your gal brings you along then bring the sewing kit. You'll need to sew 'em back on after this one. All right everybody knows what to expect now so enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "A relationship with a video store clerk is an important thing when you like to watch movies. He can let you have Star Wars III the weekend before its due to hit the shelves or he can waive the late fee or unofficially give you free rentals because you've rented over 1000 movies from him.Most importantly when you can't decide what to watch he can tell you what he thinks and make a few suggestions. If you have a good relationship he'll put more thought into it and you'll know better how your tastes and his intersect. This happened to me last night.So my video goto guy suggested in a bold and shocking move In Her Shoes which at first glance is nothing but a sappy chickflick that even my Girlfriend balked at. He insisted pointing out that the director Curtis Hanson had also made Wonderboys but forgetting to mention L.A. Confidential for some reason. He described its merits and eventually convinced me and my Girlfriend.And so I watched In Her Shoes best described as a character driven drama with some funny moments. It was very good and my faith in the Video Guy is renewed. This movie is probably the first time I ever liked Cameron Diaz in a movie. Toni Collette is great as is Shirley MacLaine. The rest of the supporting cast is strong. While there is no real umph behind the visuals the movie doesn't really suffer from it in as much as the focus is character not visual.My only reservation about this movie is that it comes on a little strong by times. It achieves levels of saccharine sweetness that jar the overall mood of the movie. The overt sentimentality while awfully effective barely a dry eye in the house leaves a bad aftertaste. The same I think can be said of a few comedic moments that while funny seem to stand out as maybe not part of the right movie. I'm glad I didn't watch it by myself but as a couple movie go for it.I'm planning a overhaul of my rating system given that I'm not sure about the efficacity of the old one. In the old system I think this movie would be a 3.75 maybe a 4 at a stretch outta 5. My Girlfriend loved it.".

He can let you have Star Wars III the weekend before its due to hit the shelves or he can waive the late fee or unofficially give you free rentals because you've rented over 1000 movies from him.Most importantly when you can't decide what to watch he can tell you what he thinks and make a few suggestions. If you have a good relationship he'll put more thought into it and you'll know better how your tastes and his intersect. This happened to me last night.So my video goto guy suggested in a bold and shocking move In Her Shoes which at first glance is nothing but a sappy chickflick that even my Girlfriend balked at. He insisted pointing out that the director Curtis Hanson had also made Wonderboys but forgetting to mention L.A. Confidential for some reason. He described its merits and eventually convinced me and my Girlfriend.And so I watched In Her Shoes best described as a character driven drama with some funny moments. It was very good and my faith in the Video Guy is renewed. This movie is probably the first time I ever liked Cameron Diaz in a movie. Toni Collette is great as is Shirley MacLaine. The rest of the supporting cast is strong. While there is no real umph behind the visuals the movie doesn't really suffer from it in as much as the focus is character not visual.My only reservation about this movie is that it comes on a little strong by times. It achieves levels of saccharine sweetness that jar the overall mood of the movie. The overt sentimentality while awfully effective barely a dry eye in the house leaves a bad aftertaste. The same I think can be said of a few comedic moments that while funny seem to stand out as maybe not part of the right movie. I'm glad I didn't watch it by myself but as a couple movie go for it.I'm planning a overhaul of my rating system given that I'm not sure about the efficacity of the old one. In the old system I think this movie would be a 3.75 maybe a 4 at a stretch outta 5. My Girlfriend loved it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Don't be too harsh on this film. A chickflick? Perhaps but lots more than that! This film is about women relationships with just the right touch of comic relief many of these films normally lack. Hats of for everyone who contributed to this film! A good script great acting and stellar craftsmanship of director Curtis Hanson make this one hit the bullseye or very close indeed. I expected a decent comedy which  in part  it certainly is but the performances are so good and the characters so alive and breathing that I soon forgot about the initial comic aspect of the film. Right from the start the film sucks you into the story which just ring true.Two sisters with quite opposite characters sexy uneducated party animal Maggie Cameron Diaz and the somewhat dull responsible lawyer Rose Toni Collette are unwillingly confronted with each other. They learn that they can actually learn something from their deficiencies and combine the strands they have  with help from their grandmother  to improve their lives. Curtis Hanson expertly directs in an appropriately modest fashion He knows his job and manages to focus on character development but doesn't forget to add the occasional comic relief. The cast shines with Cameron Diaz in what might be her best role so far. The still vastly underrated Australian Toni Collette who shined as the vulnerable ugly duckling in MURIEL'S WEDDING 1994 is just perfect in her role a Rose and there's Shirley Maclaine as the sister's grandmother with a somewhat lowkey part but she knows how to handle it expertly. A treat! Perhaps some minor flaws The story takes some time to get going. A bit too much focus on Cameron Diaz's legs which is completely unnecessary and Maggie's partial illiteracy and incapability to get a job might have needed somewhat more background or explanation. What beautiful woman no matter how stupid she might be could have any difficulty finding a job? Highly unlikely. But these are minor quibbles. Worth your time even if you are one of three guys in a crowd of three hundred women in the cinemaCamera Obscura  910".

	schema:reviewBody "In Her Shoes is a movie that takes an awfully long time to really get itself going. It almost seems as though there are two movies going on even though they are both from the same book 1 Rose Toni Colette coming to terms with how much being her sister's keeper has saved her from dealing with the fact that she hasn't really allowed herself to develop or find out what she's really about and 2 Cameron Diaz's shallow and selfabsorbed bad girl a habitual user going down to Florida to scam her grandmother and finally discovering that she's not such an unredeemable loser after all.The problem for me is that the latter is such wellworn territory that showing all her episodes of personal failure prior to her grand faux pas of having sex with her sister's boyfriend become increasingly repetitive wastes of time  especially the sequence with the two guys who take her to the impound lot and the first sequence that lands her in jail. None of this stuff  in my opinion is needed in the film. We all know users like her aside from the allusion to her dyslexia problem that she later addresses with Norman Lloyd the other messes she creates are runofthemill. They are treated with importance while shedding no new light on her character. Once we get to Florida and Shirley Maclaine catches onto her then her ensuing transformation is worth watching but by then we're halfway through the film. Hanson also seems obsessed with showing us everything he finds interesting about filming a movie that is supposed to take place in Philadelphia.So much for the film's pacing problems. Everything else works quite well. The performances are all excellent. Shirley Maclaine Norman Lloyd Jery Adler and Mark Feuerstein are all terrific in their supporting roles with the last showing a very nice and quirky chemistry with Collette. Maclaine is surprisingly understated and not surprisingly magnificent.".

Not to mention the great job by Toni Collette OK this may not the perfect film for everyone but is sure has a lot going for it. 1Great acting 2excellent direction 3good story ... all of which adds up to quality thoughtprovoking entertainment. For what else does one go to the theater? The story involves two sisters the eldest early thirties of which has become compulsively responsible while the younger sister copes by irresponsibly acting out. Their weaknesses are the other's strengths and about the only thing they share in common is an interest in designer shoes and a gnawing sense of being adrift in the world. This much you find out in the first five minutes of the film. How the sisters struggle with each other and their ability to maintain meaningful relationships is of course the meat of the story and delightfully involves their nononsense grandmother Shirley MacLaine trying to define herself in that role.Yes in the modern vernacular In Her Shoes is most certainly a chick flick. The focus is intentionally on three women working to understand and change some stereotypic female roles in which they find themselves and they do so by struggling with feelings and seeking insights. Throw in a focus on designer shoes a close girlfriend or two to talk things over with and ...I could go on... But y'know guys the quality of this film is so high that all this stuff actually makes sense and fits. It's not overly sentimental and the end result is satisfying.Go see this film with a friend or loved one. It's a real feel good keeper.".

She is a good actress but she does pick bad roles sometimes that's her flaw.The movie itself is way better than I ever expected it to be. Most chick flicks let me down with sappiness but In Her Shoes rises way above any of that. The director Curtis Hanson lets each scene breath and doesn't rush things. Characters get a chance to express themselves through nice dialogue and subtle conversations. We really get to know these people. Shirley Mcclaine as the grandmother of the two sisters brings warmth and intelligence to every scene she's in. There are some funny moments but mostly this is a drama. There are some very touching scenes especially with Diaz and an old man in a nursing home who she befriends.There a a few flaws here and there like there are one too many plot coincidences and the overthetop portrayal of the motherinlaw but nothing bad enough to make a difference. Toni Collette and all the other actors also do great jobs. I'm a guy and I'm a little addicted to this movie I've seen it a few times. Weird.

Toni Collette was excellent as Rose played almost subtly against Cameron Diaz's more outgoing Maggie. It was good that the movie wasn't like the trailers focusing exclusively on MaggieCameron Diaz. It was good to see Rose and Ella as central to the plot. Shirley MacLaine did an outstanding job as Ella the lost grandmother Mark Feuerstein was surprisingly adorable as Simon.Definitely a great date movie but also good for a night out with family and friends.

However not only is she popular and beautiful but her father has forbidden her to date until her older sister does too.  The problem is her sister Kat is negative bad tempered and unfriendly and certainly undateable. Cameron seeks the services of school bad boy Pat who he arranges to be paid to date Kat and thus allow him to go out with Bianca  but things never go smoothly when it comes to love.I'm not a big fan of teen comedies.  They mostly are lame trading on the same old plots and clichs that have been around since Animal House and Porkies.  The recent trend has just seen classical texts adapted giving rise to some poor films like She's all that'.  The plot for this is basically The Taming of the Shrew' updated  most of it bares little resemblance to the play but that doesn't matter  the core is interesting enough to stand on it's own.  It may not surprise you in terms of who gets which girl and it's fairly predictable in a romantic comedy type way but that's not it.No  the film is funny lively and pretty enjoyable.  The comedy is built around the central plot with lots of nice touches and characters that are genuinely funny such Mr Morgan and the erotic drama writing headmistress. The jokes happily never stoop to the grossout type and this helps it feel fresh and lively rather than just scrapping the bottom of the barrel.Another strength is that the cast are all very likeable and give good performances all round.  Compared to the horror or Prince and Lillard in She's all that' this was a dream cast.  Ledger is a real up and comer and he does well here  he doesn't overegg his bad boy cake and his fall into love is believable.  Stiles is very cool and better than the teen roles she has had of late.  Here she rises above the outsider' clich given to her and does good work  again being a likeable and believable character.. GordonLevitt is OK but quite characterless compared to the main two roles likewise Oleynik.  The bets roles are those on the edges and the three adult support roles really do well and are very funny   Janney Mitchell and especially Miller on good form.  Gabrielle Union is once again given a side role that doesn't play to her strength.  I like her and want to see her in bigger roles but here she is a minority face' in a predominately white film just as she was in She's All That  maybe I'm being a little paranoid but that's what it feels like.Overall I was taken by surprise as to how funny and lively this film was. It didn't sink to the gross out comedy of so many teen movies and had characters and actors who brought spark and energy to the screen.  It may be predictable but it works and the jokes and side characters just add to the sense of fun.  Not brilliant but compared to the mediocre bunch of teen comedies you COULD watch this is fantastic!".

I would have to say it's definitely more directed towards the teenageGenX generations but it was awesome.  The tongueandcheek Shakespeare references were great the Stratford girls etc. Julia Stiles  Larisa Oleynik were convincing in their roles and not to be shallow but the guys of the movie just all looked really good.  I recommend this to most teenage girls although it's not totally a chick flick because my brother enjoyed it too.  In any case the scene with the Can't Take My Eyes Off You ballad at the soccer practice is a can'tmiss for all you love saps.  I will tell you right now the ending IS predictable but not hackneyed. It leaves you with a happy bubbly feeling about teenage love.  Excellent movie that is.  P.S. When watching this in the theaters DON'T leave as soon as the credits roll.  There are some hilarious outtakes afterwards.".

She was so cool and did such an excellent job in her role that still to this day I consider her to be the coolest teen in any 'teen movie'. Basic Plot Cameron Levitt a new student at Pagua high school falls in love with a sophomore named Bianca Stradford Oleynik. However Bianca has a flirtatious crush on the most popular senior at school named Joey Keegan.  Cameron's sidekick Michael Krumholtztells him that Bianca is looking for someone to help her with French and Cameron decides that's how he'll ask her out on a date.Kat Stradford Stiles is Bianca's sister.  Totally opposite of Bianca she is antisocial and is the most feminist high school senior you could ever meet.  Against boys dances and anything having to do with prepiness and silly fun she swears off dating and finds herself being accepted to Sarah Lawrence a college across the country in hopes to get away from her father and the city she lives in.Bianca desperately wanting to date is told by her father Miller that she will be allowed to date when her sister Kat does.  Desperate and not knowing how to get her sister to 'date for her' ends up asking Cameron her new French tutor to help her with her predicament. Enter Patrick Ledger.  An outcast and rumored to have sold his kidneys on the black market for a new set of speakers also attends Padgua high and is unsuspecting of what will happen soon in his future.Cameron and Micheal decide that in order to make this work they need a backer.  Someone who's stupid but has money.  So they go to Joey telling him that they know he likes Bianca and they need him to pay Patrick a tidy sum to have him date Kat in order for him to date Bianca.  What Joey doesn't know is that Cameron secretly plans to date Bianca while he pays Patrick to take out Kat.It may sound like a very confusing movie.  But it is so funny cleverly written and not entirely true of American teenage culture but pretty close.  The acting is wonderful and in my opinion nothing in the movie would have worked as well without the people who played their characters.  As I said before I think that Stiles' portration of Kat Stradford was right on and no one could have done it better. Her best role more than certainly and I love this movie so much!  I would have to say it's my favorite teen comedy next to The Breakfast Club.  One the best movies and a great watch!I give it a 10 out of 10.  Go rent it or better yet go buy it!  You won't regret it!".

Her father knows this is as realistic as saying When pigs begin to fly but then he can't be accused of being unfair.10 Things... is overall pretty good. It's better than I thought it would be. It has some funny moments it's got a talented cast with some older actors popping up in various humorous roles etc. It's not as refreshing or unique as a John Hughes teen comedy but it certainly plays upon some of the clichs of the genre invented by Hughes no less to good effect.Overall I was impressed with the movie and the actors and that's saying a lot considering it's a teen film a genre I have come to loathe recently with entries such as Slackers etc..".

	schema:reviewBody "When hiring this movie was first suggested I turned up my nose at it. I thought another teenagers flick where the hottest guy in school has to appreciate a lesser unpopular chick etc etc etc. Since seeing it it has enterred my all time favourites list. Any old somebody can take the formula of The Taming of the Shrue and put it into a school yard and any old somebody can avoid cle she's in the finer details coming up with decent alternatives is the hard part whatever they did here works like clockwork. I would easily give it the best teen flick mantle.Firstly the acting is perfect the roles are not overly demanding but Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger play this to perfection. The supporting cast is great aswell there is not a soul that doesn't contribute to the perfection of it all. Realism is neither what they were really going for nor what makes the movie. The language and vocabulary of these kids is phenominal words like Vapid Pensive Hanus Tempestuous Miscreants. There are lots of words like these throughout the movie. It is the thing that does the most to enable adult enjoyment.For once they avoided the school bully theme the bad guy in this is just a model who the chicks like and some of the guys hang with and alot of others just realise he is a fool. The recessive geek role is this time given alot more credibility he is given the majority of the genuinely witty one liners and finds a soul mate for himself instead of them just making it a joke that he stays a joke. There are a few parts you can really cheer in you have to watch it to appreciate them. There is truly never a dull moment.The best quote of the whole movie would have to be it's just an excuse for all the nerds at our school to rub up against each other to distract themselves from the pathetic emptiness of thier meaningless consumer driven lives that pretty much sums up the purpose of teen parties these days. For once you actually identify with the bitch role in this both she and the guy that is falsely pursuing her take a backward step usually when it comes time for the leading man to apolagise for his deceit you really cant believe him after they have focused for so long on his efforts this time for some reason you do it fits straight into the story. There is another half to that situation here aswell but I wont disclose it is probably the best bit of the movie.And the last major point is that this time the father character is a hell of alot stronger than before if that had been weak so would the rest of the movie have been but he is not. He has a reason for being there and you identify with him aswell. It is clear to see they were making the characters all strong in thier own right and stronger than the actual story.To sum it all up the characters story and acting are all perfect adults can enjoy this one aswell also because the main relationships are more stable and adult than the unpredictability of true teenage relationships if they can be called such. So here is the count.Production Values 22 Acting 22 Quality and Meaning 1.52 Screenplay 22 Originality 12Anyone can get something from this movie and most can get alot. This is a must. For the movie it is I would give it 10 but going by the main qualities listed above which all movies can be measured by it would get8.510".

But 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the classic teen movies that came out of the 90's that was actually pretty good. It had a great cast the story was original and a lot of fun and the whole movie made you laugh and feel good. This was the movie that really sky rocketed Heath Ledger's career in America and I remember in school how all the girls were just drooling over him. Also all the guys fell in love with Julia Styles she was also just awesome in this movie and made for a good strong female lead. This movie captured a great amount of what most teens go through in their world wither it's just wanting to be different popular having an over protective parent dealing with sex and rejection this movie just worked on so many levels.Cameron James the new kid at Padua High School is given a tour of the school by Michael who is an audiovisual geek. Michael provides Cameron with information on the school's various cliques. During the tour Cameron spots the beautiful and popular Bianca and is immediately smitten with her. Michael warns that Bianca is shallow conceited and worst of all not allowed to date. Michael does however inform Cameron that Bianca is looking for a French tutor. Bianca's outcast sister Kat is another problem of hers' as well as her protective father Walter as he wants Kat to attend college nearby and wants Bianca to not date thinking it will lead to premarital pregnancy. Bianca begs her father to allow her to date but is rejected Kat's aversion to dating prompts the father to come up with a new rule Bianca can only date if Kat is dating. Cameron starts tutoring Bianca and she informs him of her father's rule. This news motivates Cameron and Michael to set out to find a boy who is willing to date Kat. Patrick Verona an outcast who is just as illtempered as Kat. Cameron tries asking Patrick for his assistance Cameron pays Patrick to take Kat out. Patrick agrees but Kat however wants nothing to do with Patrick. Leading into Dawson's Creek drama.If you do have the opportunity to see 10 Things I Hate About You I do recommend that you take the chance. It's a good movie and doesn't push you around or play games with you and that's why everyone loved it because it was just honest. Plus you just have to love the adorable scene where Heath Ledger sang to Julia Styles on the bleachers and got chased around by security if that's not love and commitment then I don't know what is. It has a great happy ending and just makes you feel good.710".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm 19 now so was only 9 when '10 Things I Hate About You' came out and I have seen this film way too many times to count. There have been countless sleepovers film days random gettogethers and quite evenings alone that have all featured this film so much so that I can now pretty much recite the entire script off by heart. Yet it is a mark of just how great this film is that despite knowing it inside out I can still sit down and watch it and thoroughly enjoy doing so  it is and always will remain one of my favourite films.When I was younger I never questioned anything in the films I watched  it is only as I have grown up that I have learnt to be critical of films books and music and even now I can't fault any of the acting in '10 Things I hate About You'. Heath Ledger gives a dazzling performance as usual which is surprising considering how reluctant Ledger was to take the part in case he became typecast but the real breathtaking performance for me was by Julia Stiles  it is only now I am older that I can appreciate just how believably she managed to pull off her character that you do not for an instance question whether she is the 'rude aggressive bitter older sister of the most popular girl at school who only behaves in this way as a defence mechanism'. The remainder of the cast Jospeh GordonLevitt Larisa Oleynik David Krumholtz etc all play their parts perfectly and with a true 90's script and killer soundtrack this film couldn't fail to be anything but a success.I guess that part of the appeal of this film for me is the fact that I grew up through my teenage years constantly watching it. If I was to be introduced to this film for the first time today I am not sure whether I would like it anywhere near as much as I do now but it has a certain sentimental value for me and brings back many many memories. And I have to say in this genre of film '10 Things I hate About You' will always come out on top. I guess that this film is my generations High School Musical however there is one key difference in my opinion  although this may be a teen chick flick it is in a class of it's own quality wise and definitely should not be disregarded as anything less. Love it!!".

Some may see this movie as cheesy but i've seen worse cheese in a movie you seen the wedding singer? that one is covered in brie!! I recommend it i love it and atm i can't stop watching it!!Honestly during Kat's poem at the end I did get tearful and I love the scene where they go paintballing that scene makes my stomach tingle every time i watch it! I really don't want to put any spoilers in here so I hope what i've written so i hope what i have written has aided in your decision whether or not to watch it. At least give it a little watch it's only 93 minutes long! My only criticism is that it should be longer because i loved it so much!!WATCH IT!!".

I have to know wondering if the flash of brilliance in Hamlet was a oneshot deal.As for the quality of this film I cannot say. Teen dating dramas succeed or not based on a secret everchanging language of the subculture. I don't have a pass to that area so must demur. This isn't much Shakespeare though just the barest skeleton.Her acting seems fresh but its mighty hard to tell much here. She's not asked to do much except for one moment when she reads a poem. Gwyneth Paltrow turned out to be limited albeit sometimes entertaining in what she could bring to Shakespeare. Maybe Julia will do better.".

Said to be based on 'The Taming Of The Shrew' this adaptation is fairly week and it would easily be lost among the dozens of forgettable teen films. However it does have its funny moments. Plus the chemistry between the actors makes some scenes work. The cast does work in favour. Heath Ledger and Joseph GordonLevitt do quite well. Larisa Oleynik and Julia Stiles irritate a lot in the beginning but in the latter half of the film they improve. Allison Janney is a scene stealer as the principalaspiring erotic novel writer.

And anybody with a teenager should buy a hard copy because they will love it.I feel that I am fairly well qualified to write a review of this film as I have been conducting an unofficial study of teenage behaviour for the last 25 years as a high school teacher and I have been showing this film to my classes every year since about 2000. All up I have probably watched this film about 5 times a year for the last 15 years. And I still enjoy it!The writers are to be commended for this film  rarely do you see a film that can blend comedy with true human experience. This is a film where every scene and every shot has been carefully crafted  and the meaning is not lost on a younger audience.I could write about the storyline here or give you a few of the many really funny one liners or tell you about the brilliant casting the actors really are perfect. But instead I will just leave you with this  nearly 2 decades on and this film is STILL enthralling teenage audiences. For that alone it deserves a spot in the list of greatest teen flicks of all time. Students today have stills of this film on their smart phones and they tell me it's their favourite film like ever. Do you know how nearly impossible that is? To create a teenage flick that both guys and girls will love? Or a film with a PG rating but young adult humour? Or to make a film about teenage angst where every viewer walks away identifying with the characters and feeling empowered? Lets not hold back here a film that can win over audience after audience for nearly two decades deserves 10 stars  even if it is just a light hearted teen comedy.

Let's be honest maybe back in the day when this movie first came out people thought it was only soso... but having just watched it again after all these years well I bloody well loved it. There was just something about the 90s. There was less technology to hide behind feelings were more true movies were more original and actually funny. And who would of thought the underdogs like Joseph GordonLevitt would of turned out as handsome as he has today? What I'm basically trying to say is give this film another chance because it definitely deserves more than 6.910 rating! It has everything real visions of high school crazy cliques teenage angst HEATH LEDGER IN GLITTERY TIGHT PANTS real chemistry  etc. It was just a really cute cute movie I don't know how else to put it. Instead of just everyone sleeping with each other throughout ahem seems to be a popular storyboard these days 10 things had the works Pretty boys aiming for the fresh meat caring but somewhat psychotic parents can relate misconstrued images of one another I mean the last one in particular DEFINED high school for me. No one was who you thought they were in fact they were better.So in conclusion I demand thee to give this another go it doesn't take much effort I watched it on Youtube  and please this message goes out to all IMDb members and movie watchers alike stop being so darn critical! Especially about the 90s leave them alone. They will forever remain pure nostalgia for me and I'm sure many others.".

Regardless of the fact that it gains its inspiration from a Shakespeare classic this is no different from the many Teenlove comediesreleased as films and television series.It is still worth the cost of a rental but don't expect anything great. Of the Shakespearetofilm  movies this is likely the worst or very close to it.";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS THROUGHOUT. I saw 'Ten Canoes' at Cannes and I was absolutely awestruck. Even now almost precisely a year later I've difficulty writing about this film without being emotionally overcome. Yes damn it the movie's that good that wonderful that miraculous.I feel a deep attachment to this film and its subject matter. As you might guess from my email address  Borroloola an aboriginal settlement in the Northern Territory  I spent several of my formative years in Australia's outback notably the Red Centre Arunta and the Northern Territory not far from where 'Ten Canoes' was filmed. I've been privileged to live with or nearby to members of several of the indigenous tribes from that part of Australia. The people in 'Ten Canoes' both the actors and the roles they portray are of the Yolngu and Gunwinggu tribes whereas most of my own friendships in that region are with members of the Nunggubuyu and Gunbalanya groups. All of these tribes are centred in the Arnhem Land region so I recognised much of the land and language in this wonderful movie.I was surprised that this film's English title has a number in it because the Arnhem Land natives did not use number words until recently. They quantify an object by naming it as many times as needed. For instance the Nunggubuyu word for 'day' is 'jami' so 'three days' would be 'jami jami jami'. This system works well enough for quantities of as many as five a hand's worth for more than five of anything they use a word for 'many'.It turns out that the title 'Ten Canoes' is largely irrelevant and mostly symbolic. Ten Yolngu warriors are on an expedition to steal goose eggs from their nests insert 'poached eggs' joke here. To travel by water the warriors must construct one canoe for each man. But the title refers to the ten men themselves or their physical bodies vessels canoes in which their souls travel the river current of existence. The press kit at Cannes said that this film's title was inspired by a photograph ... yet that photo is never seen in this film. My own explanation fits the circumstances just as well.The film's narration by David Gulpilil is perfect. He speaks his lines in an accent containing just enough Strine to link the action to modern Australia without evoking Mick Dundee or any Ocker stereotypes.Several supernatural events occur during this film but they're conveyed in native Australian terms not Hollywood clichs ... so don't expect any CGI fx mucking up this wonderful story. The beautiful photography is entirely at the service of native Australian storytelling techniques. Even the subtle manipulation of colour which could have been just one more gimmick adds a dimension to the narrative.The aboriginal actors with their distinctive Dravidian facial structures photograph astonishingly. Unfortunately for the film one or two of them have modern dentition spoiling the effect that we're witnessing events occurring thousands of years before white men's arrival in Australia. The main Gunwinggu character has a moustache just a bit too neatly trimmed. More favourably I was delighted by a scene which shows accurately how these ancient men who have no metal are able to shave their beards.Very credibly their preoccupations are much as we might expect flatulence sex physical urges.Because I've done continuity work on several films I compulsively check every movie I view and its soundtrack for continuity errors or anachronisms. As I watched and enjoyed 'Ten Canoes' and the beautiful footage of Arnhem Land flora and fauna I kept checking for jet contrails rabbit fences bird calls by imported species or any other signs of modern life in this movie's depiction of dawntime Australia. The flawless teeth of a couple of the actors were the only flaws in this film.I wept with joy and delight at the beauty and narrative power of this unique and precious film. A rating of 10 out of 10 isn't good enough but it'll have to do. If you have any passion at all for anything outside the usual Hollywood or Bollywood clichs you must see 'Ten Canoes'.".

Playfully narrated by Australian icon David Gulpilil Ten Canoes directed by Rolf de Heer The Tracker and Peter Djigirr tells a dreaming story that acts as a lesson for a young man in the tribe who feels that the youngest wife of his older brother should be his. The story has elements of kidnapping sorcery and revenge but is mostly about values how a community living in a natural environment before the coming of the White man developed laws and systems to guide its people. The cast consists of indigenous residents of the Arafura region and many of the visuals recreate the photographs of Donald Thompson a Melbourne anthropology professor who spent time in the 1930s with the Yolngu people of the Arafura Swamp.Set a thousand years ago in central Arnhem Land near the Arafura Swamp in northern Australia east of Darwin a group of Ganalbingu tribesmen embark on a hunt for magpie geese a wild bird used to sustain the tribe. To navigate the crocodileinfested swamp elder Minygululu Peter Minygululu leads the tribe in building canoes made out of bark. When he discovers that Dayindi played by Gulpilil's son Jamie has a crush on his third wife he tells him a story set in a mythical time after the great flood that explains how his people developed laws to govern their behavior the same laws used by the tribes today. To distinguish between the past and the present De Heer uses muted color to show the ancient landscape and black and white for the more modern story.In the beginning Ridjimiraril Crusoe Kurddal lives with his three wives Banalandju Nowalingu Frances Djulibing and Munandjarra in a camp with others including Birrinbirrin Richard Birrinbirrin an overweight elder whose sole pleasure in life is to eat honey. Ridjimiraril's younger brother Yeeralparil Jamie who lives in the single men's camp fancies the beautiful Munandjarra and spends much time stealing visits to the other camp hoping to catch a glimpse of her. When a stranger approaches without warning the men are frightened especially when he tells them that he wants to trade objects of magic.The local sorcerer warns the men of danger but life proceeds normally until the jealous Nowalingu disappears after a fight with Banalandju. Though the others believe that she simply ran away Ridjimiraril is convinced that she was abducted by the stranger and receives confirmation for his fear when an old uncle appears and says that he saw his wife in a camp with the stranger. The men are galvanized into action and a war party is prepared. Through myth and illuminating visuals Ten Canoes generates a greater awareness and understanding of indigenous Australian culture and acts as an impressive counterweight to the argument that Aborigines should give up their past and join the modern world. That the film is entertaining and deeply moving as well as informative is a very welcome bonus indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "On a recent visit to Melbourne I came across a poster for the movie Ten Canoes. It described a film about Australian Aborigines and claimed to portray them authentically. The film sets a new standard for crosscultural understanding. Ever since Whale Rider I have been entranced by movies about aboriginal culture. This film extends the genre onto a higher plane.The narrator tells a story about men hunting for goose eggs in canoes while one tells a story from the ancient times. Both stories are woven exquisitely together to form a dreamlike telling. The cinematography captures the actual remote locations the tribe inhabits. The characters are portrayed as authentically as can be probably because they are. At least it seemed that way to a white guy from Boston. I don't know if any are actual actors.If you have interest in any aboriginal culture or anything Australian you should see this movie. If you love great story telling you must see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes who lived to be 92 and spent much of his life in the aristocratic splendour of Hardwick Hall Derbyshire famously opined that the life of primitive man was solitary poor nasty brutish and short. Jacques Rousseau on the other hand in direct contradiction of Christian theology was convinced that man had been born good and that primitive man was indeed the noble savage.Rolf de Heer a maker of small quirky and interesting films Bad Boy Bubby The Old Man Who Read Love Stories The Tracker probably doesn't subscribe to either notion. In this exquisitely photographed tale from the mythical past he lets the aboriginals of the Arafura wetlands Arnhem Land tell their own story. Apart from David Gulpilil who provides a gentle teasing voiceover and his son Jamie all the parts are played by nonprofessional actors from the district. Apart from the voiceover all the dialogue is in the local aboriginal language don't worry there are subtitles.While on a goose egg hunting trip Older Brother  who has noticed his younger brother's interest in one of his wives tells Younger Brother a story from a much earlier time of another younger brother who yearned after his older brother's wife. Without giving the story away the moral is be careful about what you wish for you might get it but much happens in between. It becomes evident that these savages as well as possessing a robust sense of humor have a legal system that minimizes the damage done by crimes. It seems that neighboring tribes whose language our tribe scarcely understands will play by the same rules. Once honour is satisfied the matter is at an end. The story gives us an insight as to how aboriginal society remained stable for so long prior to contact with Europeans.It is hard to comment on the acting other than to say the characters seem completely authentic. The tribe's sorcerer for instance likes to choose a bone to wear in his nose to suit his mood or the occasion just as your local GP might like to select a bow tie before opening his surgery. But I have to mention Crusoe Kusddal as Ridjimiraril the older brother in the myth. His language means little to us but his expression everything.The scenes on the goosehunt which bookend the main story are in black and white a tribute to earlier photographers in Arnhem Land but most of the film is in colour which does full justice to the landscape. This is no Garden of Eden  the necessity to build tree platforms while camping in the swamp is evidence of that though we see no actual crocodiles. Yet the aborigines manage to live within the environment without despoiling it or each other. Theirs is a patriarchal society but women are protected by the rules as well as by their menfolk. The movie is a fascinating glimpse into the culture told in a disarmingly humorous fashion by the people themselves. One should not be too mistyeyed about this  the cast probably watch The Simpsons via satellite at home  but they have given us both a droll tale and some food for thought.".

	schema:reviewBody "I encourage you to also read the other comments on this site for TEN CANOES as each also will add to the clear understanding of this astonishing Australian film by master film maker Rolf DeHeer. He is a Dutch immigrant to Australia whose unique look at this country has now produced a superb library of films each different that contribute to a fascinating movie spectrum of impressions of Australian life. TEN CANOES is an Aboriginal parable set possibly ten thousand years ago. It has hilarious casual dialog and familiar situations depicting tribal family and community life that humanizes this people in a heightened way so accessible to audiences of 2007. At this time in a new century we are now blessed with a sequence of Australian aboriginal themed films I encourage you to find and view in their production order JEDDA directed by Charles Chauvel in 1956 WALKABOUT d Nicolas Roeg in 1970 STORM BOY in 1976 THE LAST WAVE d Peter Weir in 1977 RABBIT PROOF FENCE d Phil Noyce in 2003 THE TRACKER d Roldf De Heer and now TEN CANOES. Incredibly and as a bonus celebrated Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil features in all of them except Jedda... and as a bonus in theme his son Jamie is the lead actor in TEN CANOES with David narrating. TEN CANOES will take you to a reality and a community unlike anything ever depicted in any film ever. As alike those above it is presented and magnificently filmed in cinemascope differently to any Australian or 'primitive' feature I have ever had the fascinating engrossing pleasure of seeing. Just to study the timeless faces alone is a peep into history and often delivered with very funny and genuinely suspenseful and heartwarming results. De Heer is now a film maker par excellence now finally getting major recognition in this country with a broad range of different and arresting films unlike any other film maker I can name. just for starters check out the comments for BAD BOY BUBBY ALEXANDRA'S PROJECT THE QUIET ROOM alone for a jaw dropping range of themes. Even if you see TEN CANOES and find the journey into the Australian stone age initially difficult you will be astonished at the visuals presented and in awe of the fact this was ever captured on film with such humor and accessible humanities.".

	schema:headline " Not likely to see anything like this ever again";
	schema:reviewBody "This story begins with an aerial flyover of Arnhem Land in northern Austalia. A narrator comes on saying that he is going to tell a story his story. His story starts with the recounting of a tale about his ancestors of a few generations back who are making canoes to traverse a crocodilefilled swamp in search of goose eggs. Within that tale a wise older man is telling another somewhat parallel tale to his younger brother dating back many generations to the ancients. In a clever plotting device the ancestor's tale is shown in black and white while the ancient's tale is shown in color. This technique has the dual effect of allowing director Rolf de Heer to duplicate scenes from black and white photographs taken in the area by an anthropologist in the 1930s photographs that motivated the making of this film as well as helping the viewer keep the stories straight.The cast consists of a few dozen modern day aboriginals playing the parts in the two stories. They try to capture the reality of the times portrayed and you can believe that this was the way it could have been thousands of years ago for a tribe of early humans. The earlier Astralians have their own customs and language and the cast speaks in their native language with English subtitles. I kept thinking of how the basic emotions driving the stories are still with usfear jealousy lust love trust distrust pride humor courage loyalty honor. The culture presented is indeed not mine but it is perfectly understandable. Sorcerers keep the tribe stirred up and mystified with special knowledge of magic just as modern religions do with equal effectiveness. There are laws that must be obeyed even if unwritten. The young men relish showing prowess in hunting and war making. A creator is deemed the prime mover. Marital relationships are not always harmonious especially if polygamous. And so on. It appears that no matter how it manifests itself a culture will wrap itself around basic human emotions and desires. It would not be a stretch to recast these stories in a modern setting.The photography of the landscape is beautiful and sensuous it contributes greatly to the stories by showing what an intimate relationship early peoples had with the land and its fauna.This movie helps us better appreciate where we came from and what we are.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was absolutely mesmerizing! Gulpilil's first bizarre laugh shocked me. It was so alien! Strange! Uncontrolled! It made me look around to see how the other people I was watching with had reacted. I didn't know how to react myself to a laugh that was so fearless and unreserved.Those were the qualities that I appreciated most about this film. The story was told with no softening no regard for how strange it may or may not seem to people outside their world. For once a film didn't blur the edges or offer any excuse for the way of life of the people on the screen which was so different from our homogenized experience. The film said they are what they are. This is the way they live. This is their story. And it was marvelous.This story was told with perfect directness but fabulous imagination. The shots of various possible scenarios being played out took me right into the world of the characters listening to the story. Yes these scenarios and the changing between colour and black and white exposed the movie for what it was  a movie  but they took me back in my mind to a truly innocent time when my mum could tell me a story and the scenarios played out so clearly in my head that I really did believe there was an ankle grabber under the bed. The storytelling really was captivating in its simplicity. What a magnificent film.".

It made me look around to see how the other people I was watching with had reacted. I didn't know how to react myself to a laugh that was so fearless and unreserved.Those were the qualities that I appreciated most about this film. The story was told with no softening no regard for how strange it may or may not seem to people outside their world. For once a film didn't blur the edges or offer any excuse for the way of life of the people on the screen which was so different from our homogenized experience. The film said they are what they are. This is the way they live. This is their story. And it was marvelous.This story was told with perfect directness but fabulous imagination.

When hearing a new language such as this it is important to hear things clearly  sadly the capacity of the Adelaide Festival to screen the film was lacking on this front.That said the film is filled with compelling visuals not unlike one of the earlier films of de Heer and it has some very quaint albeit base amusement wrapped into the story.Set a 1000 years ago before white fellas came to Australia this is a dual story one told in the immediate black and whitesepia world of reality and one told in the rich color of the Aboriginal dream time... both stories are pretty much the same and the roles are played by the same actors in each so there are points where it's easy to get a little confused by who is doing what and when  but over all this is what you'd call a worthy film  it has the look of an old documentary at times and that's not a bad look.I enjoyed it despite the technological problems of this screening.".

In this way Rolf de Heer's approach reminds me of Pier Paolo Pasolini's especially in The Gospel According to St. Matthew. Ten Canoes begins. Hear the insects the birds? Of course you do. You are literally over Arnhem Land in what is now the northern part of Australianearest big city Darwin. You seem to fly maybe like a spirit from the tribal waterhole. We all begin in a waterhole well maybe not all. You will see it soon if you see Ten Canoes. The story goes that before you are born you may ask your father who your mother will be. When you die your soul returns to the waterhole and there you wait to ask your next father the same question.Spirits are everywhere in everything. Animism you say. Maybe yes maybe no. In any event this is a story within a story wrapped in another story. The narrator tells of the time when a younger brother wanted to get married but all the women in the clan were already taken. His older brother had three wives. The younger brother lusted after the youngest wife of his older brother. Perhaps his older brother was not able to satisfy all three of his wives.The narrator lives in the present. He is telling the story of the younger brother who in reality as an actor in this film is his own son. Yes the son is playing the narrator's ancestor. And why not? He plays his own ancestor in the story which his older brother tells him about a time very very long before when the people were different yet acted the same and a younger brother coveted one of his older brother's wives. Are you confused? Don't be. You'll be fine. The older brother tells this story a tale set in the deepest past. He tells it to his younger brother because he knows about his brother's lusts. He's actually been told by the younger brother that he needs a wife and that that wife should be the older brother's younger wife. The older brother tells this story as the brothers and others in their very extended family engage in a hunt for geese and goose eggs in the swamp. They need canoes for this expedition and in the ways which have been passed down by ancestors they construct ten of them made from tree bark. This is a secret you'll love to watch.The contemporary narrator lays this all out for you and even tells you about the cross river mob. His language is a bit different. He is of the present. He has been living amongst European settlers. The tales told by him have taken place long before any European landed in Australia long before the Dutch touched the beaches of Western Australia in the early 17th Century. Yes long ago but still close enough to see.The tales are told of a time very much unlike our own. It was a time and place where humans lived in communities without private ownership of Nature without money without rents without wages without a State without classes. It was a very different time. Not a wholly bad time nor a wholly good time. This was just a very different time a time and place where different things mattered to people and where people mattered more than things. It was a time when what you did with others was all shared more or less equally and what you did for yourself was yours if you wanted it that way. Women are seen gathering nuts together for the tribe. Men are seen hunting geese for the tribe and sleeping on hastily constructed platforms in trees with fires going all night to repel the mosquitoes. Children run free and in fact belong to all. The sense of time is not one of clocks. It is long. It is without meaning except perhaps as a river flow has meaning.If you want to experience this kind of time and place I urge you to see Ten Canoes. It's an experience in story telling which you won't forget soon. It has humour beauty life love death and joy. It is a story about when dreams come true....he he...".

A word of warning however there are several scenes that are somewhat well earthy Let's just say I can't really recall ever having seen human feces in a film before. But you will be glad to know that the emotional scarring is not as severe as first thought If anything what this film reinforces is what we should have already known  that basically we are all practically the same regardless of skin colour culture or religion.

It is the genuine article about the magic told with magic. It is circular nested and webbed. It floats and if you let it you will nearly be lost.The cinematography here  all the cinematic values  are only slightly apparent and when they declare themselves it is in the service of the story switching from subdued color to bright to signal the shift of what story you are in. Otherwise the camera is either in conventional documentary mode or in space following spirits across landscapes as they voyage from waterhole python ouroboros and back.What we have here is good old oral storytelling supplemented by image and highly structured. Essentially everything is told by an offscreen aboriginal narrator whose convoluted beginning establishes all sorts of narrative pockets that are revisited later. The story is a tree we are told and in its telling we visit many branches. There is a sort of beginning but it is nearly too complicated to describe. There is an ending but no. After a chuckle the narrator tells us he has no idea how it ends.Ostensibly the story is told by the offscreen narrator of a hunting party of aboriginal men who make ten bark canoes and go hunting and gathering in the swamp. Over that period in the story a wise man tells a story to his impatient much younger brother. That inner story shifts to color. It is supposed to be in a time in between creation and the full solidifying of men on earth. So the characters in the inner story are played by the folks in the outer one and the main threads are folded together a matter of the young man's desire for the older brother's youngest wife.But that is the merest of threads. We are told that the story is a tree. We literally see that tree shorn of bark and made into simple canoes. We literally see our hunters  in both stories  camping in trees. The story seems to ramble. There is sorcery mystery charmed turds. There is revenge jokes anthropology. Its all of a context. A point of all this is that there cannot be a point in the western sense. There isn't a linear narrative here with a message. There is a walkabout through a storyspace.The very first event we see tells us this in a remarkable way. Our ten men are walking single file and the last man halts the party. He refuses to be last he says because someone is farting. The line is consequently reshuffled. It is a gentle device one that sets the magic for what follows a nonlinear shuffle.The joke at the end has the same form. The last one the youngest wife is not how the thing ends.The entire production we are told uses aboriginal talent exclusively.

	schema:reviewBody "Rolf De Heer is hands down the best filmmaker in Australia. I hope he never has to struggle for financing. Each film he makes is unique and yet the only thing that unites them is his originality and intellectual depth. The Tracker Alexandra's Project Bad Boy Bubby The Old Man who Read Love Stories these are some of the best films this country has ever produced and he does it here again with Ten Canoes.In the 1930's Dr Donald Thompson an anthropologist lived and worked with the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land in an effort to bridge cultural divisions. He took some four thousand plate glass photographs which encapsulated the lives and culture of the people. These extraordinary photographs were introduced to Rolf de Heer by his good friend and collaborator actor David Gulpilil. The Tracker Storm Boy. It was the image of ten canoeists hunting for goose eggs in a swamp which inspired de Heer and provides the setting for the black and white section of the film which stars David's son Jamie. The film is said to mirror the photographs very closely. The other more dramatic tale occurs in mythical time and is shot in glorious stark colors with roving Steadicams.The entire film is in the Yolngu language save David's brief voiceover though a Yolngu language version with no subtitles also exists. This film is without white people and convention and is all the better for it. It tears apart barriers and utilizes story telling devices in a fresh style. I felt as though I was witnessing a new form of technique a new language of cinema unlike Baz Booringhams overblown toss Australia.It is a beautiful story rich in drama humor and culture. The photography of Ian Jones de Heer's frequent associate is magnificent. Watching the lush green aerials on the big screen juxtaposed with quiet meanderings through swamps with thick dark canopy's is truly aweinspiring. I hope you are able to watch it on a big wide screen in the cinema it was exquisite.This was a cinematic experience rarely felt a freshness of approach with a master filmmaker in command and yet this is also the Yolngu people's film. De Heer shares directing credit with Peter Djigirr which demonstrates the level of collaboration involved. For example there was no such thing as casting. There are people living in the region who are descended from those in the Thompson photographs therefore they had the right to portray their ancestors. There were many other cultural considerations that shaped the entire story and made this the most unique Australian film ever made. It certainly feels like it. I knew I was watching something very special indeed. It deserved its A.F.I. Australian Film Institute win for Best Film.It's hard to pick a highlight but Richard Birrinbirrin's honey addiction is hilarious. I felt proud as an Australian that somebody had actually bothered to connect with the indigenous people of this land and discover the rich resource of their culture which is still mainly foreign to us Balanda today. I cried also for that very same reason.Any way you look at it from a technical point of view to its originality and stunning imagery to a piece of celluloid as a cultural experience Ten Canoes is truly remarkable.".

We would have never been able to see or experience a culture like this if it wasn't for this film. Director Rolf de Heer was inspired by Dr. Donald Thomson who first captured the aboriginal group with an extensive group of photographs especially one photo of ten men in bark canoes hence the title.

The making of bonus features allow us to see how difficult it was to make but also how authentic it is.";

In some cultures the young fella might just get a clip around the ear but in their culture it involves a story taking several days to tell.May not sound fascinating but the movie is built around what all good movies should be an interesting story.

But I have to admit that I have often wondered about his choice of roles. So many of his titles were big budget clichs with no heart. '10 Items Or Less' for me marks the return of Freeman to a role that truly showcases his considerable acting talents.Freeman plays an unnamed formerly big time Hollywood actor who hasn't worked in several years. He has been offered a part in an unspecified indi picture for which he is doing some research at a grocery store in a poor neighborhood in LA. After being stranded there by his flaky driver Freeman is offered a ride home by checkout girl Scarlet Paz Vega whom he has semibefriended. Before she can take him home however Scarlet has a big job interview she needs to get to and Freeman agrees to tag along in exchange for the ride.The movie follows Scarlet and Freeman to several locations but the movie is really just a character piece about the interactions between the two. Freeman is the quintessential disconnected Hollywood type who hasn't heard of Target and doesn't know his own telephone number or even what day of the week it is. He spouts wisdom from the Dalai Lama filtered thru his 'the whole world is but a stage' mentality and repeatedly calls Scarlet's job interview an 'audition'. And yet he has a way with people a way of affecting them that extends beyond his fame. He is a fan of humanity. He studies them asks incessant questions about them and delights in their quirks where others would simply be annoyed. In Scarlet he sees the stubborn proud loner that he was he sees the man he used to be.Scarlet for her part displays a fierce pride and sharp tongue that serve to hide her own insecurities about herself. Vega plays the role with a connection to Freeman that skates the line between an almost daughterly love and physical attraction although she plays it beautifully and it's not at all as creepy as it sounds. But even as she feels her connection to Freeman grow Scarlet has a keen eye for the reality of their different worlds and cuts thru Freeman's Hollywood bullhit with a sharp pragmatism that refuses to accept anything but the truth.The movie is smart funny and well written with dialogue that is simple but effective. I read one IMDb review that said the lines were 'stilted' which I think is a misinterpretation of realistic human speech. There are no big soliloquies here no deep soul searching moments. And so the trick is I think to show how people in ordinary everyday life can forge connections with one another. And I think Freeman and Vega pull it off beautifully painting a picture of a bond between two people that glitters like sun on the ocean ethereal and elusive. Long after it's gone it lives on in your memories tantalizing you with what might have been. OK that was a bit flowery but I really did like the performances and the movie. I would definitely recommend it.".

Together they explore discover and learn from each other. To do that of course they must be vulnerable interested in change and have a sense of humour all of which they both have. I wish this film was realistic I wish this type of story happened more often I wish we didn't have to go to the movies to realize that we can indeed connect with each other even if we come from vastly different backgrounds. The film's message is based in the open heart and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other from there  a world where peace could be a possibility.";

	schema:reviewBody "10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writerdirector Brad Silberling just a little film shot in Carson CA that feels like the entire story was improvised...in the best sense of the word. Silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman in between his big projects with Spanish actress Paz Vega and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other.Morgan Freeman plays himself  yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things. His 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters among others one Scarlet the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job she is also generally angry about her philandering husband Bobby Cannavale currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy coworker Anne Dudek and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other.It is a simple story simply told but because of the tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message. It is well worth viewing and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching informative and comic  a pleasure to view. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Running only seventytwo minutes this small overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a twocharacter sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations. Taking place almost entirely in various nondescript spots in southern Los Angeles the story itself is inconsequential but like Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter. It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters. Finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his bigscreen specialty Freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat selfindulgent movie star. His character is driven to a lowrent grocery store in Carson where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie film.Out of work for a few years he is embarrassed when he sees DVDs of his films in the bargain bin but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff. Of particular fascination to him is Scarlet an embittered worker from Spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency. She has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company but her deepseeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already. Still looking like Penelope Cruz's Amazonian sister the beautiful Vega one of the few redeemable aspects of James L. Brooks' execrable Spanglish brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to Scarlet. She and Freeman interplay very well throughout the story which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at Target Arby's and a fullservice carwash. Nothing earthshattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters.Silberling keeps the proceedings simple but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in Phedon Papamichael's vibrant cinematography he lensed Alexander Payne's Sideways and the infectious score by Brazilian composer Antonio Pinto City of God. There are fast cameos by Bobby Cannavale as Scarlet's soontobeexhusband and as themselves Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman as well as a funny bits with Jonah Hill Knocked Up as the clueless driver and Jim Parsons the knight in Garden State as a worshipful receptionist. The 2007 DVD is overstuffed with extras including a makingof documentary 15 Days or Less aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes six extended scenes a lighthearted but insightful threeway conversation between Silberling Freeman and Vega in the middle of Target and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a splendidly done simplistic film that explores a theme and gives each viewer something different that they take from it. The premise is simple an unnamed celebrity actor Morgan Freeman decides to research for an upcoming role by visiting a store and watching people. He takes particular interest in the cashier at the 10 Items or Less lane Paz Vega who he finds an amiable strong and curious presence.Both actors play off each other brilliantly and bring solid dimension to characters in what is a character study. Not a conventional character study they each represent entire worlds. The cashier's life is mired in a harsh and frustrating real world while the actor is so enmeshed in his fantasy existence that he can't do simple tasks like remember phone numbers. He readily admits he's putting on a face when he talks to people and the whole point of researching real people shows he's not one of them.But not only is the actor inspired by real people for his work we see the reverse process as well. Several characters recognize Him and make reference to how he has inspired them with his movie roles.The cashier's favorite song Al Pasar la Barca about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and prefers instead to pay ie do honest work for boat passage couldn't have been chosen better. It parallels with the Vega character the only store employee with any brains or ambition who is willing to work hard to succeed. That's quite an aspiration for somebody who looks like Paz Vega. It's an odd little film probably made on a shoestring. If you don't mind slow pacing and a talky approach this film will entertain. The characters are perfectly contrasted and the effective acting makes them endearing. A nice watch.".

I've watched this film about 56 times now  it always leaves me feeling warm and happy and thankful that in our world of monster budget blockbusters some actors are still willing to take the time to just tell a good simple story that entertains. Very disappointed that it is not available to stream anywhere yet but I have purchased it and I'm glad it's a part of my permanent library now. For Big Bang Theory fans there is a short but fun cameo by Jim Parsons. Available on Amazon for a very reasonable price  it's worth it. I would say totally family friendly but there is some language. Other than a few curse words here and there not frequent or throughout it is absolutely appropriate for ages 12 and up and I'm a fairly straightlaced parent.".

It doesn't have much of a plot it doesn't need it. It's the human contact that makes the film special. I loved all the little silly and funny things Morgan did when meeting other people and the way he picked up Scarlet. She was lucky to meet him as he decided to help her gain a new perspective on her life. Morgan encouraged her to go to an interview for a job she dreamed of and supported her all he could. Scarlet was able to talk about her concerns with a real actor who knew that life was about playing roles. Pick a role you like and have courage to play it. I was pleased to see Morgan take joy in the human interaction. The film can certainly make you get a more relaxed approach to life and give you ideas how to make it more interesting and enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reviewed at the Sept 12 2006 2nd screening at the Paramount 1 theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival. The film had World Premiered the day before at the Elgin Theatre VISA Screening Room.The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman playing a one time popular actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent etc. The downward slope is indicated by his being a long time between roles with previous flicks in bargain DVD bins and his being chauffeured by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops Freeman off at a local community market where he is going to do research for a role as supermarket manager. He soon discovers the reallife market is run by a ironwilled 10 Items or Less checkout line clerk played by Paz Vega. When Freeman's ride never returns and Vega needs help in prepping for an interview the circumstances cause them to join forces in a ride across town to get Freeman back home and to get Vega a job that'll get her on a more upwardly mobile career path.While the film was enjoyable it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress. There were two extended musical sequences One with Vega  Freeman teaching each other children's songs in the car one that literally plays like a Paul Simon music video that felt like padding to bring up the time and even then the film was only about 80 minutes long.It's a good thing Morgan Freeman is as well liked as he is because without him this would have been too little. Sure it was funny in parts and Paz Vega is a delight as well but there was just not enough here to say it was a complete film.They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and Paz Vega said she never does that. Who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no!? In the real world it's the exact opposite.Make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits. The bit with a Target Store saleslady teaching Morgan Freeman how to hustle sales is just hilarious! An early bit where Freeman's chauffeur insists it is Freeman's voice on a Books on Tape reading was also pretty funny.The directorwriter Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a brief QA after the screening. Silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took the role he actually changed very little of what was there. Quite a compliment for both Silberling's writing and also about how Freeman can just slip into a role and make it feel entirely like he was born to play it.".

Clocking in at just 82 minutes 10 ITEMS OR LESS doesn't stretch the story trying to grasp at inane topics. It stays focused being funny sad and well thought out.Morgan Freeman LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN stars as Him an aging actor grasping at any roles presented to him. We're introduced to Him as he travels to a supermarket in an outoftheway section of town by The Kid Jonah Hill CLICK. Realizing he has a star in his car The Kid pressures Him to talk about his absence in cinema over the past few years. Him isn't very forthcoming because not only has he been out of it for while he's also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in I haven't decided if I'm going to accept the part.. The Kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of nowheresville. Stuck Him decides to check out the local market. He immediately runs into the beautiful Scarlet Paz Vega who operates the 10 items or less register. Not just strikingly pretty but intelligent Him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role. He learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated community.But Him doesn't just use Scarlet he helps her so he can see deeper into her life. They travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband and he teaches her how to act to get a new job she's pining for and how to dress for success even when confronted with Target as the epitome of local clothing. This is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of Him too showing his complete lack of understanding of the chainstore retail world These shirts are only 12 bucks! How is this possible?! The ending as stated at the beginning of this review is abrupt but apropos. There's no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond. They know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other. It's a quiet but riveting moment as Scarlet's clunker car sits idling outside Him's L.A. mansion.This is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going. And it won't waste your time either.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a difficult movie to classify 10 Items or Less. Generally I don't care about defining genres but there's something about this movie that makes you want to put it in a specific category in order to transmit even with only one word your feelings about it. I completely recommend this film to anyone and if you truly enjoy cinema and if you enjoy life you'll want to do the same as soon as you've finished watching it. I recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting it's not perfect but it doesn't do anything wrong. I don't want to sound like I contradict myself but I believe writerdirector Brad Silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspiring script. I'm sure he wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection a product that would be as simple appealing and uncompromising as its title. Well he's done it. Silberling director of long complex dramatic movies like City of Angels and Moonlight Mile proves with 10 Items or Less which closes in at just 70 minutes the passion he has for his work and also the faith he has in it. To put an actor Morgan Freeman in front of a woman Paz Vega in a grocery store and take them exactly to the places ordinary life would take them is what Silberling proposes here. I can't tell you no more because within the apparent simplicity lies a thought provoking background that shouldn't be underestimated. Because here everyone's exposed the camera focuses directly on the two main characters who share endless conversation in a car ride with stops that's not endless only because life is life. And let me express how praise how well Silberling handles the situation by saying that he reaches in less time not only in movie duration time but in the single day that the movie develops its events and in a smaller place the kind of connection between two characters that Sofia Coppola generated in Lost In Translation.That movie set in Tokyo also encountered an actor and a woman and they also had conversations about the moments they were living in their lives. It's in the conversations where we sense the though provoking quality of 10 Items or Less and just as in Coppola's movie the naturalness of every situation is never lost and the images with all music and no words don't seem forced or included in the picture to 'buy time'. In this aspect the collaboration of Silberling and his director of photography Phedon Papamichael. The man who shot the beautiful sceneries in Sideways and focused on every emotion in Patch Adams delights us here with visual passages of true natural beauty. But the ultimate beauty of 10 Items or Less can be found in its cast by Avy Kaufman in its two protagonists. They are the ones who transmit this feeling I mentioned at the beginning and I can't specify we feel their connection and we can tell they're having fun and that they may even be improvising stuff. Academy Award Winner Morgan Freeman also an executive producer of the film simply stands there and confirms the status he has today in the movie industry and one that's well deserved a quiet man filled with wisdom that can easily make you cry as he can make you laugh. And the beautiful Paz Vega well I said she was great in SpanglishHere she proves she's the real deal and Hollywood's not small for her.".

I thought his 'City of Angels' was terrific and given that '10 Items or Less' had the unusual pairing of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega I was curious. Now after seeing this delightful little picture I can say it's definitely worth watching. The story is about the randomness in life and how it can lead to something precious as is depicted through the random encounter of a famous actor and a supermarket cashier.The relationship between the two is beautifully portrayed through simple interactions. The one thing they have in common is that both these people are fed up with the current state of their lives and they want something better. While they plan on moving forward as the actor attempts to make a comeback and the cashier goes to her interview they are pessimistic and uncertain questioning whether there's any point at all in taking a step forward if the result is going to be the same.I'm glad to finally see Morgan Freeman in a proper lead role. His actor is funny charming friendly likable and smart. He more than proves that he can carry a lead role. Paz Vega wonderfully matches wits with Freeman as she holds her own. Cameos by Annie Dudek Bobby Canavale and Jim Parsons are hilarious.'10 Items or Less' is another example of how less is more. The clever writing boasts of humour and satire. The running time is less than the standard 90 minutes. It has a very simple look to it and is made on a modest budget. Coupled with this are the writing performances and direction that make '10 Items or Less' a movie treat.".

How Morgan Freeman's unnamed character psychically not physicallyarrives to where he meets this jaded checkout girl who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor who also happens to be getting it on with her philandering husband played by Bobby Cannavale in a small role is somehow left for us to witness more than deduce and their witty banter  two people on opposite sides of the coin of society  is deceptively simple.

	schema:reviewBody "I had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews. Then....Here's my additional 'two cents' to the already posted excellent 'lost in translation' review. Premise Morgan is 'stuck' in a dusty small town where he meets lovely Scarlet who is working in the local supermarket. Can Morgan help elevate the lovely Scarlet from her trailer trash life?Realistic dialog? NOT. How about that shopping in Target. First Freeman looks at the Target interior as if he's walked into Harrods. Then he's bowled over at a Tshirt rack confirming he has NEVER been in any store visited by lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as gleeful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life.One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and exhubby fight scene where her survival a car in this instance requires she physically attack her ex hubbie. Does Freeman run to her defense....naw...he's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real sorry lot in life. Freeman's character believes a car wash and new very revealing tight fitting blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless 'stage talk' where all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to one or another stage related Freeman experience was irritating. Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces vis a vis uneducated no white collar skills or experience VERY POOR no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem. Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as some people pay 100 for a Tshirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her lack of education and white collar job skills. In the end Freeman offers Scarlet little more than strange diversion with a 'star'not even paying for gas for Scarlet's dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which Freeman cares not to know.".

	schema:reviewBody "In all honesty if someone told me the director of Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events City of Angels and Caspers was going to do a neat little low budget indie film and that'd it be real good I'd say that person must be joking. But that's what director Brad Siberling did. And it was really good.10 Items or Less has a similar conceit to films like Before Sunrise Lost in Translation or more recently Once. It involves the chance meeting of two people who if serendipity didn't put them there they'd probably never cross paths or if they did they wouldn't say word one to each other. Like those films 10 Items or Less focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters come to understand each other and build on each other's strengths and weaknesses.The story involves Morgan Freeman playing an unnamed actor who goes to research his role as a grocery store employee for an upcoming independent movie and because of things beyond his control ends up spending the day with the lady in the 10 items or less lane played by Paz Vega. She has a rotten marriage and is hoping to land a new job as a secretary. Initially Freeman's character just needs a lift home. After spending time with her however he wants to get to know her and maybe even offer her some advice.Brad Siberling builds the characters almost entirely through the exchanges between Freeman and Vega. The plot is merely a setup for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the film's 80 minute duration. Freeman has fun with his character as he appears an outsider in lower class world that Vega's character Scarlett inhabits. Vega in the meantime grows beyond the stubborn checkout clerk upset with her life's situation looking to move on.There a couple things that really stood out in this film. First of all Siberling has probably taken note from independent cinema to make sure the relationship is sincere and doesn't fall into any Hollywood pitfalls. It's a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film. It works even though the situation itself does seem a little inconceivable.I am also impressed with the performances. While Freeman's presence gives this film credibility from the getgo he shows a certain amount of charm and fun not usually seen from him. Paz Vega meanwhile is priming herself for a breakthrough in US film sometime in the future. I loved her in Spanglish and she's equally good here as the tough nononsense Scarlet. Towards the end of the film she successfully conveys the growth of her character. I'm looking forward to seeing her in more films.Overall 10 Items of Less functions best as a character piece well scripted and directed by Brad Siberling. He hasn't done much writing and his feature film work has consisted mostly of big Hollywood films. Yet there's certainly an artist at work here and am anxious to see if he'll take this road again.".

	schema:reviewBody "The director clearly couldn't make up his mind whether to please his coproducers and churn out a conventional madeforTV movie or whether to impress his film school buddies with a postmodern patchwork of plot lines and perspectives. To make things worse the script is based on a true story but it doesn't tell that story and even if you are a close follower of the air traffic control scene chances are you won't know what's going on. I'll give it 5 of 10 anyway on the grounds of a single memorable scene Marie Bumer's character Franziska has just lost her husband. She's on the phone with her secret longtime lover to arrange a consolatory rendezvous as her motherinlaw walks in. Time itself seems suspended for a split second. She could simply hang up and play the grieving widow. Or maybe not. Suffice it to say Franziska takes a dramatic decision that will define who she is once and for all. Judge for yourself but that scene made my day.".

To make things worse the script is based on a true story but it doesn't tell that story and even if you are a close follower of the air traffic control scene chances are you won't know what's going on.

If you are part of this target group I am telling you now that you will most certainly be disappointed. This film is a slowpaced methodical characterdriven piece about the conflict between faithbased ideologies. Don't be tricked into thinking that this is going to be some exciting or thrilling popcorn adventure in the same vein as some of the other high budget apocalyptic films out there. Director Darren Lynn Bousman has himself said that he wanted to explore his own spiritual beliefs and conceptions about existence through this film.We begin by following Joseph Crone Timothy Gibbs a popular novelist who is tormented by the death of his family through constant reoccurring nightmares and hallucinations. As seemingly random events begin to unfold in his life Joseph struggles to cling onto any real purpose of his continuing existence. As he rapidly descends into a state of selfseclusion he discovers a pattern in which all the events in his life are taking place. They appear to always happen at the set time of 1111 ampm. When his estranged pastor brother Samuel Michael Landes rings to tell him about his dying father Joseph immediately travels to Barcelona. Here is where the story will perhaps turn south for most people. We spend a good 40 minutes of the film trying to decipher strange supernatural clues as we are subjected to longwinded seemingly pointless dialogue scenes. For some this may be incredibly boring especially since the fact that apart from a few jumpscares and men in goblinesque costumes the film is basically devoid of any horror or suspense. As the day of 111111 approaches events get weirder and weirder until the finale where a huge revealing twist is attempted but comes off looking incredibly schlocky.Overall I'm pretty sure this film will flop badly. Due to its misleading nature I feel that many people are going to rightfully flame this film in general. In my opinion it would have served better as a psychological drama about the descent of a rational man into madness. The twist would have been Joseph's selfrealization that 111111 has no meaning and it is just another number. Unfortunately the film favors a more unrealistic and perplexing ending that wasn't needed. There are however some redeemable qualities to the film such as the philosophical themes surrounding religion vs. society and also the talent of Timothy Gibbs to carry the film until the end despite many major flaws. I recommend that you watch this when it comes out on DVD so you can make up your own mind but I suggest that you consider the limitations of the budget which couldn't have been more than 2 million.25".

The plot becomes tedious and bland fast holding this pace for the majority of the film. The scares consist of frightening faces appearing in the shadows or windows but they fail to show any snap or shock value becoming repetitive and tiresome early on. The special effects especially the costumes and make up feel amateurish and almost laughable a times.

For an hour the same things happen over and over again even going so far that 2 characters have the exact same conversation no less than 3 times. Acting is hammy at best especially from the lead actor who's filmnoir detective like voiceover nearly takes the film into the realm of parody. The music is constanty omnious even when nothing remotely creepy is happening. The finale is actually pretty OK and I actually liked the ending but the makers damn near give us the resolution of the movie in a powerpoint presentation with the director shouting See? See what we did there??? I actually had quite some fun watching this giggling at how bad this all was. And I admit I jumped a few times. Just make sure you don't go out of your way to see this. It is a deeply silly film.".

	schema:headline " It's All About the Date and Nothing Else";
	schema:reviewBody "111111 is a horror movie about a writer plagued by ominous visions supernatural encounters and repeated exposure to the number eleven. This would include the date the story leads up to and how fortuitous that the film was actually given a November 11 2011 release date. Remember the 2006 remake of The Omen and its June 6 release date which we all know was a marketing ploy to have the month date and year exactly match the demonic number 666? And then there was The Number 23 which opened to the public on February 23 2007  and incidentally I was twentythree years old at that time. At least they both had clever ad campaigns and in my opinion they were fairly decent films. The same cannot be said for 111111. To be perfectly honest all the elevens in the world would not have made this film work.The writer named Joseph Crone Timothy Gibbs is a skeptic who lost his faith after his wife and child tragically died in a house fire. It was started we eventually learn by a fanatic who was inspired by one of his books. As the film progresses his brushes with strange phenomena will naturally become more frequent more dangerous and more frightening. This would be fine except that he stubbornly remains a skeptic until the last possible moment which is odd because the circumstances make absolutely no sense. But I won't get into that just yet. Exactly how many runins with demons and double digits are necessary for you to finally consider the possibility that there truly is something bigger than yourself? At a certain point I wanted to crawl up into the screen smack this guy across the head and scream Believe already!The plot as it were involves Joseph travelling to Barcelona and reuniting with his estranged father Denis Rafter who's dying and his handicapped brother Samuel Michael Landes a minister for a dwindling congregation. As Joseph muddles his way through a series of strange events he begins to suspect that everything is somehow connected to the number eleven. He's repeatedly told that someone has to be saved and so he naturally deduces that his purpose in life is to protect his brother who may be a really special person. Warnings persist about ghostly beings caught in the purgatory between life and death that they seek a doorway into our world and that it will happen on November 11. At least I think that's what was going on. It seems that the more explaining this movie does the less sense it makes.Many horror movies have been made about the battle between faith and nonbelief but lack of originality is not what makes 111111 so unbearable. It's the way in which these opposites are explored. Just about every conversation between the brothers is constructed like a joke. Samuel pious and softspoken provides the setups. Joseph the angry atheist delivers the punch lines. Writerdirector Darren Lynn Bousman assembles passages of dialogue as if there's no such thing as middle ground he has two men shouting at the rain both sounding ridiculous. Listening to these men argue about God is a little like watching a political debate between candidates who have already lost the race. They continue to campaign even though voters have long since stopped caring about what they stand for or even who they are.The film also features a young woman named Sadie Wendy Glenn who met Joseph at a support group for people who have lost family members. Her appearance seems to have stemmed from the desire to have a female character present in a horror movie. This is strange because Bousman didn't have the decency to use her in typical ways such as having her get topless making her scream helplessly and ultimately having her die a horrible bloody death. I don't think I've seen another film this year in which a character so thoroughly lacked a purpose. She's completely useless. Even her encouraging words for Joseph have no effect mostly because we expected her to say them as early as her very first scene.All leads to a surprise ending except it isn't a surprise so much as it is a cheat. At that point I no longer had any idea what was going on. When I was finally hit with the plot twist I felt angry for its inclusion seemed intentionally designed to confuse me even further. Nothing that happens during the final ten minutes makes sense. Is Bousman trying to make a point about religion? If so what is it? The more I try and work through his logic the more I'm torn between hysterical laughter and blinding rage. It can't possibly be a good sign when the only thing a movie called 111111 has going for it is a series of numbers tied to a release date. They couldn't even get that right the film's limited release pretty much prevented the start of an immersive ad campaign. How many people actually know that this movie exists?

The story is very simple on the 111111 things will go wrong with the world the devil will unleash his demons on humanity.

It slowly reveals itself and some will see the end coming of this flick from miles away.

But it's just a horror who needs the scary parts and there aren't that many in 111111. The demons do appear on a regular base but nothing really happens until the end.

The movie starts off with the whole 111111 shebang and as soon as it's being explained somehow I started to roll my eyes. The movie was boring until the end and even in the magical 111111 mark it just stumbled horrifically. The main protagonist is just unlikeable as well as the rest of his family. And as soon as the other characters start popping up you pretty much guess their motives and reasons for being in the movie. The plot in itself is idiotic and just thrown in the wind. The plot mixes religion with premonitions and literal bible junk and just doesn't come together in any point to deliver any sort of ahhah feeling or a sense even wanting to know what the whole thing is about. All the spooky stuff happens in complete darkness so you see a glimmer of something shiny in the darkness but the music direction is a bit off so you'll hear the loud TADAA music before anything interesting happens. And sometimes it took the music ques to inform me that something was actually happening seeing that all you see in the night scenes is black. All and all I'd say that the movie had no redeeming qualities and just skated by on the entire numbers theme. Bad acting bad script bad direction and no suspense all together in one unhappy bundle. But seeing as I've seen worse I'll give a 3 for all of the 11's. Shame on you Bousman I really expected more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stest shown at the International Filmfestival Rotterdam as 'Something Like Happiness' is by no means a comedy  it's only classification should be 'drama' as that is what it is. And excellent drama at that.The story is simple in its outline Monika Dasha and Tonik are friends  or at least they all were at some point. At the movie's opening we learn that Monika's boyfriend left for the United States and will send for her as soon as he is settled though no concrete time frame has been talked about. While her mother is supportive her father apparently doesn't care much for the guy. He does however get along well with her longtime friend Tonik and the two enjoy the occasional bottle or two of spirits. Tonik lives with his aunt in a house next to the factory his dad works for. The house is falling apart but the aunt won't sell out to the factory and this has strained relations between father and aunt and thus father and son. Unfortunately Tonik doesn't have a penny to his name and they can barely afford electricity. Then there is Dasha the catalyst of the story. She has two children by a man who has long since left and is in love with a married man. Dasha is mentally unstable has been so for some time and doesn't know very well how to care of her two children. Tonik and Monika regularly help out and are like an aunt and uncle to the children but Dasha's mental problems make her scornful even hateful towards her friends. Then Dasha has a breakdown and both Monika and Tonik need to decide how to balance their own needs with those of Dasha and her children.I can't or rather won't tell you more about the story  I do not want to include spoilers. But while the story so far sounds grim and the surroundings look equally grim and grey with the smoking nuclear plant dominating the scenery there is levity and a surprising amount of warmth in this movie as the characters strive towards something like happiness.The acting is very natural it feels like Monika and Tonik play themselves rather than their roles and there is real chemistry between the two. The roles of the respective parents should not be overlooked either although I am sorry to say I don't have a list of the full cast to give them the credit they deserve.Most striking is the perseverance of these wonderful people considering the circumstances they live in and the blows life deals them. There is an admirable strength of character to Monika and Tonik and you can't help but feel for them and wish them well.The movie feels longer than it actually is. Not in that it gets boring on the contrary had it been an hour longer I would still have enjoyed watching it because the characters are so interesting. It feels long because of the range of events covered. By the end of the film you feel you've come to know the characters almost as friends. A part of me would like to contact the director and ask if they're alright. It's funny how real fiction can be.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are quite different opinions on Bohdan Slama a young Czech director. I give my own here. I believe him to be the greatest talent of the current Czech cinematography. He worked on his second movie Stesti really hard and for a long time which eventually led to a surprisingly good result and high expectations of his upcoming work. He is marvelous and precise! in directing the actors he gives them life and credibility. The movie is very dense and every moment is functional so it requires you to watch carefully! Most people say it is a sad or even a drastic movie and take the name Stesti rather as irony of the author. Stesti is ambiguous between happiness and luck. The German Glck is exactly the same. How silly that they try to find different names for it in English and German! Something like happiness is a REALLY bad translation. Seeing the movie only from its sad side is seeing the surface. Somewhere deeper in the minds of the two main characters  Tonik and Monika who eventually fall in love there is a real happiness one which most of us hasn't had the opportunity to experience. The happiness stems from the very fact that they live a life which is not simple but very meaningful. The sad and drastic background stands in direct contrast to the inner happiness of the characters. This is most apparent at the very end where Monika after leaving her boyfriend in the United States most obviously standing for empty meaningless material dreams not at all for a better life comes back to Tonik's house the symbol of all his humble material efforts but also and mainly his home which is under destruction. Monika leaves the place with a light smile how can people not see that! and goes looking for Tonik the source of her happiness the one who gives her life meaning no matter where he is whether he has a house or fixes broken windows with a piece of scotchtape. The message of the movie is totally universal and labeling it as a social drama stemming from the unsatisfactory situation of an industrial and poor region of the Czech Republic is a misinterpretation or at least a demotion.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's Christmas time in a Czech Republic apartment complex but not all of the residents feel like celebrating certainly not DasaAna Geislerova who is impervious to the yuletide spirit of a visiting neighbor. Spurned by her married lover Dasa shows MonikaTatiana Vilhelmova the door along with the romantically obsessed mistress' two bawling children and TonikPavel Liska Monika's childhood friend bearer of a secret flame for this claimed woman. With the unwanted gift still in Monika's possession the mirthless Santa Claus brigade rides the elevator in silence down like a descent into the devil's lair. Since Monika's lover is in America a juxtaposition is created by which two countries beget a hierarchy which corresponds with the two men prominent in the petite woman's life. When the mother learns that her daughter will be joining the Czech emigrate stateside she receives the news as if a plane ticket to America is like a passport into heaven.While SoucekBolek Polivka is abroad the people he left behind form a temporary family. To a passerby who might have happened to see Monika and Tonik confined to a rowboat or the platonic friends with Dasa's children huddled together in an amusement park bumper car they would presume the two arrangements of live bodies as being a happy couple and a loving family. For quite some time Tonik's life has been in a holding pattern but with Monika's departure looming over the horizon this quiet unassuming man tries to win her approval by renovating his junkyard dwelling he shares with a spinster aunt. So does the goat herder stand a fighting chance against the gogetter? Meanwhile Monika entertains second thoughts about meeting Soucek in the states much to her mother's considerable chagrin. When the gogetter returns for a quick visit Soucke's postcoital diatribe about the inelegance of Czech life generates disharmony in the reunion bed as Monika turns over on her side with a look of quiet anguish. In judging his birthplace so harshly he's judging her. Now that Soucek perceives himself as being something of a continental man he unknowingly pushes Monika closer to Tonik. Bereft of her boyfriend's experiences Monika feels like an unsophisticate and finds solace in the company of the uncomplicated Tonik a fellow provincial native like herself to help the torn woman regain her bearings. But it's up to Tonik to set the love of his life free whose official reason for staying in country is to look after the welfare of Dasa's children.Who knows for sure the secrets of a woman's heart secrets that Stesi wisely never reveals although the audience has their suspicions. Stesi is an objective film that suggests the probability for longterm contentment may very well lie in North America but it never consigns the economically depressed native country and the people who live there to hell. Contrary to what Soucek thinks living in the former Czechoslovakia is not the end of the world.Love resides there. It just might be the beginning.".

Spurned by her married lover Dasa shows MonikaTatiana Vilhelmova the door along with the romantically obsessed mistress' two bawling children and TonikPavel Liska Monika's childhood friend bearer of a secret flame for this claimed woman. With the unwanted gift still in Monika's possession the mirthless Santa Claus brigade rides the elevator in silence down like a descent into the devil's lair. Since Monika's lover is in America a juxtaposition is created by which two countries beget a hierarchy which corresponds with the two men prominent in the petite woman's life. When the mother learns that her daughter will be joining the Czech emigrate stateside she receives the news as if a plane ticket to America is like a passport into heaven.While SoucekBolek Polivka is abroad the people he left behind form a temporary family. To a passerby who might have happened to see Monika and Tonik confined to a rowboat or the platonic friends with Dasa's children huddled together in an amusement park bumper car they would presume the two arrangements of live bodies as being a happy couple and a loving family. For quite some time Tonik's life has been in a holding pattern but with Monika's departure looming over the horizon this quiet unassuming man tries to win her approval by renovating his junkyard dwelling he shares with a spinster aunt.

But it is a more disillusioned film also probably because it describes a country in the state of breakdown before reconstruction and it shows the people in the turmoil and torment of change. It is an unsophisticated film as films of the developing world often are but it is realistic and honest one as these films are sometimes. Of course Czechie is not a developing country but it seems that the sophistication and glamor of Western cinema is not so easy to attain even for a director of talent.

Check out Denzel Washington directing a child in his film Antwone Fisher. He cut away whenever there were times the child was part of a sad violent or frightening scene. No artistic integrity was sacrificed by doing this. In Something Like Happiness the toddler children are obviously hearing everything the actors are saying and reacting to them with obvious fear. It is despicable and thank goodness in the USA mostly this is changing. I had to skip much of Something Like Happiness due to boredom also. Yes the actors were very good but yes I could not tell the difference between the young women and who was who...Oh yeah and why do men think that women should be portrayed as enjoying being fked against a wall...well of course cuz men like doing it! I got it at the library so did not pay for it or I would have asked for my money back. I actually decided not to see any film in which women or children actors or characters are exploited obviously this film was a mistake. I can't see Wonder Woman endlessly but let's hope that director keeps making her films with strong women in them and no exploitation of children.".

	schema:reviewBody "The reviews here are mostly from Czechs or Americans. My perspective is somewhat different  I was born and raised in Czechoslovakia but have lived most of my life in the U.S. Therefore I see the movie more through the eyes of an American yet understand the language and the circumstances the movie portrays more intimately than an American ordinarily would. Overall I found the movie confusing and depressing. Confusing in that it's difficult to follow the plot particularly the relationships between the various characters portrayed. I had a hard time keeping track of who's who who lives where who's whose father or mother girlfriend romantic boyfriend platonic boyfriend just in general I found it difficult to sort these things out. I also agree with another reviewer here that Czech cinema is going through a dark phase. It seems like so many of the movies coming out of the postcommunist era are so similar. I would call them black comedies. Other movies with generally the same overall essence as this movie are Horem Padem Up and Down Kraska v nesnazich Beauty in Trouble and Zeny v pokuseni Women in temptation. They all portray contemporary Czech society in a very depressing way choosing dark and depressing images whenever possible. Naturally attractive women are poorly groomed and unattractively dressed only ugly countryside is shown ugly living conditions etc. While there is no doubt that there are Czechs who are unmotivated careless about their appearance and who live in poor conditions such as portrayed in this movie there are also those who are determined to succeed take care of their appearance raise happy families and live very well but they are apparently completely ignored by today's film makers. Somehow only the dark aspects of life are considered art by the contemporary Czech film makers. They seem drawn to this type of realism as if intrigued by that which is ugly depressing twisted in some way. From the perspective of an American we go to movies to be entertained not to engage in philosophical discussions about the meaning of life or happiness. This is more the domain of European film making. Fellini's La Strada and other such movies were the pioneers of this new Czech genre focusing solely on the harsh and dark realities of life and none of its beauty or joy. This Czech realism is different from what Americans are used to. I imagine most US audiences would not find this movie appealing or entertaining. But the small group with eclectic taste that seeks to view the dark side of life and to be challenged by movies into engaging in philosophical contemplations this movie delivers big time.".

At the Swedes and their Ikeatype market research at the Norwegians and their laconic ways and at the strange ways of humans altogether. This movie manages to be moving without being sentimental or manipulative. What I mean here is that the element of manipulation that is quite obvious in many of the more sophisticated recent feel good movies I generally enjoy you know the ones I mean  Cinema Paradiso Billy Elliot etc. is not in evidence here. We are getting at something pretty basic and human with Kitchen Stories. The movie tracks the unlikely relationship that develops between the Swedish market researcher sent to observe and strictly forbidden to interact with the subject of his study the kitchen ways of his crusty Norwegian bachelor host. Sounds rather minimal but this is a movie that is as good as a movie can get. Perfect pacing perfect acting perfect camera work perfect story. While the movie can be enjoyed on the tv as video I think that it is best seen on a larger screen in a movie theater because the visual impact is strong. You come out of this movie a happier person than went in and that is worth something these days !".

	schema:reviewBody "How do you make a film no SELL the idea of a film whose premise is the following?  Take 1950 era Swedish scientists whose goal is to find men who live alone in the wilderness and study their kitchen habits' at home for the purpose of building a more efficient living space for people.  I am sure if any writer walking into Hollywood with that script would be instantly flogged before he even set foot in a studio executive boardroom. A story like this obviously seems to set itself up as a comedy since the story is so obviously absurd but what viewers come out with after witnessing this film is the great appreciation and the bonds the characters create.  This is a truly touching masterful picture from a premise that has the most bizarre source that I don't know how anyone could have even come up with. That premise is quite something since it seems that the idea of studying male behavior in a kitchen in the backwoods of Norway is either going to be a complete disaster or something extremely memorable.  Luckily it is the latter of the two. Isak Bjornsson is a scientist out to study a subject' named Folke who lives by himself and has literally no friends.  Folke unwittingly is part of this experiment which involves Isak sitting in a giant chair overlooking his living space as if he was the judge in a tennis match.  Also Isak is supposed to follow certain rules set out by his employer.  He is not to disturb Folke's living space nor talk to him.  If this isn't a unique bit of Scandinavian humor I don't know what is. If this film were to fall flat or even be just a short funny comedy it would only fixate on the stupidity of this premise.  Somehow a guy who sits in a log cabin miles away from civilization who can put up with a stuffy repressed scientist whose main purpose is to write excruciating details of a man who literally spends his day doing nothing is actually quite a funny situation for comedy.  Kitchen Stories does not fail in that sense but the ingeniousness is that Kitchen Stories is smarter than that.The film suddenly takes the viewer to ask what the real purpose of these 2 men in the movie are and the focus provides and glaring and obvious point. They are essentially both alone in their lives for different reasons and they in a way need each other.  But not of course in the sense of a dying love but in a great sense of male camaraderie and caring that is essential to the idea of a great friendshipGradually the bond between scientist and subject breaks down and both men start evolving a strange set of rules and create a friendship that comes off as the most genuine and heartwarming I've seen on screen since this year started.As this relationship and some good subplots develop the comedy takes another turn as Isak tries to hide from his boss  a man who only dreams' of what the future possibilities of kitchens may look like that he has engaged his subject in what is obviously caring' humanity.   The nerve!I loved this film from the moment it started till its tender conclusion.  It had only a short run in my area and even after what must have been several months since I've seen it I still think about it and a giant smile comes across my face.It is touching heartwarming very funny and just flat out great.  It is the best film I have seen so far this year.  If you ever get a chance to see it go immediately.  It shows the perfect beauty of the bond between us all as people in the most kooky unique bizarre way.  And that in itself is pure geniusRating 10 out of 10".

The NorseSwedish coproduction depicts 1950's Swedes studying bachelors in their kitchens to improve their lives.  Swedish scientist Folke in a high chair like some infantile god observes Norwegian Isak under the restriction that he must not interact with Isak.The humor comes from the stereotypical Swede as uptight and organized and the Norwegian as slow but solid.  The silliness of the experiment itself is obvious and the restriction ludicrous because of course they will interact in fact bond given the loneliness of Norway's winter and the need for humans to be sociable. That the story turns on male bonding is a bonus especially because neither country is considered a bastion of sociability. When Isak lets Folke listen to the radio on his teeth fillings I figure the guys are in for some warm nights.In another way this film could be as good as it gets for analyzing the effect observers have on their subjects be it laboratory or media.  A question probably unanswerable even today is how much anyone changes under observation.  In the case of the central characters in Kitchen Stories' the change is considerable but more so just because of another human being's presence in an otherwise lonely world. The credibility of documentaries and scientists is on the table here.The minimal dialogue and occasional joke spiced with subtle racial stereotyping makes me think of not only Kaurismaki but also Beckett whose waiting characters sometime talk nonsense but most of the time profundity under the guise of simplicity.  Kitchen' is a slow but rewarding film that strips life of its pretensions to study more closely the tissue that binds humanity with communication.Diplomat Dag Hammarskjold in his Markings caught the minimalism of this film Friendship needs no wordsit is solitude delivered from the anguish of loneliness.'".

The film is similar in its deadpan humor and offbeat characters to the work of Aki Kaurismki but without the Finnish director's overbearing selfconsciousness.

Some however are not willing subjects. One of the scientists Folke a Swede Tomas Norstrm draws Isak Joachim Calmeyer an antisocial Norwegian farmer used to living in solitude. Isak at first refuses to let Folke into his house resentful that the horse he was promised in return for his participation turned out to be a figurine. Folke however eventually gains access to the kitchen and sits every day perched in his high observation chair recording Isak's every movement like the Lord High Executioner until Isak decides to take his hot plate up to his bedroom to frustrate his unwelcome guest.The sly Isak drills a hole through the upstairs bedroom floor and now secretly watches Folke in the kitchen. When they start conversing each man insists on speaking his own language not shown by the subtitles as if to doggedly maintain their separate identities. Gradually they become friends breaking through the barriers in their life that have imposed a limiting solitude. They begin first by drinking coffee in the morning sharing a bit of their background and then celebrating Isak's birthday with cake and bourbon whiskey. Their interaction of course is against the rules of the study and there are consequences for Folke. His life however acquires new meaning the more willing he is to take risks and share himself openly. Kitchen Stories is a small film but one that is warmhearted and thoroughly enjoyable a work that celebrates the small pleasures in just being alive without trying to be profound or seduce us with blatant emotional appeals.".

The snappy music sets me quite at ease in spite of anticipating reading subtitles  the melodic and light drum beats chorus behind main vocal saxtrumpettrombone sounds  it's easy swinging tunes indeed.

It's about a meticulously organized scientific research in the '50's on studying the kitchen behavior of single Norwegian men by assigned researchers from Sweden in the name of advancement of course  to improve kitchen activity efficiency. Sounds awfully dry? How can watching two men watching each other be interesting? Ah to the genius of director Bent Hamer who cowrote and coproduced with Jrgen Bergmark the film is simple enjoyment and relaxing fun. It's the discerning humor of observing human behavior of all parties involved neighbor and neighborhood doctor researcher and target subject boss man and his boss  it's a film to relish and bemused upon.Having had graphic arts any pattern catches my eye. The opening scene  the caravan of the nine trailers each with an interesting form seen at the top of the trailer presented quite an engaging sight.

And in the name of science we are given insights to the 'body electric' static radio tuning.what am I talking about? Ha that's another smilingly amusing reason to enjoy Kitchen Stories. Thanks to the subtitles by Nick Norris we get steady doses of chuckle and bemusing smiles throughout the film. The two main leads Joachim Calmeyer as Isak and Tomas Norstrm as Folke are fantastically 'wry' in their own selfbemused way complementing each other's performance.Not everything's indoors per se there are impressive snowy landscapes light of dawn and dead of night scenes by cinematographer Philip gaard. There's also a touching side story revolves around a faithful companion of a horse and an anticipated red horse. It's full of little sprinkles of surprises and details down to the specific food that Folke likes. Do enjoy this film. Bemused is the word repeatedly reinforced.".

As the plot develops around the friendship between the subject and the object we are drawn into a conflict which is essentially outside the boundaries of nations how can you understand someone without verbal communication for the sake of scientific research?  You can't. Bureaucratic strictures can lead to disobedience however much the personal cost of that kind of action might be.  Folke and Isak forge a friendship in a relatively short time which might take others years of nurturing.  We applaud the rebellious scientist when he dumps his snailshell caravan to return to Isak's uncomplicated rural dwelling. The most moving closing scene suddenly makes you realise that what seemed to be a static film was in fact full of heroic action.

The scientific study of single male's kitchen activities is carried out in high chairs strategically placed in the corner of the kitchen.

There is a small twist at the end but when you think about it with all of the very small funny moments leading up to it getting radio stations through a gold tooth Isak eating dinner in his room instead of his kitchen you realize at the end that everything is the way it should be. This movie is a small masterpiece slow and dry yet hilarious and perfect. This is a movie with no villains and no heroes just regular people eating in their kitchen. At the end even though you may have looked at your watch a few times you leave satisfied and with a silly little grin on your face.My grade 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "We humans are by nature a thoroughly inquisitive lot. We can't help but want to know what it is that makes everything  including the people around us  tick. But can that curiosity which has done so much to enlighten and advance us as a species also wind up draining all the spontaneity and fun out of life? If everything is catalogued and labeled and put into little boxes what happens to that sense of mystery that makes life worth living? The Swedish film Kitchen Stories is an ingenious little satire about mankind's insatiable propensity to study and analyze every damn thing in life and to subject even our most mundane daily activities to the rigors of scientific enquiry.It's the 1950's and a group of Swedish researchers have descended on Norway to study the kitchen habits of the single male a truly pressing concern if ever there was one. The project involves setting up an observer in a volunteer's kitchen in order to watch and record the subject's every move leading hopefully to kitchen designs that will prove more fruitful and productive for the average citizen. The proviso is that there is to be no fraternizing whatsoever between the two parties otherwise the objective nature of the experiment will be ruined. This is truly life as lived under a microscope and the question early on becomes who will be the first to crack under the pressure of this totally unnatural state of affairs the observer or the observed. And just how meaningful and reliable could information gleaned from such a contrived unnatural setup be anyway? Given the complexity of human nature how much can such a study truly tell us about ourselves and what we're really like? The film focuses on two men who are caught up in the study Isak the relatively reluctant subject and Nilsson the analyst who takes up residence in Isak's kitchen perched high above him on a five foot tall chair made especially for the occasion. At first the air is tense between the two men for Isak is not shy about showing his obvious resentment of this nonstop intrusion and prying into his daily life. But after a few days the mood thaws out and the two men become fast friends drawn to each other by their common humanity and need for companionship. Soon they are breaking all the rules of the study sharing food beverages and conversation with untoward abandon.Some people may see this film as an allegory of life under a totalitarian regime with the individual's every move being observed recorded and monitored by an authoritarian power. I see it more as a simple study in human nature as two men triumph over a dehumanized institution. Either way the film does an interesting job showing just how easily the observer can become the observed if he lets his guard down. The film boasts excellent performances from Joachim Calmeyer as Isak Tomas Norstrom as Nilsson Bjorn Floberg as Isak's jealous friend Grant and Reine Brynolfsson as Nilsson's serious Nervous Nelly boss who like Grant can't abide the intimacy he sees developing between evaluator and subject albeit for totally different reasons.Kitchen Stories is a quiet almost muted film in which the characters rarely speak above a whisper reflecting the somber mood of both the clinical experiment and the stark winter background against which the story takes place. Yet there is warmth and humor in the relationship between Isak and Nilsson and a great deal of quirky humor in both the premise and director Bent Hamer's sly execution of it. This is a film for those in search of the unique and the offbeat.".

	onyx:emotionText "We humans are by nature a thoroughly inquisitive lot. We can't help but want to know what it is that makes everything  including the people around us  tick. But can that curiosity which has done so much to enlighten and advance us as a species also wind up draining all the spontaneity and fun out of life? If everything is catalogued and labeled and put into little boxes what happens to that sense of mystery that makes life worth living? The Swedish film Kitchen Stories is an ingenious little satire about mankind's insatiable propensity to study and analyze every damn thing in life and to subject even our most mundane daily activities to the rigors of scientific enquiry.It's the 1950's and a group of Swedish researchers have descended on Norway to study the kitchen habits of the single male a truly pressing concern if ever there was one. The project involves setting up an observer in a volunteer's kitchen in order to watch and record the subject's every move leading hopefully to kitchen designs that will prove more fruitful and productive for the average citizen. The proviso is that there is to be no fraternizing whatsoever between the two parties otherwise the objective nature of the experiment will be ruined. This is truly life as lived under a microscope and the question early on becomes who will be the first to crack under the pressure of this totally unnatural state of affairs the observer or the observed. And just how meaningful and reliable could information gleaned from such a contrived unnatural setup be anyway? Given the complexity of human nature how much can such a study truly tell us about ourselves and what we're really like? The film focuses on two men who are caught up in the study Isak the relatively reluctant subject and Nilsson the analyst who takes up residence in Isak's kitchen perched high above him on a five foot tall chair made especially for the occasion. At first the air is tense between the two men for Isak is not shy about showing his obvious resentment of this nonstop intrusion and prying into his daily life. But after a few days the mood thaws out and the two men become fast friends drawn to each other by their common humanity and need for companionship.

It calls into question a lot of the assumptions made in science about the way observed people change and also shows great insight into the human condition particularly the conditions that develop in isolation. An excellent movie and even though the pace is slow to speed it upwould have destroyed the film since friendships are slow in developing and the fast pace of modern films always falls flat because they assume that relationships do not need time to develop. This film not only demonstrates this but it relies on the slow growth of friendship. A masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the major issues in the history of anthropology is the question of whether or not an outside observer can objectively report on the culture and values of a society in which she is not a member.    On a certain level Bent Hamer's Kitchen Tales is a fable or parable about the difficulties faced by anthropologists sociologists and other social scientists as they go about their work.    On another level the film works as a wry commentary on the history of NorwegianSwedish relations.    On yet another level Hamer investigates the pride and modesty which keeps people apart from one another.   There is a fair amount of absurdist comedy in the script but also mixed in is a blend of emotion and sentiment.    Perhaps if David Lynch collaborated with Garrison Keillor to produce a story about NorwegianAmerican bachelor farmers they might come up with something like this.    The film starts slowly  the first reel drags a bit so to speak. But the acting particularly in the last twenty minutes is very compelling. This modest lowbudget and somewhat sparse film presents a true slice of Norwegian tradition nonetheless it resonates far beyond its Scandinavian setting.".

	schema:headline " The Jeff  Geena Trilogy";
	schema:reviewBody "Former real life Hollywood couple Jeff Goldblum  Geena Davis made 3 films together two of them comedies one of them serious. The first film also the film where they met was the horror movie spoof Transylvania 65000 which I keep looking for but can't seem to find in which Jeff played a reporter sent to Transylvania to follow a story with partner Ed Begley Jr. and Geena played a sex starved nymph who was convinced she was a vampire. The 2nd one they did and also the only serious one was the 1986 remake of The Fly in which Jeff played a good natured but lonely mad scientist who turned into a giant fly monster that looked nothing like a fly and something more like a killer praying mantis and Geena played his journalist lover. Then after boldly going where no Hollywood couple had ever gone before in said remake of The Fly they returned to light hearted comedy with our film here Earth Girls Are Easy.I've often theorized that the reason celebrity couples do films together is because it gives them a chance to spend time together and work together seeing as how the hectic Hollywood schedule tends to keep people apart for long periods of time and because studios can cash in on the respective fan bases of both stars. Well for what it's worth this is a hell of a lot more fun to watch than most celebrity couple films.Anyway in this their third and final film together Geena plays a beautiful but romantically unhappy manicurist Valley Girl who's doctor boyfriend Ted is cheating on her and Jeff plays the blue furred ringleader of three furry aliens the other two being yellow furred Damon Wayans and premovie stardom red furred Jim Carrey with his hair dyed blond!. Furry aliens Jeff Jim and Damon crash land in Geena's pool the day after Geena discovers how unfaithful Ted's been and the sight of them understandably throws her for a loop. With their ship down for repairs the boys will have to stay with Geena and doing her part for interplanetary relations takes them to her ditzy manicurist cohort Candy Julie Brown who also helped write the film to give the guys make overs so they can pass for Earthlings. Guess what? Geena eventually falls in love with Captain Jeff.In an unrelated subplot that never quite went anywhere Julie Brown's character fell for Jim Carrey's alien. Watching this back when it was made who would have guessed that Jim Carrey would eventually go on to become one of Hollywood's biggest comedic stars and possess a career that would overshadow stars Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis?May not be brilliant comedy but like so many other comedies of the 80s this is still a reasonably funny good natured romp with the cast making the most of it. Geena's easy to like and Jeff's a good straight man to the wild antics of Jim and Damon who both appear to be having a good time as the nuttier aliens. I don't know why people keep saying bad things about Jeff's performance here as his quirky style makes him an ideal alien stranger in a strange land and manages some of the film's best bits like when he uses his love touch to get two cops stuck on each other. There's also a funny scene where Jeff offers to make love to Geena to make her feel better about herself and get her mind off her cheating boyfriend and she tries to explain that them making love might not work on account of the fact that he's not of the Earth so not everything may work the same way and the whole time he's undressing off camera and then she gets a look at him and his equipment and just sort of trails off. Of course she has to make sure he doesn't get the impression that Earth Girls Are Easy.Bit of a shame that Jeff  Geena's marriage didn't work out.There are also some funny musical bits.Mac is Mr. Right?  Jeff Goldblum as Mac".

	schema:reviewBody "'Earth Girls are Easy' is a B52's kind of style musical. Well it's sort of a musical. It's sporadic musical numbers and dance acts that have to keep this movie plugging along. If you know the Julie Brown song Earth Girls are Easy then you know the story. Clueless Valerie Geena Davis of the Valley discovers that her idiot fiancee Ted Charles Rocket is cheating on her about the same time that some aliens crash land in her swimming pool. With Ted gone she doesn't mind entertaining a few aliens Jim Carey Damon Wayans and Jeff Godlbum for a while. Actually the results are pretty funny since basically she tries to get them to assimilate to 80 Californian culture as she knows it. She first does by shaving off their hairy exterior so that they look like humans of course. It sure doesn't occur to their blonde braindead Valley Girl friends that there is something wrong Wiploc Zeebo and Mac especially considering that they repeat everything people tell them and don't say much else so long as theyre good dancers party animals and good in bed of course. In the course of everything including her creepy fiancee trying to weasel his way back Valerie falls in love with Mac played by her thenhusband Jeff Goldbum. It is an amusing little romantic comedy that seems to have taken some cues from Susan Sneideman's 'Making Mr. Right' which you might also enjoy if you like this movie although that is not quite as funky in the B52s sense of the word. Not that the B52s had anything to do with this movie either but I think they are most closely associated with the style of comedy and atmosphere I'm referring to.This is not a movie for everyone obviously. Earth Girls are Easy is a funky 80s bcomedy recommended for real 80s fans though it'll probably appeal more to us female audiences. Just waste your brain wax your board and pray for waves!".

Great for watching on a plane or for whiling away a couple of hours if you want a laugh with a few friends. It's worth it for the blue furry Goldblum alone! 6 points.";

No there's nothing plausible about 90 of the plot but nor is there any pretense of such so it's not something worth angsting over. Three fuzzy colorful aliens crash their little yellow ship into the pool of a young somewhat vapid Geena Davis who has recently discovered that her MD. fiance is cheating on her. A quick shave and styling at her friend's beauty parlor transforms the three into less hirsute versions of Goldblum Carrey and Wayans. Having assimilated at least the appearance of human beings the aliens enter the world of 80s California and wackiness along with the necessary romance ensues.As 80s flicks go this is better than say Weird Science or Back to School though not up to par with things like Caddyshack or A Fish Called Wanda. Nothing essential to go out of your way to see but certainly worth catching sometime".

It seemed to have gone nowhere when it could have been the great kitsch summer film that year. It had the stars Jeff Goldblum a young Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans and the super hot Geena Davis!!! Geena could have been a HUGE star but she seemed to have disappeared during the 90's. She was beautiful and cute at the same time and funny with a tall hot body. Why did she just sort of vanish????When I resaw this film I could see why it wasn't a hit. It's a bit too loose and wacky. The direction by Julian Temple is too slack many of the jokes just misfire and go past unnoticed because the staging is bad. He seemed to have taken just one take of each shot. The musical parts are badly put together and the music which I still love pretty weak. The best thing in this film is Julie Brown with her too few scenes and songs!".

You really need to see it twenty or thirty times to catch all the brilliant jokes and oneliners as they fly so thick and fast. Who was crazier Julie Brown the writer or Julien Temple the director? Probably both. This is the most wacko comedy you can imagine probably the most anarchic thing since 'A Night at the Opera'. The reason the film works so perfectly is because Geena Davis was the only actress who was absolutely made for the part. She slipped into it like 'something a little more comfortable'. When Geena Davis was born they wrote in invisible ink on her forehead 'This is the one for the aliens.' She didn't even have to be abducted they came to her. There they are sitting around her house and her pool in L.A. talking backwards and eating the fish out of her fish tank. Geena plays Valerie who is really bright 'I know Finland. It's the capital of Norway.' This film is so over the top it's from outer space. Well what did you expect? Julie Brown is staggering in this film. She is so funny you need life insurance to watch her. Her songs are stellar but then so are the aliens not to mention their starship. 'Cause I'm a Blond' is a classic song. I'd really like to read the lyrics over carefully as it's one of the funniest songs ever written performed with enough gusto to bust the lens. The humour of this film is so broad it slides off the sides of the screen. Hilarity Incorporated that's what it is. They had to be crazy to make this we know we're crazy to love it. Let's hope that when the aliens finally do come I mean the other ones who aren't here yet they watch this movie to learn how to act towards us. They could do worse than go to Geena's house for some sushi. After all her main concern is that the aliens won't 'think Earth girls are easy'. No problem. You should see the girls on Venus.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three furry multicolored aliens Jeff Goldblum Jim Carrey Damon Wayans land their spaceship in Geena Davis' pool. Wackiness follows. This is a fun little musical comedy with a great cast that's having a blast and it shows. Goldblum Carrey and Wayans are all good but it's the girls who really make this one work. Geena Davis is funny as well as being smoking hot in this. Julie Brown owns every scene she's in. She's a riot and her songs are great. Music video director Julien Temple maintains a brisk pace throughout. This is a colorful bubbly comedy that I think will appeal to a variety of viewers. It's got '80s stamped all over it so if you enjoy movies from that decade and you should you'll enjoy this one.".

	schema:headline " Bad Title  VERY Funny If Somewhat Dated Film";
	schema:reviewBody "The production quality of this film is somewhat lacking and I think the title is awful but the rest of this film is comic genius!!! You'll be cheating yourself if you don't see it. I never get tired of seeing it once every year or so. And it's one of those films I've felt the need to show to all my friends because it's too funny!!!To those who might be deterred by the bad reviews on this site I think the bad title is probably what led many to avoid the film years ago and what has led many on IMDb to give it bad reviews I suspect these were kneejerk feminists who reacted to the title and not the film itself which was written by a woman and is womansympathetic. The bad reviews are terribly unfair and not in line with the cutting edge comic tour de force here  lampooning not easy women about which it really has nothing to do with but the shallow California scene of its time.And for the feminists who missed the point the FEMALE wins here!!! Get it???It's the male lead who's the bad guy. That's for starters. And any woman who dated a jerk is going to LOVE this movie  because the jerk gets his I don't think I'm giving anything away here because the movie is about much more than this. Yet men like myself won't be offended by this fact there are of course jerks of both sexes and they DESERVE to get theirs!I have to wonder whether those who gave this movie anything less than a very good review actually saw the film or just hated the title. There are some very very funny scenes here  including Julie Brown's Cause I'm a Blonde song vignette which is hilarious and memorable and a song you won't ever forget!!!. A very young Jim Carrey is off the charts here too yet he's just one of a supertalented cast of heavyweights who score big in this film his talents as an impressionist especially shine here for example. You absolutely have to see Michael McKean in his role as the dumb California pool guy and Damon Wayans as Zeebo!!! These are comic performances that are among the very best on film and there are a wealth of vignettes you'll be referring to in conversations for years to come  so many I couldn't list them all here the doughnut scene for instance  the mention of which won't give anything away for those who haven't seen this  and the disco scene which lampoons discos more than any other movie scene ever.Plus this is heavyweight actor Geena Davis' best comic performance ever  and she's so endearing in this role. I don't think this fine actress has ever been filmed as lovingly or beautifully. Jeff Goldblum then still her husband too puts in a solid job as a romantic lead and even gives realism to an outof thisworld character and the love and chemistry between him and Geena is palpable. The only bad thing about this film is the title. And it has NOTHING to do with the film! Yet I think it scared a lot of people away from seeing it. What a shame!!! This is a great comedy  superinventive and funny and you absolutely have to tune out the bad reviews and see it!".

The songs are well written and genuinely funny the comic pacing is nicely zippy and the situation could hardly have more camp appeal combining space aliens makeovers and Valley culture into a goofy fun mix. The look of the picture is a major plus with everything having a sparkly quality to it and the slightly goofy 50s appearance of the spaceship is a definite plus. Geena and Jeff are an attractive easy to like couple and carry off the fairly absurd premise a whirlwind interspecies romance disarmingly. One major weakness with the picture is an inability to find screen business for Jim Carrey who has a few fine moments but his unique gifts for mimicry and physical comedy are largely wasted.".

It's always popular with customers who enjoy watching it as they browse comment on how young Jim Carrey looks and ask What on earth is this? as they get to the checkout counter. That's because its such a great looking film. The vibrant color palette with its bright primaries and 80s rehash of 1950s aesthetics is inspired production design. The film really has aged incredibly well and looks better today than when it was first released. Were it released today it could easily take its place beside any of the recent musical comedies that have come out in the last ten years.".

This is your typical Valley Girl movie with all the usual characters and bells and whistles one would expect from nothing but fluff. But sometimes we need just plain fluff.

His wife is having an affair his daughter is a slut no wonder she's cute as hell and his son is bullied at the school where he teaches. Even the other students think he is a geek. Shinichi spends all of his free time fantasizing about a show he watched as a kid called Zebraman that was cancelled after only a few episodes due to low ratings. He even goes as far as to make his own Zebraman costume and that's when the fun truly begins.As the Earth is invaded by aliens what did you expect Shinichi is called into action as Zebraman and he transforms from mild mannered teacher to Earth's last hope. Think PowerRangers but with odd and hilarious dialogue Don't stand ... behind me.. But first he spends some much needed time in front of a mirror practicing his shouts Black and White Ecstacy! costume spliting poses and signature attacks like the Zebra Double Back Kick. I admit I was sold as soon as he beat the crap out of a guy wearing a giant crab mask on his head. I laughed the hardest at the introduction of ZebraNurse though.This is a different kind of film than what you'd expect from Miike. The characters are warm and lovable and no one gets injured with the exception of an easily regrown arm Thanks ... ZebraNurse!. Which shows the kind of range this cult director has. My only regret was that Takashi Miike wasn't present to witness a world class response to this outrageously funny film. 910".

He makes up for it by dressing up as a cosplay geek reliving his childhood by taking on the role of his idol of manly virtue Zebraman. His costume is crude and fragile his martial arts pantomime only causes personal injury...When suddenly we learn that the school where he teaches has become an alien epicenter for green jellybeans hellbent on corrupting the youth of today into untameable savages.

There's a secret gay agent unrequited love subplot that doesn't pan out and a chaste love story involving our protagonist and a single mom who provide the family oriented support Zebraman needs to attain his destined power.I felt sympathetic for our clutzy protagonist all the way through i laughed at his foolish behavior and empathized with his despair. The destroy alien invaders genreplot did not get in the way of the characters expressing themselves and gave structure and conflicts where needed. Even so the human condition shone through as a worthless feeling man redeems him self in the eyes of everyone he cares about claim his right to basic human happiness.Actually the whole cosplay transition to costumed hero thing gets more believable er suspension of disbelief that is as the story progresses. The action is excellent and over the top as usual but still family oriented you could say ichi the killer was NOT a good first date movie. I could accept that Zebraman got his powers from pretty much out of the blue and because it was fated to him the same way I can except Godzilla without knowing where he came from other than the sea of Japan Die Green Jellies!

	schema:reviewBody "Zebraman is at its best when Takashi Miike kicks back and lets his mania go at its most fun. This isn't your typical ultraviolent or taboo smashing fare from the director if anything it's Miike at his most playful if you can call a man in a zebra costume fighting little green men from outer space in Power Rangers style as playful and actually hearkens to his mode of nostalgia that happens in his work that the characters have for past events that have shaped them or let them slip by. Sho Aikawa in his funniest performance in a Miike movie plays a man who is hapless schoolteacher by day and Zebraman by night. He's inspired by a TV show from when he was a kid which in turn was inspired by real programs like these in the 70s and to see flashbacks to this show with Zebraman fighting a crab man and other nefarious figures is unequivocally hilarious and exciting in the same way that Power Rangers could be in the cheesiest ways possible as a kid. There's also government agents tracking down alien presences of which there are many a secretive principle at the school and most importantly the teacher's good friend a 3rd grade student bound to a wheelchair who is also a huge zebraman fan and who's interest is heightened when seeing his hero out and about in the city streets at night.The first half of Zebraman needless to say is vintage Miike and save for the one government agent who has his own crab problem and not from a man in a costume which is hysterical in its own right and a couple of curse words could be appealing to some youth round the world.

	onyx:emotionText "Zebraman is at its best when Takashi Miike kicks back and lets his mania go at its most fun. This isn't your typical ultraviolent or taboo smashing fare from the director if anything it's Miike at his most playful if you can call a man in a zebra costume fighting little green men from outer space in Power Rangers style as playful and actually hearkens to his mode of nostalgia that happens in his work that the characters have for past events that have shaped them or let them slip by. Sho Aikawa in his funniest performance in a Miike movie plays a man who is hapless schoolteacher by day and Zebraman by night. He's inspired by a TV show from when he was a kid which in turn was inspired by real programs like these in the 70s and to see flashbacks to this show with Zebraman fighting a crab man and other nefarious figures is unequivocally hilarious and exciting in the same way that Power Rangers could be in the cheesiest ways possible as a kid. There's also government agents tracking down alien presences of which there are many a secretive principle at the school and most importantly the teacher's good friend a 3rd grade student bound to a wheelchair who is also a huge zebraman fan and who's interest is heightened when seeing his hero out and about in the city streets at night.The first half of Zebraman needless to say is vintage Miike and save for the one government agent who has his own crab problem and not from a man in a costume which is hysterical in its own right and a couple of curse words could be appealing to some youth round the world. What Miike has in mind as a kid's movie however is also greatly accessible to adults and to see both the scenes of the 'presentday' err 2010 Zebraman fighting against his opponents saying his moves before doing them as well as the usual lot of scenes where Miike just lets the camera stay still on the characters in an interesting position as some development goes on is to see a filmmaker at the peak of his own powers.

But escaping into his fantasy world in a selfmade zebrasuit is the only thing keeping him going.

Where the film's spirit hits the nail on the head is in its blurring of zeal and absurdity.

	schema:headline " Nostalgia kitsch and video game pleasure for everyone";
	schema:reviewBody "A man dresses as his favorite childhood superhero Zebraman from a television show that was canceled after only a few episodes. His love of Zebraman is shared by a thirdgrade student in his class of which he is an unsuccessful teacher and that student turns out to have the admiration and warmth the man can't get from his family. As he runs around the night in his suit trying to remain harmlessly escapist and yet still romantically fantasized he starts running into the enemies from the television show. Seems the 30 year old defunct television show was actually a prophecy and since it was canceled Zebraman himself doesn't know how it will end. Now if only he could figure out how to fly...This warm and nostalgialaced movie by Takashi Miike is one of his later features and Miike has sort of slowed down a bit. He no longer cuts corners like he used to and in this case he doesn't feel the need nor is there to throw anything truly disturbing in there. Still I've heard some people call this movie a children's show and of course there's some very adult themes speckled throughout. However once again Miike surprises by playing with audience expectations.Zebraman is a superhero movie but the moments of action and frenetic stylizations are actually quite rare and reserved. The bigger bulk of Zebraman is actually a focus on the characters especially Zebraman and his tenyearold sidekick as they figure out just what a superhero is supposed to do after he dons the outfit. And what an outfit! Sure to be a new staple Halloween costume for film geeks for years to come Zebraman's costume is its own character first because of its hilariously ironic blackandwhite style and also in the way it slowly falls apart throughout the film.Miike is also not strictly a filmmaker in that he throws any visual media into his stories as he desires.

	onyx:emotionText "A man dresses as his favorite childhood superhero Zebraman from a television show that was canceled after only a few episodes. His love of Zebraman is shared by a thirdgrade student in his class of which he is an unsuccessful teacher and that student turns out to have the admiration and warmth the man can't get from his family. As he runs around the night in his suit trying to remain harmlessly escapist and yet still romantically fantasized he starts running into the enemies from the television show. Seems the 30 year old defunct television show was actually a prophecy and since it was canceled Zebraman himself doesn't know how it will end. Now if only he could figure out how to fly...This warm and nostalgialaced movie by Takashi Miike is one of his later features and Miike has sort of slowed down a bit. He no longer cuts corners like he used to and in this case he doesn't feel the need nor is there to throw anything truly disturbing in there. Still I've heard some people call this movie a children's show and of course there's some very adult themes speckled throughout. However once again Miike surprises by playing with audience expectations.Zebraman is a superhero movie but the moments of action and frenetic stylizations are actually quite rare and reserved. The bigger bulk of Zebraman is actually a focus on the characters especially Zebraman and his tenyearold sidekick as they figure out just what a superhero is supposed to do after he dons the outfit. And what an outfit! Sure to be a new staple Halloween costume for film geeks for years to come Zebraman's costume is its own character first because of its hilariously ironic blackandwhite style and also in the way it slowly falls apart throughout the film.Miike is also not strictly a filmmaker in that he throws any visual media into his stories as he desires.

The Big Boss battle becomes what literally looks like a intervideo graphic from a video game like Final Fantasy VII.

The plot is the worst part of the film. I almost fell asleep till the end. So stupid so predictable... And where did all the super powers come to that loser teacher? We see him normal and after a second he has all the super punches and kicks and he even teaches himself to fly?!? And that handicapped kid and his mother. One would think that Zebraman is a pedophile and then other would think that he cheats on his wife with the cripple's mother. The whole movie is pathetic. I wish I never watched it.

It can work well in dramas or in suspense pictures but these three films lack anything that could be considered suspenseful. Miike's not allowed I would guess to push the boundaries much so he can't create any memorable setpieces. He works a lot with computer effects in Zebraman but they're extremely poor. They wouldn't have been acceptable ten years ago in the United States. The film concerns an ineffectual teacher and father played by Sho Aikawa who longs to become a super hero he remembers from TV when he was a kid. He is soon endowed with the powers he wishes for so he can fight an alien invasion. Sho Aikawa is very good in the lead and there are a couple of good sequences. But all in all it's a bore.".

Beyond how intriguing the band and it's members are the film itself is so well directed and beautifully shot. The sound is excellent. Incredibly artistic film montages add to rather than detract from the music. I have never seen a better portrayal of live music. The sheer musicianship of these men is mind boggling.

This movie shows Pink Floyd at their best and happiest in the early 70's. There is alos footage of the recording of the best album since Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  Dark Side of the Moon.  This band is so meticulous and so conscious of what they put out.  Their talent is so enormous I would recommend this video to anyone.  The musicianship is so good by all members of the band David Gilmour Roger Waters Nick Mason and Richard Wright.  It is so great to see them perform live and to be so young and talented.  I was impressed especially by Richard Wright and Nick Mason. They are so good in this movie.  So are Roger Waters and David Gilmour.  David Gilmour's guitar playing moves me to tears.  He is so good.  Roger Waters songwriting is just so excellent.  I wish that all four would get back together again and tour. Thank you Pink Floyd.".

	schema:reviewBody "An ancient city nowadays wiped out Pompei a major British band from the seventies Pink Floyd. Apparently there's none link between the two quoted names. You can barely imagine the dark side of the moon's creator to give a concert in this magic and sole scenerie. However this is what happened in october 1971 and the result is astonishing. There's no spectators but the music impresses is at its full swing. Moreover you are under the impression that the members of the band surpass themselves musically and they give the best they can. Adrian Maben succeeds skilfully the marriage between the sound and the picture and it creates an entrancing climate. I think about the static shots of different places in Pompei with Echoes probable the best song Pink Floyd has ever written in the background. However his making appears to be paradoxical it can be both creative and ingenious Waters' scream in careful with that axe Eugene is compared with a volcano erupting. On the other hand it's a pity that he favours a bit too often slow travelings and the same precise shots of the band's members during their performance. It can give birth to weariness. Nevertheless Pink Floyd live at Pompei is also a wellregulated movie thanks to the sequences that take place in the Abbey Road Studios. You see interviews of the band and this one at work recording their masterpiece dark side of the moon THE album that will reveal them to the general public and probably their last collective album before Roger Waters' seizure of power. If you wish to know how your favourite album was recorded the movie will deliver it to you... The movie isn't without humor Nick Mason's preference for an apple pie without crust and a dog is baying at the moon during Mademoiselle nobs. In short Pink Floyd live at Pompei will delight any Pink Floyd fan.".

You can barely imagine the dark side of the moon's creator to give a concert in this magic and sole scenerie. However this is what happened in october 1971 and the result is astonishing. There's no spectators but the music impresses is at its full swing. Moreover you are under the impression that the members of the band surpass themselves musically and they give the best they can. Adrian Maben succeeds skilfully the marriage between the sound and the picture and it creates an entrancing climate. I think about the static shots of different places in Pompei with Echoes probable the best song Pink Floyd has ever written in the background. However his making appears to be paradoxical it can be both creative and ingenious Waters' scream in careful with that axe Eugene is compared with a volcano erupting. On the other hand it's a pity that he favours a bit too often slow travelings and the same precise shots of the band's members during their performance. It can give birth to weariness. Nevertheless Pink Floyd live at Pompei is also a wellregulated movie thanks to the sequences that take place in the Abbey Road Studios. You see interviews of the band and this one at work recording their masterpiece dark side of the moon THE album that will reveal them to the general public and probably their last collective album before Roger Waters' seizure of power. If you wish to know how your favourite album was recorded the movie will deliver it to you... The movie isn't without humor Nick Mason's preference for an apple pie without crust and a dog is baying at the moon during Mademoiselle nobs. In short Pink Floyd live at Pompei will delight any Pink Floyd fan.";

For years I only knew what they looked like in the 90s and later. To see how they looked in the 70s is awesome. I used to feel ambivalent about some of their music I loved some of it but not all. Having this DVD to play and replay made me realize just what great musicians they were and still are and I usually follow it with Pink Floyd at Live 8 when the four of them got back together again for the first time in years. Amazing to see the march of time in their faces they're my generation so its not off putting or anything. In fact it just confirms what we've all known for so long Pink Floyd are Timeless and still very handsome! I'll always love you David! Sigh!".

I have to say that as brilliant as the film is I am not a fan of the director's cut on the DVD with all the alternate clips especially the new intro. Don't get me wrong this is still an amazing must have for any Floyd fan. It documents the band after the Meddle album was released and right on the cusp of their major breakout Dark Side of the Moon which would officially end their psychedelic phase. The film gives a brilliant insight into the live and studio aspects of the Floyd which as a musician is always fascinating. If you like to see the inner workings of a band in the studio performing live and on the road this film provides plenty. There are clips of the band recording Dark Side interviews which provide a glimpse into how they perceived themselves and the evolution of the band ex. Nick Mason saying they are all done because 1967 is long gone and clips from the road with all the typical rock star banter and complaining And no crust!!!. If you've never seen the original of this film then the newer DVD will probably be just as wonderful as the original is for me. I don't like change. Pink Floyd is a monumental rock band and this period of time for them shows some of the well thought out musical genius that was and will always be Pink Floyd.".

The band's musical prowess is well represented here especially David Gilmour's passionate playing.  Also it should be noted that Nick Mason is an underrated drummer and his skills shine in the performance scenes.  This film truly captures Pink Floyd at one of its creative peaks.  Between the concert footage there are several scenes where the band can be seen writing and performing their legendary successful Dark Side of the Moon.Also included are some scenes of the band eating together as well as some quick interviews.

It has two parts to it which is part one and part two. Both of these parts combine to make up the excellent part of the movie. Also in this movie is how they were trying to make Dark Side of The Moon. You could see them in the studio trying to figure out how they wanted to make the album. It is really cool how they let us hear the early versions of their songs. There is some good interviews on this one that adds to the movie value. I find the interviews very helpful for understanding what the band was going through at the time. There are some good instrumental songs on this video that sometimes get overlooked. I think that Pink Floyd had made some good instrumentals. There was an blooper on One of These Days when Nick Mason drops his drum stick then he gets another one. That shows how Nick is intense for a song. I can not find no bad songs on here at all. The live Pink Floyd is sometimes better then The Pink Floyd that make studio albums. I owned this video for about four years now and I still enjoy watching it. This movie is a must for all music goers of all kinds.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not only does Live at Pompeii accomplish the assignment of documenting early Pink Floyd though not early enough to have Syd Barrett but it's directed by Adrien Maben with such an electric slow to quicker and back to slow pace that even nonFloyd fans should take a look at this. The film starts off with a bang Echoes part.1 as well as the concluding part.2 rivals the version on their Meddle album and in my opinion is their best most freewheeling yet not in overtly psychedelic improvisational piece. Along with this are the spooky Careful with that Axe Eugene the menacing One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces the mindblowing Saucerful of Secrets the serene Set the controls for the Heart of the Sun and even a wonderful piece with a dog on vocals and Gilmour on Harmonica called Mademoiselle nobbs. These early noteworthy tracks from Floyd's preDark Side catalog is also incorporated with studio footage of the group recording sections of that LP as well as interview footage where Waters Gilmour and Mason explain some of their opinions on the current scene of music at the time if they really take drugs personally I don't trust them and how synthesizers help their iconoclastic creations. In truth Live at Pompeii was made more for the main fan base of Floyd fans and for those looking for a Floyd Fix it's a mustown I pray they release a DVD of this because of the noticeable pan and scan format on VHS however for those who like music videos in general there are camera tricks and such different splicing and editing that it can boggle and possibly enlighten the mind. It's a unique piece for fans and a trippy curio for casual listeners. By the way if you can try to seek out the VHS tape of the film. It may not be what is called the 'director's cut' like on DVD but it's superior by not including cheesy new visual effects that cut into the greater effect of the original 1972 cut.".

As I watched Floyd perform a version of Echoes which I liked even better than the one on the Meddle L.P. I just wished I had showed up stoned out of my bird. The film seems to have been filmed in several placesbesides the ruins of that ancient Roman amphitheater there are a few selections shot in a film studio. The interview sections are well documented as well. There are sections of Floyd in the recording studio working out the 'Dark Side' L.P. I wonder if any of that unused material has ever turned up on any Floyd bootleg? Now that I've heard that a longer version exists of this film I'll have to scour the planet for a version of it.

	schema:reviewBody "When movie characters have many opportunities to leave but stay in a place we quickly understand and not without excitement that the movie will have only one setting. On that aspect Carnage tries to resemble Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? through a plot consisting in a conflict between two couples. I say 'try' because it's also a rare example of a marvelous potential totally wasted coming so close to be a comedic gem of originality. I couldn't believe Roman Polanski didn't go farther with the concept he had on his hands. How he let the film end in such an abrupt and let's face it anticlimactic way is a total mystery.Carnage starts with a civilized discussion between two couple of parents their kids had a fight the little Cowan broke little Longstreet's two teeth. The Cowans Nancy and Alan are played by Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz and the Longstreets Michael and Penelope by John C. Reilly and Jodie Foster. To determine which actor outshined the other is a futile exercise they were all great and the script knows how to give to each one a moment to shine. The discussion is full of social hypocrisy the Cowans don't deny their son's responsibility but the insistence of Penelope on little Cowan's guilt foreshadows a tension between the couple and the pivotal moment happens in the most unlikely way through a big outburst of vomit. As soon as Nancy pukes the movie takes us to one exhilarating ride into human relationships.The underlined theory behind Carnage is that we all have two facets when it comes to our adult behavior the image we'd like to reflect to society and whatever cements our inner personality. Interestingly Carnage shows the gap between these parts of ourselves we prefer to keep intimate and the image we display as a couple and that's the key of the film's narrative. In the beginning it's about two couples and then it desegregates into four protagonists each one guided by his or her own issues. The performances are crucial because the point is to allow each viewer to identify with one character while the actions of the others remain justifiable. Indeed no one is right or wrong but each one is blinded by a subjectivity that underlines any attempt of a rational judgment. And the funniest thing is that they all try to be objective when it's totally impossible.Take Penelope for instance she is an idealist humanitarian that extrapolates the problem of her child to the eternal conflict between the weak and the strong she embodies the feminist aspect that translates almost everything in terms of conflict it's all about dominant this and oppressed that. She proudly reminds everyone that she defended the Darfour cause neglecting that the core of most conflicts in the world is profit and greed regardless of genders and colors of skins. Ironically her idealism doesn't prevent her from superficiality when she makes a fuss about a catalog messed up by Nancy's vomit. On the other hand Michael assumes his superficiality and enjoys life with more detachment. He takes that his boy was in a band with a sort of childish pride that betrays a naive and somewhat good nature but clearly opposed to his wife's philosophy of life.The Cowans are more sophisticated and dysfunctional enough to justify a failure in their son's education but something seems to point the fault on Alan as the eternal workaholic who can't get rid of his phone. The second pivot of the film occurs through the bonding process by gender when the two men try to not overreact and overanalyze the children's problem and the two women make it personal. And when the plot was getting more and more exciting then Nancy took Alan's cell phone and threw it in the water making the two men struggle to repair it under the wives' mockeries. Then I started to feel manipulated as a guy I know that we men have many flaws but not being obsessed by objects otherwise we would have purses too. I thought this was a risible attempt to ridicule the guys when the two women were obviously bonding in a most grotesque way.This highlighted what was for me the problem of the film the pacing it was fast and it seemed to be like in a hurry without a pause or some time given to let us catch our breath. Shot in real time it seemed like the director and the writer were in a hurry to conclude the thing without giving much answers on the few interesting questions it raised. The mothers had to drink to get drunk fast and behave abnormally very soon. I expected a crescendo evolution that would lead to some audacity maybe a fight or a realization. But it felt like the whole concept of the film adapted from a play written by Yasmina Reza was trapped in a sacred respect of the unity of time space and plot with no plot whatsoever.Amusingly my wife told me that it was typical of a Yasmina Reza play and she immediately slept after half an hour expecting that the movie would lead nowhere. I continued the film and I thought that maybe it was cleverly preparing for a spectacular climax or some mindblowing statement about couples. Well it just ended there and I couldn't help but feel a bit cheated. Since the movie doesn't end having a point in the literal meaning of the world I guess its point was just to depict how manners and politeness are social masks that can easily get removed when the most sensitive issues are tackled and while even the couple's facade fails to hide the most intimate convictions.I'm sure it could have taken more distance and explored more interesting points but since the writer and the director didn't feel like developing the story and the characters why should we?".

I continued the film and I thought that maybe it was cleverly preparing for a spectacular climax or some mindblowing statement about couples. Well it just ended there and I couldn't help but feel a bit cheated. Since the movie doesn't end having a point in the literal meaning of the world I guess its point was just to depict how manners and politeness are social masks that can easily get removed when the most sensitive issues are tackled and while even the couple's facade fails to hide the most intimate convictions.I'm sure it could have taken more distance and explored more interesting points but since the writer and the director didn't feel like developing the story and the characters why should we?";

	schema:headline " An interesting film but I expected more from it";
	schema:reviewBody "Roman Polanski along with other audacious directors such as Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola was part of the new school which changed the face of commercial cinema during the '70s leaving behind the retrograde moralist and edifying schemes the industry had been dragging from the '50s when the famous Hays Code severely censored the indecency in cinema. However at the difference of Coppola and Scorsese Polanski seems to have improved with the age leaving aside the misstep he had with Oliver Twist because even though some of his classic films keep undeniably being very interesting The Tenant The Fearless Vampire Killers I think his modern films offer a wider spectrum of artistic and narrative attributes. In other words I think Polanski is living his best creative period as it has been proved by the films The Ninth Gate The Pianist and The Ghost Writer. That's the reason why I was very interested in watching Carnage his most recent film however even though it ended up being an interesting experience I didn't find it very memorable and it's definitely very far from being among Polanski's best films.Even if it hadn't been mentioned during the initial credits the fact that Carnage is based on a play would have been obvious. With the exception of the prologue and the epilogue the whole film is developed in only one location and it basically relies on the dialogs and the performances. On some way Carnage is a filmed play and as a consequence it's difficult to appreciate Polanski's hand but anyway...even without his characteristic atmosphere and visual style the film is entertaining despite feeling a bit affected and pretentious. In this kind of minimalistic stories we frequently see the structural simplicity compensated by over the top drama because instead of looking for a visual deployment the focus is on the evolution or deevolution of the characters something which was exactly the point of Carnage. The result in here is competent even though I occasionally found it superficial and not very credible. The conflict between the two couples begins on a realistic way but its staggering is too quick and obviously designed to make a contrast between their moral values. And when the ending came I felt the fact that too many things were left up in the air.However I can't deny that the performances from Carnage are magnificent. Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly are absolutely perfect as the liberal and progressive middleaged couple so politically correct that they run the risk of becoming caricatures. Meanwhile Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz are brilliant as a wealthy but accessible and casual couple.Even though it didn't leave me completely satisfied I can bring a moderate recommendation to Carnage as a competent film with excellent performances and an interesting story.".

As in director Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby the action is almost exclusively in the small one bedroom apartment resulting in an uncomfortable crowding of bodies and egos. And it doesn't take long for the individual differences to surface as one is conciliatory another confrontational another detached and another bewildered.Nor does it take long only an 80 minute production anyway for alliances to build and not necessarily in the same couple with the refrain Why are we still here? becoming the battle cry. Yes it doesn't turn out well nor would most confrontations except that the civil veneer usually stays intact for most of us.But when writers Yasmina Reza and Polanski allow the characters to speak their minds albeit helped by Scotch the drama gets good and the words become socially lethal. What I like best is the language not elevated but sassy smart and colloquial Should we wrap this up? Yes it is a film to be wrapped but there is no real end to the social jousting that goes on in our minds if not our mouths which are sometimes beaten badly as careless children might do in their play.".

Reilly Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz main seem like an unbalanced superficial casting to some for a lowkey movie such as this but what at first is expectedly unfit and useless is later realized and understood.From the opening of the film Roman Polanski uses the same intensity of 50's60's suspense film openings such as 'Compulsion' to distract you from what is happening behind the credits to then lead you to the purpose of the film to the then the plot. The back drop of the credits is filmed and placed in a way that looks especially 70's which entirely gives a delightfully and brilliantly vintage opening of a treat as something like this is unfortunately rarely seen in a dramedy as this. A starting such as this lets you know that you're in for the creative dramatically playful telling of Mr. Roman Polanski.The first few lines of the movie give way to the two head strong characters of the movie who battle it out later on but before then the movie centers on the societal dealing with a schoolyard attack on the son of a seemingly liberal couple Penelope and Michael played by Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly by the son of a seemingly conservative couple Nancy and Allen played by Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz. Penelope is an opinionated passionate writer who leads the reasoning of the incident. Michael is a friendly yet choosy salesman who tries to make light of the whole situation. Nancy is a pseudoconservative who like Michael tries to keep the whole situation without argument and Allen is a sly yet focused attorney who would rather be working then deal with the incident as long as the whole thing is dealt with fairly. The first half of the movie displays the tightrope courtesy of the two couples dealing with this unfortunate situation in Penelope and Michael's New York apartment as little by little the faults of each parent comes out but is especially looked over for the sake of good re pore which makes for a realistic look out on the stubborn idiosyncrasies of parents in general. As what one would consider to be poorly written boring typical or an offputting part of the film is really a clever set up of what's to come as the first half realistically exports the pointlessness and exhaustiveness of how this situation is handled. As things seep towards the second half of the film the characters become less and less censored and open to be their real selves in the confinement of Penelope and Michael's apartment which leads to the rewarding and interesting part of the film. Nancy and Michael are the soft mending parts of their relationships but turn out to be more disturbed and Penelope and Allen are the leaders and rightfully duke it out. As the conservative couple Nancy and Allen are nothing without their accessories and as the liberal couple Penelope and Michael just want to be heard and taken seriously.What's great technically about 'Carnage' is Roman Polanski's eye and directing as he is aware of the subtleties and exaggerations of film and why they can go hand in hand. With that Kate Winslet is great at acting guarded and then letting her guard down and Jodie Foster pushes herself to points that seem brilliantly worrying she should probably get an Oscar nom. John C. Reilly naturally does great playing the friendly caring Michael who as much as he is that he's as well careless and Christoph Waltz plays his usual cocky self who has an answer to everything which is accurate as the fierce attorney he portrays.Also written by Roman Polanski 'Carnage' has a lot of insight biased or not about men and women and society which makes it importantly realistic and in part shows view of the accurate thoughts of Roman Polanski. If you're into or not into films about four people dealing with each other in one location check out 'Carnage' and if not for Roman Polanski see it for the rare useful form of the actors involved. I started out not sure whether I was going to like 'Carnage' or not but towards the end I saw the big picture and in that my only regret is that when it ended I wanted more time with these four people.".

I was off from work on a beautiful Southern California day and just watched Woody Allen's Manhattan Murder Mystery last night so this was a nice complimentary movie.The basic premise of the movie is the interactions of two sets of parents who are getting together for the sole purpose of an altercation between their children. Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly are the parents of the injured child Ethan. Kate Winslet and Christopher Waltz are the parents of the boy that hit Ethan Zachery. The movie starts and ends in the confines of the Longstreet's apartment Reilly  Foster. What ensues is the breakdown of civility between the two parties. I really enjoyed the movie especially as it was the right movie for my mood but also because the casting was great dialogue was sharp and as usual the directing was spot on. I went in expecting Reilly to be miscast but he not only held his own but had some real moments. Foster is easy to hate and the one I think an award nomination is due. Winslet had a great metamorphosis as too chic investment banker. Waltz was maybe not fleshed out as much but easily the most enjoyable. All things considered it was a Thoroughly enjoyable movie. There is very little not to like but taken in the essence of an old fashioned ensemble And that it's wrapped up nicely with a bow not many loose ends it's a great 80 minute Escape from the HD life we live.".

	schema:headline " A breath of fresh air";
	schema:reviewBody "In the face of such classics as Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby it would be a hollow statement to label Carnage one of Roman Polanski's best films it's shockingly minimalistic compared to the rest of his catalog and almost anachronistic in its old fashioned filmmaking style and strippeddown production. Many were probably disappointed by the film purely because of Polanski's name it might have been better received if it was directed by a young newcomer. Case in point 12 Angry Men and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf directed by young newcomers Sidney Lumet and Mike Nichols respectively. Both are still considered among the best each director achieved but also as experimental debuts that would lead to bigger and more ambitious things. Obviously this is not the case with Carnage which is a veteran director returning to his roots to a minimalism not seen in his work since the 50's. And yet it's so much better than any of the more ambitious films he made in recent years  The Ghost Writer Oliver Twist The Pianist and The Ninth Gate all having their merits but none a real classic or any kind of a surprise.Not to say that Carnage is as good as 12 Angry Men or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf masterpieces of minimalism and cinematic landmarks. Carnage isn't any real news cinematically speaking but it's a wonderful exercise in acting and interaction and if you're a fan of minimalistic cinema like I am you're bound to find interest in it. I never found it boring for a second  uncomfortable yes grating even but never dull I was completely drawn in by the wonderful performances of the leads  Jodie Foster Kate Winslet Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly  who manage to covey four complex fascinating repulsive and very realistic characters and by the evershifting relationships and alliances between them.

	onyx:emotionText "In the face of such classics as Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby it would be a hollow statement to label Carnage one of Roman Polanski's best films it's shockingly minimalistic compared to the rest of his catalog and almost anachronistic in its old fashioned filmmaking style and strippeddown production. Many were probably disappointed by the film purely because of Polanski's name it might have been better received if it was directed by a young newcomer. Case in point 12 Angry Men and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf directed by young newcomers Sidney Lumet and Mike Nichols respectively. Both are still considered among the best each director achieved but also as experimental debuts that would lead to bigger and more ambitious things. Obviously this is not the case with Carnage which is a veteran director returning to his roots to a minimalism not seen in his work since the 50's. And yet it's so much better than any of the more ambitious films he made in recent years  The Ghost Writer Oliver Twist The Pianist and The Ninth Gate all having their merits but none a real classic or any kind of a surprise.Not to say that Carnage is as good as 12 Angry Men or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf masterpieces of minimalism and cinematic landmarks. Carnage isn't any real news cinematically speaking but it's a wonderful exercise in acting and interaction and if you're a fan of minimalistic cinema like I am you're bound to find interest in it. I never found it boring for a second  uncomfortable yes grating even but never dull I was completely drawn in by the wonderful performances of the leads  Jodie Foster Kate Winslet Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly  who manage to covey four complex fascinating repulsive and very realistic characters and by the evershifting relationships and alliances between them. While it's clearly a filmed play  and Polanski let the original text shine  he makes excellent use of the possibilities the film format allows from the bombastic and melodramatic to the quiet and subtle neither of which is possible on stage at least not in the same way.Carnage isn't necessarily a masterpiece but it's a wonderful intellectual exercise and one of my favorite films of 2011.

Is it really that easy to declare one 11 yearold boy the victim and the other the abuser? Aren't they both somewhat to blame for whatever occurred? Well you try telling that to Foster's Penelope. After the 1 hour and 20 minute straight verbal battle I am staying clear.Carnage is funny because we know what each character is really thinking under their sincere or falsesincere passive cover. Eventually once a bottle of scotch gets consumed they admit to their feelings and surprisingly it still remains funny. That is where the brilliance of the writing comes in. You could apply the old adage it's funny because it's true. But there is something to these movies about the real human and family relations accurately displayed beneath a comedy banner.Being a comedy Carnage fared well enough getting Golden Globe nominations but I am a little miffed at the lack of screenplay nominations. Then again that's what happens when it is written and directed by Roman Polanski. I don't blame Hollywood for not always wanting to award him. If you don't want to reward him either then find the play version of Carnage. I'm sure it's just as good.".

	schema:headline " Hysterical Carnage of Parenthood. This no manners comedy movie was a good watch.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie directed by Roman Polankski is really unique as most of the film was shot in real time without breaks and with the exception of the park scenes in a single location. It reminds me of previous one room stage plays works turn into feature films like Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 'Rope' Sidney Lumet's 1957's 12 Angry Men or 1966's 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' by Mike Nichols. I love how the movie is shot in one location. It's does give that small time playwright play feel as if the viewer is an audience member in a silence sitcom watching these events unfold in front of them. The movie tells the story of two boy's parents meeting in Brooklyn apartment to discuss the matter of their children getting into a fight in the park that results in one boy hitting the other in the face with a stick. Alan Christoph Waltz and Nancy Cowan Kate Winslet visit the home of Michael John C. Reilly and Penelope Longstreet Jodie Foster to talk about the issue only to find out that their intended short meeting became drawn out longer due to various circumstances. They soon overstay their welcome and the peaceful conversation turn ugly as the two sets of families continue to try to get the upper hand over the other family in verbal battle of wits over issues ranging from dead hamsters cell phone use to prescribed drugs. Sooner than later both sets of parents find themselves at each other throats. The movie is surgically exposing the true layers of social convention with dry wit meanspirited humor. While some people might find this annoying or unlikeable to listen to. I found myself very interested in what was being said. I also found myself laughing at times at the smart humor. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea but if you enjoy subtle refined humor it is well worth your time to give it a watch. Other humor like the vomit gag kinda turn me off from the film. I have to say the humor is wellrounded. All of the actors did their parts very well. John C. Reilly really comes across as the well mattered laid back Average Joe whom would simply appreciate an apology from their child and quickly forget about it. Jodie Foster really knows how to act like an arrogance stuck up author with a pushy agenda. She never seems to want to shut her mouth against people she secretly despise. She has this unpleasantly overbearing preachy attitude that you can help not hating. Christoph Waltz indeed waltz into the right role as the aloof over busy brutality honest Pharmaceutical spin doctor businessman. It was funny how often he had to pick up his cell phone for a call. Kate Winslet is truly amazing as the over emotional bi polar train wreck who find herself going to extremes in both in mania and her lows. The movie is well written and very faithful to the Tony Award winning play God of Carnage by French playwright Yasmina Reza. Although set in Brooklyn New York the film was shot in Paris because of Polanski's fugitive status. You really couldn't tell the different since most of the film was indoors. The opening and closing scenes ostensibly filmed in Brooklyn Bridge Park were shot by a second unit. The movie is well shot and shows why Roman Polanski is a good director. A lot of critics might hate this film due to the fact that Polanski is a controversial figure. In 1977 after a photo shoot in Los Angeles Polanski was arrested for the rape of a 13yearold girl and pleaded guilty to the charge of unlawful sex with a minor. To avoid sentencing Polanski fled to his home in London eventually settling in France. I have to say while I'm not a huge fan of Polanski the person I do praise his works as director. He has a secret cameo in the film that worth checking out. Overall I believe in the god of carnage. The god whose rule's been unchallenged since time immemorial. This movie showcase their power and it works as a pretty good comedy. What are you still doing here? Go home and watch the film. It's that good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roman Polanski's Carnage is without a shadow of a doubt the best black comedy I've seen since Bobcat Goldthwait's World's Greatest Dad. It's thin but beyond commendable as it depicts two couples discussing the aftermath of what happened between their two children in an extravagant beautiful Brooklyn cough cough Paris condo.The victim here is Ethan both boys only appear at the very beginning and the very end who was hit in the mouth with a stick removing his two front teeth by another kid his age. His parents are salesman Michael Reilly and writer Penelope Longstreet Foster who are holding the meeting. The boy who was wielding the stick was Zachary whose parents are loquacious Alan Waltz and nitpicky and openly insulting Nancy Cowan Winslet. At first the talk is presumed to be only a short meeting between two parents both equally in stressful situations. It quickly transfers from a genial encounter to an almost blatant attack on the couples' separate ways of parenting. The Longstreet couple is more attached to the path of calmness and politically correctness while the Cowan couple is more blunt dictative and downright nihilistic.The performances are electric with every actor giving their all to make the material work. At only seventynine minutes long and gridlocked into one standard setting the slick writing manages to squeeze out humor compassion passiveaggressive behavior and provide a social commentary on modern parenting all in one quick rapidfire excursion.Despite all the personal attacks that come into play later in the film neither couple seems like the villain. It shows what pressure a smothering setting and a real problem involving their kids can do to people. Parenting is arguable one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences life brings many of us. It can only be further complicated when a confrontation between another child is brought into the picture. The film never becomes pictorial and depicts the stress in a relaxed way that doesn't become dry or unbearable.The film is based on a stage play titled God of Carnage which is really no surprise. The film plays like one big monologue shot practically in realtime. If Hollywood got a hold of this formula I could see a very very bleak turnout. It would most likely focus more on the humor making it too arrant while oppressively hammering in one liners like a onetrack dull comedy. Here we are more focused on timing wit style and don't forget the development and substance. The care and attention needed to perfect an idea like this is all here full force. No exceptions no cop outs  just unadulterated honesty.I mentioned in my review of The Myth of the American Sleepover that awkward silences and pauses were becoming too common in independent films. Silence not in the sense of pacing or development but a droning quietness between dialog that made films feel like a giant hole was cut in the screenplay. The characters in Carnage are quick on their comebacks and timing making for a very interesting playbyplay. You want to yell your comments and remarks at the screen but feel you'll disrupt the casual sophisticated flow of the script.Carnage is simply a masterful piece by a wellrespected director. This is my introduction to Polanski's work and probably my strongest welcoming to a director's vision next to Scorsese's Casino and Kevin Smith's Clerks. I recently mentioned in my review of Harry and Tonto that the greatest trait a film can possess is the trait of humanism where the characters seem real well thought out and developed unconditionally. Carnage understands that trait inside and out. It could also very well be a comedy with more bad laughs than natural ones including an ending that reigns truer to anything I've seen in a while. Its commentary on child development and parenting is efficient and its intellectual side is brittle realistic and calm. This is easily one of the funniest darkest comedies of 2011.Starring John C. Reilly Jodie Foster Christoph Waltz and Kate Winslet. Directed by Roman Polanski.".

	schema:headline " Yet another great film about argument!";
	schema:reviewBody "'CARNAGE' Four Stars Out of Five   Roman Polanski adapts the popular French play 'God of Carnage' by  Yasmina Reza in to this dark comedy about argument. The film tells the  story of two sets of parents trying to 'heal' a conflict started by  their kids. It stars Jodie Foster Kate Winslet Christoph Waltz and  John C. Reilly. The entire film is set in real time in one Brooklyn  apartment although filmed in Paris due to director Polanski being a  wanted fugitive in the US. Reza cowrote the screenplay with Polanski  and it's about as clever and witty as any film I've seen this year  while still remaining mostly believable!   The film revolves around a fight that breaks out between two eleven  year old classmates in Brooklyn Bridge Park when one boy refuses to let  the other in his gang and calls him a tattletail. One boy is struck by  the other with a stick and is hurt badly in the mouth requiring some  dental work. The parents of each boy decide to meet in one couple's  Brooklyn apartment in order to discuss the fight and try to resolve the  conflict between the two boys. The rest of the film almost it's  entirety plays out in the apartment with the parents discussing their  boys' conflict rather aggressively which results in a much bigger  conflict between them.  Like the recent Iranian film 'A SEPARATION' this is a beautiful and  believable film about argument. Of course this is a much more comedic  and somewhat lighthearted look at argument than the award winning  foreign language film but it's just as realistic and drives home it's  point just as clearly. The acting is all top notch with Foster playing  against type as the most unlikeable character of the bunch and Waltz  impressing yet again by delivering my favorite performance of the film.  The dialogue is very smart and funny and the directing is perfectly  subtle. Like I said not as hardhitting as the Iranian masterpiece but  nearly as effective in it's own way. A very relatable and enlightening  film one not to be missed!".

The film tells the  story of two sets of parents trying to 'heal' a conflict started by  their kids. It stars Jodie Foster Kate Winslet Christoph Waltz and  John C. Reilly. The entire film is set in real time in one Brooklyn  apartment although filmed in Paris due to director Polanski being a  wanted fugitive in the US. Reza cowrote the screenplay with Polanski  and it's about as clever and witty as any film I've seen this year  while still remaining mostly believable!   The film revolves around a fight that breaks out between two eleven  year old classmates in Brooklyn Bridge Park when one boy refuses to let  the other in his gang and calls him a tattletail. One boy is struck by  the other with a stick and is hurt badly in the mouth requiring some  dental work. The parents of each boy decide to meet in one couple's  Brooklyn apartment in order to discuss the fight and try to resolve the  conflict between the two boys. The rest of the film almost it's  entirety plays out in the apartment with the parents discussing their  boys' conflict rather aggressively which results in a much bigger  conflict between them.  Like the recent Iranian film 'A SEPARATION' this is a beautiful and  believable film about argument. Of course this is a much more comedic  and somewhat lighthearted look at argument than the award winning  foreign language film but it's just as realistic and drives home it's  point just as clearly. The acting is all top notch with Foster playing  against type as the most unlikeable character of the bunch and Waltz  impressing yet again by delivering my favorite performance of the film.  The dialogue is very smart and funny and the directing is perfectly  subtle. Like I said not as hardhitting as the Iranian masterpiece but  nearly as effective in it's own way. A very relatable and enlightening  film one not to be missed!";

There is no need to discuss and interpret the message is delivered in nicelyserved bits of satirist speeches which are easy to follow. Our civilization is based upon lies. So how does Roman Polanski achieve it to present us this cheerless idea in such an incredibly cheerful way?It's the actors and the characters they play. They are rich they are cultivated but not too aloof. One still is able to identify with the characters. The woman with the big heart for Africa played by Jodie Foster and married to the slightly corpulent shopowner played by John C. Reilly. The other couple consists of the most charming investment consultant played by Kate Winslet and the busy yet stylish lawyer wonderfully acted by Christoph Waltz. The reason for their little meeting is a fight between two boys. Two civilized married couples having a civilized meeting. If there's something negative it's sad behind the other's back. But slowly the good attributes become ironically stretched blurred we know the roles of the single characters so well that consequently only hate remains. We hate the superhuman Jodie Foster. We hate the darling Kate Winslet for her being blatantly drunk and not being able to control herself. We hate John C. Reilly for his diplomacy and simplemindedness. Only Christoph Waltz remains jetset. The scene in which he talks to John C. Reilly's mother on the phone is so great you can't draw a border between noble showmanship and sheer arrogance. Great actors great story it reminded me a bit of Clybourne Park but it was better not too thoughtful not too thoughtless  but all chewed. I love the moment of cracking the nutshell of a movie the moment of realization. Sadly Roman Polanski left that nutshell out. What remains still is very delightful though.".

Not since the powerful screen version of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf  almost half a century ago has a blistering film adaptation from a highly praised play about the disintegration of marriage made it to the big screen. Sadly the sound and fury of the written word has fell silent to the relentless onslaught of superheroes teen angst vampires and such.Now there's a new couple or two bickering away into your hearts. It's Get the Guest Time once more! The class war has heated up in Roman Polanski's film treatment of the Tony awardwinning play God of Carnage. Cowritten by its original playwright Yasmina Reza  and the director  and shortening its title to Carnage the basic story is still left unscathed but the core of the drama and the overthetop hysterics are too forced and heavyhanded to support the action. Meet Michael Longstreet and his wife Penelope an upper class couple with the middle class values to prove it. Their son was injured in a schoolyard scuffle by another boy and his parents the upper upper crust Alan and Nancy Cowan have decided to formally apologize for their son's violent misdeed. Nothing goes as planned as conversation and blame escalates throughout the visit.This film version is fairly faithful to its original source  although the names of the female characters have oddly been changed to protect the guilty . Polanski cleverly opens the film with a distant shot of the altercation between the two boys but never reveals the cause or argument leading to the violent act. Most of the action as in the play takes place in the spacious New York apartment of the Longstreets with much of the fun being the slow dissolve of the superiorminded one percent's resolve as they gradually become less civil and more savage to each other by the day's end.Yet with all of Raza's witty remarks and ironic touches still on hand and the dialog zinging along the film remains inert and not as entertaining as the play. Polanski's direction is solid but the satirical edge has been blunted sacrificing the comedy for the melodramatic flourishes with certain monologues either abridged or removed entirely in this new translation.  Sorely missing is a wonderful ending speech by one of the characters that efficiently summarized the play's theme.  There is a disparity a lopsidedness in this film adaptation. Perhaps this is a vehicle for strong actors who are ideal for these demanding roles. The right casting is so essential to achieve Carnage's vitriolic sting. Polanski has wisely cast Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz as the rich intruders. They bring their baggage with them in full force even if it's the Louis Vuitton variety. But the director seriously miscasts Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly as the other warring couple causing a delicate imbalance of the comic elements to suffer in the process. The credibility of each couple is so crucial for the film to work and it just doesn't here. One never truly accepts Foster and Reilly as real spouses. Physically and emotionally they are a mismatch with Foster emanating classy strength and intellectual superiority and Reilly underplaying his role as more of a schlep rather than a controlling bullying type. This unevenness sets the wrong tone for the wordplay that follows.Carnage is supposed to be a bumpy ride a dark comedy about our human foibles. But this film version more often fumbles in its clumsy staging. This farce has become far too sobering even with all the booze being shared. Pour me another.

I absolutely love the books and although the trailer of the movie implied a few silly changes had been made I still thought it would be true to the heart of the book.What a travesty. From the moment it began I knew that being a fan of the book was not a good idea. Alex Pettyfer is not Alex Rider. Since when was Alex Rider actually particularly good at being a spy. In the film he's already far better than any spies MI6 have to offer before he goes to training. HE'S MEANT TO BE RELUCTANT. The training camp is supposed to be a huge task for him but apparently falling off a zip wire to music by the Gorillaz is a tough training programme. The characters became gimmicky and ridiculous they were like cartoon caricatures. Jack Starbright is not some kungfoo pufferfish loving idiot that she is in the film. Alicia Silverstone is wooden and irritating. Alex Pettyfer spends the entire duration of the film content with the fact he looks good and doesn't feel the need to really look upset or happy or anything when these kind of emotions are required. He basically sat back had a few facial shots of him looking moody filmed and let his stunt double do the rest. Smithers  Stephen Fry what are you doing?? He was sarcastic and moody he's meant to be practically the only jolly person Alex meets. And MISSI PYLE MAY JUST BE THE MOST IRRITATING ACTRESS EVER. WHAT WAS SHE DOING?!? If at any time the film started to redeem itself she'd come on stage and run into something and say something in her ridiculous accent By the way that entire sequence with Jack and her made me want to walk out. Everything was wrong. All the suspenseful moments from the book  Alex swimming under water in the mine the jellyfish scene the quad bike scene which wasn't even in the film and is one of the best scenes in the book EVERYTHING was just rushed and ruined and linked together with bad oneliners such as what is this Hogwarts?Utter utter farce. If you are a fan of the book do not waste your money. The Alex Rider films will certainly not be getting any more of my money.READ THE BOOKS!".

	schema:reviewBody "Book adaptations rarely capture the excellence of the novel which they are based upon and though the same can be said for 'Stormbreaker' it still is a rather good film considering the fact it is mainly aimed at the preteen and young teen audience.Based on the first of Anthony Horowitz's 'Alex Rider' novels the story is centred around orphaned fourteenyearold Alex Rider who lives with his Uncle Ian a man who his nephew assumes is a dull bank worker but is in fact an MI6 operative. When Ian is killed on a mission his superiors are determined to recruit Alex to break the case. Pressured into complying Alex is trained at an SAStype camp before being sent undercover to discover the true intents of psychopath Darius Sayle who is planning a nationwide release of computers he has dubbed Stormbreakers.In his bigscreen debut as Alex Rider sixteenyearold Alex Pettyfer was a shade too old for the role he was as tall as most of the adult cast which took away the shock his role as a child thrust into danger. However although he did have lapses where his performance turned wooden he was quite successful in bringing the character to life depicting Rider's determination anger and cockiness well. It's just a shame he was nowhere near as good as he proved himself to be in 'Tom Brown's Schooldays'. Mickey Rourke was great as the unhinged and vengeful Sayle his reallife disastrous plastic surgery only enhancing his character's crazed nature. It was Pettyfer and Rourke who carried the bulk of the film but their costars including Ewan McGregor Sophie Okonedo Robbie Coltrane and Stephen Fry made their presence known despite having minor roles.The fight and action scenes were nicely performed and depicted a suitably odd feel by conveying the fact it is a boy in the heat of the battle. I also enjoyed the homages to James Bond such as how the main credits at the start exploded onto the screen and how Mr. Smithers nicely complimented Bond's Q. And it was also change for the better to meet Ian Rider as he is already dead in the beginning of the novel so we never really get a feel of what his character might have been like although we could have done without the stereotypical busy fatherfigureneglected child scenes.However there were numerous low points in the film. I love Bill Nighy and he did give a good performance as MI6 boss Mr Blunt but the character just didn't come across right. He was too slapstick to properly depict the cold edge to Mr Blunt a man who doesn't think twice about sending a child into the line of fire. The change to the character of Jack Starbright was also annoying. She isn't meant to be a karate expert nor does she ever become directly involved in Alex's missions so there was absolutely no need for the fight scene. It was quite irking to see the script was poorly handled in terms of keeping Alex's role a secret. Instead of both MI6 and Alex himself taking great care to ensure noone ever learns of his part in bringing down Sayle he's all over the news in the film and even his little girlfriend knows the truth. It ruined the idea that if recruiting Alex as a child spy became public it would be humiliating for MI6 and disrupt whatever chance of normality Alex tries to harbour for himself.For a first outing though 'Stormbreaker' was enjoyable and would probably please young members of the family as well as parents dragged along. However the unnecessary humorous touches to the film will very likely leave many older teens and twentysomethings wanting a bit more 'meat'. Hopefully when they adapt 'Point Blanc' the darker edge that makes the novels so addictive is retained.".

Alex Rider played superbly by Alex Pettyfer is very believable as a school kid thrown into the deep end by Bill Nighy who hams it up brilliantly as spymaster Alan Blunt. Alex Rider is a deadly weapon on two legs as you'll see as the film progresses. Marvellous Micky Rourke plays the evil villain who keeps a very unusual and deadly pet and looks as if he's just stepped off the set of a Revlon ad you'll see!!. There's lots of action some love interest but that's not overplayed and although some of the evil characters look as if they've been loaned out from Cirque Du Soleil including Micky Rourke they play their parts as they should be comically but with a twist of evil thrown in. It all works very well but Alex Pettyfer is a revelation. He plays the part coolly calmly and with a great deal of conviction. I think Sean Connery would be proud of him. The film throws in a few James Bondesque clichs and there is one scene in the film which will remind you of a particular person from Goldfinger !! All in all highly enjoyable my 11 year old niece and 14 year old nephew and their friends really enjoyed it and I think you will too.".

The main problem was that the film was very different from the book with many parts of the story changed and with parts added. The ending was entirely made up for the film. I disliked the way that many of the actors chosen had no resemblance to how the character was described in the book.I also felt that many of the action and fighting scenes were overdone and the superfluous parts annoyed me. The acting particularly from the person playing Herod Sayle was boring and unimaginative. The film was very jumpy in places and I thought that people who had not read the books would have been confused by the ending. I thought that some of the lines in the film were quite strange and didn't really fit in with what was being saidgoing on!However I still gave the film a 4 out of 10 rating because of the many usually unintentionally funny scenes. I was particularly amused by Bill Nighy's acting in the role of Alan Blunt. Stephen Fry also added some comedy to the story in his role as Smithers. The film is reasonably watchable probably because it only lasted 90 minutes.".

The bad guy has no gain from his evil plan and the girl appeared like 10 minutes before the totally unbelievable ending.

However the storyline is very predictable and sometimes ludicrous the script is a bit weak in places I found Alicia Silverstone surprisingly irritating here and the cameos from Stephen Fry and Robbie Coltrane are too brief to allow them to shine properly.Still it is a fun and mildly enjoyable flick. 610 Bethany Cox".

Alex Pettyfer was an amazing Alex Rider delivering a performance worthy of an award.Far from a family film this movie was packed solid with action from start to finish.

I'm not saying it was horrible it was just disappointing.The Alex Rider Series is my favorite book series in the whole entire world and when I heard Stormbreaker the movie was coming out I was SO excited to see it! That was early July late July came the said release date for the movie and I hadn't heard a thing about it no commericals...no nothing. A little while later I figured out that late July was England's release date. So I spent another several months pouring over fan sites reading comments about the movie from English people. Then October 13th the release date for the US finally came. I was very very VERY excited but once again I hadn't heard anything about it. I looked the movie up in the newspaper and on movie theater websites and I found out that it wasn't showing in my area in fact Stormbreaker wasn't showing within a twomile radius of my town! I finally drove two and a half miles to see it and was greatly disappointed. The movie was okay probably a 710 but everything felt off. I don't think the actor that played Alex Rider was right for the part. Also the fact that everyone figured out that Alex was a spy it got rid of the secretive atmosphere and theme that the books had. This fact and because Alex Rider's actor was a bit too old for the role got rid of the scrambling of MI6 trying to hide the fact the they are risking a child's life.This movie was defiantly not what I expected it to be. It might not have been so disappointing if the movie company actually spent some money on advertising and got it in more theaters so then I wouldn't feel that I wasted my time and money driving so far.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've read all the Alex Rider books  largely to see what my three sons were raving about. The books are action from page 1 well crafted stories in the James Bond genre with plausible science. I have thoroughly enjoyed them. Stormbreaker is not the best book in the series but I can understand the movie makers starting there as it gives them the option to make at least five more Alex Rider films! The film follows the book pretty faithfully though with a few inevitable cuts and the introduction of a character from a later book. More is given to the female characters particularly Alex's housekeeperguardian Jack StarbrightAlicia Silverstone presumably to widen the appeal beyond teenage boys and their dads. The relationship between the nasty head of MI6 his deputy Miss Jones and the reluctant spy Alex is nicely transferred from the book. I particularly liked the Miss Jones characterisation. I thought the SAS training camp and the relationship with Wolf could have been handled better  the reasons for Wolf handing over the cap badge were a bit weak in the film but are much stronger in the book. Overall the plot in Stormbreaker is not the strongest in the series so I am sure many will criticise this but the studio have done an excellent job of transferring what there is to the screen. The location shooting in London is fabulous. It is so nice to have a wellcrafted British movie in this genre after having to sit through the awful SpyKids series...".

NOT DARRIUS SAYLE. And also Sabina Pleasure shouldn't even be is this film. Another bad feature of this film is the constant attempts at cheeky humour from Alex Rider. The book is not a comedy therefore the film shouldn't be either. To sum up I would give this film 2 out of ten in quality and 0 out of ten in how well it kept to the book.".

	schema:reviewBody "ALEX RIDER OPERATION STORMBREAKER is of course not realistic at all but it does not need to be. We can almost believe that the story is real because the director producers writer Anthony Horowitz who also wrote the novel the film is based on and actorsactresses do their best to make us believe. Rather than going in the tongue in cheek direction like the earlier AGENT CODY BANKS they adapt a much more serious mindset and pessimistic outlook. Instead of the lead being a smart aleck he is a very mature teenager well beyond his years and is very well acted by Pettyfer. His character is not at all slick and perfect but unsure of himself and he makes mistakes. He does not own a cool sports car is not 18 which according to Horowitz were the requirements the American producers wanted for the film but does have a girlfriend of sorts. In short these attributes and qualities make STORMBREAKER the much better movie. However I do enjoy the AGENT CODY BANKS films but they require the viewer to suspend their disbelief on a much higher level. The main plot is that Alex Rider Alex Pettyfer is a normal British schoolboy whose parents died when he was very young and now lives with his uncle Ian Rider Ewan McGregor and eccentric American housekeeper Jack Starbright Alicia Silverstone. Ian supposedly has a very boring job for a bank which keeps him away from home a lot of the time. But he is eventually killed and his coworkers cover up the cause of death at the funeral as not wearing a seatbelt. Alex investigates however and is forced to participate in an action sequence expertly created by Martial Arts Master Donnie Yen with a junkyard crew. He finds out that his uncle did not work for a bank but actually was a special agent for M16 and was assassinated by Yassen Gregorovich Damian Lewis while on his way home with vital information from a mission. Alex is recruited by the director of M16 Alan Blunt Bill Nighy and his assistant Tulip Jones Sophie Okonedo to find out what Darrius Sayle Mickey Rourke along with his assistants Mr. Grin Andy Serkis and Nadia Vole Missi Pyle really intend by giving one of his company's own supercomputers to every school in the country. The cast is excellent from the new star that has been found in Pettyfer all the way to the veteran actor in Stephen Fry as Smithers. The action is fast and unforgiving especially in the junkyard scene. The stunts are great such as at the Rider house with Jack and Nadia. A movie not to be missed and I also recommend that you read the excellent Alex Rider books.Also Recommended STAR WARS EPISODE I THE PHANTOM MENACE 1999 SPY KIDS 2001 SPY KIDS 2 THE ISLAND OF LOST DREAMS 2002 AGENT CODY BANKS 2003 AGENT CODY BANKS 22004 THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE LIVING OR DEAD INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF ALEX RIDER OPERATION STORMBREAKER.".

There are several twists and turns as well as some impressive action scenes but a lot of it is stagy and a little contrived particularly the character of Nadia Vole who is just plain silly.   There is little suspense and much is predictable. It really doesn't differ enough from similar teen fair whichis a shame as Howowitz's books predate the other films it so closely resembles. However hewrote the script himself and only has himself to blame. I would have liked to seethe series develop however with only half of its 40 million dollar budget recouped in its worldwide theatrical release it appears unlikely.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that my hopes were high before seeing this movie. I had just read the book and had been wowed by Anthony Horowitz's skillful writing and unbeatably creative imagination and so my expectations were almost too high to meet. In fact on first viewing I thought the film was good but that in between the action sequences the pace was too slow and the acting not quite uptoscratch. However when seeing the film for a second time on a bigger screen and in the evening meaning I felt more relaxed and was able to get into the film more easily! I realised just how fantastic this movie is! There are a couple of awkward moments for example at the funeral at the beginning and Bill Nighy hams it up as Mr Blunt with his sometimes cringeworthy lines however overall the action is mindblowing the humour hilarious and the acting superb. Alex Pettyfer is definitely NOT just a pretty face there is a deep intelligence in his eyes and he is able to portray a range of emotions with expert realism. Despite many changes being made in the pagetoscreen process the film does not disappoint.. at least not on secondviewing! I recommend seeing it more than once to truly appreciate it. And I challenge any discontented viewers to justify their dislike  I cannot find a single worthy fault in this fantastic  and I am proud to say British  movie. Standing ovation for Mr Horowitz Mr Samuelson Mr Sax and the entire cast and crew. Looking forward to Point Blanc!".

I had just read the book and had been wowed by Anthony Horowitz's skillful writing and unbeatably creative imagination and so my expectations were almost too high to meet. In fact on first viewing I thought the film was good but that in between the action sequences the pace was too slow and the acting not quite uptoscratch. However when seeing the film for a second time on a bigger screen and in the evening meaning I felt more relaxed and was able to get into the film more easily! I realised just how fantastic this movie is!

This was definitely not the case and I find it hard to believe that teenagers would like it either. Maybe it's for younger children.It would be interesting to see the reviewers' ages to find out whether it is young people who have given this film the ridiculously high scores that it has.For the record I am 30 and I watched it with my 23yearold fiance who also thought it was the worst film she'd seen for a long time.In short I recommend you not to watch this film.".

As he has only been in Thomas Brown School Days what he did a good job in to!! All actors and actresses were good like Ewan Mcgregor Sarah Bolger Alicia Silverstone Steven Fry and many more!! I enjoyed this film because it really gives the audience the feeling that he is an actual fourteen year old spy!

But lets not forget the uncle Ian rider played by Ewan McGregor for all of 3 minutes. His scene at the beginning of the film james bond beateris a breathtaking start and makes you believe the rest of the film will be as good as that.

He proves that he can either play a 'funny wacky' character but also a serious character that will touch the hearts of the viewers.

	schema:reviewBody "Owing to the fact that it is based on an Isaac Asimov story Bicentennial Man' turns out to be a more interesting and meaningful film than both its advertising campaign and its own opening section would indicate.  The caveat for those seeking out a fun film for the entire family is that this movie though initially sold as a warm cuddly comedy in the tradition of say Mrs. Doubtfire' actually deals with some very heavy and heady issues like sexuality aging and dying which may make it lessthanideal viewing for young children.The first section of the film is by far its weakest.  In 2005 the wealthy Martin family receives delivery of a brand new servant android Robin Williams who almost immediately begins to display a remarkable range of human emotions and interests.  Thus we are set up for yet another in a long line of predictable tales i.e. Harry and the Hendersons' Stuart Little' in which a family comes to adopt a strange notquitehuman creature welcoming him in as one of their own.  Indeed in the film's early stages there is no shortage of either bland humor or drippy sentimentality as Andrew the android ingratiates himself with all but one of the Martin household.  The wit' in the film consists basically of endless jokes about how Andrew takes all idioms at literal face value a running gag that is finally as unoriginal as it is wearying.Then however just as we are about to give up hope in it the movie becomes more intriguing.  Rather than staying within the context of the present life of this one family the screenplay begins to move ahead in time exploring Andrew's gradual growth toward total humanity while the initial family grows up and eventually dies off.  Actually despite how one may feel about the film itself one must admire its boldness and audacity for it is not often that in a film billed as a mass audience comedy all the main characters pass on to their heavenly reward at one point or another  but then again how many comedies span a two hundred year time period? Bicentennial Man' obviously has more on its mind than mere fishoutofwater buffoonery as it becomes an oftenelegiac reflection on the transience of life the meaning of being human and the search for societal acceptance.  The mood of the film is remarkably hushed and reflective at times which again might make it slow going for the modern mass audience more conditioned to a faster pace and giddier tone especially in a Robin Williams film though of late his films have certainly been taking on a much more somber quality vide What Dreams may Come' Patch Adams' and Jakob the Liar'.  There are times when Bicentennial Man' seems overly impressed with its own selfimportance yet one appreciates its refusal to settle for the easy path of cheap comedy and upbeat sentiments. There is indeed a real sadness to much of the film.Special acknowledgement should be made of the superb art direction set design costume design makeup and special effects that together give the film its understated and believable futuristic look.  In addition James Horner's melancholic symphonic score though a bit lubricious at times does create an atmosphere of contemplative seriousness that perfectly matches the tone and purpose of the film.Bicentennial Man' may not turn out to be what you are looking for when you first seek it out but if you approach it with an open mind and a certain degree of tolerance and indulgence you may be pleasantly surprised and perhaps even rewarded.".

This movie quite simply follows the life of a man trapped in a robots body and his quest to be accepted in the world and be allowed to love and cherish the people close to him.I have to say that i didn't expect much from this movie i thought it would be a kids film full of typical Robin Williams style laughs i was way off in my assumption. This is probably Robin Williams's best performance and it is a very emotional journey through change and development of the human condition.Overall the film is quite amusing very touching and is full of realistic characters all very well cast to not overshadow 'Andrew' as he quests over 200 years for acceptance.A great movie 910".

Some may complain that this movie is too long and slow but I would wager that their attention spans are somewhat lacking. If you are looking for a high action movie with robots then you have come to the wrong place. If you are looking for a scifi based romantic comedy about the personal growth of one man...er robot then this is the movie. The comedy was well written and well played appropriately placed in each moment. AS for the character of AndrewRobin Williams though he is supposed to be a robot you really connect with his character and sense his growth over time. Unlike A.I. his character learns and grows and has real not fabricated emotional attachments. I give this movie an 8 or 9. Very good.".

	schema:headline " The most underrated and misunderstood film ever made Simply Amazing";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is absolutely outstanding. Forget the reviews of the critics who seem to love bashing films this is a tremendous epic film with such a great heart that explores the values and meaning of humanity and life in general. I saw it for the first time in ages today and its still as touching as the first time I saw it a few years ago. In fact I remember it being shown on a plane I was on the year it came out and I watched the first 5 minutes on a screen with poor picture and sound and remember thinking it was just cheesy family comedy which just plays for humor and nothing else. When I first saw it a few years later when there was nothing else on I was completely blown away by it. It was the complete opposite of what I was thought it was originally. This film does have its humor and that humor is often hilarious in parts but thats because its delivered so brilliantly by Williams who plays his character to perfection. More importantly it is not supposed to be a comedy. Its a drama and features brilliant performances from an underrated cast including Williams Sam Neill Embeth Davditz and Oliver Platt among others.The film is also outstanding from a technical perspective. The futuristic cities buildings and vehicles look fabulous along with the new household appliances but the most important thing that really steals the show is the Script and Direction from Kazan and Columbus respectively. I will certainly be watching more of Kazan's films in the future and already thought he did a great job on Matilda beforehand. I've always been an admirer of Columbus and this has to be his best film to date. His vision of the film is splendid and I applaud him for bringing such a brilliant set of actors and sets together to make such an epic and unforgettable film.For most of my reviews for films I don't like commenting too much on the plot but here I feel the need to because it touched me so much and the plot helps explain why this happened. It is about a Robot that over 200 years learns about humanity and seeks to be a part of it. At the beginning its more of a comedy as the robot who's called Andrew gets used to the way humans are and learns about simple well known things in life i.e Laughter Sex Family Life and Change. But further on as he becomes close to the youngest in the family he learns more about love and how life is. I sympathised with him as he has to witness this and we follow him as he experiences the deaths of the people closest to him. I felt for him due to him being unable to experience these things like we do. Throughout the film I felt although the critics certainly didn't and many here probably don't all these things and became closer and closer to him as he constantly never gives up hope on becoming a human. I found it very emotional and I actually appreciated many of my abilities that I as a human have. To love to cry to experience changes to reproduce watch my children to grow up to get older and to eventually move onto another life. As Andrew learns about all these things and begins to want them I really did feel for him like I say because I would find it incredibly hard to live if I was like that.SPOILER Having witnessed the ups and downs of Andrew's life throughout the film and his epic journey to finally become a human being by the end of the film Andrew has managed to fully achieve this. He is fully human and unfortunately misses this declaration by a few seconds. But he didn't need to like his lover Porscha His closest family member's granddaughter says. He has done it. He has found the love he's wanted all those many years with her and he won't have to experience the sadness of watching things change ever again. He has moved onto another life like we're all destined to do and Porscha decides to join him. END OF SPOILERBasically after seeing this film I did learn just how lucky I am to possess all these extraordinary and unique abilities and I don't believe it is just an accident or coincidence. We each have a destiny and I believe God wants us all to experience these things in life and I'm grateful to be here today and will certainly not be taking any of them for granted.I really think that that this film with a rating of just 6.1 and with the harsh and very unfair criticism its got from critics has to be the most underrated misunderstood film ever made. The film is not really in my opinion a family comedy although it unfortunately has been marketed that way. Its a drama about humanity with bits of comedy that should be watched by anyone of any age. I believe it can help people to become like me much more grateful for things we as humans perhaps take for granted in life.I thank you for reading this review and advise you to watch this film and prepare to be moved in a way I don't think any film has done or ever could do.1010 Not my favourite film of all time but certainly in my Top 5. Stunning.".

The characters along the way are well acted  in particular the robot creator and his ditsy assistant. This movie is a tear jerker as Andrew's friends come and go and lifetimes pass him by without him really comprehending it all. The only real failings were the large gaps in time and how Andrew came about  but then it's difficult to compress 200 years into 1 12 hours. If you enjoyed Azimov's books as much as I did then this movie is for you. Far better in my opinion than IA or I Robot who also took their cues from Azimov.".

Rated PG for mild language and some sexrelated material By Blake FrenchChris Columbus is very good at directing tearjerkers. He has a history of constructing such movies as Stepmom and Mrs. Doubtfire. Bicentennial Man is being misadvertised as a humble family comedy. Although it starts out unsatisfying the film gradually becomes more and more penetrating as we discover the film is really about inner emotions  the changing of times how people change over time and the meaning of life from an original point of view. Bicentennial Man is a sweet touching production with lots of heart and a shapely message.At first Bicentennial Man looks  to be about a futuristic family who buys an android robot that is supposed to do housework and serve them. The family of four includes two children one named Little Miss and the parents who are called by the name of Sir and Ma'am. They adopt Andrew expecting him to be similar to all the other androids in the area. Nearly every household has one. However Sir soon notices certain features about Andrew that make him unique different from any other android he has ever seen. Andrew occupies creativity and emotional personality elements that these robots are presumed not to contain.The film doesn't contain a good an introduction to the family who adopts Andrew which is mainly the reason why I was never entirely concerned for the characters. But the reasoning behind the lack of focus on the family is due to the fact that Bicentennial Man isn't about the family who buys Andrew but a narrative of Andrew himself.A running flaw in the film is our foundering curiosity that only grows more ponderous as the script progresses. The audience desires more information about why Andrew is so different from the other robots. There are obvious reasons sure but what I wanted was an explanation of why he is special. A lust for information that is never appropriately granted.The film skips ahead a generation or so. Sir and Ma'am age and Little Miss grows to be a full grown woman. Many things change for Andrew. He begins to wonder what lies beyond the likes of his household. He longs for emotional reactions to take place on his face and the concept of freedom. Sir has taught Andrew about death sex love humor and time. He gradually wants more and more independence. This is where Andrew starts becoming interested in turning from a mechanical being to a biological being.The age advancing makeup is believable and aweinducing. I could hardly trust my eyes that Sam Neill wasn't an old man in the movie. However although I can see that the filmmakers had no other reliable option I disliked the jumps in time the it takes. The time gaps force us out of massive plot pieces some of which are important to the character development.There are some really funny moments in Bicentennial Man. Most of them appear when the picture becomes a bit emotionally heavy in order to relieve such tension in the audience. This is a wise choice in the writer's part the viewers who do mistake this movie as a family comedy will gain some satisfaction from these insulated humorous moments.   I wanted more information on how the robot Andrew gradually becomes ''human.'' I felt cheated out of a lot of decent noteworthy material here. I felt this way because the scenes where we do have the privilege to see Andrew reinvented are wonderfully inventive and interesting. The film should have leaned towards that material a little more. The movie features super charged performances by the entire cast. Robin Williams offers an emotionally accurate acting job that brings the confusion and imagination of the android Andrew to life. The supporting cast is also filled with fine performances with Sam Neill Wendy Crewson Embeth Davidtz and Oliver Platt.Even though I can admit that Bicentennial Man contains several flawed motives I still was a little surprised that the film opened to many negative reviews. This isn't a bad movie just a differently anticipated one. The movie sets up its effective conclusion from the very beginning it is the only logical climax for such a story. Although it leaves viewers with a sense of wellbeing I thought it posed too many spiritual and biological questions. Overall however the movie is a welldepicted idea that deserves more appreciation from audiences than its receiving.  Brought to you by Touchstone Pictures and Columbia Pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "After reading the mixed to negative reviews I was a bit worried that this film wouldn't be that great. But to my surprise I found that I couldn't disagree more with some of those reviews because this movie was really damn good. The performances are great the story is touching and well written the narrative is gripping and the premise is really well executed. The music score which isn't something I usually talk about is surprisingly great in this movie and is something worth noting. However despite this movie being a pleasant surprise I did find the script to be a bit messy at times. It isn't really that bad but there were times a few lines felt out of place andor kind of halfassed. Another thing I noticed is that this movie can drag on a bit too long in a few scenes which while it doesn't necessarily ruin this movie can still be a tad bit of an annoyance when you just want to know what happens next. Overall despite these few flaws this is one hell of a movie and the fact that so many people didn't enjoy it as much as I did kind of makes me sad as I genuinely think this is one of the smartest and most heart wrenching movies I've seen with Robin Williams as it does a good job of not only having a few funny moments but also having a lot of heart warming moments whether it be Andrew slowly becoming human or Andrew finally finding love. I thought this film was great and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet because while this is definitely not a perfect movie it is still in my opinion an underrated classic.".

	schema:headline " Isaac Asimov's classic Big Science scifi brought to film. Tearjerker. 710. SPOILERS!";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember Asimov's story far more emotionally but then I was a mere teenager when I first read Bicentennial Man. The short story has no expressed romance between Little Miss and Andrew Martin as there is in the movie and I'm sure it was better that way because that just heightened the pathos surely the very core of this story. Instead the film is forced to invent a lookalike granddaughter Portia in order to compensate for the robot's long lifespan. Cheesy. I was disappointed in this I have to admit. The reactions of the wifemother Ma'amWendy Crewson a wonderful actress under normal circumstances are especially irritating and frankly not believable. Women of all people would accept robots far more readily and respond to them emotionally. For exactly the same reason that Little Miss liked Andrew almost instantly any mother could and would musterat leastwarmth for him ESPECIALLY if he was as gentle with the children as Andrew clearly was. Remember Sarah Connor who decided that she would let The Terminator raise her one and only child because he would make the best father of all the candidates? Well if she could think like that despite being highly suspicious then why couldn't Ma'Am? It's crazy and not believable. The alwaysunderfoot syndrome too could've been handled with more subtlety or just minimalist comedy to show intelligent adjustment. Did the mother want to perform household chores herself or not? I completely fail to understand the woman's emotionalintellectual wherewithal ineptitude. Basically we're forced to conclude that except for Sir and Little Miss the rest of the family were lost causes. This despite that robots were supposed to be commonplace. This abysmal character development has to be inherent to the Nicholas Kazan screenplay we can't blame the unfortunate Wendy Crewson. The very same thing is wrong with AI2001. The mother again?! is even more insipid and daft. Such characters do test one's patience because they are such an obvious fraud for the sake of some plotdevelopment or other it is CLUMSY WRITING.The Martins actually had a helpful and an astonishingly verbally adroit android compared to current technology amazingly wellsocialized into the family. He was safe for them and in his own way funny courteous smart talented and permanently so! I'd trade him in for any of my last three boyfriends. Why wouldn't any of these people come to terms with Andrew? Ridiculous.Perhaps the problem was that Chris Columbus et al waited too long to make the movie. Other scifis like Terminator1984 in fact had already surpassed Asimov's notions about humanity's political incapacity and rejection of androidsrobots. We've also suffered through Idon'tknowhowmany court cases about android rights on Star Trek and the Voyager Doctor's frankly irritating harping about hologram rights ad nauseam so that declaring a robot as in fact human is no longer such a biggie. That had been the guts of the original 1976 story but audiences are now far too sophisticated  watched 14yrs of Star Trek! Viewers interested in more Asimov robot stories should read I Robot and The Rest of the Robots. They are excellent short stories. What I think happened was that certain contractual obligations about moviemaking and particularly this script may have gotten in the way of creative output eg the option was about to run out and since the CGI technology was OK it was now or never. We may have ended up with an outevolved turkey because of the business being not showart. I don't know that this is what happened but it sounds plausible to me. The Three really Four Asimov added another one Laws of Robotics is a very good place to start robot ethics they are not in debate. The hard part about making Andrew real would be socializing him to the degree he was in the movie. That's what we still can't do. We can't teach context. That's the stumbling block. Neural nets do their learning usually with human cheating called backpropagation  don't ask I always thought the technique completely disreputable so I cringed and winced may way through 7 years of Data's pride in his own neural net on STNG. But context requires generalization into abstracts from the concrete and then reversing back again and the mapping onto the real world has to be accurate 95 of the time. So it's a whole new kettle of fish. Roger Schank modularized layers of contexts as individual nested subroutines and called them schemas which a computer could simulate. But you just couldn't schematizedigitize enough of reality it takes too much room. The human brain excels at filling in blanks based on this bidirectional mapping of the essential  the generalized. Computers and robots suck at this. They have no real life experience to guess with. They need a background library the size of a planet to carry around just to take a walk in the park. Which is why Andrew Martin is so impressive. So. Wherefore art thou Bicentennial Man? Perhaps Rodney Brooks bottomup architecture with Cog Kismet needs to team up with Doug Lenat CYClist topdown architecture handcodes reality one step at a time so they can hit paydirt somewhere in the middle. That they should join forces is EXTREMELY unlikely they are both using diametrically opposed concepts and code. The other possibility is that Honda will beat them to it with their humanshaped white robot that walks up stairs. Otherwise Bicentennial Man may be another couple of centuries away. Growing up is aardvark hard work.".

The Martin family have just got their own robot and decide to call him Andrew. It seems as if the Father is the only one that really likes having Andrew around one child is scared of it the other hates it. And the Mother seems very uncomfortable with Andrew around. One night the oldest daughter causes Andrew to brake himself. And from then on Andrew shows signs of intelligence. Is this machine capable of intelligence and human emotions?Andrew quickly becomes apart of the family. Bonding mostly with the Father 'Sir' and the youngest daughter Little Miss'.The film follows the 'life' of Andrew and the humans around him. The family grow up and get older but Andrew of course stays the same. The first time jump is amazing.I must mention the makeup costumes and the sets. As the film is set over a long time period the humans age. And what a job the makeup artists did! Sometimes you feel as if the movie was made over a long period of time and the actors aged naturally! As the film is set in the future the clothes have changed slighty from the present. Most of the clothes aren't that typical future clothing stereotype of white or silver jump suits thank goodness!. The clothes look futuristic without being over the top. The sets are a real treat later in the movie. I especially liked the set in the last scene. Somehow it feels like something Kubrick would do. The special effects are also wonderful. Look out for some American icons spruced up in the future. Amazing!I felt this movie was rather poorly marketed. It seems as if it was being sold as a comedy and a children's movie. Firstly while there are a lot of funny moments I wouldn't really call it a comedy. And it doesn't seem like a kids movie either. I was also surprised to hear the s word used a few times.The film starts of a little slow but give it a chance it gets better with time. I particularly enjoyed Robin Williams performance although everyone put in a good job.If I have a complaint it would be the portrayal of the oldest daughter. It felt to me like a very stereotypical 'brat' character. Also the character of Portia seemed to change to quickly.810".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm giving it 6 stars because when the movie tries to be interesting it definitely succeeds. Unfortunately when it tries to be anything else it rather flunks out.For me Robin Williams is the kiss of death to any movie. That sherbetlemonsucker's smilingwithpain I'vegotmyheartonmysleeve expression is just a bit too much of a good thing. I liked him in 'Good Morning Vietnam.' The idea and his character worked well there. Unfortunately since then he seems to have been typecast. Every subsequent role he has played has entailed a bigger and bigger bag of sherbet lemons. Lachrymosity has become his trademark.The coming of selfawareness amongst robots  or at least computers  is a concept which has been evaluated in any number of movies and with every kind of prognosis. Though I still suspect it will catch us largely unprepared both socially and morally when it happens. Here Williams plays a robot that is different in some indefinable way. And  indulged by its kindly owner who gives it evergreater latitude  the thing embarks upon a journey of selfrealisation. It has difficulty coming to terms with the passage of time. Humans grow up and grow old while the robot remains constant unaffected by age. This area of the story is wellhandled but when the robot wants to become more human and when it starts to fancy its owner's younger child the scenario becomes rather inept and also slightly sinister. There are overtones of 'Demon Seed' 1977. But  Hey you can see what'll happen a mile away it's going to BECOME human in the end. And you know it will succeed because this is Robin Williams Captain Lachrymosity and if he doesn't get his own way he will almost certainly weep till he rusts. This scenario requires a progressive suspension of belief both at his increasingly improbable and bizarre modifications and the attitudes of commerce and law. Handled more objectively  which means a little more cruelly  the story could have been a bit more believable but then it would have called for a part that Mr Williams manifestly cannot play without him I'd have awarded at least another star. But the thing must stumble on for his sake if no other to its ultimate and implausible conclusion.The evaluation of affection is particularly strange.

	onyx:emotionText "I'm giving it 6 stars because when the movie tries to be interesting it definitely succeeds. Unfortunately when it tries to be anything else it rather flunks out.For me Robin Williams is the kiss of death to any movie. That sherbetlemonsucker's smilingwithpain I'vegotmyheartonmysleeve expression is just a bit too much of a good thing. I liked him in 'Good Morning Vietnam.' The idea and his character worked well there. Unfortunately since then he seems to have been typecast. Every subsequent role he has played has entailed a bigger and bigger bag of sherbet lemons. Lachrymosity has become his trademark.The coming of selfawareness amongst robots  or at least computers  is a concept which has been evaluated in any number of movies and with every kind of prognosis. Though I still suspect it will catch us largely unprepared both socially and morally when it happens. Here Williams plays a robot that is different in some indefinable way. And  indulged by its kindly owner who gives it evergreater latitude  the thing embarks upon a journey of selfrealisation. It has difficulty coming to terms with the passage of time. Humans grow up and grow old while the robot remains constant unaffected by age. This area of the story is wellhandled but when the robot wants to become more human and when it starts to fancy its owner's younger child the scenario becomes rather inept and also slightly sinister. There are overtones of 'Demon Seed' 1977. But  Hey you can see what'll happen a mile away it's going to BECOME human in the end. And you know it will succeed because this is Robin Williams Captain Lachrymosity and if he doesn't get his own way he will almost certainly weep till he rusts. This scenario requires a progressive suspension of belief both at his increasingly improbable and bizarre modifications and the attitudes of commerce and law. Handled more objectively  which means a little more cruelly  the story could have been a bit more believable but then it would have called for a part that Mr Williams manifestly cannot play without him I'd have awarded at least another star. But the thing must stumble on for his sake if no other to its ultimate and implausible conclusion.The evaluation of affection is particularly strange. This robot seems able to transfer its preference from daughter to granddaughter at the drop of a hat which surely cheapens the very sincerity for which it supposedly strives. Further whilst the robot may indeed have a uniquely intuitive glitch how did it identify with its own sexuality? Intelligence and sexual identity are two completely different issues.

Tread carefully.Like most other reviewers I could not help but notice how perfect the future was yet how much it resembled the 20th century. However all that IMO is irrelevant to the plot.Now I haven't read Asimov's book as a matter of fact I had no idea this movie was based on a book till I logged on to IMDb but even if I had I wouldn't go in with the highest expectations knowing how Hollywood mucks things up.My parents who have already watched this film praised it quite highly but my sister trashed it as boring. I went in with mediocre expectations particularly because I don't have much affinity for movies dealing with artificial intelligence.I was pleasantly surprised by the plot. Perhaps it's just me but I really felt I could actually relate to the robot. I didn't care that it was Robin Williams. I didn't care the future was totally unrealistic. In a sense I think I related to Andrew because of my personality I'm awkward in social situations and am always utterly agreeable.I probably fell for the plot like a sucker but I liked falling for it. Whatever superficial goofs the movie made were more than made up for me by the story which I found brilliantly beautiful. I really cannot think of adjectives that would sufficiently describe it but.... it's just something that really appealed to me.Besides the similarities I found between myself and Andrew I think I was also touched by many elements of the plot independence freedom recognition a spurned love... And the philosophical issues most imperatively. I've always enjoyed pondering the moral issues surrounding robots immortality and so on. I think that's probably what drew me in. Watching the people Andrew loved die was probably the part of the film that touched me most because I'm a very nostalgic person at heart  I love recalling past incidents people I knew... and I felt Andrew's pain at losing the people he loved most.A lot of reviewers criticised this movie for its unrealistic portrayal of the future its failure to properly adapt Asimov's book from what I've heard about it it does sound like a great pity as the book seems more powerful hell even the music played.But none of that stuff really matters to me. The story was quite philosophical with all the touches of sentimentality that make me melt like butter in a frying pan. This movie is probably one of the most touching and brilliant dramas I've watched outdoing A Beautiful Mind my previous most favourite drama. Neither films are without flaws but the stories which is what a movie is about are beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "When this film was released 18 days before the turn of the century it was hurt at the box office by two nearly fatal blows. The first was the temporary backlash against Robin Williams at the time for his performance in the manipulative Patch Adams. The second was the onslaught of reviews that called it schmaltzy and overlysentimental. Well I never found it to be that way. If you want to watch a horribly manipulative and sentimental emotional rape then checkout the other ColumbusWilliams movie Mrs. Doubtfire. I'd rather throw myself into the path of an oncoming combine harvester than watch that again.The film opens in 2005 the near future at the time as Mr. Martin Sam Neill a wealthy businessman has a robot servant delivered to his luxurious home. As soon as the robot is powered up he seems to be...different. His name is Andrew which means man or manly and while his body may be robotic his personality is not. In fact he very slowly develops and learns human characteristics as he interacts and responds to the world around him.Mr. Martin is astonished by Andrew's ability to understand art and music. He treats him like a member of the family and educates him by the fire every night on the customs and history of mankind. As the years pass and lives fade away Andrew setsoff on a decadeslong journey to find other robots like him. The quest ends when he meets Rupert Burns Oliver Platt a robotics engineer who turns Andrew from a simple robot into a lifelike android. Upon returning home with his new appearance he falls in love with his old master's greatgranddaughter who is an exact double of her grandmother. They want to be with each other so badly but know they will never be accepted by society unless Andrew can become fully human. Which is impossible.Or is it? It's a question for the atheists and religious zealots to fight over. At what point does Andrew develop a soul? Why is he different from other robots? Did God give him the gift of human emotion? It is a cosmic selection or is it up to the World Council to declare Andrew human? It all builds to a heartbreaking ending that is honestly one of the toughest movie endings I have ever had to sit through. I can't even write about it so I'll end my description here.This is familiar territory for Williams though. His performance as Mork learning about Earth and marrying a human woman is rather close to Andrew Martin's journey to become a man. And although I wouldn't call it a kid's film or even a comedy there are still a lot of laughs. But not in the usual anarchic Williams style. Andrew's curiosity of the world is a much more refined and quieter performance. It's a shame that most people can't see that it's Williams inside the suit for the first hour of the film as it makes us forget he's there on the screen and perhaps appreciate his acting ability less.James Horner's score is also simply wonderful. It's hard to believe the man who gave us the storming action sound of Commando and Aliens could also be capable of something so warm and beautiful. I guess they didn't give him the award for Titanic for nothing. For this movie he again teamedup with Celine Dion to record the song Then You Look At Me which is the perfect tune to roll the credits to. I don't care what you think about me I love it. Even if the lyrics make that ending even more harrowing.Despite going as far ahead as the year 2205 there's no utopia or dystopia subtext to distract us from the story of Andrew's life. The evolution of technology and architecture is handled subtly and is unobtrusive. It's a quirky irony though that Andrew's inventions and discoveries help save lives and forward the human race despite not being fully human himself.Bicentennial Man is certainly the most mature and subversive film of Chris Columbus' career as a director. As I said not a kid's film but a masterpiece of sciencefiction and character drama. How anyone could ever truly hate this film is beyond me.".

The stuff in that movie I got really interested in because I'm a television major and i'm taking courses that are based on what they used to make this film and thanks to that it's actually getting me upto the point of graduating sometime soon. even though i know i started college 6 years ago but when i started watching it i started to get the feel for the movie and thats how i was able to pass computer art 2d and the rest of my TV classes then. but now since it's been years since i've seen it i haven't passed much of anything but now come to think of it i'll go back to watching it again. and for any of u guys that are TV majors and are about to take science or new developments or anything that is based on robotics or any kind of science work like they used for this movie i'd recommend first to check with your advisors to see if this movie will help u guys with your assignments for classes and if so go either rent this movie or better yet because u'll need it for the rest your entire college learning buy the movie. it's worth watching. i have to give an award to chris columbus for making this movie and thanks to him and robin williams this has been helping me pass classes and now i'm at the greatest danger of graduating the community college.";

So let me say straight off if you are the sort of person who didn't like Inception because it made no sense or the sort of person who didn't like The Matrix Trilogy because it made no sense or indeed the sort of person who didn't like any of David Lynch's films because ahem NONE OF THEM MAKE ANY SENSE...in short if you are an incurable pedant you will not enjoy this film and you might as well stop reading this review. Seriously stop reading don't watch the film and go calculate Pi or something.If however you have an appreciation for tightlyedited emotionally engaging aesthetically pleasing cinema with a brilliant soundtrack and at times breathless pacing please allow me to take a few minutes of your time.Hanna is the story of a teenage girl who lives in total isolation with her father. She has vague memories of her mother and these memories combined with her literally encyclopedic knowledge fuel her desire to leave the relative safety of her father's protection in the frozen hinterland of northern Finland.In a way I don't want to say any more than that. If you've read the other reviews on this site that give away more then I'm very sorry for you but if not then suffice it to say that her father's motivation for keeping her in this state of isolation appears to be protection combined with a desire to train her in survivalassassination skills in preparation for...well that would be telling. Of course you don't need me to tell you that she leaves her father's protection and the story proper begins. As Chekov said One must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if noone is thinking of using it and boy does that rifle get used. Saoirse Ronan is brilliant as Hanna. At times seemingly invincible at others pathetically vulnerable owing to her complete inexperience of the world. We see the world from her unique perspective as she struggles to understand nonfamiliar interaction the natural ease of recreation and even the basic electrical appliances that we all take for granted.The story moves us from one location to the next painting a rich tapestry of colour and culture whilst simultaneously and somewhat comically contrasting Hanna's desperate need to traverse these territories with the bourgeoisie's seeming obsession with experiencing as many of them as possible.The acting is solid throughout. The only truly great performance comes from Ronan but Tom Hollander Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana all turn out good performances that serve the picture well.However the true credit for this film has to be laid at the feet of Joe Wright. None of his previous films could possibly prepare you for Hanna. Wright's mastery of both a tight intricate plot such as in Atonement combined with his incredible skill in making this beautiful thoughtful actionpacked coming of age story mark him out as a director of real class.It is true that Hanna suffers from a few plot holes but that plot is delivered in such an appealing exciting and aboveall entertaining film that anyone who isn't compiling continuity errors for some godawful TV programme that relishes in the fact that THIS ISN'T REAL LIFE IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY A FILM!! should have a blast letting this film take them along for the ride. If you want reality watch a documentary. If you want a very good fiction watch Hanna.".

	schema:headline " Starts off as a good film but ends up as a handful of good ideas poorly strung together.";
	schema:reviewBody "Once upon a time there was a little girl called Hanna Saoirse Ronan who was raised in a forest by her father Erik Eric Bana. As an exCIA agent Erik taught Hanna everything she needed hunting armed and unarmed combat and all the languages in the world. One day Hanna was sent out of the forest to assassinate Marissa Wiegler Cate Blanchett the woman who murdered her mother.Joe Wright's latest feature is modernday fairytale that is part revengeflick part coming ofage drama. Like his last effort 'The Soloist' 'Hanna' has some very good ideas that are let down by bad decisions and occasionally overpowering direction. The film certainly has a very strong beginning. The concept of a killer child may be screwed up but this is offset by the curiosity it arouses. Why has Erik raised Hanna in this manner? Who is this woman they want to kill and why did she become their enemy?The storytelling is tight intentionally dripfed which keeps the focus on the moment and makes the assassination plan more dramatic. Well for the first 45 minutes. After that Hanna sees the wider world for the first time and becomes distracted  which is both good and bad.On one hand it allows some insight into the effects of Hanna's blinkered upbringing. Having grown up killing her own breakfast and making her own fire she is not prepared for her journey through the modern world. Seeing her flick light switches on and off in awe is one of several touching moments which add a human side to what could have become another soulless gun movie.However Wright doesn't know when to pull back on the sentimentality. The film hits its low point when Hanna hitches a ride with a stuckup English hippy family which is meant to contrast the lonely limited nature of Hanna's upbringing. Ironically this family is even more dysfunctional than Hanna and Erik and only succeeds in making Hanna's journey more irrelevant.Her meticulous plan somehow becomes selfindulgent fauxart featuring slowmotion Flamenco dancing. The film goes so offcourse that it is questionable whether there was a plan in the first place. Is the story intentionally dripfed or is there just not very much to tell? For a child raised specifically to kill Hanna doesn't end up doing very much.That's not to say that there isn't any action. There are a handful of set pieces and they are a delight to behold. From a fight in a subway to a chase through a labyrinthine cargo yard the action is wonderfully shot and expertly edited. Long tracking shots allow for a high level of clarity and immersion. Even this however is sometimes ruined with overenergetic camerawork turning the film into a music video.Saoirse Ronan is a good action star throwing herself into her fight scenes with zeal but her real strength is her acting. On one hand she seems so genuinely lethal that it's a little scary. At the same time she has a delicate innocent aura that makes it hard not to feel sorry for her. This is a layered performance that transcends the generic labelling of 'good' or 'evil'.'Hanna' is not flawed but sabotaged. Ronan is superb and the action is fantastic but even this is not enough to put the film back on course after Joe Wright steered it in the wrong direction. It started off as a good film but ended up as a handful of good ideas poorly strung together.".

So I put the disc in with mixed expectations and afterwards I sat glued to the credits thinking what was their problem?! Truly a beautiful film. Don't set out expecting an action packed badass picture I think that was the problem with most of the negative reviewers. Though not as frequent as your everyday action film the action scenes are just as exciting as ever.

	schema:headline " Wow was this a waste of money";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was derivative of many other films including Soldier Resident Evil with little new in the way of plot. The immoral CIA creates a program in which they are attempting to genetically create the perfect soldier by fooling with the DNA of embryos. When the experiment proves successful huh..? Why shut down a successful program..? it is decided for unknown reasons to end the project and terminate all those involved. Eric Bana the CIA field agent who recruited the women for the experiment has a change of heart and tries to save one woman and her child. For no particular reason except to give Hanna a reason to want revenge later on the mother is killed by Kate Blanchett and Eric Bana escapes with the infant. Bana raises Hanna as his own in an arctic cabin without electricity or modern conveniences in order to prepare her for the day that she has to face the CIA and their henchmen. The day finally arrives when Hanna decides that she is ready. Bana digs up a transponder he had buried and places it in front of Hanna quipping that once the switch is flipped it can't be undone. Since there is no electricity in the cabin and in fact Hanna has never seen an electric light the method by which Bana got a battery to operate after over 14 years is never explained. Bana leaves Hanna alone to be captured by the dastardly CIA operatives. He did this apparently in order for Hanna to kill Kate Blanchett. Why he doesn't take Hanna with him instead of leaving her to be taken by the CIA is left unexplained. Hanna is brought to an underground holding cell the size of the Superbowl in Morocco.Strangely Morocco looks a lot like the desert southwest of the US. Naturally Hanna is more than a handful for the loutish CIA operatives and manages to escape through the ubiquitous airconditioning vents which just happen to be her size. She makes her way to the surface and just as she is looking out of a vast desert vista in broad daylight Hummvees start driving directly over her head apparently oblivious to the fact that there is an open submarine door in their path. As the last Hummvee passes the hole is shown as empty clearly showing that Hanna has managed to take hold of the undercarriage of the last vehicle as it passed at 50 mph where she hangs on similar to Robert De Niro as Max Cady in the 1991 film Cape Fear. Too bad nobody told the director about this same treatment by the Simpsons with Sideshow Bob. I'm sure I'm not the only one surprised by the location of Morocco for this CIA detention cell instead of somewhere in the US. It becomes obvious later on when Hanna has the opportunity to show off her dexterity with languages which wouldn't have come up in the US quite so easily. Also since it was decided by the Director to have the final fight scene in an amusement park in Germany the CIA detention center had to be someplace from which Hanna could conceivably get to Germany without a passport or any ID.At one point in the film Eric Bana picks up a post card at a post office apparently where they've been holding his mail for the past 14 years and there's a postcard from Hanna telling him in code she has killed Kate Blanchett which is unfortunately incorrect. How she bought the stamp mailed the postcard or knew which post office Bana would be near is unexplained. The fact that all of this action takes place in a matter of a few days makes the idea that a post card can get from Morocco or Spain to Germany in that amount of time laughable to anyone who has lived overseas.There are several editing or continuity errors like when Hanna kills the reindeer with a bow and arrow but then guts a reindeer of approximately half the size and then brings the originally sized reindeer home on a sleigh apparently having made the sleigh from the raw materials by hand.The choice of where and when to use blood spatter effects is also interesting. Hanna gets her face splashed when shooting people and the picture in front of grandma gets covered when Kate Blanchett kills her again for no reason but the reindeer is remarkably without blood even though Hanna is in the process of gutting it.If you can willingly suspend your disbelief for this film then you really have no disbelief to suspend.The story is derivative the characters are two dimensional and without motivation the lines are full of clichs and the violence is unrealistic. Eric Bana is supposed to be the Zen like trainer of Hanna but he can't seem to handle a Aryan Brotherhood with a knife. I suppose 12 year old girls will like the scene where Hanna flips a Spanish boy who tries to kiss her but her reactions were closer to that of someone suffering from antisocial personality disorder than of a normal teenager.The fact that Hanna kills people for little or no reason would seem to suggest that she is in fact meant to be characterized as a serial killer except that she announces to Eric Bana that she doesn't want to hurt anyone anymore when all she really needs to do is to stop hurting people.I found it disconcerting that Eric Bana had spent 14 or so years training Hanna to kill everything that moves when the CIA was unaware of his or her actual existence. He could just as easily have changed his name and raised Hanna on a ranch in Idaho or a tenement in the South Bronx but then there wouldn't have been as much of a story as such.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film was derivative of many other films including Soldier Resident Evil with little new in the way of plot. The immoral CIA creates a program in which they are attempting to genetically create the perfect soldier by fooling with the DNA of embryos. When the experiment proves successful huh..? Why shut down a successful program..? it is decided for unknown reasons to end the project and terminate all those involved. Eric Bana the CIA field agent who recruited the women for the experiment has a change of heart and tries to save one woman and her child. For no particular reason except to give Hanna a reason to want revenge later on the mother is killed by Kate Blanchett and Eric Bana escapes with the infant. Bana raises Hanna as his own in an arctic cabin without electricity or modern conveniences in order to prepare her for the day that she has to face the CIA and their henchmen. The day finally arrives when Hanna decides that she is ready. Bana digs up a transponder he had buried and places it in front of Hanna quipping that once the switch is flipped it can't be undone. Since there is no electricity in the cabin and in fact Hanna has never seen an electric light the method by which Bana got a battery to operate after over 14 years is never explained. Bana leaves Hanna alone to be captured by the dastardly CIA operatives. He did this apparently in order for Hanna to kill Kate Blanchett. Why he doesn't take Hanna with him instead of leaving her to be taken by the CIA is left unexplained. Hanna is brought to an underground holding cell the size of the Superbowl in Morocco.Strangely Morocco looks a lot like the desert southwest of the US. Naturally Hanna is more than a handful for the loutish CIA operatives and manages to escape through the ubiquitous airconditioning vents which just happen to be her size. She makes her way to the surface and just as she is looking out of a vast desert vista in broad daylight Hummvees start driving directly over her head apparently oblivious to the fact that there is an open submarine door in their path. As the last Hummvee passes the hole is shown as empty clearly showing that Hanna has managed to take hold of the undercarriage of the last vehicle as it passed at 50 mph where she hangs on similar to Robert De Niro as Max Cady in the 1991 film Cape Fear. Too bad nobody told the director about this same treatment by the Simpsons with Sideshow Bob. I'm sure I'm not the only one surprised by the location of Morocco for this CIA detention cell instead of somewhere in the US. It becomes obvious later on when Hanna has the opportunity to show off her dexterity with languages which wouldn't have come up in the US quite so easily.

	schema:reviewBody "What is Hanna? it certainly isn't what I thought it'd be. At all. Chances are it isn't like anything you've seen before. Weird wild and beautiful it's Jason Bourne by way of the Brothers Grimm David Lynch by way of Hans Christian Andersen Luc Besson and Tom Tykwer by way of huntsmen evil witches and big bad wolves. It doesn't hesitate it hurtles along. It doesn't flinch it charges. It prowls and pounces haunts and disarms. It has a pulse a heartbeat a rhythm. It roars. It cackles. It sings a lullaby. It hums. It whistles. And really you should stop reading right there. The joy is in the discovery as they say and Hanna is best served with as few expectations as possible. Whether you ultimately find it baffling or bewitching is frankly beside the point. It's well worth watching  experiencing rather  and you'll be hard pressed to deny the thrill of such a bizarre breathtaking ride. Once upon a time there was a very special girl named Hanna Heller Saoirse Ronan. Since she was twoyearsold Hanna has lived in the secluded forests of Finland with her father Erik Eric Bana. There she's learned to survive hunt fight... and kill. When she turns sixteen her father decides she's ready to hear the truth and to be presented with a choice continue living in seclusion or flip a switch on a dormant tracking device and alert a vindictive CIA chief Marissa Wiegler Cate Blanchett to her whereabouts. It seems Marissa has been searching for Erik and Hanna since she failed to assassinate the pair fourteen years ago and Hanna is all too anxious to meet the woman who murdered her mother and sent her father into hiding. The choice is simpler than Erik had hoped. Hanna flips the switch the moment he steps away from the cabin. And then? Then all hell breaks loose. Hanna captured and taken to a CIA facility in Morocco kills a woman she believes is Wiegler steals intel about her true origins escapes into the desert and hitches a ride with a family of tourists bound for Germany where she plans to rendezvous with her father. But she'll have to stay one step ahead of Marissa in a strange alien world of television traffic and the internet and dodge the CIA witch's fiends led by the maniacal Isaacs Tom Hollander.Hanna leaps over vast genre chasms with the grace of the fully realized darkfantasy action thriller hybrid it is. Director Joe Wright has created something so wholly in tune with his vision so true to its own delirious delights and hardhitting flights of fancy that it floats high above the Hollywood fray. It begins simply enough explodes soon thereafter and then slowly reveals its secrets and intentions with meticulous precision descending into increasingly offbeat grotesque territory only after enchanting viewers with its siren call. Wright pushes sure. But he knows exactly how much to push his audience at any given moment. He challenges convention but knows just how much pressure to apply. He demands a lot of those watching the film for the first time but never more than they should be able to bear. And Hanna is even better on repeat viewings. His madhatter action opera doesn't overwhelm or overreach it hypnotizes mesmerizes and casts a spell with fierce fist fights comingofage tenderness cruel villains audaciously long tracking shots complete with brawls sans cutaways or cheap edits dazzling photography and organic electronica from The Chemical Brothers no less. Ronan doesn't buckle beneath the weight of Hanna or Hanna and approaches every scene with the same killer instinct her adolescent assassin approaches an assailant. Wright and Ronan seem acutely aware of how easily the film could plummet over the edge and adapt or die accordingly creating a young protagonist both beyond her years and subject to childlike awe. Hanna squeals with girlish excitement at the sight of a passing plane mere moments after gutting a deer and battling her father on a frozen lake. Elsewhere Blanchett gobbles down helpless scenes with toothy vehemence and devilish zeal she's the Wicked Stepmother the Foul Enchantress and the Evil Queen Hollander licks his deranged chops and bears his fangs with sick pleasure and Bana brandishes his best Bana  the somber but soulful soldier  and lends balance to an eccentric ensemble. The travelers Hanna joins  a family played with flaky bohemian funk by Jason Flemyng Olivia Williams and kinetic ball of energy Jessica Barden  may be the straw that crack some filmfans' backs but their presence is only jarring initially and only the first time through. Further viewings and a bit of patience illuminate their true purpose  no wandering fairy tale princess would be complete without a band of quirky creatures and peculiar new friends be they dwarfs talking forest denizens or free spirited European hippies  and make them every bit as essential to Hanna as anything else. It's through her temporary surrogate family that she learns things her father neglected to teach her for reasons that become painfully clear as the film nears its endgame.But not everyone will be so forgiving. Hanna is a divisive genrebender that will infuriate as many cinephiles as it entrances. Even if you and I typically see eye to eye we may not this time around. Wright's fourth feature film defies expectation and explanation and must be seen to be believed. It may not ensnare you but it'll sink its claws in for two spellbinding hours. Hanna will probably make its way onto my Top Ten list this year and it will undoubtedly find its way onto some of your lists as well albeit as one of the Worst Films of 2011. You'll just have to brave its dark demented forests to find out.".

She's a ruthlessly trained assassin by her secret agent dad and with a blonde disguise over her ginger genes she easily passes for a modern day example of the Hitler Youth.Saoirse Ronan plays the lead role with a quiet intensity that echoes the character she played in Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones. But in Hanna she's not so much ethereal as she is lethal. Eric Bana plays her warm father who has the same concerns for his little girl as any dad  he wants her to be able to defend herself and survive in a world that's out to get her.Cate Blanchett is a mother of sorts  mother to the subversive operation of destroying the fatherdaughterkillertagteam. But to me she looked like Julia Gillard on a ruthless rampage to restore order to a chaotic world surrounded by unreliably competent underlings.The real success of this movie is director Joe Wright's ability to use every prop and every location in a highly provocative and meaningful way. Playgrounds are dangerous and decayed snow is beautiful but unkind daddies show they care by playing rough and demanding excellence and daughters murder then apologise for not doing it as well as they should have. The loss of childhood innocence would be tragic if it even existed in the first place.Even the support cast and extras are homeless baseless and nomadic like the leads. Everyone is on the move or on the run. But there is no escape.I love wonderfully choreographed handtohand combat action sequences and there are quite a few in Hanna  but I long for the day directors will return to holding wider shots so we can actually see the fighting take place. The constant rush of mid shots and closeups with fast cutting detracts from a truly emotive fight sequence. Look at the footage of the beating of Rodney King  shot by an amateur  but you can't go past it for emotion. Hold a shot and you force the audience to watch. Every cut is a blink. And once the audience blinks  the emotional buildup is halted. Another great example of a terrifically shot fight sequence is in Coppola's The Godfather. Watch the unbridled fury in James Caan as Sonny as he gets increasingly carried away with bashing his brotherinlaw. We get vital spatial awareness thanks to wide shots held long enough to turn us into gobsmacked witnesses. Now that's how you shoot a bashing sequence! Hanna has the menace of A Clockwork Orange and the inevitable pathos of Nikita while providing another example of what we are doing to destroy ourselves and our future. There are plenty of films about little girls whose circumstances and parenting options prevent them from being little girls for long  The Professional Kick Ass and even Sucker Punch to some extent. But Hanna is the broken heart of modern youth from a broken family in a broken world that has cultivated a culture of making things that break then breaking them and throwing them all away like they didn't even matter in the first place.Is Hanna a metaphor for raising a child in the postmodern world? What exactly do we need to teach our kids in terms of coping mechanisms and life skills? Is emotion now secondary to instinct and is that an insidiously smarter more efficient way to live? We never really grow up. We just get bigger like the responsibilities heaped upon us. Our lives are terminally spent on swings and roundabouts in a spiralling state of disrepair so that playing games become less and less fun. And we all witness the mutilation of our childhood by the process of becoming older and socalled wiser.If you haven't guessed it by now Hanna isn't a cheery film. It's a grim fairytale.Or maybe it's me. Chances are I've murdered my own childhood years ago. And what this movie has done is take me back there to identify the body.It's worth seeing on the big screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't super hyped to see this when I first saw the trailer to this in theater but it got me intrigued. Especially how it goes in a direction where a little girl doing action sequences didn't seem lame at all in fact some sequences was pretty darn cool. They way it reveals what is going on bit by bit was nicely done without giving away exactly and completely what the movie is about in the beginning. Good character driven movie with some good action sequences with a slight artistic cinematography. What is great about this movie is that it isn't just straight forward action movie. Even the soundtrack doesn't have the typical generic action movie style soundtrack in fact the soundtrack is great. The masses might find this movie to be a bit awkward because it doesn't have the generic action movie feel to it. The plot isn't spectacular but somewhat absorbing. Saoirse Ronan was sometimes mesmerizing with her acting and I buy into her situation in the movie while she was playing Hanna and I wouldn't be shocked if there is a bright future for her in the acting business. However if your one of those audiences that is expecting constant action might be left disappointed. But when it comes to action it shows that you don't need a lot of CGI to make some cool action sequences. And the movie might be a bit slow at times especially in the middle but overall it's a character driven movie with action in it that is worth seeing. It's a simple story but has just enough substance.7.810".

There fat out of shape and more like clockwork orange hoodlums that couldn't win a bar fight let alone beat a superior fighting hybrid! If all the hybrids for a lack of a better word had to be 'terminated' and Hanna was the last left think about this... here's Kate keeping up with her in heels! chasing her and Hanna was not able to put distance between them? The point is If that's all the hybrid can do WHY does the U.S. have to see her dead? Obviously she's not all that bloody superior if that old British broad is out thinking her! And how do the clockwork orange goons ever find her in Morrocco? Was that the ONLY seedy little joint in the whole country that the lugs somehow knew that's the one she'd be at?

When Eric fights the 3 guys in the vacant space when the thugs after incredible hesitations finally do decide to fire their weapon Eric had time to through one of them into the line of fire and throwing a knife to kill the gunmen.

The point is If that's all the hybrid can do WHY does the U.S. have to see her dead? Obviously she's not all that bloody superior if that old British broad is out thinking her!

There are just too many mistakes and holes. Hanna is a 16 year old ANOREXICLOOKING supposed genetic super human. Right away you know the casting is all wrong. She looks so weak. Sometimes she kills commandos immediately and then other times she fights with skinhead caricatures for hours it seems. Silly stuff. To view this film's comments use the hated it filter. I think the film's cast and backers shamelessly used IMDb.com for their selfish untrue and dishonest promotion of the film. No one with half a brain would recommend this film. There are plot holes which should anger you. Also we are never told why she has to die or why the skinny little girl is a threat to US security. Why does she look longingly lesbianlike into her new friend's eyes as they are lying in bed together? What happens to that girl and her family? We are not told. What did her fosterfather ever do to deserve such treatment from her at the end? He then sacrifices his life for her! She has knowledge of everything in the world but acts like one of the Beverly Hillbillies when it comes to turning on a light or using electric appliances but then she just walks into a computercoffee caf and goes online. This is one of the dumbest films of all time. I was just so angry to have wasted my time and money on this film that was rated so highly on IMDb. Why does this film deserve a 7.7 rating? 7.7 Oh please. Something is really really wrong with the ratings system if this can happen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's get the obvious out of the way shall we? The plot is derivative of so many other things it's not true with Nikita being the obvious reference point. The acting isn't particularly strong the script is barely adequate and the plot is neither internally coherent nor believable. In other words it's like every other action film ever made from Bond to Bourne and all points between. So what was everyone expecting who went to see this movie? Shakespeare? On the other hand I would rate this as one of those rare experiences of seeing pure film. That is to say that there is the perfect marriage between image and music that makes it something quite different to the normal. The composition and direction of this film are really quite extraordinary with scene after scene catching the eye and making the commonplace clichs of the action genre seem fresh. The choice of music is inspired and the way that is has been synced to the action serves to heighten the tension in the scenes.The film also manages to avoid the usual problem of overreliance on CGI with the effects that are used being spare and for a reason. At one point we have a chase and fight in a container port and I was expecting the worst. Where did this scenario come from? I suspect it was one of the early Dirty Harry films and the container port shootoutchase has since become a compulsory element in all bad action movies and features in multiple episodes of TV thrillers. In 99 times out of 100 it's lazy it's boring and it's the same as every other one you've seen. Well Joe Wright has done the seemingly impossible by making his container port scene exciting and different.Look you're not going to learn the meaning of life or even the meaning of the plot by watching this movie. If you enjoy cinema however and by that I mean the use of images light and music to propel the story then I think you'll like this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hannah is a wholly unexpected but entirely enjoyable film. However this is not the all out balls to the wall action film the trailer might suggest. There is a high art house value to the film and it takes it's time letting you get to know the characters most notably the titular character Hannah as she explores the world for the first time. What we have is the kind of action film that comes around every once in a while that values it's characters but also demonstrates some great action pieces.Hannah tells the story of the 16 year old girl who after living her whole life in the woods is set upon the world. At the same time her release into the world sets in motion a man hunt by a CIA agent with her own agenda. I've read many comments comparing this to Kick Ass and I couldn't figure it out for the life of me. While these two films share loose ingredients they are wholly different films with Hannah arguably the superior film. Beautifully shot and fantastic all the way around the film elevates itself to art by successfully balancing Bournestyle action and a beautiful coming of age story. Through the film we see the world as Hannah sees it with a sense of wonder and beauty but also a sense of confusion. Sound is used to great effect to depict this as well and I will be very disappointed if this film doesn't get nominated for every sound award next year. The cast and talent behind the film also help to elevate it above the standard pic. Particularly Joe Wright who treads into different territory but nonetheless proves that he is an extremely versatile director. Saoirse Ronan also excels as the lead here playing up the hardened but vulnerable character. It's not an easy role to fill the shoes of with both a physical and emotional demand on the characters but in Wright's hands Saoirse nails it.While the film does have moments of drag here and there even these moments are filled with something visually or audibly interesting. If it's not the Chemical Brother's fantastic soundtrack or a unique shot here and there it's the stylish editing and unique focus. I will say that this won't be for everyone. This is not a film that's constant action and it does have an independent quality to it. But for those that take the journey you'll find a very rewarding film here that succeeds where many action films don't. I'll even go so far as to say that this is my favorite film of 2011 so far.".

I hate to say that Eric Bana's character Erik was almost forgettable  in the end the movie was really not about him.

	schema:reviewBody "This film has some beautiful locations early on but quickly becomes so pointless and loses credibility very quickly.While there are some great actors and actresses in this film they unfortunately have very few lines of dialogue and also have very few opportunities to show us why they act or feel the way they do.The film seems to happen for no reason. Sure Hanna wants to kill the US secret agent Marissa because she killed her mother but everything else is left largely unanswered. The superwarrior waif I can go along with for a time but the film ends up becoming ridiculous when Hanna leaps out of a hole in the ground to grab the underside of a Humvee driving overhead. Idiotic.Then the interaction she has with the English family is a confused mix of light relief and possible self reflection on a life spent in the Arctic wilderness without family fun. We're left wondering what happens to the family after she leaves them and they get found by the baddies.The baddies that Marissa rely on apart from gray faceless operatives are hard to take seriously. Are they meant to be funny? Skinheads in boots led by a fuhrer in tennis shorts is possibly trying too hard but apart from a tenuous eugenics connection with Hanna's genetic manipulation I can't really see why the filmmakers did this.The inconsistencies in the story are infuriating too. Hanna is freaked out by an old black and white TV in Morocco but somehow uses the Internet to discover the truth about her father and the DNA manipulation carried out on her.Ultimately the predictable end to the film comes too late and you've had enough.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film has some beautiful locations early on but quickly becomes so pointless and loses credibility very quickly.While there are some great actors and actresses in this film they unfortunately have very few lines of dialogue and also have very few opportunities to show us why they act or feel the way they do.The film seems to happen for no reason. Sure Hanna wants to kill the US secret agent Marissa because she killed her mother but everything else is left largely unanswered. The superwarrior waif I can go along with for a time but the film ends up becoming ridiculous when Hanna leaps out of a hole in the ground to grab the underside of a Humvee driving overhead. Idiotic.Then the interaction she has with the English family is a confused mix of light relief and possible self reflection on a life spent in the Arctic wilderness without family fun. We're left wondering what happens to the family after she leaves them and they get found by the baddies.The baddies that Marissa rely on apart from gray faceless operatives are hard to take seriously. Are they meant to be funny? Skinheads in boots led by a fuhrer in tennis shorts is possibly trying too hard but apart from a tenuous eugenics connection with Hanna's genetic manipulation I can't really see why the filmmakers did this.The inconsistencies in the story are infuriating too. Hanna is freaked out by an old black and white TV in Morocco but somehow uses the Internet to discover the truth about her father and the DNA manipulation carried out on her.Ultimately the predictable end to the film comes too late and you've had enough.";

	schema:reviewBody "CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!! I've opened an account on IMDb to warn you against this Film! It is a complete and utter waste of time. I don't know how it is scoring so highly on IMDb. The plot is ridiculous  we're not told why this girl poses a threat what her Father did wrong it doesn't explain why they had to split up only to meet at the same point again couldn't they have got the bus together? LOL. The whole 'super human' business just doesn't wash how can a skilled 'fighter' take out a soldier in one fell swoop and then struggle to fight against two skinheads? It doesn't make sense. Why on earth would the typical bad guy whistle a stupid tune when he is trying to find the girl? Hello..... whistling will give your location away! Why would you if you are being followed and you are a trained spy make your way to an isolated underground car park type place? Why if you are trying to catch said spy and there are 4 of you would you get involved in a hand to hand fight which was poor by the way  just shoot the guy taser him whatever  in the real world you would keep you distance! And then when the spy the father beats up the 4 agents he doesn't take the radio with him he doesn't search them for weapons it's just an insult to one's intelligence. There are so many holes in the plot it's almost laughable! None of it makes sense. Why does the grandmother get shot? She's been ignored for the last 16 years! Why would a trained super human spy be amazedpuzzled by a light a TV a kettle? And then she asks why she needs a bit of paper her passport to say who she is? Please do not waste your time with this film it is nothing like the Bourne films or Leon which some people seem to be comparing it with. This film is about a little girl who's been stuck in the forest with her father for 16 years and by the way she doesn't even look 12 let alone 16! finding her way in the big world beyond the forest. The film makers have tried to put a spin on this age old plot but it just reduces the film to the pile of garbage that it is.".

Below are some examples and believe me there are lots! of the ridiculous laughable and stupid moments in the film  She was imprisoned in a CIA cell located in the desert of Morocco which incredibly looks like the southwest of the USA  After shooting a few CIA agents her face was covered with blood. The whole scene when she escaped from that CIA location gave me a headache because of the way it was filmed and the techno music the post production probably wanted to recreate a coolstylishish effect a la Matrix but they pathetically failed  Hanna has no money yet was able to send a postcard to her father somewhere in Europe how did she know how to buy a postcard and walk to the post office? She spent her life in the mountains remember? Besides she had 0 money...  Hanna was raised all her life in the mountains. She had never seen a TV or had electricity yet she was able to walk into an internet caf and surf the web to look for information about DNA I could go on for hours but I'll stop here. The movie is rubbish the scenario is rubbish the dialogues are rubbish and the music is rubbish. I don't understand what worldwide famous actors such as Eric Bana and Cate Blanchet are doing in this failure".

Obviously her teacher fails so miserably that she doesn't even know what a lightbulb is ffs.. despite being taught about supernovae and whales and  we hope  everything in between.Well at least the martial arts sections were good .. oh no wait  there aren't any! Hanna very very rapidly  or not rapidly enough actually  turns into a comingofage chick flick that would not have been out of place on TV in the 80's.. if and i must stress if they had marketed it this way  with its true contents  then at least i could have avoided it and i would have What a ripoff. This film might not be the worse i have ever seen though it does rank up there with the most boring i should say but the problem is the same with the tin of beans.. it's not what i wanted and i want my money back. I can't give Hanna a realistic vote. If i wanted a horror and got a really bad horror i could vote it down but this film is nothing of what i was sold in light of this act of complete thieveryMy final vote 110 The producers didn't even have the courage to sell it as what it really is.".

Hanna started in the Arctic got captured and ended up in Morocco escaped to Spain and then to Germany. This without the faintest idea what to do with a light switch telephone or annoying TV programme. But of course she was able to first find a place with a computer and second use one proficiently enough to extract information from. Seemed odd she was freaked out by a light switch but knew what a computer was. Also her fighting skills against trained soldiers was stunning but she was not very well trained in warding off skinheads in the employ of a whistling dwarf in a tracksuit. What Cate Blanchett was doing and why was difficult to understand and the plot revelations were never really exploited very well. It had the makings of a good film but was too stupid to actually make the grade. If this was Eric Bana's plan to kill his nemesis it assumed a lot of things would go Hanna's way for her to complete her Mission Impossible. Especially as she was unable to even turn on a light. Her escape was utterly silly and became sillier when she hooked up with the family in the camper van. Very little of the actions of anybody in the film made that much sense and the story made even less. The reviews here written by those who worked for the production team ensure that the film feels worth watching but best start at the hated it and work upwards for a sense of what the film is really like. Another promising movie that failed miserably. Thankfully I saw 'Paul' the same day and that made up for watching Hanna. Hopefully 'Super 8' will be more 'Paul' than 'Hanna'.".

	schema:headline " The best action sequel of all time and one of the best Schwarzenegger's movies my personal favorite";
	schema:reviewBody "Terminator 2 Judgment Day is 1991 is the best action scifi flick movie from the 90's ever made of all time. Terminator 2 is my personal favorite film I absolutely love this movie to death! Is my number 1 best movie ever till today the best of the best epic movie of all time. T2 was nominated for 4.Oscars the only movie of the franchise was nominated for an Oscar. If you watch T2 carefully and follow the story you never got bored and you are very entertained. This movie kicks ass! I love the hospital scenes mostly at night the Cyberdyne building action sequences and of course steel mill action sequences are perfect for this film. This film deals with a lot of action scifi and does involves a lot of paradox past travel. There is a lot of explosions and automatic weapons used in the movie and they are used well thousands of bullets are fired and explosive projectiles are fired at the police cars. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the good terminator T800 did an awesome Terrific real job he acted believably as one of his best characters I ever saw on screen. Terminator walks to the front of the building and kicks a desk out a window. Than ignores the police's order to surrender and fires a M134 Minigun with Chainsaw grip at the police cars below avoiding the humans. The helicopter pilot moves away. Terminator than uses a M79 grenade launcher to destroy two more vehicles. Its headsup display indicates no human casualties. The film has a heart and is the best film in the world. Robert Patrick as T1000 is a mimetic Pollyalloy or liquid metal. He can shape shift to match other people he touches after first arriving in present time he decides to have his base form be that of a nearby cop he killed and passes himself off as a cop in that form. The truck chase scene is awesome and the crash is also awesome. The truck that hit in to another column in the canal and explodes T1000 emerges as a shiny featureless liquid metal figure. Its features become more pronounced and its colors return to normal returning to the form of the unharmed pseudocop is awesome. It shows what his character can do. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor she acted her character perfectly here she played her character genius and very convincing and real tough beyond all belief and completely focused on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety. Sarah Connor is her best performance ever in the both Terminator films. Little out of her mind with paranoia and anger amazingly you see actual character development specifically when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to. Edward Furlong is the only John Connor for me is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom told him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well. Earl Boen plays the semisadistic mental hospital warden Dr. Silberman from the first film The Terminator 1984 that stands between Sarah Connor and her son until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance.Arnold Schwarzenegger Linda Hamilton Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick did there best acting performances those actors who played there characters are beloved till this days and Terminator 2 has since been ranked as one of the greatest action science fiction sequel films of all time. Twin sister of Linda Hamilton also appeared as Leslie Hamilton Gearren as Twin Sarah in dream she was for real there wasn't no CGI in here. Twin brothers Don Stanton and Dan Stanton both of actors appeared in here one as Lewis the Guard the other as Lewis as T1000 who kills lewis they were for real no CGI except special effects for T1000 knife. Terminator special effects were designed by Stan Winston R.I.P. who has done incredible job making those effects. The film is absolutely filled with great classic moments. T2 is James Cameron masterpiece. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. James Cameron writes produces and directs brilliantly this film. Brad Fiedel does a perfect music score to the film. American rock band Guns N' Roses wrote a single for this movie You Could Be Mine and Schwarzenegger appeared in the music video as T800 in the music video for this movie. The chopper scene that crashed in to a SWAT van and explodes was awesome. The CGI and special effects are awesome. This movie is what it is a perfect 10 because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task actors stunts puppetry models and special effects designed from Stan Winston. It is Rated R for strong scifi action and violence and for language it is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. 1010 Score Bad Ass Seal Of Approval".

Now that Terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment Protect John Connor. John ConnorEdward Furlong is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new Terminator sent to kill himThe T1000Robert Patrick. Sarah John and The Terminator journey together on their quest to stop Judgement Day with a trailing shapeshifting Termiantor trailing from behind.This is the greatest of the Terminator trilogy. I have watched three times in the past year and have not found anything that Cameron could have improved on. The move is a masterpiece in every aspect of film. Schwarzenegger's acting might not be incredible but this is the perfect role for him. He isn't supposed to show emotion or feelings. He is a machine. I hate almost every one of his movies besides this trilogy because he is a horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role.The special effects are incredible beyond belief. The shapeshifting T1000 is some of the greatest animation I have witnessed in cinema history. It absolutely blew my mind when I first experienced this visual extravaganza. The animation looked so realremembering this was a good ten years. The movie included fastpaced action along with some clever scifi dramahorror. The idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city should be scary enough. But the T1000 has very little lines and is just creepy enough to make twitch when you see him.Scifi movies can rarely be made in such way that can be looked at as works of art. This is one of the few exceptions. The prediction of judgment day with Hamilton watching a playground full of kids be burnt to the ground is an absolute brilliant portrayal of Armageddon. The theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout the movie also and is even said by The Terminator It's in your nature to destroy yourselves. This brings the movie to a whole new level of scifi.Overall Termiantor II Judgement Day is an absolute must see classic. If you have not seen it buy it! Because once you have seen it you will want to do so anyways. It is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.I highly recommend this movie.".

Because this is THE action movie of all action movies next to Die Hard this is the movie that isn't just about the action as well but has an incredible story and message behind it that will always stay with you. Terminator 2 like the first Terminator film has memorable lines moments and incredible effects. This is the film that made you believe in liquid metal machines. Robert Patrick's performance is flawless to be honest I found him a million times more terrifying than Arnold in the first Terminator because Robert looks like this normal average guy but he's not like Arnold where he gets shot and you can clearly see he's a terminator Robert goes back to human looking and won't stop. Not only that you don't know how to stop him. Linda Hamilton returns and gives a great performance as Sarah Conor who is no longer a meek little girl she has turned into a strong woman who will do anything to protect her son and the future. Arnold is back and he's better then ever! No wonder in the future they made several terminators that look like him he's great entertainment.Eleven years after Sarah Connor destroyed the original Terminator that was programmed to kill her two Terminators arrive in Los Angeles from the year 2029. The first is a Terminator identical to the one that Sarah first encountered while the second is a new model which assumes the identity of a police officer. John Connor is now a 10 year old living with foster parents. Sarah's experiences have made her tougher and more vigilant but also desperate to warn humanity about the coming apocalypse. After attempting to bomb a computer factory Sarah is arrested and remanded to the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the supervision of Dr. Silberman. Meanwhile the Terminators locate John Connor in a mall. After John is rescued and a chase through the L.A. storm drain channels the original Terminator escapes with John on his motorcycle. The Terminator explains that he is reprogrammed by the future John Connor to protect and obey John's younger self. The other Terminator is a T1000 an advanced new prototype programmed to kill John. It is made of a mimetic polyalloy a liquid metal that allows it to take the shape and appearance of anything it touches. It can also form into knifes and stabbing weapons. Learning that the T1000 will likely kill Sarah and then mimic her to lure John John orders the Terminator to help free her. Initially Sarah is terrified by the Terminator but after seeing it fight off the T1000 she accepts that they need its help. As they escape the city the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet the sentient computer system that will nearly wipe out humanity in an apocalyptic nuclear attack on Judgment Day.Terminator 2 is one of the best films of all time this is a film that I absolutely adore and if someone hasn't seen it there's something seriously wrong. This story is a special one humans are we our own worst enemy? Arnold's line It's in your nature to destroy yourselves is something that always sends chills down my spine because it's true. I loved the relationship between Arnold and Eddie Furlong interesting to see a terminator take the place perfectly of a father and you see the pain in Eddie's eyes of never wanting to let go of the terminator. Like Sarah Conor said  The terminator wouldn't stop it would never leave him. It would never hurt him or shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it was too busy to spend time with him. And it would die to protect him. meant a lot to me. Like I said if for some odd reason you have seen this movie do see it! I promise you that it's just an excellent film and one that will always stand out against cinematic history.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Disclaimer If you are a viewer that mainly prefers arthousetype movies then you might as well ignore this review. In addition if you're not able to take a few scifi leaps of faith ignore this review as well. We'll both be better off.This is the finest action movie of all time. And yet believe it or not it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a 100 million budget in 1991! with multiple huge explosions with thousands of bullets fired and scores of stuntmen used.This movie is what it is a perfect 10 because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task  actors stunts puppetry models and CG. Without the vision this film would be nothing. Without the tools this film would be nothing.But a little bit of background is due. This is the sequel to the Terminator 1984 whose premise was that a nearindestructible cyborg is sent by evil selfaware machines from the near future to destroy the mothertobe of the military commander who would lead the humans to a victory over the machines. Oh and this terminator machine would come from a time of war between men and machines which followed a nuclear exchange that left billions of people dead first. In Terminator 2 John Connor the commandertobe is about 12 years old and his mother Sarah is feverishly trying to prepare him for his fate even as she tries to stop the factors that will lead to the nuclear war and the entire terrible future that made all this necessary. The machines now send a superior more intelligent shapeshifting cyborg T1000 into the past to kill John himself. Meanwhile futureJohn reprograms the exevil Terminator T101 from the original film and sends him into the past to PROTECT John against the T1000.That's your basic plot. It does involve travel into the past so it immediately presents a timetravel paradox which can't really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don't this movie has zero credibility and is not worth your time.What happens after the two terminators appear in the past is a wild ride rife with macho action dark reflection on the nature of man and a few rays of hope here and there. Schwarzenegger the good terminator and Patrick the bad one make for such effective foes that the times they meet onscreen are completely breathtaking and odd given that you repeatedly see the relatively slim T1000 through Arnie through a wall or two. Hamilton as Sarah Connor is a wonderful character  tough beyond all belief and completely focussed on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety yet clearly a little out of her mind with paranoia and anger amazingly you see actual character development specifically when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to in her otherwise 2dimensional character. And Furlong as John is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom tell him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well particularly Earl Boen who plays the semisadistic mental hospital warden that stands between Sarah Connor and her son until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance.With these players set in motion it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances  an impressive feat. The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great classic moments I counted TEN allstar ones during my last viewing and they're evenly spaced through the movie. I mean who doesn't cheer at least inside when Arnold steps out of the biker bar fully clad in leather when Bad to the Bone music starts to blast? The guy absolutely bleeds coolness. And the T1000 absolutely bleeds evil. But with so many great moments you'd think the pacing would be a little uneven... not really! The film shifts from place to place with an ease that makes perfect sense never giving you the time to start being a little nitpicking jerk always driving forward but always doing so thoughtfully and with attention to detail.Of course this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it and it's perfectly done. The CG effects for the shapeshifting T1000 were cuttingedge for the time and still look great whoever said differently below is simply incorrect  even if they're completely commonplace today. The stunts are completely insane in scale at one point a helicopter flies under a highway overpass at another a motorcycle jumps from the 2nd floor of a building into a flying chopper. Probably only the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings movies compare in terms of the level of stunt insanity. And the gunplay is delivered in perfect CameronSchwarzenegger style as opposed to the slomo John Woostyle  you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons and you'll see them used well. The film is violent and somewhat bloody but ALL of the meanspirited violence is dealt by the evil characters not the ones you root for Quentin Tarantino fans sorry. And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable  just wait until the nuclear detonation sequence.I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie. Probably moral content and the movie has a very clear prohuman antiwar message. The message is a bit stale and the delivery IS at times a little heavyhanded and some moments with the T101 seem just a bit unrealistic towards the end but the movie has heart and that you cannot deny. Plus it simply rocks. 1010".

In addition if you're not able to take a few scifi leaps of faith ignore this review as well. We'll both be better off.This is the finest action movie of all time. And yet believe it or not it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a 100 million budget in 1991! with multiple huge explosions with thousands of bullets fired and scores of stuntmen used.This movie is what it is a perfect 10 because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task  actors stunts puppetry models and CG.

	schema:reviewBody "Who said sequels aren't any good? Terminator 2 is the ultimate sequel a big bad wolf ready to chomp the head off of anyone who crosses its path. It's dark it's mean and it's one tough movie. It's not as bleak as the first film at least in terms of visuals but rather has a new kind of bluishtint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.If there was ever a contemporary mainstream visionary director it is James Cameron. Here we've got Cameron's real thoughts on the series those repressed by a low budget in the original film. He lets loose here filling every frame with hardboiled action and special effects. He introduces a liquid metal Terminator that he wanted to use in the first film but graphic processors and CGI were not advanced enough in 1984 at least not advanced enough to work on the low means he had to film the original. So his original dream is finally unveiled and good golly is it wonderful.Yeah he's back. Arnold like he needs any introduction? returns as The Terminator Series T101 Model T800 an indestructible cyborg sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor Linda Hamilton in the first film. Well it's 1991. New film. New mission. He has to save the future resistance leader of mankind who will ultimately defeat the machines of the future John Connor Edward Furlong Sarah's 11yearold son. Though his age has been switched from 11 to 13 and back to 9 over the years with no help from the third film that takes place in 2003 yet claims he was 13 in 1991 though his age doesn't match with his age in the third. We'll just leave it at 11 in this film. Got that?Another model Terminator the T1000 Robert Patrick has been sent back to 1991 programmed to annihilate John Connor. Which explains Arnold's appearance. Arnold an undoubtedly lesser opponent compared to the T1000 has to help save the day and learn to appreciate humanity. It won't be easy. First he has to find John Connor who is a rebellious angstdriven preteen living with foster parents. Then together they have to break into the local loony hospital and release Sarah from the clutches of Dr. Silberman Earl Boen who believes Sarah is delusional. You may remember Silberman as the psychiatrist from the first film too. Then they have to stop a computer chip designer Joe Morton from creating the first version of a SkyNet computer modeled after a destroyed chip his employment company discovered at a large mechanical warehouse. Which is of course the chip from the destroyed T800 of the first film.Whew. On with the film analysis right? Where to start? This isn't as fierce or brutal as the first film but it's got plentiful action sequences a large budget great special effects even compared to those gracing the screen nowadays not to mention a great character study of the machine we loved to root against in the first film. Of course this Terminator has no memory of the first film since he wasn't in itSkyNet creates hordes of the same version machines on a large conveyor belt and ships them off to fight in the war. Some are sent back through time. So with that in mind John Connor's resistance found an extra Arnold lying around in an abandoned warehouse programmed him to keep John Connor out of harm and sent him through the time portal.Sarah doesn't trust him. In a deleted scene available on the Ultimate and Xtreme edition DVDs Sarah says You don't know what it's like to try and kill one of these things! It's an important scene that should have been left in the final cut. In it Sarah is about to destroy the machine's central processing chip located inside his head when John stops her. It's important because it focuses on the fact that Sarah still doesn't trust him and came close to destroying him purely out of prejudice without giving him a chance. As much as I don't like it when people go on about hidden meanings in films that obviously are not meant to have hidden meanings and are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed for deeper meanings T2 clearly has an underlying message One don't judge a book by its cover. Read it first. Two if an emotionless killing machine can learn to appreciate life why can't everyone? And three the most important fact of all Never mess with a muscular man who walks into a bar completely naked and requests your clothes and means of transportation.I suppose the question on most interested viewers' minds is this Is T2 Judgment Day better than its predecessor? Well in some respects yes. In others no. It lacks the fierce brutality and darkness of the first film but makes up for it with spectacular visual effects and action sequences. It lacks the horrific central focus of the first film futuristic indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able to unemotionally kill but it makes up for this with a new focus of humanity coming to accept your future and how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into an arena together.In some ways I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I'd choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I'm glad I don't have to choose.55 stars.".

	schema:headline " Schwarzenegger's Best Film Hands Down";
	schema:reviewBody "Oh yeah Terminator 2 Judgment Day......The greatest overall action film next to Die Hard and the greatest science fiction one next to Aliens. It is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time and I would give this 20 stars if I could and this is a film that everyone recognizes and knows about and this is a film that absolutely gets what it deserves.In 1991 Arnold Schwarzenegger had finally cemented his reputation as the world's greatest action star after a couple great classics The Terminator Predator Total Recall and the Conan films. This is the movie that defined Schwarzenegger forever as the one and only Terminator the cyborg sent from the future to protect the kid Edward Furlong who will save the entire world. Even though he's a machine he learns what humans need to do and what they were put on this Earth for. And like what action films lack T2 develops its characters flawlessly and yes EVEN the Terminator is given development as a character! When the T100 arrives to the mid 1990's he is basically awkward and socially clueless and knows nothing about human emotion or interaction. As the film progresses he learns how humans behave and learns a few oneliners from John Hasta la Vista baby and Spoilers at the end before the Terminator melts himself in molten steel his humanity is completely obvious I know now why you cry for it is something I can never do. And just before he completely disappears in the molten steel he gives the thumbsup gesture something that John had taught him before.It is also probably the most heartbreaking ending and even the most insensitive guy will cry to that.Also Linda Hamilton makes one of the greatest ever screen performances by a female and even challenges the performance of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens. And her character has really developed from the first movie. The main problem with most movie sequels that have been made is that they usually act like the film before it never happened. But Sarah Connor has transformed from a timid waitress into a smart and brutal militaristic woman. And it shows off James Cameron's filmmaking genius and he truly knows how to make a great action film and a great sequel to follow it because of this and Aliens which I will write up a review soon 2 of the greatest sequels ever made. During the course of this film Sarah Connor has already developed a phobia for Terminator's due to her experiences in the first movie. And during most of the film she doesn't trust the Terminator at all and even tries to destroy its CPU chip only in a deleted scene. But at the end when the Terminator is just about to destroy itself she shakes hands with him and makes peace with him.....veryvery touching moment. Also Hamilton did a great job at providing the narration with some greatly written lines and she utters them with perfect drama and suspense to reveal the story in the beginning and what's next for the future at the end.Also Edward Furlong really makes a name for himself in his film debut. He is absolutely perfect as the juvenile offender who is affected by the absence of his mother and biological father. Throughout the film he becomes attached to the Terminator and teaches him the meaning of human life. And no one else could've done the role better or equally as great. FYI it's not really that easy for a kid with limited acting experience to pull it off.The line She's not my mother ''Todd'' shows what Furlong can do and says that line with the perfect facial expression and delivery. And Furlong and Hamilton are really the 2 who provide the intense emotion that has capitalized James Cameron's films ever since.The villainous T1000 Robert Patrick has gotta be the icon for movie villains 'cause the whole liquid metal thing is so cool. And the film was even a landmark for special effects which make the action scenes stand out and make them among the best in the genre.This is further proof of why every action fan needs to have James Cameron alive to give em a reason to live. I'm already looking forward to Avatar and Battle Angel and I'm sure those 2 will kick  once they come out.If it weren't for this film every other action flick that you see these days wouldn't be the same. When you watch it just keep in mind that this movie changed a lot of things. It's not just an excellent action epic but a very emotionally charged story about human survival.".

During the course of this film Sarah Connor has already developed a phobia for Terminator's due to her experiences in the first movie. And during most of the film she doesn't trust the Terminator at all and even tries to destroy its CPU chip only in a deleted scene. But at the end when the Terminator is just about to destroy itself she shakes hands with him and makes peace with him.....veryvery touching moment. Also Hamilton did a great job at providing the narration with some greatly written lines and she utters them with perfect drama and suspense to reveal the story in the beginning and what's next for the future at the end.Also Edward Furlong really makes a name for himself in his film debut. He is absolutely perfect as the juvenile offender who is affected by the absence of his mother and biological father. Throughout the film he becomes attached to the Terminator and teaches him the meaning of human life. And no one else could've done the role better or equally as great. FYI it's not really that easy for a kid with limited acting experience to pull it off.The line She's not my mother ''Todd'' shows what Furlong can do and says that line with the perfect facial expression and delivery. And Furlong and Hamilton are really the 2 who provide the intense emotion that has capitalized James Cameron's films ever since.The villainous T1000 Robert Patrick has gotta be the icon for movie villains 'cause the whole liquid metal thing is so cool. And the film was even a landmark for special effects which make the action scenes stand out and make them among the best in the genre.This is further proof of why every action fan needs to have James Cameron alive to give em a reason to live. I'm already looking forward to Avatar and Battle Angel and I'm sure those 2 will kick  once they come out.If it weren't for this film every other action flick that you see these days wouldn't be the same. When you watch it just keep in mind that this movie changed a lot of things. It's not just an excellent action epic but a very emotionally charged story about human survival.";

Linda Hamilton can play insanity and despair like nobody's business and she gave her all here. Robert Patrick was wonderful in the demanding role of the T1000 creepy and threatening even during the funny fingerwagging moment. Arnold Schwarzenegger balances nonstop action with a machine's emerging humanity frankly this movie cancels out every dumb action flick he ever made.

It's arguable of course that the Terminator T800 does kill some people incidentally or you know all that gas from the gun he shoots could make some people really screwed up but hey He'll live is enough.But if Cameron is soft at all here it doesn't show too much... well okay Lil' John hehe does squeak and squak those early 90's amorphisms No Problemo  chill out  listen to Kriss Kross  etc and Edward Furlong is one of the things that just does not hold up here. He's serviceable at best annoying at worst. He can cry okay though.But it's Arnold in his swaggering lowkey and then with an occasional grin awesome leading man turn and especially Linda Hamilton who make this tight script so compulsively watchable. Hamilton makes Connor into what Cameron likely saw in his onetime wifecollaborator Bigelow  a takenoprisoners soldier who can take charge and has muscles and can probably knock you upside the head maybe that's why they divorced he couldn't take all that woman... but I digress at any rate he moved around a lot till his current wife And there is also a vulnerability still to Sarah that makes her so endearing. She can never be completely hard though time and experience and the dread of what's to come had scarred her so by the time she has the chance to kill the Man Who Destroys The World she can't do it. A scene like that is probably more emotionally gripping than so many other scenes that try in these blockbusters something like Days of Future Past which is a cousin of this flick gets there. The fact Hamilton wasn't able to parlay such high caliber performance work into a better career is kind of sad but at least this stands as a benchmark of a woman action hero one of the two Cameron Wonder Women really.So blast your Guns N Roses say hi to the kid from Salute Your Shorts that's him right Connor's friend in the first act? and ride your motorcycle through LA  it's a bad motherjammer of a blockbuster that holds up enough to look over its faults i.e. some dialog isn't tight like the voiceover it's alright but whatever  perhaps it was ambitious enough to best The Perfect Action Movie which the first Terminator just was.".

In particular I'm referring to Sarah and John Connor but also to the inhuman T101 in all it's programming trying to humanise itself at the demand if John.Though these might sound like day to day interactions pardoning the whole terminator and robotic elements here but to put them onto film and not have them feel forced or contrived is quite a feat and all of these were achieved far above the expectation of one watching an action movie. You truly believe that John is devastated to have to lose T101. You can tell he's fearful about Sarah going off to kill the man who would kill the world unwittingly.I urge you all to sit down and watch this film again.

	schema:headline " It pushes the limits of greatness";
	schema:reviewBody "Probably this is the movie I enjoyed watching the most. Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of my all time favorite actors I am a huge fan of him. It does not matter whether his acting is great or not but in this movie he is great I think The Terminator 2 has humor at times but because of that again rather critics give one star low! However humor in the movie is not to entertain audiences. Humor in this movie results from natural situations it seems that Cameron does not put such moments for our entertainment like the third Terminator movie. And this humor does not ruin the seriousness and the dark tone of the movie. I can't think of a Terminator movie without Schwarzenegger. I have seen Terminator Salvation and yes there was Arnold Schwarzenegger too but CGI! an awful idea Terminator Salvation was OK but not as a Terminator movie as a post apocalyptic science fiction action. I want to say a few things more about Schwarzenegger. He was an icon by this character. Motorcycle leather jacket sunglasses and pump rifle. At this point this is the most humanist may be the only action movie ever! One of my favorite one liners is the movie is ''he will live.'' Connor tries to teach him not to kill people. Don't get me wrong it does not mean that I don't like other action movies which do not give such a message but this just makes the movie greater and deeper. By the way Terminator 2 is also the deepest action movie ever. This is one of the movies that when you replace any of the actors pieces don't fall into place. Schwarzenegger is like he was made for Terminator and yes Conan too Robert Patrick was made for T100 he was at his best in this movie may be not for acting but for performance and Edward Furlong was made for John Connor. Honestly personally it was impossible to believe that Nick Stahl is John Connor I watched him like another character. Furlong portrays a very realistic rover portrait. As for Linda Hamilton she was not made for Sarah Connor but it is a big pleasure to watch her and for her acting real very good. Musics always make me live nostalgia great musics. Now let's talk about the scenes. The atari center sequence is the first beyond great sequence. This movie is great entertainment every time it is a great pleasure to watch it. From the middle of 1990s till now I watched the movie almost 50 times. I love the metal holes and then renew. How creative it is. As for visual effects it is a touchstone yes still. It is the greatest visual effects of all time to me till 2012. Now to me it became the second greatest. And I am sorry I find the visual effects of T2 much more believable than Avatar. Yes I know 3D some other new technologies as well. but this is what I think. At a few moments it is flawed like the scene they shoot at the face of Schwarzenegger but no problem at all. Can you believe that this movie was made in 1991? I can't believe at all. That's why it is still a milestone. The chase sequence in the highway is beyond great too. Cameron raised the bar and I used to compare all the chase scenes with this one. Do you know another movie that in user comments the titles which say the greatest action movie ever are innumerable? Almost everyone says the greatest action movie ever the best action movie of all time the greatest the best... I will say the same thing. This is the greatest action movie of all time. The pump rifle using style of Terminator was getting my attention when I was a child. Still I like that. I just like gunfight scenes not guns by the way. The hospital sequence is the third beyond great sequence there are a lot of scenes that deserves cinema anthology in this movie. The coffee scene was incredible every time makes me remember The Silver Surfer we get lots of very interesting and brilliant moments like the shoot at head not just in this sequence throughout the whole movie The Terminator is 10 out of 10 but T2 surpasses even that you know I can't give 11 out of 10 Ohh By the way I don't recommend you to watch the extended edition if you are a first time viewer. There are three new scenes in this edition. The scene which Sarah hallucinates to me a mediocre scene the scene which T100 tells Sarah and John where his chip is an unnecessary scene and the scene which a kind of foreplay and talking between Tarissa and Miles while he works at desk a clich and a bit ridiculous scene. Returning to the movie this is the best cat and mouse game movie with No Country for Old Men it wouldn't be better. T1000 is the most powerful the most resistant the most indestructible villain ever! You think that he is terminated but he is not will he be terminated this time? The movie delivers such a feeling that I would define great success. Helicopter truck fight is great another action sequence I would call the kind of action in the movie metallic not CGI action. By the way mercury scene was one of the most shocking moments in the cinema history! Unbelievable incredible. There is an unaccountable moment which it seems that Hulk was inspired from. Another moment recalls The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King etc. If you watched both movies you understand what I mean. And T1000 continues to execute his tricks I was bowling over every time. This is a non stop action movie but not shallow at all not like pure action with no substance in contrast the deepest action movie ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a rarity that a sequel actually outshines its predecessor. Yes James Cameron was allowed a budget for 'Terminator 2 Judgment Day' due to his own success as well as the cult following part one had. But he didn't stop at simple special effects. He took his original interesting and origin story and blasted it in fast forward excellently. Hamilton apparently refused to return unless her character expanded and it did tenfold. Schwarzenegger was given more lines most hilarious and a lot more in depth was his cyborg. Also was the addition of excellent acting of Morton Patrick and soontobe notorious Furlong a fulllength story of his own origins. Not only was 'T2' a perfect summer movie not only did it surpass the original it is absolutely one of the best action movies of all time. And like part 1 it's mostly about the story and acting. I cringe at most socalled action movies of today SEE 'Transformers' 1  2. Sure there's FX to spare but where's the story? Where's the acting? This movie a continuation of part one with Sarah now the mother of the future resistance leader John protecting him or is he protecting her? while a new duo of terminators sent back in time to protect andor destroy. They up'd the ante for action dialogue comedy score suspense heart with special and original effects  this one set the liquid metal stage. I can go on and on but seriously this is what real big budgeted movies should model themselves after. First get a great and original story. Then hire accomplished actors who can yes act. Next employ real FXexperts. How hard of a code is that? I truly believe parts 1 and 2 are a complete story. It should've ended here.Side Note and Spoiler Though I loved the deleted and reinserted closing with Grandma Conner and Senator Conner playing in a nowar zone decades later it was the most unrealistic aspect. For how could those two ever expect not only to make it out of the events of 'T2' despite the humanitarian efforts without being completely hunted or on the FBI's most wanted list? We must of missed the President's pardoning and the American's forgiveness for John to become a Senator. Only in Hollywood.".

I don't think there's any aspect of this film that I don't like it really has a great feel of humanity's struggle against the creation of Skynet which will be responsible for the loss of so much life.It's hard to pick out the best performance here with Linda Hamilton portraying such a cold character almost like a Terminator herself to Robert Patrick's excellent performance as the new Terminator the T1000. Even young Edward Furlong is fantastic in this picture being just 9 years of age as the young John Connor. And of course you have Schwartzenegger who is playing the role he was born to play unlike the clich he turns into in Rise of the Machines.I would highly recommend film to anyone. From a distance it might just look like your mindless sciencefiction action movie with robots and explosions but it really is just so much more than that. The production value is phenomenal with great chase scenes and fantastic special effects even by todays standards. And as I mentioned the performances by the actors are fantastic. But more than all that I think is the whole feel of the movie which contrasts good over evil brilliantly.1010 your not going to find a better action movie than this buy it on special edition if you haven't already..".

Nowadays it can be hard to distinguish an action film from a video game. In fact there is one coming out soon that appears to be both. I guess studios these days feel that kids need something to see while resting their fingers after long days of playing their NintendosPlaystationswhatever. So they come up with all of these PG13 action films that are often mere meditations of comic books toys or old TV shows. Looking back at T2 one may find the action films of today sorely lacking in comparison.The story of course deals with Arnold returning from the future to protect a boy who will some day lead the human resistance against a world run by machines. This time Arnold is the good guy as per Schwarzenegger's request and he's up against a lethal and much more advanced prototype sent to off the kid. The CGI used to create this new T1000 terminator was jawdropping at the time this was released. Though technology to create such things is now infinitely more available this has led to problems in my book. Now there is too much done with computers and stunts don't seem so wonderful if you know it was all done on a computer. Most of the stunts in T2 were live action and extraordinarily filmed using all types of vehicles and explosives. Director James Cameron really sold these stunts in terms of how he filmed them.Not all directors are a good as Cameron. That is a given. But directors looking at making action films should take note of other strengths found in the construction of T2. First of all you don't need shaky camera movements to sell to your audience that there is an exciting or crucial scene happening. Here the photography is crisp and detailed. You see everything clearly that you need to see. Right down to the little things. The action sequences are perfectly blocked and the spacing between hostile parties is easy for the audience to figure out. We know who is shooting at who and how far apart they are from each other. Cameron also made sure his entire cast was proficient with the weapons they were going to fire in the movie. And guns run out of ammunition and need to be reloaded at appropriate times. Nothing seems artificial in a shootout.I could go on forever pointing out good qualities of this film. Just watching a bit of it on Bravo the other night reminded me why I saw it so many times in the theater. And this film was rated R! And it still made a fortune! That just proves if you make a good product you don't have to dumb it down or tame it for the kiddies. If it's good enough they'll find a way to see it! 10 of 10 stars. Unfortunately the inspiration seems to have left this series with Cameron.The Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "When this movie came out at the theatres I was 15. I thought it was cool. I'm 24 now and I see this movie in a completely different light. I don't doubt that the movie has amazing special effects that makes the movie quite watchable if you just want to vegatate for a couple of hours. I don't doubt that there  might be a few plot holes and discontinuity in the time travel aspect of the story. This is something I have yet to figure out.   But after watching this movie a few times and reading critical reviews of the movie I've come to this current opinion. If you bother to think about this movie beyond the great special effects you might find that it has more to offer than the cool FX. James Cameron is a very critical and detail oriented director. If you are familiar with his work at all you will see an emerging theme in all of his movies. I believe that theme is humanity vs. technology. THE ABYSS TITANIC ALIENS In any case the characters are an INTEGRAL part of the story and not simply the platform in which the action takes place. Compare this movie to say practically any Jerry Bruckheimer movie. Gone in Sixty Seconds anyone? James Cameron thinks about his characters first before he can imagine the situation in which they may reasonably be confronted with. James Cameron says himself that the intent of the movie was to make people feel for a robot to cry for him and not simply to be blown away by the action taking place within the context of the characters and the story.With this in mind I see this movie as first and foremost a human story. The whole premise of this story is the fight for humankind. Humans vs. Machines. I mentioned Cameron's theme earlier humanity vs. technology. In this movie the more technologically advanced we become the more inhuman we are. Witness this as Sarah Conner becomes more of a terminator herself in her willingness to kill Miles Dyson. She does not question morally or ethically about why she is killing him. She is just going to do it. Before she does it though she has an epiphany and she realizes exactly what she has become. It is shattering to her. There is such a moral fabric throughout this story voiced by our future hero You can't kill people!!! And later on Don't you get it?! Don't you understand why you can't kill people? Because we hurt we feel pain we're afraid... It is not surprising that John has such a strong moral fabric. After all he is going to become a great leader someday. Ironically it is his teachings to the terminator and the resetting of the CPU that makes the terminator more human. In the end he becomes halfhuman and he realizes his halfhumanity. I know now why you cry... but it is something that I can never do. It makes his sacrifice even more greater. A hero is defined as someone who sacrifices himself for a greater good something greater than even his own existence. Although the terminator could have stayed he chose to go. In this movie he is a true hero. Cameron chose to have this strong moral issue in the film... he did not want Arnold as the good robot killing everything in his way which he could have easily done. After all he is a terminator. He chose to weave this moral fabric into the story which I think many people easily overlook. The terminator teaches us a lot about ourselves too. This is a very spiritual aspect of the film. John says to the terminator we're not going to make it are me? People I mean... to which the terminator replies It is in your nature to destroy yourselves....   It makes the theme and message of the whole movie even more meaningful. The theme of the movie can best be summed up by Sarah Conner If a machinea terminator can learn the value of human life maybe we can too. It took something as inhuman as the terminator to teach us something very human about ourselves loyalty love fear sacrifice and hope. So before you write T2 off as just another action movie I challenge you to watch it critically. This movie is about destiny vs. free will how much control over our future do we have? as john says there is no fate but what we make of it ourselves. and as I've said before really about being human in such a technologically run world. Watch as Sarah fights to protect her son watch as john just desperately wants his mother to embrace him and love him. Observe the quiet moments of contemplation and rest in this movie. This movie is not perfect as no movie is but as an action movie it certainly provides a lot more than a two hour adrenaline rush.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most action movies follow a pretty predictable sequence. There's nothing written in stone but the movie tends to have an introduction an epic conclusion and then fills the intervening hour or two carefully switching between scenes of suspense heroics setbacks triumphs evil ploys and noble sacrifices. The more you watch the more you notice the formula.Terminator 2 is one of the few good action movies that dares to throw the formula out the window and that is what makes it so great. Instead of structuring the plot to build suspense by the book Terminator 2 makes the bold move of telling a linear story where every scene actually has to be multidimensional and build the plot in a creative and new way. This is very hard to do each scene practically has to be written from scratch like a chapter of a good book and the difficulty of making that style of filmmaking succeed is why so many films rely on the trusty old formula.The structuring of Terminator 2 is a subtle thing to notice but I do think it contributed to its success and certainly to the relatively serious respect its given as a film. No one is going to confuse it with an art house film of course but at the same time it does something that formula thrillers like Air Force One don't even try to do it tells a story in an original genuinely creative way without relying on traditional suspensebuilding clichs. In its own way this film is a work of art.Of course the film has much more obvious assets. The film's calling card will always be the epic action and special effects sequences  Arnold riding his bike off a ledge twirling his shotgun around to reload it tearing aside his fake skin to reveal the metal parts below  Terminator 2 was a stunningly exciting film when it came out and its visuals don't feel dated at all even 18 years later.Still though a lot of other films have had competent special effects. Why do people consider T2 a classic instead of films like Independence Day which also invested heavily in effects? It's not enough to just generate 15 minutes of jawdropping visuals in a 2 hour movie. You need to be creative about what you're actually depicting. A 10 million scene that's carefully crafted into the film's narrative is always going to do more for the audience than a similarly expensive scene that doesn't bother to give the audience any real reason to care about what's happening. Terminator 2 is a movie where the director spends time on the nonaction scenes treating them as more than just filler and this really pays off because instead of seeing a nifty visual sequence with some character you don't particularly care about the excitement of the action scenes in Terminator 2 is actually enhanced greatly because you like the good guys on a deeper level than in a formulaic action film.T2 is one of the high watermarks of action films. Everyone should see it it's that simple.".

	schema:reviewBody "Come on people watch it for what it is. Yes it's silly it's supposed to be. It looks great and slides down easy. Guy Pearce is a blast to watch as he struts and mouths off throughout the film in a manner I haven't seen since Bruce Willis in the Last Boy Scout. This is an 80's action movie at it's core set in space. One of failures of recent action movies trying to be an 80's action flick is that they forgot that the hero needs to go up against a memorable villain. In this we get 2 brothers that actually deliver the goods. Add in a fancy Star Wars inspired ending and you have fine Friday night escape.Don't think too hard and enjoy the trip.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off Lockout is not meant to be taken seriously. It is a fun action scifi movie that breaks the boundaries of what it physically possible. Remember when you were a kid playing with your little action figures in the sandbox well that is how they designed Lockout. They forgot about what is real and what can actually be done and simply had fun.Guy Pearce is hilarious and teamed up with Maggie Grace the laughs just keep rolling. It is an action scifi comedy that is amazingly well crafted if you can take your thinking cap off and just have fun. There are a few plot twists but nothing you didn't see coming. While Lockout doesn't really bring anything completely new to the table it is very entertaining and well worth multiple viewings.Due to mixed reviews I did not expect much but Lockout really impressed me with its style and fast paced action. Other reviews has said that the special effects looked terrible that is simply because of the style. One thing Lockout has is style and solid direction and cinematography. They knew what they were doing with this movie and they pulled it off perfectly.The PQ  AQ were great on Bluray and while the special features were lacking it is still a solid Bluray release.Recommended!".

After being on my feet for hours it was good to sit on my arse at twelve on the night and just switch off and enjoy a mindless bit of action. And that's exactly what 'Lockout' offers. If you've seen Luc Besson's Europacorp action flicks you know what to expect. I love all of them and this was no exception. Guy Pearce is the show stealer as Agent Snow the John McClane of the space age. His wisecracks and mindless violence keep your attention. Maggie Grace is as good as ever as the damsel in distress and the supporting actors do a bang up job as well. Almost stealing the show from Pearce but not quite is Joseph Gilgun as the nutty Scot sure to make you laugh once or twice even if you're hating the film. The effects are well done the action overthetop and exciting and it's overall good late night entertainment. As with all these sorts of films I'm sure critics and serious Scifi nuts are going to hate. But as I always say for people who can switch off and enjoy a bit of brainless fun this is a must.

	schema:headline " Thinks it's more fun than it is but 'Lockout' is still effective";
	schema:reviewBody "It's fair to say Luc Besson has gotten a bit giddy ever since Taken. The man who once upon a time brought us La Femme Nikita and Leon The Professional has instead taken to lighter action fare in this case recruiting amateurs James Mather and Stephen St. Leger to help write and direct his original idea. Exactlynot a story by credit but original idea.That's not to say Lockout isn't creative but it's definitely not original. Some might dub it Taken in space especially considering it borrows that film's starlet in Maggie Grace but it's much more akin to Escape from New York in space. Either way Lockout is another simple concept action film from Besson only it has a bigger ego that gets in the way sometimes.Lockout is good for kicks a fact of which it's very aware. Guy Pearce's Snow the morally questionable and reluctant hero written so closely to the archetype he almost transcends it weirdly. He has a sense of humor best described as abundant though sometimes quite clever and Pearce plays him especially wry most actors think Nicolas Cage would've hammed it up too much or been unconvincing.Snow is tasked with rescuing the president's daughter Grace who is stuck on a maximum security prison in space that has incurred a major security breach. These are the world's most dangerous criminals plus they have been in stasis for any number of years which has made them even nuttier. Joseph Gilgun as Rydell one of two Scottish prisoners trying to run the uprising is a particularly deranged fellow reminiscent of a demented Groundskeeper Willie.Both Rydell and the other main baddie Alex Vincent Regan have a coldblooded edge that could have made for an effective Rrated ransom thriller reminiscent of late '90s films like Air Force One but the devilmaycare attitude of the entire movie ultimately clashes with these darker moments even though they do make you take the movie more seriously than you would otherwise.After a little bit of context at the beginning to properly motivate Snow both he and us are effectively shot from a canon. The story only slows down a bit toward the end but it mostly plays out as a series of dominoes. The action doesn't satisfy so much as the pace and the threat of violence now here's a good example of how you do PG13 violence but it's well done aside from an opening motorcycle sequence shot on green screen and outfitted with an effects job that really shows the budget.Aside from that the futuristic scifi elements stay pretty classynothing overdone or distracting. The gadgets provide some creativity to a number of the sequences and the script manages to inject some unpredictability into a story that could not have a more obvious trajectory.Despite the selfawareness at points with a lot of that credit going to Pearce Lockout tries especially hard to be entertaining on too many fronts aspiring to be the consummate popcorn flick rather than just identifying one tone and sticking with it. The final scene on the space prison strangely evokes the original Star Wars Death Star run as if to make sure the audience gets to munch on some sci fifantasy before the credits roll.It's hard to fault Lockout for aiming to please considering that that spirit seems to be the driving force behind the movie's strengths as well as its weaknesses. Although the number of attempts at humor might catch some folks off guard Lockout offers what anyone interested in the film would expect if for no other reason than its built upon tons of tropes from previously effective movies. In turn Lockout is effective but not too much more.Steven CThanks for reading! Check out moviemusereviews.com".

That anyone could enjoy such a derivative tongueincheek low ambition piece of schlock is surely cause for venomous spleen venting from the serio film brigade. They call them guilty pleasures but thing is I just don't feel guilty about having such a wonderfully fun filled great time with the Luc Besson produced Lockout.Plot? Well it's the future and basically Guy Pearce Snow is wrongly convicted of a crime and sentenced to do stir in stasis until whenever. But up in space at the MS1 prison facility home to all the maniacs found in Demolition Man the president's daughter dogooder babe Emilie Warnock Maggie Grace is suddenly taken captive and it's a big hostage situation. This looks like a mission for a serious hard bastard type! Well Snake Plissken wasn't available so they get Snow who is bulked up full of wise cracks and has a point to prove. Guess what follows? Yep complete popcorn frenzy as Pearce and Grace cut a swathe through MS1 and have a date with coolness personified.On the way via a truly gorgeous scifi affected Bluray print we will tick off the homages and influences and compare notes with our viewing partners about how it's a Snake Plissken movie but with Shane Black type dialogue. While those who are partial to a bit of scifi design are well served here. Because even though there might be the worst CGI effects ever during a chase scene that mercifully only runs for 50 seconds the space ships sets and Torsion System sequence prove that you don't need Michael Bay type bucks to please the eyes. From the quite brilliant and hilarious opening interrogation beat down to the big reveal and punch line this Besson produced piece is serving popcorn with a smile to a certain segment in the film watching populace.With bits of the Snake Plissken movies Fortress Die Hard Commando Demolition Man Minority Report Last Boy Scout and any other quip laden dudewronged man on a mission movie Lockout clearly lacks originality. But seriously! Was anyone involved playing it as anything other than a sly homage movie? No they wasn't. Pearce is great fun in the role but he isn't trying to worry the highbrow crowd's votes for films of the year. Anyone viewing it expecting something cerebral should feel more guilty than those who stand up to say they had a great time watching it. Ingem Ferem. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "When I watched Lockout I didn't even know it was from Luc Besson until I saw his name at the start of the movie. This got me excited remembering how I like his past films especially The Fifth Element. Besson's films seem to have that unique polish and style that places them in a class between A and B movies. They always have some ludicrous scenes and effects included similar to B movies but they are definitely justified in the end by how much Class A fun and twists the overall experience it generates for the viewers. If we measure this movie on those aspects Lockout is no different from Luc's other films although this one is special in a way that it brought back fond memories for people like me who were already actively seeing films like this back in the 80's and 90's. Lockout is a modern version of those films with some new concepts added from this era. Some of the nonBesson filmsTV series that Lockout reminded me of are Army of Darkness Cowboy Bebop Die Hard Escape from New York Fortress Firefly  Serenity Minority Report and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.I can see that Lockout like most of the other movies I previously specified can also have a cult following. So I truly hope the current generation will like this movie enough to give it a chance to have a sequel. Sometimes you just need to relax your mind and allow it just the right amount of activity to enjoy a fun cruise like this type of films can provide. More power to Mr. Besson!".

I was a bit puzzled that the inmates in America's topsecurity prison all seemed to be from Glasgow and that it seemed to be costarring George Galloway but the performances are great. Pearce is really cool and the psycho prisoner acts his socks off. If you're used to watching thrillers you'll guess a lot of the plot turns but overall I believe it deserves to be getting a lot better reviews. Overall it was great fun.".

This could get a bit tiresome and does limit the character's range but his comedy is so effortless it just somehow works! The Villains in the movie two Scottish brothers played by Joseph Gilgun and Vincent Regan are also played very well although Joseph Gilgun's role as the crazier brother is the more interesting of the two. This guy plays crazy a little too good. Joseph Gilgun is better known from the British Scifi series Misfits where he replaced Robert Sheehan after watching him in this role I hope he brings some of this character to the next season.....OK listen I'll be the first to admit that the plot is recycled the effects are Meh and the script is pretty barebones. But the comedy saves this movie and makes it a real gem. If you find Pierce's character funny you are are going to enjoy this movie period. So as Mr. Snow said Here's an Apple and a Gun.

There is also a sub plot that could have been more interesting than the actual plot and may be used in the hope of a sequel. Lockouts action is good and many of the prisoners look intimidating. However the movie fails to really connect with anyone and the movies hero only delivers snarky comments instead of real dialogue making him one sided. The movie is also entirely predictable leaving no room for surprises. There is the seasoned veteran man saving woman aspect but unfortunately this is not taken. I would say that Lockout is not a complete loss but a better rental than movie trip.

Although  Lockout still might be a little bit lightweight to be considered a box office hit in spite of the explosive and spectacular action sequences and a couple of familiar fresh faces. Lockout based on an original concept idea by the mighty respectable Luc Besson initially feels overwhelming and imposing but it's actually one of the most derivative action thrillers you'll ever see. The plot borrow its main story lines and characterizations from a series of world famous as well as lesser known SciFi classicsgems. The setting of a supposedly inescapable maximum security prison floating around in space comes from the early 90's cult favorite Fortress the premise of a noble convict sent in to try and evacuate a presidential relative naturally comes from John Carpenter's legendary SciFi monument Escape from New York and Guy Pearce's character Snow fires off as many witty oneliners as Bruce Willis did in all of the Die Hard movies combined. The year is 2079 and Pearce depicts an elite secret agent wrongfully accused of espionage and murder but the only evidence that can set him free has gone missing. Snow is about to be sent to MS1 a super hitech penitentiary in space when all of a sudden riots break out. Snow is nonetheless sent to MS1 not as a prisoner but as the last hope to bring back the president's daughter Emilie who was there to investigate the effects of brain stagnation and accidentally caused the prison disorder. Lockout is definitely amusing while it lasts but it's unmemorable and occasionally even too preposterous for its own good. The structure of the film is logical and most of the key sequences are easy to predict but at least it's fun to behold the excessive violence and some of the overthetop performances like Guy Pearce and particularly the prototypical British scumbag Joseph Gilgun as the indescribably psychotic and maniacal inmate Hydell. The CGIeffects are surprisingly inane and laughable. There's one scene in particular that is quite terrible namely near the beginning when Snow tries to escape from a crime scene on a motorcycle seemingly borrowed from Minority Report. That sequence actually looks as if you're watching a video game. Premiered at the annual Belgian Festival of Fantastic Films.".

It turns out that the President's daughter Maggie Grace was on the prison for a humanitarian effort when the convicts broke free and have taken her hostage. Now Snow is offered his freedom in exchange for getting on the prison ship and saving her. Yes this is certainly a major ripoff of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK but without the charm excitement and great characters. It's really a shame LOCKOUT turned out so bad because it could have worked on many levels. Back in the early 80s there were a whole slew of ripoffs coming out from Italy Germany and various other countries and these would play in driveins or lowrent theaters. LOCKOUT could have worked like those films but the direction here is just so poor that it's really hard to be caught up in anything going on. It also doesn't help that the film is burdened with a PG13 rating which takes away any possible sleaze aspect and you can tell that certain scenes appeared to be cut down to avoid anything too graphic. This is really silly because there are points in the film where people are decapitated and there are jokes built around such events and yet it's all editing down. Another problem is that the direction just never packs any punch in regards to drama action and even the fight scenes are boring. The characters are all standard stereotypes and none of them are interesting. This is especially true of the Grace character who is just downright annoying stupid and you can't help but hope something bad happens to her. Pearce at least turns in a good performance even if it is rather sad seeing someone so talented appear in stuff like this. The one thing the film does have going for it are some pretty funny oneliners and they're perfectly delivered by Pearce. LOCKOUT could have been something but what it turns out to be is a silly lowrent action movie trapped in a PG13 universe with direction that just keeps bringing it down.".

This is really silly because there are points in the film where people are decapitated and there are jokes built around such events and yet it's all editing down. Another problem is that the direction just never packs any punch in regards to drama action and even the fight scenes are boring. The characters are all standard stereotypes and none of them are interesting. This is especially true of the Grace character who is just downright annoying stupid and you can't help but hope something bad happens to her. Pearce at least turns in a good performance even if it is rather sad seeing someone so talented appear in stuff like this. The one thing the film does have going for it are some pretty funny oneliners and they're perfectly delivered by Pearce. LOCKOUT could have been something but what it turns out to be is a silly lowrent action movie trapped in a PG13 universe with direction that just keeps bringing it down.";

	schema:headline " Relentless FastPaced Action that Helps  Hurts It";
	schema:reviewBody "The latest actionthriller from Luc Besson Taken follows a similar formula of his other action films. Lockout jumps right into the action and refuses to slow down. The premise is somewhat original with many elements from other future isolated prison films. I think the best way to describe this movie without giving away too many details is that is a cross between John Carpenter's Escape From New York and David Fincher's Alien3 minus the alien of course.Guy Pearce plays a wise cracking hardened government agent who following some misunderstanding with his superiors has to go into space on a solo rescue mission for the President of the U.S.'s daughter Maggie Grace who is trapped on a run wild womenless prison holding murders and rapists used for conducting experiments. Okay maybe the premise is not too original. Pearce's portrayal of Snow is one action movie fans will like he can take a punch while delivering effortless oneliners much like Bruce Willis did in Die Hard. But I will say the zippy comebacks get annoying at times some were great zingers I will admit but there are some that were unnecessary. You got the idea Snow didn't give a crap about anything without them. Maggie Grace was a typical damsel in distress nothing much else to add there. The villains were kind of creepy Joseph Gilgun was off the wall but predictable and same could be said for the leader played by Vincent Regan. I actually thought of Peter Stormare as Langral as the major antagonist rather than the prisoners.Like I say in the title it has action from start to finish which has advantages and disadvantages. The very original special effects were fantastic and fight scenes were well done which made the movie go by very fast. The problem with so much action is that the story gets jumbled or rushed. Besson used this for Taken and it worked out for it but with Lockout there were some things missing or flaws in the story. One was there seemed to be some references to the President being like a tyrant by Pearce's character but it is never really explained. Overall it was a fun movie great action with soso acting and an interesting outer space setting. 710 for me maybe if it were 15 minutes longer it could have made up for its flaws.".

This is a homage to the old days when action movies knew what they were and embraced it those with knowledge of the old days should recognize most homages instantly. Guy Pearce was a good lead for this was he perfect? No I could think of a few guys who could do the role but it worked. Pearce stars as Snow...a chain smoking hard nosed  wise cracking exspecial agent with one chance to regain his freedom. The movie is worth watching for the banter alone it's constant and it's funny. There are some very nice action scenes I expect no less from a guy like Luc Besson. However my main complaints are from a lack of brutality an R rated movie centering around a prison riot should have plenty of that. My other complaint is the most memorable villain in the movie didn't get a very memorable send off. Overall I've watched this twice now and will again take it for what it is. A homage to the old school action heroes in that sense the film is near perfect".

Besson's films are always entertaining and his better ones invariably become cult classics.Unfortunately despite the fact that Besson both cowrote and produced Lockout the film just doesn't live up to its billing.Guy Pearce stars as Snow a former CIA agent convicted of murder and sentenced to 30 years in stasis aboard an experimental orbital prison. At the same time the President's daughter Emily Maggie Grace arrives at the prison for an informal inspection. When things go wrong and the inmates take over the prison Snow is offered a chance at redemption if he agrees to go in and rescue Emily before she gets killed.It's a pretty good concept despite some similarities to Escape From New York but the execution is poor. It starts incredibly well showing off the film's sense of humor and a surprising amount of charisma from Pearce. The alwayssarcasticandegotistical schtick however wears thin after about 1520 minutes and we're left with a surprisingly unsatisfying action picture.The set pieces are surprisingly tame and altogether underwhelming an issue that may be somewhat alleviated by the RatedR version of the film that was released in other countries including Canada.The action is further hindered by extremely below average visual effects which only make it harder to take it seriously. There are a couple of effects near the beginning that are so bad that they pull the viewer completely out of the movie something unforgivable in a modern action film.Grace is adequate as Emily a typical morethansheseemstobe damsel in distress. Her interactions with Snow are decent but again tame. The dialogue is OK at times awful at others. The conflict and tension between Emily and Snow is often manufactured and rarely makes sense and each situation exists solely to service another scene later. There is no rhyme or reason to a lot of what goes on which would be less noticeable in a film with more intriguing action.The film's supporting characters including the inmates are given no development so even though the performances are fine they lack depth.In fairness the film makers do get a few points for tossing in a couple of curveballs that actually make sense and don't seem out of left field but in the end the lack of interesting set pieces makes the film's other flaws stand out even more. Lockout had a lot of promise but fails to follow through on almost any of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Lockout' is like a relic dug up from the '90s because the plot is a composite of elements taken from 'Escape from L.A.' 'Fortress 2' and many other actionSciFi flicks from that era. I can only surmise screen writers James Mather and Stephen St. Leger wanted to make a retro tribute  if that was the intention they succeeded. Guy Pearce plays futuristic CIA agent Snow who's framed for murder when a mission goes wrong. Fortunately for him the President's daughter Emilie Warnock played by Maggie Grace is taken hostage during a fact finding visit to a high security space station prison where the convicts are kept in stasis. So Snow gets the chance to redeem himself by going to rescue her. Formulaic to the nth degree the plot proceeds as the escaped convicts take over the prison. They are led by two Scottish brothers Alex Vincent Regan and the deeply psychotic Hydell brilliantly portrayed by Joe Gilgun. As you expect Snow and Emilie have to team up to fight off the inmates and escape the space station. Further complication is added as one prisoner holds the key to clearing character name's record. What lets this movie down is its predictability. You can almost guess character name's one liners before he says them. Nothing in the plot is a surprise or even vaguely innovative. Without Joe Gilgun's character all the cast would have been one dimensional movie stereotypes. Emilie is a throw back female lead only there to be threatened and rescued. She doesn't seriously try to fight back or take control it's all down to character name to do the hard work whilst she complains and makes the inevitable switch from hostility to romance. Having said all that I did have a nostalgic fondness for 'Lockout' I can imagine renting it on VHS from my local shop or watching it on ITV late night on the small portable I had when I was a teenager living with my parents. If you fancy a trip down memory lane and have a couple of hours to kill then go see it but you'd be best saving some money and waiting for the home release.".

I visited both countries and my opinion is the Russian actors in this film don't look like Finns and don't behave like them. Such Russian stars as Leonov Nevinnyy and Vitsin are wasted and silliness creeps in from the very start and then builds up and clogs up everything. The director Gayday made quite a number of really witty situation comedies. Unfortunately this is not one of them. Try 'Twelve Chairs' or 'Kidnapping Caucasian Style' instead.".

If you want to see how people really appeared lived and responded to the actual culture in Israel at the time of the birth of Christ this is a work of art.The Nativity is an excellent depiction of the actual events as we know them from the Bible. While it has very minor flaws these are buried under the number of things that make this film accurate and authentic.Mary does not wear her piety on her sleeve and get hysterical and dramatic at every turn in the story. Instead she is accurately portrayed and played as a simple peasant girl in a very traditional culture with strict rules of behavior. She responds hesitantly but with faith to the events that focus on her.Joseph is equally realistic as a young peasant just beginning life and any man who has ever faced marriage for the first time will appreciate the dilemmas facing Joseph and his reactions to them.Herod is an historicallyaccurate and ruthless jerk but the movie does not overdo his part. The balance is just right he's on camera enough to convey his wickedness and his part in the plot but not enough to distract from the message.The wise men are great! Instead of being simple plastic figures in a nativity scene on your mantle they really come to life add a lot of context to the movie and provide a lot of information about how and why things happened as they did. The timing of the wise men's arrival may be off  but no one is 100 certain when they did arrive so this is not a big deal.When the shepherds are visited by an angel to announce the birth of Christ the angel is not followed visibly by a heavenly host praising God  but you can hear them.I could go on and on and on but the point is that this is an excellent depiction of events that occurred in Israel 2000 years ago. If you want to learn about and marvel at what life was really like at that time see the movie. It will bolster your faith. If you want to see Adam Sandler playing a Jewish Santa Claus to celebrate Christimas this is probably not the movie for you.".

And surprisingly I think it translates very well onto the screen.

It was nice to see actors of the correct age and race. Jesus was not white despite what some may say.The movie was not perfect few are.

The Magi gave him the answer concerning the prophecy that he feared and in doing so realized by his hypocritical reaction that he feared the prophecy. Hardwicke also gave us I believe a strong Mary. But she reminded us that Mary was YOUNG. She also did not present a romanticized view of Mary's and Joseph's betrothal but what is probably a more realistic one.Theirs was an arranged marriage. Joseph could have accused Mary of adultery and she may have been stoned. I thought that both Mary and Joseph were well cast. What young girl wouldn't have been confused and perhaps resentful of her arranged marriage when she still wanted to play and have fun? Yet she grew throughout the film to love her child her husband and humankind. He is for all of mankind. I also appreciated the reminders of what reality must have been like for Joseph. A beautiful young couple to watch together and the baby chosen for Jesus was stunning. Loved the story loved the film. Extremely worthy effort. It will go in my permanent collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Nativity Story was the ideal Christmas film this year and really stunned me that it didn't do better for what it was worth. Part of that problem was it's release time so that it was gone from a lot of theaters before Christmas even approached. Nonetheless Nativity Story was brilliantly filmed and had some stunning cinematography and created an indepth story into Mary mother of Jesus and her struggle with the conception birth and her promised husband. It was almost more of a love story about the two of them and the most brilliant thing the writer and director could have done for this film was that they managed to make it as nonreligious as possible. I mean considering the story is about the birth of Christ which the Christian denomination relies on they still managed to make this film watchable by anyone as a sort of beautiful story or even a legend or a historical epic. You don't have to be of any school of belief to see this movie and enjoy it's romance and gritty story. Director Catherine Hardwicke is not exactly a seasoned director and yet she has had some real success with gritty real life stories like Lords of Dogtown and Thirteen under her belt. She transfers her ability to capture the human spirit into this story of Mary.She also had the talent of the young and lovely Keisha CastleHughes as Mary. She is only sixteen years old and captures the intelligence deep spirituality of the young mother and all the turmoil surrounding her lifestyle. This is the only film I have ever seen that portrays what negative fall out would have came upon Mary for showing up pregnant unwed and scared. CastleHuges shows an incredible maturity in her performance and is the perfect casting for the role. Also fairly new to the screen is Oscar Isaac who plays her promised husband and carpenter Joseph. Issac is twenty six years old and they show a deep bond and an incredible love unfolding as they journey to his home city of Bethleham. Issac creates an unconditionally loving husband and man a strong man of virtue and you see in him what would make a great father for the Son of God. Talented character actor Ciarn Hinds is barely recognizable in the role as the evil King Herod. His part is fairly small save for a few appearances and speeches but his role is effective and he makes the role of King Herod quite apparent as an adversary and the villain of the film. Also a notable performance is by another actress who is making her way into a terrific character actor Shohreh Aghdashloo most notably for me from 24The TV Series. She plays Mary's cousin Elizabeth who nurtures and guides her spiritually through her first months pregnant.The film is less about the actual birth of Christ and more a deep emotional character journey revolving around Mary. How does this sudden pregnancy and prophecy effect her? How does her engagement to Joseph effect her and their trip that sees them falling in love and her realizing his strength and finally the scenes in the manger where the child is born which is both glorifying and yet anyone can love these scenes. Filmed almost entirely in Spain they utilize some truly breath taking spots to recreate the rough terrain and the trip they would have before them. In no other film has Mary and Joseph been captured in such a truly deep and spectacular way. Now the film does drag a little and there seems to be more than necessary when it comes to finite details about the traveling. Also I found the Three wise men a little stereotypical and often inappropriately funny. They were deliberately used as comic relief which I will say was amusing with their sarcastic anecdotes and banter among themselves but it felt very out of place for the film and broke the more emotional parts. Everything is in tact from the story though and the screen writer didn't stray too far from the original story. I insist no matter who you are or what your beliefs that you see this film because it's beautiful and touching and I think anyone can enjoy it's strong message of love. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Although the Nativity seems like it happened a long time ago 2000 years is only one sixth of recorded history and one fiftieth of the time that homo sapiens has existed. The physical features of Palestine Isreal and Egypt are for all intents and purpose identical to what they are now. The people while shorter and thinner are indistinguishable from ourselves. Although there is certainly differences of opinion as to all religious elements of Christianity as it relates to Christ Mary and Joseph it is somewhat well established that Jesus Mary and Joseph did exist as did King Herod the astrological phenomenon of the Star the census etc. In that light The Nativity Story is a reverend and authentic attempt to successfully convey the words actions and general physical and political environment of that time. It is also an attempt to convey the physical hardships of the time the economy of thought and word the limited aspirations of people 2000 years ago and the simple faith that has a good deal to do with the success of Western culture to this day. The acting is totally appropriate while many have commented that Keisha Castle Hughes is emotionless and Joseph simple of thought and action it reflects the attitude of a world where 50 of children died and an above average life was to be married at 14 and dead at 40. The supporting actors are totally believable even the wise men who offer limited comic relief are appropriately reverend and humble. The scenery and cinematography are magnificent.

	onyx:emotionText "Although the Nativity seems like it happened a long time ago 2000 years is only one sixth of recorded history and one fiftieth of the time that homo sapiens has existed. The physical features of Palestine Isreal and Egypt are for all intents and purpose identical to what they are now. The people while shorter and thinner are indistinguishable from ourselves. Although there is certainly differences of opinion as to all religious elements of Christianity as it relates to Christ Mary and Joseph it is somewhat well established that Jesus Mary and Joseph did exist as did King Herod the astrological phenomenon of the Star the census etc. In that light The Nativity Story is a reverend and authentic attempt to successfully convey the words actions and general physical and political environment of that time. It is also an attempt to convey the physical hardships of the time the economy of thought and word the limited aspirations of people 2000 years ago and the simple faith that has a good deal to do with the success of Western culture to this day. The acting is totally appropriate while many have commented that Keisha Castle Hughes is emotionless and Joseph simple of thought and action it reflects the attitude of a world where 50 of children died and an above average life was to be married at 14 and dead at 40. The supporting actors are totally believable even the wise men who offer limited comic relief are appropriately reverend and humble. The scenery and cinematography are magnificent. All in all a must see for everyone old enough to understand the story probably 8 and up.With the materialistic sarcastic garbage out there about Christmas light wars drunken Santas etc this is an ideal way for a whole family to spend a night at Christmas and reflect afterwords as to what they saw.";

	schema:headline " A Realistic Spin on a Timeless Story";
	schema:reviewBody "The Nativity Story Don't miss it  its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. Here's my 17 yearold daughter's review hot from a 23rd November 2006 London preview so this is a typical teenage take on the new release. The film has a realistic spin she told me shortly after exiting the theatre but toward the end it got so overdone like the old Christmas films with a star shining through a hole in the roof of the stable scenario. The wise men appear right there in the stable on the same night Jesus was born and lo and behold there were three of them! Contrary to popular myth the Bible never does mention the number of wise men. The film was well paced at the beginning she agreed but toward the end it seemed rushed like they had to finish off the 100 minutes of screen time. This may reflect the tight production schedule  how many movies make it from a blank piece of paper to worldwide theatrical release in 12 months? An amazing accomplishment by any standard.Asked about the humour angle my daughter thinks that it ..could have done with a little humour yes the wise men did add some comedy flavour but it wasn't that funny. Also she didn't like the name the title reminding her of ...every single nativity film you're ever likely to see. For me however the title is simple and straightforward  just like the movie which she rates at around 710. The IMDb rating linked to this piece reflects my own unashamedly generous rating especially in light of the clear antiChristian bias evident in some reviews of this production.Interesting that I had to remind my daughter who Keisha CastleHughes is both these beautiful young women are around the same age as it happens but she made the connection in the end and thinks Keisha turned in a quite tidy understated performance. For me although the film does show evidence of being rushed through production especially the final act I do take my hat off to Mike Rich for turning out that screenplay in one month start to finish and to Catherine Hardwicke for actually getting this to the screen for Christmas 2006.Regardless of how she rates the finished screentime at least my daughter got to see The Nativity Story several days earlier than Pope Benedict XVI and a theatre full of cardinals for its Vatican world premier. Note the pope was in Turkey at the time so didn't actually see it at all! My take on the film is that it brings us back to the time when one could openly be thankful for that quite amazing birth so long ago and not have to make apologies to be politically correct. Whether one believes or not certainly a historychanging event. I do hope that this rendition on the big screen does well at the boxoffice. It deserves to because despite the title and while it stays rooted to the ancient religious drama genre it simply isn't like any other nativity film you're ever likely to see!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Nativity Story is by no means a commercial portrayal of the Biblical story. I'll admit this. The power of the film and what in my view makes it far and away the best thing to happen to Christmas films in a long time is that it is indeed a realistic portrayal of human emotions.When I say the previews for the release I knew that this was going to be something interesting. Since the movie is based on the lovable retelling of Jesus' birth I knew that I wouldn't be disappointed. And after leaving the theaters to say the least I was pleased. The acting was phenomenal. To say that I completely fell in love with the character of Mary whom was brilliantly played by Keisha CastleHughes would be a complete understatement. Someone who was so pure obedient and virtuous is in my mind what all of us should attempt to become. As Mary stated I have broken no vow. It is clear that CastleHuhghes has acquired the maturity and intellect that was essential in playing such a prestigious role.I loved how the film acknowledges that Mary was only a child when she became the mother of Jesus and the movie shows the emotional transformation of Mary. During her pregnancy Mary had experienced the power of bravery the depth of kindness the miracle of life and the profoundness of love. As a result she had grown from a frightened and unaccepted child to a woman. I appreciated the portrayal of Joseph in the film. In the Catholic Church Joseph is rarely though of however in this film he was incredibly realistic and acted exactly as I have always imagined Joseph. Though Joseph was frightened he was humble. As Mary stated he is a man that puts others needs before his. He protected cared and loved Mary despite what others thought of her. Congrats to Oscar Isaac for doing an amazing job as portraying Josephs character.What I find to be the most brilliant about the film is that it is as nonreligious as possible. The movie is in many ways a gritty love story about a couple and their growing relationship through times of tragedy. Catherine Hardwicke has a reputation for directing films that portray the gritty teenage essence and she takes her talent of amazing depictions of the teenage nature to the story of the beloved Virgin Mary. This is an excellent Christmas film and I encourage everyone to see it!".

Can you even imagine a 1314 year old Jewish girl in that time being told by an angel of God that she is to bear the Messiah she will become the Mother of God? This movie shows the very human sides of Mary and Joseph and the difficulties they must have encountered while preparing for the 2nd most monumental event in history the birth of Christ the greatest event of course was His Passion and Resurrection.I loved this movie and hope everyone can enjoy it!".

It fills in the blanks missing from the traditional story by populating it with Mary's family their village King Herod's crowd et cetera. The acting pacing photography are flawless the Nativity Scene brilliant.Special attention ought to be given to the most recent advertising of the picture which begins with an Attack on Christmas theme the Christmas tree stripping of SeaTac Airport and leads into a few seconds of the sacred scenes. This was an electric shock motivation as far as we were concerned quickly rising our lazy butts from the easy chair we hunted up one of the last lingering screenings attending one at the inconvenient hour of 555 pm. Normally a quiet if not dead time in theaters this one was almost capacity.The year 2006 is perhaps the worst year in 60 years in terms of film quality. Taking this one together with Apocalypso we saw the two best backtoback. Add The Illusionist and Eight Below and you have my complete list of this pathetic year's quality movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure this commentary contains spoilers but the consequences of spoiling are too severe to take chances! This is an exceedingly well done film with actor selection and actor work being absolutely top notch. They all sell their parts very well. The humor break provided by the three kings is very appropriate in an otherwise quite serious movie. At the same time these 3 fine actors can portray a seriousness and understanding that is not at all at odds with their humorous side. Their appearance at the stable toward the end of the movie is a phenomenal scene. Ciaran Hinds does a fantastic job as Herod as does Oscar Isaac as Joseph. The role of Mary is an exceedingly difficult one and it took a bit of reflection to decide that it was in fact done very well by Ms. Keisha CastleHughes played low key simply and humbly and lest others forget like me appropriate to the young she was when the momentous event took place. The angel's part is played out superbly  another very difficult role don't wanna be sappy sentimental or any other numerous ways it could have been mishandled. The old shepherd is a heart breaker. I had only two problems with the movie one trivial one a bit more serious. Trivial first. Too much camera movement in the scenes with the angel. Action or simulated motion isn't needed there and indeed detracts from the encounter. More serious Mary's journey to Elizabeth would IMHO have been better treated as journey of absolute joy rather than a checkandsee kind of event. I won't give away the Gibsonian moment of this film a Gibsonian moment is a filmic presentation of an event in a religious movie that has no basis in Scripture or elsewhere but is absolutely so fantastic and fitting that it elevates the movie to a towering height it would not achieve without it. It first occurred in The Passion and is the moment when the tear of God over the death of His Son falls on the earth. There is a Gibsonian moment in this film and the filmmakers imagination is to be highly commended for it. In sum this movie exceeded all my expectations.".

The Wise Men and their comic relief were welcome. The producer chose to follow the traditional approach in portraying the story of the birth of Christ by having the Wise Men at the Nativity even though the biblical account reveals that when they arrived in Bethlehem the scene had moved to a house and the baby had become a child. Entering the house they saw the child with Mary His mother and falling to their knees they worshiped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented Him with gifts gold frankincense and myrrh Matthew 211. However there is nothing objectionable in the dramatic portrayal of the Wise Men. The tensions that must have been present with Mary's pregnancy were appropriately presented. Surely this will be a Christmas season staple in the offerings of television and video.

The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet but Megatron blasts off in search of it. He eventually tracks it to the planet of Earth circa 1850 but his reckless desire for power sends him right into the Arctic Ocean and the sheer cold forces him into a paralyzed state. His body is later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky but before going into a comatose state Megatron uses the last of his energy to engrave into the Captain's glasses a map showing the location of the Allspark and to send a transmission to Cybertron.

	schema:headline " When Summer Blockbusters Go Really REALLY Wrong.";
	schema:reviewBody "When the announcement came for a new Transformers movie for Summer I was pretty excited. I wasn't a major Transformers fan but I had fond memories of the cartoon and toys. However I hated the redesigned Transformers thinking that these new designs were an overly busy cross between Lego's Bionicle toys and expressionist modern art sculptures. I also heard the script was poor so I decided to skip this one.However I started hearing movie reviews about what an amazing film this was. The greatest film of all time! people proclaimed. So I came to terms with and accepted that these weren't the robots I grew up with this was a new version and I'd at least find interest in robots transforming into cars and beating each other up. I'd even go see this even though I don't like Michael Bay films.How was it? Transformers is a disgustingly bloated and selfindulgent piece of crap. I understand that I'll get rated down for my review but I'm prepared to accept that. Sadly my theater must not have gotten the euphoria inducing gas that apparently other theaters got causing me to gush over this film like other people.Even the 1986 Transformers film wasn't perfect. It was basically one fight scene after another and was a means to replace the old toys for a new line but the action was good showed the consequences of war and featured the death of a beloved character. It kept true to the mythos even though it was different. This movie makes reference to so many other films that it feels like a mishmash of 30 films you've seen before.Bumblebee sends up an Autobat Symbol to summon the other Autobots like Batman. There's a scene in an underground bunker which felt totally pulled from Terminator 3 and a few scenes later uses the exact drumbeat from the Terminator Theme. The fight scenes with their out of focus cameras and shaky cam style seems like they are trying to treat the battles as if they were Saving Private Ryan caliber. When Bumblebee gets captured during a scene the music swells up so mournfully and overdramatically that it makes the tragedies found in Schindler's List seem modest.The biggest problem in character design lies in the fact that they all really do look alike. The worst offender was the Decepticon Frenzy which looked like a 3D rendered pencil scribble and acted like the Zuni Fetish Doll from Trilogy of Terror. During the final battle I was having problems telling who was who and when the robots collided it was hard to see where one began and the other ended. The car forms were presented as blatant product showcases ripped straight from a commercial. Then again there was so much product placement in the film. eBay must have made a fortune.The slow setup to the action or even any real glimpses of the title characters felt like The Hulk. I pay for a movie about transforming robots that's what I want to see.Why would they keep a deadly robot under Hoover Dam a major water source and tourist attraction? Why would they bring this AllSpark out of the desert and into a heavilypopulated city where property damage and civilian casualties could run their full course. The dialogue was painful sounded like it was written for teenagers by teenagers in a really bad fanfic like what they thought people would say. What really irked me is how the Autobots couldn't seem to kill a Decepticon but a lone soldier skidding on his back could dispatch one with a single shot. Why were the Autobots even there if the humans could do it better? How is it that they can save Bumblebee but they can't repair Jazz? What was the difference? The governmentmilitaryrobotanyone dialogue was totally unrealistic with officials willing to bet their ridiculously high government paychecks on hunches. Every line smacked on bad puns clichs or just sounded stupid. There was an extended conversation about masturbation between Sam and his parents that felt really awkward and extended far too long.The personalities were also way underdeveloped. Transformers has over two decades of history that wasn't touched upon. The Starscream and Megatron rivalry where Starscream tried to usurp Megatron for leadership was not mentioned or covered at all. Jazz was cool and funloving with a sense of style while in the film he sounds like a ghetto thug. His first line is profanity and I felt insulted. Not because of the language but the fact that this was apparently the best the writers could do. Decepticons were introduced and blown away within minutes. The Autobots weren't much better. Did the people who wrote the story know anything about the subject material besides the fact that robots changed to vehicles? And then Optimus Prime. Obviously Bay's madness knew better than to totally ruin this character as he was the only robot who looked even remotely familiar to any previous version. And the personality was fairly accurate... up to the backyard scene where Prime's personality suddenly shifts breaks character and he becomes a clumsy comedian. The next scene he shifts back into a leader personality.The saving grace outside of Prime was Sam Witwicky played by Shia LaBeouf who brought a credible gee whiz performance to the film and yet I felt sorry for him using such hamfisted dialogue.Summer 2007 has been really mediocre for blockbuster films as we're apparently supposed to lower our standards sit back not think and enjoy with these types of films but how is one supposed to do that with with film devoid of heart personality or no focus on the main characters? As a standalone film this is a really bad movie. As a Transformerslicensed film it's a God awful embarrassment. I'm avoiding the sequels unless they drastically overhaul the franchise and get a script not limited to highschool level online fanfic.".

And the personality was fairly accurate... up to the backyard scene where Prime's personality suddenly shifts breaks character and he becomes a clumsy comedian. The next scene he shifts back into a leader personality.The saving grace outside of Prime was Sam Witwicky played by Shia LaBeouf who brought a credible gee whiz performance to the film and yet I felt sorry for him using such hamfisted dialogue.Summer 2007 has been really mediocre for blockbuster films as we're apparently supposed to lower our standards sit back not think and enjoy with these types of films but how is one supposed to do that with with film devoid of heart personality or no focus on the main characters? As a standalone film this is a really bad movie. As a Transformerslicensed film it's a God awful embarrassment. I'm avoiding the sequels unless they drastically overhaul the franchise and get a script not limited to highschool level online fanfic.";

Maybe these'll be in the director's cut.Except of course Ed Wood's movies had heart even at their worst they feel like more than exercises in featurelength product placement. Bay doesn't have anything even remotely resembling a heart in his chest  that's why he's not even in Wood's league as a bad director no matter how many laughs his terrible films get. And at least Wood's films didn't cost 150 million to make.I'm a Transformers fan from way back. I've got an Optimus Prime and a Megatron atop one of my bookshelves. I have ancient videotapes of the fondly remembered cartoon series and a copy of the 20th anniversary movie DVD. I had worried that this film would damage my childhood memories beyond repair like Star Wars Episode I did. But the film is just TOO bad and TOO stupid to have any real effect on me. The old animated movie bad as it is mops the floor with this one. If anything it is a more mature! and entertaining work. The music in the old movie is terrible but it fits. The music here is just terrible.There are good points but none anywhere near enough. John Turturro is the only actor who escapes this mess unscathed  his great overthetop performance suggests that he actually understands how Zgrade the script he was given was. He's a lot of fun to watch even as he's quickly reduced to a nonentity by the plot mechanics. Turturro is a great actor and this part only serves to elevate his status in my eyes. I hope he got a serious paycheck.I can't stand CGI as a rule but the special effects here are moderately convincing at least in those rare moments when the camera isn't performing idiotic cartwheels to obscure them. I honestly like the models for the new TFs the Autobots anyway  I can barely tell the Decepticons apart but the fact that they have little personality isn't so endearing.Maybe the sequel will be up to the lofty standards of Ed Wood's Night of the Ghouls. But I doubt it.".

Anyway here is just a brief summary of all the good and bad this movie has to offer.The GoodThe transformations I'm surprised at how well they made the transformations work. Optimus Prime Bumblebee and Megatron don't look half as bad as I thought they would. It's nice to see the parts warp and change instead of watching these big blocky characters that were in the cartoon.The BadOn my where do I start...The jokes were awful. For some reason they decided to make this movie as a crossover between American Pie and Transformers. Bumblee lubricating the man and Sam masturbating just wasn't funny. The only people who were laughing in the audience were little kids.The humans stole the show. I thought Transformers was supposed to be about the Transformers themselves who each had unique personalities with a little human action thrown in the background. Instead the tables are reversed where we are FORCED to spend lengthy amounts of time with characters the audience truly doesn't give a rat's ass about. Who cares about Sam Whitwickey? Or that smart programming chick? Or that fat donut eater? Who honestly gives? This is a Transformers movie folks not a love story with some dumb robots thrown in for kicks. Oh and Sam himself was super duper irritating and annoying.The choreography was terrible. Some fight scenes were cool enough but the shaky camera movements and extreme closeups made it difficult to tell what was going on. The fight between Megatron and Optimus proved to be extremely disappointing as we are only given a few shots of Optimus punching and tripping Megatron while the army tries to destroy Blackout. They completely destroyed the Transformers back story. Those even remotely interested in the Transformers will know that they came from Cybertron and that their ship crashed on Earth only to be revived centuries later. But here Cybertron is destroyed to pieces with no chance of it ever being revived. Well I guess the Transformers are screwed folks ... but they already were when Michael Bay decided to direct.In short if you were expecting to see a movie about the Transformers you were sadly mistaken. Be prepared to spend hours focusing on Sam and his loser girlfriend instead. Also why the hell did it take an hour and a half for Optimus Prime to show up in the first place that to me is a disgrace.".

Big explosions highpriced special effects meant to dazzle generic comedy and female cast members meant to dazzle are just about all this movie has to offer and it all culminates in a big battle in downtown Los Angeles that by nature and setup is almost as implausible as even the inclination that a guy with Shia LeBouf's face could score a pity date with a girl that looks like Megan Fox without fame or fortune to help. Yet as a summer movie the audience is not simply sold this idea but expected to accept it in a neat marketable package complete with overwhelming amounts of product placement. As a result a vicious cycle is born. Visuals reign over every aspect of this film as it does in many of its kind which leaves little room for anything else that is supposed to make up a movie and too often the story is the first victim and audiences buy into it like a toddler distracted by a shiny set of keys. The robot effects are nothing short of impressive but with the price tag on this production they should be at the least. However movies are not simply pretty moving pictures. The story does matter and that is why blockbusters are considered by many to be a joke.Transformers is really no different from the blockbusters that have become easy cannon fodder either. Plotholes and inconsistencies are usually considered a hindrance but in a movie like Transformers the audience is supposed to accept the idea that taking the catalyst for the movie's battles into town to in affect endanger countless lives is a good plan. Not only that but taking it by helicopter is safe or sensible when two of the most violent pursuers can easily fly faster and would be willing to shoot the helicopter down. All of the characters are shallow and sometimes superfluous. Look no further than Anthony Anderson's character for an example of a role that takes up time unnecessarily and is ultimately meaningless. In this case even a lead character in Optimus Prime is not fully developed. Much of what we know about him depends solely on preexisting knowledge of the franchise. For anyone else his nobility is simply to be taken at face value without much of a basis. When you see him bypass a crashing helicopter for the allspark coughMacGuffincough it really makes all of the talk about protecting humans feel a little pretentious. Then again the very design of the robots in this movie are contradictory.If the Autobots and Decepticons are supposed to be alien robots their designs don't reflect that at all. The fact that Bumblebee has an engine is really absurd. He's not a car he just needs to look like one to an outsider. Optimus Prime's face looks like it's constructed of truck parts when if he is meant to be a robot first and truck second he should just have a face...period. The same can be said for all of the robots look at Blackout's hand in the closeup for example. Too much of their look is steeped in the technology of Earth when that really doesn't make any sense considering their origins. But that's only a part of the problem here. The real problem lies in the shitty cinematography and even lousier action. Fights in this movie look like scrapmetal tumbleweeds. A lot of what goes on is indecipherable nonsense that lasts all of seconds onscreen WHEN it actually is onscreen. Even the climatic final battle is rather anticlimatic.In the end what you're left with is a stain of formula right down to the awful GooGoo Dolls song that accompanies the ultraimplausible halfass teen romanticcomedy that most of this movie centers around augmented by promilitarism in the most idiotic and insipid way. Plenty of detail went into the SFX of the movie but even that was misdirected. The story didn't receive half as much attention and it wouldn't have taken 18 of the work and that is one of the key flaws. If effects were all that mattered then there really would be no such thing as a good or bad movie and that goes double for the BS inclination toward judging a movie for what it is. Narrative is more important than the whizzbang and aintthatcool of special effects. One need look no further than a lowertech classic of the genre like Aliens or Terminator 2 to see my point. Comedy also shouldn't be so painfully transparent as that defeats the purpose of the joke. If you don't see that you probably like this movie. If that's the case then you should know that you're ing up the genre for the rest of us...".

	schema:headline " Someone stop Bay for the love of God...";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay i'm 23 years old pretty well educated in both life and film and have decided to review this is 2 sections1 as a transformers fan 2 as a member of public who knows nothing about transformers.So...1 Well This film was always going to be very different from the cartoon. I was just surprised by how little respect Michael Bay clearly has for the original. Read the boards and you will see a list as long as your arm about 'fan boy' faults...Prime has blue flames jazz acts like he's from the ghetto etc. I won't list the whole list but it's enough to say that Bay probably has NEVER watched a TF cartoon in his life. Another major gripe is there was outrage at the 'nonmass shifting' rule they placed on the robots meaning Megatron couldn't be a gun Prime couldn't have a trailer and Soundwave couldn't be a cassette all would require their sizes to change during transformation yet the 'allspark' CAN change for seemingly no reason. Hypercrites. I would rant longer but i don't want to say more than a 1000 words.2 As a nonfan i found this film RUBBISH. Bay cannot direct. The simplest rules of directing seem unheard of to him as one meaningless action scene blends into another followed by 10 minute scenes of tanks planes or other military hardware. The humour is well not funny and the script badly written. The actors try but really can't do much with this rubbish filled with plot holes big enough for unicron to fall through. A word for the visuals as well  rushed. Each battle scene is so shaky and unfocused that i couldn't physically watch the screen most of the time. I felt nothing for any of the characters and left the cinema wondering why i'd wasted my time on this pap.110".

	onyx:emotionText "Okay i'm 23 years old pretty well educated in both life and film and have decided to review this is 2 sections1 as a transformers fan 2 as a member of public who knows nothing about transformers.So...1 Well This film was always going to be very different from the cartoon. I was just surprised by how little respect Michael Bay clearly has for the original. Read the boards and you will see a list as long as your arm about 'fan boy' faults...Prime has blue flames jazz acts like he's from the ghetto etc. I won't list the whole list but it's enough to say that Bay probably has NEVER watched a TF cartoon in his life. Another major gripe is there was outrage at the 'nonmass shifting' rule they placed on the robots meaning Megatron couldn't be a gun Prime couldn't have a trailer and Soundwave couldn't be a cassette all would require their sizes to change during transformation yet the 'allspark' CAN change for seemingly no reason.

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see an advance screening of Transformers tonight and I walked out of the theater in disbelief. Not because the movie wasn't what I thought it would be but on the contrary it was so much more than I had ever expected.Going into the theater I was expecting a corny kids movie with decent acting and a fantastic unrealistic plot. Needless to say the plot was indeed fantastic and unrealistic but it was all kept in check with solid acting and the most incredible display of visual effects that I have EVER seen. Most...actually almost all of the acting credit in this movie has to go to Shia LaBeouf whom is quickly becoming a Hollywood star after recently giving an excellent performance in the thriller Disturbia. It was another great performance from Shia in Transformers with his clever wit still ever present.However the most impressive aspect of Transformers was most certainly the special effects. The robot vs. robot fight scenes were in a word remarkable. I didn't know that modern day special effects could produce images so fantastic AND realistic to the point where the robots didn't seem computer generated at all. The interaction between human and robot was beautiful and flawless. It seemed like the actors were actually interacting with real 50 foot tall robots during the movie. Transformers will without a doubt be the pioneer for future cinematic visual effects.The plot may have been a little unrealistic and some of the acting a little sketchy at times but it does not in any way override what was truly an entertaining movie. The plot simply stayed true as best it could to the cartoon story without becoming overly ridiculous or corny. When I say unrealistic that does not mean cartooncorny. In fact I would recommend that ANYONE over the age of 13 go to see this movie. I promise you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "After having been forced to watch Pearl Harbor a couple of years ago and for my memory's sake I wish it was 50 years ago I promised myself to never go see a Michael Bay movie again. However a friend of mine tried to convince me that Transformers might be worth an attempt based on the fact that a nonhistory related actionpacked comicandtoyfranchiseadaption might be a fitting theme for a megalomaniac director like Bay. Even the critics who booed Pearl Harbor back then said that Bay had finally found his genre and that Transformers was indeed an enjoyable popcorn movie. So my buddy and me went to the cinema.... and I painfully realized I should have stuck to my promise!!! I'm still looking for negative superlatives to describe the movie because awful horrible worst movie ever and complete waste of time and brain cells just don't quite say it.I don't know where to begin... well let's start with the overall impression of the director's efforts. I had the feeling of watching not an entire movie but a line up of trailers from different genres. Bay was genrehopping from infantile American Pielike humor pretty much every scene with Sam his parents and the girl to cheesy drama when Bumblebee gets caught and last but not least to horrifyingly pathetic gung ho heroism made in the U.S.A.! And it went back and forth all through the movie without the slightest attempt to get these connected in a bearable manner. Every single scene felt completely out of place due to the previous and following one. Screenplay and editing were virtually nonexistent.The characters be it human or Transformer were all totally mundane archetypal in a horrible way and completely clichdominated. My heart bled when I saw John Turturro embarrassing himself with this joke of a character. But it's not the actors' fault that the characters came out so thin. Given the screenplay I would say that the Teletubbies would have been the most appropriate cast for both the protagonists and the villains.The effects were top notch yes but nowadays that's not an achievement anymore is it? Especially not if you can afford to hire the most expensive FX Company in the world. And still Bay manages to spoil the action by shooting it so fast that it was almost impossible to see any details. Pretty much all the robot fights were one big blur on the screen  which is far away from what I call enjoyable special effects.One last point of criticism before I come to my destructive conclusion for this flick Subtlety! That's what Bay needs to learn among a lot of other things! Subtlety! You just can't go over the top for 140 minutes straight! Not even in an actionpacked SF robot whatever movie. It's simply too much! So far every single Michael Bay movie I had to endure felt like a bad stimulus satiation. This isn't filmmaking this is cheap grandstanding for big business.Summary for Transformers The latest and saddest proof that talent is no longer of any value in blockbuster Hollywood. Not sure exactly how high the production costs were probably once again the highest in Hollywood history so far but as far as I am concerned every single dollar was wasted in this project. I can only advise you to keep the money and spare yourself the brain damage. I have definitely drawn my conclusion from this and will never watch a Michael Bay movie again.".

	schema:reviewBody "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.Anyone who has seen a previous Michael Bay movie knows exactly what to expect so I went to the movie theater very cautious about what I was about to see and tried not to think about it as a movie based on a beloved show from my childhood and rather as a big budget action fest with robots.There are just too many problems with this movie. Like all Bay movies its at least a half hour too long. It has both unnecessary scenes and too many characters and thus no character development. The action scenes are both drawn out and short at the same time. There are long periods of action yes but each Decepticon that is fought is generally defeated very quickly so don't expect to see any decent robotonrobot battles that last any longer than a few seconds. The action scenes specifically the ones involving Transformers fighting each other are very hard to follow. For example I have no idea how Bumblebee lost its legs or how exactly Optimus Prime lost his fight with Megatron and neither did any of the people I was with. There are definitely plenty of explosions and a good deal of action...the only problem is that the action isn't actually any good.Much of the dialog was cheesy and half a dozen times people in the audience broke out in laughter in scenes that were definitely not meant to be funny simply because of how bad the dialog was at times.The movie portrays the Decepticons as unstoppable killing machines but shows the Autobots as awkward bumbling fools. The scene at the Witwicky's is especially bad as the Autobots refuse to listen to Sam and apparently cannot movie with any hint of finesse instead managing to crush anything near them or just trip over their own feet. The Autobots generally serve no purpose throughout the movie but to provide comic relief and many of them have very little onscreen time or dialog. Are we supposed to believe that the Autobots can learn English from watching television but cant learn anything about earth in the process? There are also a number of obvious plot holes in the movie that practically jump out and slap you across the face. A good example of this is how Megatron had been frozen for thousands of years but immediately after being resurrected could speak English perfectly.As a Transformers movie there is very little here resembling the original series. The characters all act and look very different from their G1 counterparts. The vehicles they transform into are now all brand new GM automobiles which are featured throughout the movie. Other advertisements are rampant as well for example the mountain dew soda machine that turns into a Transformer covered in mountain dew advertisements and fires cans of mountain dew at people....which is probably the only way they could get anyone to drink it.Unfortunately I couldn't enjoy this as a Transformers movie or as a big budget action flick...it is just too horribly directed. When I saw it a dozen people walked out and many booed at the end. I cant blame them.There's plenty of other flaws to point out but unfortunately I just don't have that much free time. If you can turn off your brain and watch the movie without thinking about anything you are seeing as a person has to do with any other of Bays films you may enjoy it. If you like coherent story lines and character development then this movie is not for you.".

	schema:headline " How could Hollywood mess this sure thing up? What a shameful disaster!";
	schema:reviewBody "This deafeningly loud obnoxious usually stagnant and glorified epic disaster of a film was presented with too many opportunities to be one of the alltime greatest summer flicks ever. However despite the advancements in today's special effects it being inspired from the highly popular 1980's Hasbro toys and cartoon with Steven Spielberg overseeing the production as an Executive producer Michael Bay and his writers were still guilty of making this a steaming pile. I can effortlessly breakdown at every level why this film didn't work for me.The story was about a teenager name Sam Shia LaBeouf who purchases a car that happens to be a robot in disguise from another world. Sam is then caught in the middle of an ancient battle between two groups of these alien robots the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons. Both are seeking a mysterious cube known as the Allspark that contains their life source. This central plot intertwines with the story of a special ops team being attacked by one of the Decepticons in the beginning the pentagon enlisting teams of computer hackers to decode a signal they detected that ultimately came from the Decepticons and a hokey love story between Sam and Mikaela the gorgeous bombshell in his class.As intriguing as all of this may sound besides the many battle scenes car chases attempts on Sam's life and Decepticon attacks nothing happens to move the story along. Whatever layers of stories that were suppose to be happening beneath the unimpressive action sequences were uneventful and slow. So all you're left with is the action which by the end was boring and tedious to watch.The characters were flat and moronic. The humans were onenote soulless caricatures. They were also more than capable of damaging the robots which took away from the extraordinary antagonism the original cartoon presented for our human heroes. The humans were helpless against the Decepticons and this made the Autobots necessary. In this absurd film the humans didn't really need the Autobots to take out the Decepticons.And whatever happened to characters like Jorge Fig Figueroa and Maggie? They sort or left this film halfway to the end to join the film playing in the theater next door.Also part of the cartoon's success was the personalities of the Transformers. They were emotional beings that were capable of treacherous loyal courageous cowardice morose and optimistic behavior. They weren't just giant piles of junk destroying an American metropolis. Whatever happened to the ongoing struggle for power over the Decepticons between Starscream and Megatron? This would've added some real complexity to this paperthin story. Instead Bay and the writers settled for hinting at it with a laughable oneliner from Megatron that rang falser than the action. Wasn't Bumblebee the kindest frailest of them all? He was essential for his undying compassion for the humans in the cartoons. Not in this film where he obviously fought in many battles and when annoyed can urinate on a human being at any given time. Now going from the true character to the characterizations of the robots the looks of the original were more engaging and attractive to the eye. In this film they looked like metal scraps of junk.Then the films auteur had to take it there by making Jazz the Transformer with the BlackAmerican soul screaming What up bes? Ironically he was the only Autobot that easily gets killed as well. Now a lesser minded person would pull the race card for this. I would just blame it on lazy unimaginative sloppy hack writing and directing. In the end I couldn't care less about any of the characters human or Transformer.The original Transformers could be chastised for wooden dialogue. However when the characters weren't trying to be funny in this film the dialogue was ten times worse than that of the cheesy words spoken in the cartoon. It was absolutely ridiculous with zero subtext. The quality of the dialogue was lessoned in scenes where exposition was inappropriately forced in like the ineptly written scene when Agent Simmons John Turturro was questioning Sam and Mikael in the backseat of the SUV revealing Mikaelas' weak back story. And how many times did Optimus Prime have to tell us his name? At one point I thought he was forgetting the many times he said his name previously. Besides the whole introducingyourselfthing from the Transformers especially the Decepticons was extra cheddar cheesy to me I am Megatron! Yeah and?! The monologues underscored by the sappy music could've gotten the collective heavehove from this film as well.The special effects were cool but could've been better. Most of the time the Transformers looked animated instead of real in my opinion. And the confusing unorthodox way they transformed not to mention detailing that made them look like piles of scrap metal revealed most of the flaws in the cartoon like computer generated images. As a director I wouldn't be satisfied with the end result.The most entertaining thing about sitting through a screening of this film was the hordes of people that were going ballistic over it. They laughed at anything and applauded for everything. From Bumblebee shattering all the glass in and around the car dealership to the Autobots skidding in unison on a UTurn these people thought every little thing deserved a standing ovation. Okay maybe they were not standing. But it was all so laughable to me.In my opinion Bay Spielberg and the writers massacred what could've been one of the greatest scifi films ever made. The only thing amazing about this experience was my girl sleeping through most of it with me nodding off right along side her. Bay has proved himself to be one of the worst overpaid film directors in the history of Hollywood.".

In this film they looked like metal scraps of junk.Then the films auteur had to take it there by making Jazz the Transformer with the BlackAmerican soul screaming What up bes? Ironically he was the only Autobot that easily gets killed as well. Now a lesser minded person would pull the race card for this. I would just blame it on lazy unimaginative sloppy hack writing and directing. In the end I couldn't care less about any of the characters human or Transformer.The original Transformers could be chastised for wooden dialogue. However when the characters weren't trying to be funny in this film the dialogue was ten times worse than that of the cheesy words spoken in the cartoon. It was absolutely ridiculous with zero subtext. The quality of the dialogue was lessoned in scenes where exposition was inappropriately forced in like the ineptly written scene when Agent Simmons John Turturro was questioning Sam and Mikael in the backseat of the SUV revealing Mikaelas' weak back story. And how many times did Optimus Prime have to tell us his name? At one point I thought he was forgetting the many times he said his name previously. Besides the whole introducingyourselfthing from the Transformers especially the Decepticons was extra cheddar cheesy to me I am Megatron! Yeah and?! The monologues underscored by the sappy music could've gotten the collective heavehove from this film as well.The special effects were cool but could've been better. Most of the time the Transformers looked animated instead of real in my opinion. And the confusing unorthodox way they transformed not to mention detailing that made them look like piles of scrap metal revealed most of the flaws in the cartoon like computer generated images. As a director I wouldn't be satisfied with the end result.The most entertaining thing about sitting through a screening of this film was the hordes of people that were going ballistic over it. They laughed at anything and applauded for everything. From Bumblebee shattering all the glass in and around the car dealership to the Autobots skidding in unison on a UTurn these people thought every little thing deserved a standing ovation. Okay maybe they were not standing. But it was all so laughable to me.In my opinion Bay Spielberg and the writers massacred what could've been one of the greatest scifi films ever made. The only thing amazing about this experience was my girl sleeping through most of it with me nodding off right along side her. Bay has proved himself to be one of the worst overpaid film directors in the history of Hollywood.";

The subplot of the signal detection team who did nothing except point out that some alien being had hacked the networka nobrainer could be cut without losing anything of note except for the funny scene where Anthony Anderson's onscreen cousin gets tackled by the FBI agent into the pool. And what's with Bumblebee pissing on the FBI Agent and Mikaela making him take his clothes off? The action scenes are stellar but not enough to make up for all of the other mistakes in the movie.

Seen by the Autobots as life that should be protected and by the Decepticons as insignificant obstacles the characters that made Transformers so popular were the transformers themselves.Alas Michael Bay's vision was obviously something quite different.After an outstanding exposition in which we meet the lead and supporting characters the movie goes downhill. Fast. Full of plot holes that invalidate half the events of the movie and stupid writing that just doesn't make sense Transformers severely makes me doubt the abilities of its writers then again one of its writers did do Catwoman AND The Core  two more stupid movies.Plot flaws? That's right! The better part of the movie is spent following the two factions as they race to find a map Megatron made to the 'Allspark'. Naturally we later find out that the Allspark was moved by the humans AFTER the map was made to a place specifically selected to prevent the transformers from finding it. But does that stop them from using the now invalid map to find it? Not at all! The map leads them right to it. Somehow.So now the Allspark is found but entrusted to Bumblebee. And what does a US special forces operative decide to do? That's right  drive it into the middle of a large city where hundreds if not thousands of people can be killed in the inevitable battle between 20 foot tall transforming robots.A good story can be set in the present day or in Shakespeare's time or Ancient Rome underwater or in space. Your characters can be humans farm animals or robots and if it's a good story little will be lost.So why did Bay find it necessary to give the transformers barely any lines or decent screen time? And why were half their scenes just petty jokes I refer to the fartoolong scene in which the transformers act like complete idiots as Witwicky searches for his Grandfather's glasses. It was funny for about 2 minutes. The other 30 minutes were just painful.? I don't think I could ever run out of bad things to say about this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Summer action flicks should never be seen with the preconceived notion of high expectations. The reason for this is simple eye candy films that are released when school is out aim for a youthful demographic who are simply looking for good way to kill 2 and half hours. These films can be instant blockbusters even without a coherent plot or compelling dialogue. Films about massive robots based on a toy line which wreak havoc narrow the demographic further and lower the bar of cinematic standards but throw in wannabe epic director Michael Bay Armageddon Pearl Harbor and you can guarantee the trailer will pull in other audiences. I never played with the toys or watched the cartoon but it can be assured nothing more meets the eye than CGI goo and decent Foley artists on sound in Transformers.The basic plot involves the benevolent Autobots and their archenemies Decepticons dragging their robot war on Earth as if humans didn't have enough of their own war mongering to deal with. The Decepticons are looking for their cube which is powerful enough to create new robot life or destroy Middle Earth..err...the universe but the Autobots are willing to have Frodo...I mean... Sam Shia LeBeouf sacrifice the cube and new transformer life for the victory of the human race. The stereotyped prodigies give hope to nerds everywhere teenage intelligence agents a computer hacker even a car mechanic with too much make up. Sam probably feels left out as the average kid but is reassured later that you're a soldier  too. Michael Bay who is only good at directing big locations blowing up on camera  struggled to find a logical reason for the final battle. He fails at doing so and consequently has a character suggest with knowledge of an impending robot onslaught to rendezvous in a major human population area. Everyone else including the Secretary of Defense John Voight quickly agrees to this idea of jeopardizing the safety of an entire city. I have this to say to Michael Bay No pushing the story along so you can have your 20 minute destructoscene isn't going to make me forget about that line earlier in the movie. You know the one where the boy films the Autobot simultaneously crash landing and yells Wow! This is cooler than Armageddon! I didn't sit down in the theater expecting fine cinematic quality but I don't want to see a movie where the director services himself for what he believes to be past accomplishments.At least there were a few well done casting elements. Shia LeBeouf was good as the quick witted underdog student but I'm afraid he is in danger of being typecast. Didn't I already see him play this role in Disturbia? John Turturro as the oddly likable top secret agent also makes the monotonous dialogue scenes more dynamic. Most importantly the film lacked Michael Bay's favorite fan boy Ben Affleck It was reported that for this reason the crew had to stop production for a week because Bay locked himself in the bathroom sobbing uncontrollably. Hugo Weaving The Matrix The Lord of the Rings was in the film voicing Megatron but you wouldn't know it considering his two lame lines. Then there's Sam's caked up love interest Meagan Fox who besides the horrible acting loses points for actually saying Sam whatever happens I'm glad I got in the car with you. It must have been a homage to every poorly delivered cheese ball romance line in the the history of cinema.At least Bay who sold his soul to corporate America in this film didn't force her to to replace the word car with Camaro. It wouldn't have been surprising considering I counted 11 different products being shamelessly placed throughout the entire film. Ebay is not the only online auction site I'm not letting Bay have that one. As for the rest was it really necessary to show the words GMC and Camaro as if the movie was a car commercial? Was it really necessary to include the words Blackberry Nokia and Energizer in under a minute of dialogue? Did John Turturro feel as sold out as I did for not walking out when I heard him say ...your little Taco Bell dog?I only stayed for the duration of the movie to write this review which will never happen again if I witness such disgusting product placement. A summer action flick about fighting robots is tolerable but the special effects weren't even that great. A shot without any movement other than the CGI spectacles isn't live action it's animation. The music sounds stripped from another Bay film. Take away those elements Bay's pathetic direction the typecast characters the poorly written plot and all you have left is the sound which actually made the film audibly pleasing. I salute you Erik Aadahl and friends of the sound department. Michael Bay please take the advice of Matt Stone and Trey Parker and stop making movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the advance screening a few days ago and in a nutshell two whole years of anticipation were stripped away by a flash of severe disappointment within the first 45 mins of this film. I'm a hardcore G1 fan and can't tell you how blasphemous this film is to those of us who who followed the original series from Cybertronian history to character profiles and traits.The script itself is utter garbage and reminiscent of a Disney film with ultralame jokes and childish references. The mere reference to teenage masturbation in one scene is just completely uncalled for and unnecessary in this film. Too much focus was placed on the human characters than the Transformers themselves who are the stars of the show. It's sad that the original film in '86 was a lot darker than this slop that Dreamworks has tastelessly thrown together and expected us to swallow. There's absolutely no character development regarding either clan of robots. The only thing keeping my attention was Peter Cullen's voice as 'Prime...that's the ONLY justice Dreamworks has afforded this film. I understand they needed new body styles to fit today's society...not a problem...but they should still have the same basic look in robot mode and the same voices!! Starscream was everyone's favourite Decepticon...he looked awesome and his trademark voice made the character. He's now absolutely hideous completely beyond recognition and his voice is just as low and bland as the rest of the characters.Way too much comedy in this film...Transformers don't tiptoe around people's front lawns in the middle of the night trying not to be seen by human parents...that's lame. Transformers is an epic intergalactic war over ENERGON not this allspark that Dreamworks fabricated. It's a dark battle like Lord of the Rings but with Cybertronians! My last argument has to be the scoresoundtrack. Talk about minimalist...Steve Jablonsky did NOTHING for this film. Was Danny Elfman not available?! All my fellow fans out there need to know that the Transformers theme song does NOT even appear in the film ANYWHERE by ANY means. Not even a melodic reference to it in the orchestral score which I find completely absurd. The band Mute Math did the theme for the soundtrack allegedly though it never actually plays in the film not even over the end credits!! From start to finish this was absolute mockery of all traits that made the original series and film so great...it's nothing now. I'm forced to pretend this new film doesn't even exist because it's defiled the Transformer name so bad...a complete injustice to my expectations as a true fan. If they have the nerve to make sequels to this slop I refuse to watch.".

As strange as such a premise might sound I can imagine a fun actionpacked summer movie based it. This is not this movie. The common wisdom about Michael Bay is that if his movies are not really masterpieces of storytelling and character development at least he can deliver some kickass action sequences. Transformers should put an end to this inept storytelling and cardboard characters yes great action sequences no! Even though his subject matter is gigantic by nature Bay insists on keeping his camera close to the ground and to the robots cutting so fast that the end result is one big ugly visual mess it's impossible to figure out what's happening as the screen is filled with closeup of scrap metals moving fast. The rest of the direction is just as incompetent constant mindless camera move and fast editing in a typical ADD style to make us forget that most of the time nothing really interesting happens on the screen. And what about the awkward transitions from broad daylight to night time which occurs not once but three times in the whole movie! The script is simply awful filled with plot holes stereotypical characters terrible dialog and ridiculous attempt at humor the 15mn scene where the cute autobots try to hide from the main character's parents in their backyard is simply an embarrassment for anybody past 5year old. Add to the bad acting especially by veteran actors who should know better yes John Turturro and Jon Voigt I'm talking about you!. The only one to stand up from this trainwreck is Shia Leboeuf although his character is the stereotypical awkward teenager found in countless other movies he manages to make him more sympathetic and a little bit less onedimensional that it should be. Otherwise besides ILM's amazing FX but who's still impressed by CGI these days there is not much to recommend about transformers without any doubt the worst movie I saw at a theater in the last months.".

When i heard that they were going to do live action movie I thought 'Wow its got to be impossible to get that wrong!' You could be forgiven for thinking that a movie about waring giant robots that transform into various vehicles would be about robots. So I would have to ask where were they?? What were they doing?? In this movie they get very little screen time and even less character development than a dog which is called 'Mojo' in case you were wondering.Optimus prime hardly has anything intelligent to say why they made him into another Lee Evans or even Charlie Chaplin I'll never know when he does say something intelligent its a huge dramatic speech. By the time he breaks out a speech you are genuinely shocked he's capable of it due to his bumbling foolish mannerism he is presented with.As if that wasn't bad enough this movie has too many story lines going on at once which detracts from what should be the main story line of the Transformers themselves. At times it tries to be a teen romantic drama and at others some sort of slapstick comedy movie.The movies effect are faultless ILM did a wonderful job. Their effects are the only reason this movie gets anything above a 1. I just wish the same could be said about everyone else involved.I'm not going to comment upon the acting here as I believe the underlining fault with the movie was with the choice of script and and the direction.If you MUST see this film don't worry you can fall asleep and not miss anything. Take someone who will wake you up for the last 20 minutes and you should be happy. The rest of the movie is a waste of your life.PS Someone please give Michael Bay a romantic comedy film to make starring Hugh Grant so he can stop ruining action movies and my childhood memories.".

Sadly Transformers fell below the bar considerably. I understand that story takes a back seat in a film of this nature but did they have to drag it behind the chariot over a street laden with potholes and speed bumps? Overly long scenes that attempted humor were nothing more than filler for Michael Bay's inept storytelling ability. Every authority figure was treated as a complete moron the only plot device Bay knows.There was also a useless scene featuring an obscured view of George Bush asking for some Hostess DingDongs used as a bridge to show us the covert ops boombox robot hack Air Force 1 computer systems from the storage area. What? Huh? Yeah I didn't get it either.'Transformers' has a lot of bark but no bite. The action scenes were heavily edited so as not to let us really sink our teeth into them. I wanted to see Bublebee trash Barricade. I wanted to see Prime get in some shots at Megatron instead of getting his trasmission handed to him. I don't care if Sam's parents are overbearing. Nothing in the movie adds to anyone's character arc. The only cool things about this movie are The BumblebeeBarricade chase which wasn't even CGI and the...wait I can't think of anything else that was cool. Bay teases us cruelly with dramatic tension then lets it fall flat by skipping what could have been the best part of the scene and giving us the results instead. He forgets that 'Transformers' is about gigantic robots in knockdown dragout fights for the fate of humanity and themselves. The battle seemed only for the fate of the editing room under the crushing weight of the egomaniacal director.The PrimeMegatron fight started out to be the most awesome moment ever. One shall stand one shall fall. says Optimus in a classic moment as we cut to Sam running around and his girlfriend towing Bumblebee before cutting back to see Optimus defeated and Sam killing Megatron. What? Huh? Yeah didn't think it could get worse did ya? END SPOILERS The special effects were abused horribly. I was cheated. This movie doesn't deserve the high rating it is getting. Probably due to Dreamworks shilling the vote system. I wouldn't be surprised. Hopefully people pick their brains out of the trash can once they've seen the movie and give it the 4 or less it really deserves. This movie does nothing more than to prove that Spielberg's Hollywood no longer cares. ADHD directors like Michael Bay should be blackballed. Hollywood should just die and let the knowledgeable independent filmmakers to rule so that maybe yet again we can have movies of substance instead of bankrolls.Skip this monstrosity of a film. And pray that a new director can be hired if they make a sequel. Heck I'd even settle for Brett Ratner.".

Not only was their behavior evocative of stoners and idiots they lumbered around his backyard and later in the movie peed on a federal agent. There was even one transformer I forget the name and I am all the better for it that talked like he was from the projects. The plotting was puerile and idiotic. There was even a subplot where Shia LeBeouf's love interest was discovered to have a criminal record but that subplot was handily absolved five minutes later when Shia LeBeouf cuts a deal with the government. SO STUPID AND POINTLESS! Not to mention the movie abounded with Michael Bay's neverending car chases and slowmotion hoohah. Very very bad scripting like I'm not leaving without Bumblebee! and the leader of the good Transformers saying Oops my bad made for a horrible experience.The bulk of the movie was terrible. The acting aside from noticeably realistic screams from Shia and others was stilted and just perfect for the sort of film that doesn't even hide that it relies wholly on specialeffects and the toy franchise itself the kind of things that Michael Bay loves to beat over moviegoers' heads like a blunt object.".

The only positive thing I can say is that the transformers where done in very good detail which seems to only make me starve for the movie I had hoped to see.Very very very very sad.";

Forget that it was basically a twohour commercial for the army. The bottom line is that this was the worst looking 150 million dollar movie I have ever seen. It looked like a bunch of actors in front of a blue screen pretending to interact with extremely cartoonishlooking robots.And what was that garbage about how most of the transformers almost never spoke? It was like they couldn't be bothered to write dialogue so they made the robots mostly mute and tried to fill time with lame subplots like the army guy trying to get home to see his daughter. Seriously any jerk can try to pull you in with cheap sentimentality but it is pretty obvious that Michael Bay couldn't make a movie with anything resembling real emotion or dialogue if his life depended on it. With this movie Bay has solidified his position as the worst director of our generation. I would rather watch two hours of security camera footage of a garbage dump that watch this movie again.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is ACTION. I say this first because if you think this movie will be anything more than this you will be disappointed on some level as I was. Frame for frame this movie screams Michael Bay.Now that's out of the way there's a lot of stuff here that works and a lot that doesn't. It's a good thing that the robots do work. Seeing autobots and decepticons in glorious photorealistic CGI is enough to wring out any childhood fantasy from anybody not just boys from the 80s. Watching these robots move is to realize a revelation to what is possible with modern movie effects. Whether it's transforming on the move bashing the living daylights out of each other or just standing and talking these guys alone make the movie work. And unlike the other blockbusters that have came out this year these effects have a sense of weight that adds so much to the visual satisfaction.As for everything else well... that's when things start to go downhill. In typical epic fashion this movie contains a sprawling cast. Along with this however are a large number of writing and acting issues. With such a large number of underdeveloped characters names are pretty much luxury. Also most of the human related humor gags miss badly which makes it hurt more considering a lot of the characters were unnecessary. Jon Voight's Secretary of Defense character completely baffles me which makes me think that audiences responded positively to the President in Independence Day doing aerial dogfights. Any positives from the supporting cast including the strange yet entertaining overacting of John Turturro are outweighed by the large set of negatives.However the cast has got it where it counts. Shia Lebeouf plays an important part in selling the reality of the robots as the lead character Sam and also carries an easy likability factor. Megan Fox's acting does a reasonable job bringing some interest to her character to beyond her looks. The voice cast also does an overall superb job. Peter Cullen IS Prime and although his dialogue does border on the ridiculous he always has a sense of gravity to his lines. Hugo Weaving also does an equally commendable job as Megatron His booming entrance will forever be embedded into the minds of little kids everywhere. The rest of the transformers don't say much which is a shame because I wanted to see so much more interplay between them The taunts that Optimus and Megatron yell as their fighting is great stuff.Another major gripe I have is Bay's ADD editing. Although it does keep the movie constantly moving it creates some issues with continuity and distracts from some of the action probably the biggest crime committed in the movie.I could go on and on about the good things Bumblebee Frenzy and the bad things Anthony Anderson and his family forgotten Barricade and the downright weird things Dubya's cameo Sam's friend climbing in a tree. Overall the film delivers where it really matters. Although I was disappointed the amount of potential for the sequel which just got greenlighted just gets me giddy is it too much to ask for a tighter script and better acting? Also the Autobot Assemble scene is one of the coolest things I've seen in theaters in years.".

I was one of several hundred packed like sardines into the theater. Fortunately I did not have to sit on the floor like the rush ticket holders.It was unbelievable! A sick and twisted tale5 tales actually of coincidence deceitsmall town mentality and goodor badintentions gone miserably wrong. Hilary Swank is brilliant as a convenience store worker so afraid to lose her job she opts to chance suffering tremendous injury over practicing a little common sense.

I can't say enough about this movie.

Ensemble cast includes Rachael Leigh Cook Henry Thomas Shawn Hatosy Stark Sands Colin Hanks Ben Foster Barbara Hershey Clark Gregg Patrick Swayze and Hilary Swank.It was directed by Greg Marcks.The film involves a series of interconnected events that converge up to the same time at 1114 p.m. The connections between the events are not apparent at first but are gradually revealed by a series of progressively receding flashbacks1 Jack who has been drinking is seen driving along a road at night talking on his cell phone. The clock on the dashboard reads 1114 p.m. Suddenly as he drives under an overpass something smashes across the windshield causing him to skid off the road. He stops by a deer crossing sign and gets out to inspect the damage and finds a human body with a badly mutilated face lying close to his car. When he sees another car approaching he panics and drags the body out of sight2Teenagers Tim Mark and Eddie are driving around causing trouble by throwing things out of the windows of Mark's van including a book they have set on fire3Frank is walking his dog late at night and discovers his daughter's car keys next to the dead body of Aaron in the cemetery. Thinking his daughter is responsible for the death Frank packs the body in the trunk of Aaron's car accidentally locking the keys in with the body4Buzzy is working at a convenience store late at night. Her friend and coworker Duffy arrives and they begin discussing Cheri's pregnancy and money needed for an abortion and 5Cheri leaves her house to have sex with Aaron at the cemetery. Aaron is reclining against a tombstone that has a stone angel on top. The angel's neck is damaged and the heavy stone head falls onto Aaron's face killing him instantly and mutilating his face.The camera pans to Cheri's cell phone which reads 1114 p.m.This is an enjoyable and smartly directed comedy thriller with a clever script and engaging performances from its ensemble cast especially Hillary Swank and Patrick Swayze. The solid screenplay satisfyingly clicks everything together unraveling little mysteries as it goes and leaving nothing hanging. The audience is made privy to connections between the characters that they themselves are unaware of and they will see how various lies and deceptions lead to murder.Ultimatelythis is an enjoyable and entertaining film.".

This is a black comedy drama movie which is extremely well directed by firsttimer Greg Marcks. I was drawn into these different characters lives. I saw this in home and you know what the really weird part is? It ended at exactly 1114 pm. I didn't time the movie before seeing it! That was simply coincidence and really weird. The opening credits music is simply so cool.There are 5 stories intertwined cleverly with each other and it doesn't lead up to the same ending. All the separate plots happen at 1114 pm and it is very entertaining to watch these people go about their night. The opening story involves a roadkill which is not his fault second involves the decapitation of a penis and another roadkill which is definitely the driver's fault the third story involves getting rid of a body by the father of a hot girl the fourth involves a robbery the fifth revolves around a cheating hot girl.This film has Colin Hanks Rachael Leigh Cook Hilary Swank Patrick Swayze Jason Segel 'How I Met Your Mother' he is totally unrecognizable here and several other good actors. This is a very cool movie and the background score is really amazing. If not for the background score this would have been a serious drama. Some scenes will really gross you out but at the same time they are hilarious too. These characters keep running into each other and very bad things happen. The dialogues are witty and real and this young cast really keep it up. Hilary Swank is brilliant as a convenience store worker so afraid to lose her job she opts to suffer injury over practicing a little common sense. Patrick Swayze utilizes his intensity and tendency towards the dramatic to comedically portray the world's most overprotective Father. The most excellent performance is by Rachael Leigh Cook who as the trashy hot Cherie is just the right combination of evil and desperate. Even in her trailer park costume she's breathtakingly beautiful! Anyway it is a very cool watch.810".

After modest filmfestival exposure it played briefly in San Francisco in August 2005 over two years after it was completed but that's a cruel twist of fate for such a cleverly twisted movie about cruel twists of fate. Destined for sleeper status on DVD and given a slightly higher profile by Hilary Swank's subsequent Oscarwinning performance in Million Dollar Baby the audacious debut of writerdirector Greg Marcks boasts a fantastic cast in a smartly constructed comedythriller partly inspired by Blood Simple in which a fatal traffic accident is examined and reexamined from multiple perspectives. The flashback structure involves all of the characters and events that lead up to the accident's deadly occurrence at 1114 on an otherwise pleasant evening in Middleton a typical suburb of Anytown USA filmed in the vicinity of Los Angeles. Marcks's screenplay attracted an impressive ensemble cast costar Swank also signed on as an executive producer and they're all given equal time as the intertwined plots are revealed. They include Rachael Leigh Cook whose badgirl behavior sets the chain of events in motion Patrick Swayze and Barbara Hershey as her worried parents Swank and Shawn Hatosy as wouldbe criminals with a dimwit plan Henry Thomas as a drunk driver whose involvement is deeper than we realize and Colin Hanks as one of three teenage vandals on a fast track to trouble. With falling corpses graveyard sex reckless gun play and a severed penis it's all in good grisly fun apart from intricate plotting Marcks has no lofty agenda up his sleeve and there's ultimately not much point to its random misfortune but 1114 is clearly the work of a promising filmmaker worthy of rediscovery on DVD. Bonus features include Marcks's intelligent commentary a standard behindthescenes featurette and a useful character jump feature allowing viewers to choose a plot trajectory whenever one character encounters another.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roadkill that isn't a severed penis that is a convenience store corpses that's plural a wicked girl with too many boyfriends that's plural too these are just some of the raw materials that go into 1114's Rashomonlike multiple retellings of what happened at a rural roadside near the little town of Middleton 'A Very Happy Place' to Live so the sign says on one ridiculously eventful summer evening. There's enough material for three horror movies  or with wittier dialogue and more sparkling production values a substantial sequence in a Quentin Tarantino movie. On hand are energetic young actors  Shawn Hatosy Rachel Leigh Cook Henry Thomas and Colin Hanks to name a few doubleOscar winner Hilary Swank a brave veteran Barbara Hersey and Patrick Swayze his presence in Donnie Darko not forgotten by fans of the young and the edgy  a little like roadkill here himself  gamely playing the loser dad of the misbehaving Cheri Ms. Cook. This is a whole flurry of those situations where somebody forgets that two wrongs don't make a right. It starts when a drunken young driver on a cell phone Henry Thomas hits something and thinks he's committed a felony. Somebody else finds a corpse and hides it to protect whoever he thinks is the killer. Another guy's ready to commit robbery to pay for an abortion because he thinks he's the dad. A coworker is ready to help him even though it could cost her her job. One character is guilty of multiple deceptions. Unlike Rashomon this isn't so much a single event seen from various viewpoints as a snake's nest of malfeasance's that all turn out to be intertwined and it doesn't repeat those moments leading up to 1114 to get at the truth or run them in chronologically backwards segments like Memento or Irrversible or 5x2. Eventually it connects something said during the first sequence with a character whose secrets come out at the end to reveal one of the oldest plots of all  a doomed doublecross for profit and escape  just like something in one of Geoffrey Chaucer's grimmest most moralistic Canterbury Tales. There's no divine retribution here though the local cop takes enough of the players away to run out of handcuffs and get tired of reciting Miranda rights. Almost everybody's bad in 1114 and gets worse because he or she does something naughty to escape consequences and fails in the attempt. Firsttime director Greg Marcks's dark comedy of multiple selfsabotage and misadventure has horror movie raw materials and Bpicture cheap visuals and jumpy camerawork but a conceptualist's intricate and finely tuned plot the sequences don't leave any dangling threads. The question is though what's the conception? What's all this add up to other than a freakishly busy night for Officer Hannagan Clark Gregg? It's a game a puzzle without a point. Compared to Amores Perros to Memento even to Franois Ozon's chilly 5x2 1114 has nothing general to say. The puzzle is well constructed but it leaves you hungry for something more solid. Marcks's scenes of wrongdoing tend to the excruciatingly slow and messy as in the Coens' Blood Simple  which Marcks has cited as a major influence. But instead of Blood Simple's hurtssogood suspense there's a breathless speed in 1114 that keeps you watching  but also bars you from caring about the characters The ingenuity of construction feels wasted for another reason as in many another film with a plot line wound up tight as a drum the ending itself lacks punch. At the finale the hunger for relief and revelation the multiple plot lines have aroused is only partly satisfied. No doubt Marcks's attention is elsewhere even if it's not yet clear where. Despite its B style visuals and its debts to the Coens and horror flicks and noirs 1114 is attempting a fresh outlook. There is clear talent here. Though the slippery mix of genres may disappoint horror fans hipsters and folks just out for a nasty good old time this isn't mere roadkill. Life remains when all the corpses and wrongdoers have been dragged away and the hybrid comedic style is very 21st century. Some of the scenes stick in your mind and if you won't know where to file them that may be Marcks's point. If he can bring his visual and production values up to the level of his writing and directing skills he may get the distribution this first film has been robbed of for several years. Let's hope he also finds a little more to say. Seen during a brief theatrical showing in the SF Bay Area August 2005.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the vein of LOVE ACTUALLY 1114 gives us a set of intersecting story lines but in a very black comedy way. And while I enjoyed LOVE ACTUALLY very much 1114 I enjoyed only marginally. Don't get me wrong it is entertaining. But a few times during the viewing I said No way would it happen like that. 1114 focuses on several lives that are forever changed at exactly the same moment and how each overlaps the other in strange and often chuckling ways. The film starts out with Jack Henry Thomas E.T. driving down the road halfdrunk when he runs over someone in his car. Terrified that he'll go to jail he quickly tucks the body into the back of his car's trunk. Norma Barbara Hershey approaches the accident in her own car sees Jack and quickly surmises that he's hit a deer Happens all the time right around here. She helpfully calls the police to notify them of the accident and drives away. Officer Hannagan Clark Gregg shows up on the scene and uncovers the truth. Or is it the truth? Did Jack really hit and kill this guy? We backpedal to another group of lives a trio of young boys out for a good time. They're driving around drinking and letting ...um ...everything hangout. In fact one of them decides to pee out the window and it is during this time that the driver accidentally runs into a young woman in the middle of the road instantly killing her. How terrible. Or is it? In the process of slamming on the brakes the young man who was peeing out the window loses his manhood too. Ouch! Another set involves Buzzy Hilary Swank and Duffy Shawn Hatosy who are workmates at a local convenience store. Duffy needs cash and decides to rob the store with Buzzy's approval. Trouble is Buzzy wants him to wound her so that it looks like she was trying to protect the store and won't get fired. A gunshot overheard. A bowling ball. A missing set of keys. All of these things lead to some rather outlandish yet darkly funny hijinks.The final set of lives mostly are the family of the aforementioned Norma Hershey. She's married to Frank Patrick Swayze and they have a daughter named Cheri Rachael Leigh Cook whom starts all of this pandemonium. It is her who is on the phone with Jack Thomas at the beginning of the film and it is this that causes Jack to get into the accident. It is also Cheri who is responsible for the death of a young man by having sex with him in a cemetery and causing a headstone to fall on his head thus crushing his brains out. She's not a very nice lady out for the money and she's using everyone including her father in order to get what she wants. She is the one who's responsible for the dead guy that Jack hits he didn't runover and kill anyone. It was Cheri's father throwing the body of the bashedinbrains guy off an overpass and landing on Jack's car. She's also the young woman who gets hit and killed by the trio of boys out having a good time. And she's been pretending to be pregnant and needing money from her boyfriends in order to get an abortion. One of these boyfriends as it turns out is Duffy who would use the money from his robbery in order to pay for Cheri's procedure. But her death puts a quick end to that and closes pandora's box.Twisting the viewer's perceptions is the game here and it's pulled off pretty well. The story was entertaining and I kept watching only to be amazed at how these lives intersected.The only downside is the impossibility of certain aspects. Most notably is the cop Officer Hannagan who is the only law enforcement official we ever see. Considering all of the death shooting accidents and other bizarre occurrences the police would've been swarming over these scenes. But no. All we see is one lone officer with no crime scenes. Not likely.Still the story moves along a great clip and the audience is entertained by the unfolding stories.".

But unlike Crash and Babel 1114 is more of a dark comedy thrillernoir then a drama per se.Unfortunately the plot isn't that interesting and in the end the film comes trough as a bit pointless. It all seems like a simple series of events that had consequences and not a straight narrative line. I just don't think it's a story worth telling besides I felt that the story was in service of the narrative gimmick and not the other way around. On a more positive note the film has a great pace and is somewhat engaging. The cast did a good job as well. All in all it's a decent watch but I would skip it.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Whenever a film is touted as the next Pulp Fiction it always makes my heart sink a little bit. It never does a film justice particularly those that not only are not in the same league as Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece but don't even match up to the previous movies spawned in its wake. For every Go there is a Two Days In The Valley so in the end all you should ever really do is try to view a film its own right rather than condemn its failure to match its inspirations. Perhaps then it is fitting that newcomerdirector Greg Marcks who's only previous work was a short film about a man who reads to cigarrollers via radio has created a tremendously entertaining if at times rather gruesome tale about five intertwining stories revolving around a couple of car crashes at 1114pm.Story one involves a young man who obviously after intoxicating himself attempts to drive himself home when low and behold he hits what appeared to be a dear. After closer inspection it turns out that he has actually hit a fellow human who is now dead as a possum. This incident along with the other four stories are not actually tales but rather perspectives which as the movie goes on begin unravelling a narrative hidden from each of the other stories' characters displaying how they are oblivious to the repercussions to which their misgivings seemingly affect others. Along the way there are some pretty nasty although hilarious gags involving such modern day taboos as fatal graveyard sex and a certain missing penis. You will squirm as you chuckle at the ensuing madness invoked upon our protagonists.Where as hokey silly riffraff like Snatch involved increasingly contrived story lines intertwining over a rather dubious narrative showed cheekychappy cockney gangsters smirk and dance their way through a music video of a movie 1114 manages to recapture the style and essence that made something like a Quentin Tarantino movie so effortlessly entertaining. What nobody cared to inform the duplicators of said director was that it was NOT swooshy camera moves ridiculously quirky gangsters or even a decent soundtrack that made Reservoir Dogs the movie it was. It was a script. A script that was so funny so original and so clever that you fell in love with it. 1114 might not necessarily be a lovable movie but it is constructed in a very clever sense fooling its audience in a sense of doom only to reveal itself later on to choruses of laughs. Marcks obviously understands how to strike a balance between humour and dread as parts of this film had me clutching for breath yet laughing all the same.The cast do their upmost to fill in the gaps that may not make this as brilliant as some people have made it out to be. Most characters only serve the movie with around 15 minutes worth of screen time so it is impressive that most of their scenes are packed with enough humour to keep you interested. Patrick Swayze's godfearing father who is frantically trying to rid the body of his young daughter's lover is fairly impressive but the daughter herself played with wonderful fauxditz and scheming nastiness by Rachel Leigh Cook steals the show. You probably won't feel much for the clumsy nature of the characters but they will certainly keep you on your toes.".

Hilary Swank plays a very convincing dumb store clerk in a bad situation. Finally Rachael Leigh Cook plays a young woman who plays three clueless guys  Henry ThomasBlake Heron and Shawn Hatosy. The real star of the movie is the writhing and the directing done by Greg Marcks. A one hit wonder of job is done by Greg. The dialog is fast and funny and the scenes are all greatly shoot in the city night. The only problem I found with the movie was a few sound problems but their minor nit picks.

Not only do we see the immediate implications from his outing but the athlete takes strong action to get on with his life and to help those around him accept the simple fact that he's gay  which is no big deal to him but which is evidently a big deal to so many people around him. This keeps you rooting for things to work out and for his family friends and fellow athletes to simply accept this part of him and get on with it  including their own lives.The overall disfunctionality of everyone creates characters that are at times caricatures but that really add a light and wellrounded touch to this work.

	schema:reviewBody "Warning potential spoilers...Eleven Men Out is a rare European film and one that doesn't play for the big laughs or go for the obvious moments. Director Robert Douglas paints a knowing and fun look at a side of Icelandic culture that few outside of the country will know. Using his previous deadpan approach the comedic moments come from his unique skill at characterising and recognising the odd quirks that make up every day people. He takes great joy in turning stereotypes on their heads in one gay sex scene the lead actor is having anal sex with his teammate on the living room sofa when his 13 year old son comes in catches them at it and shrieks 'fucking perverts' while dad just replies matter of factly 'Hi son what're you doing here?'. This is the kind of humour that is rife throughout Eleven Men Out but sometimes the comedy can be so deadpan that you do have to pay attention or you will miss it.The ending too isn't quite as you would imagine. Again Douglas takes an almost gleeful approach deliberately toying with audience expectations to then deliver a low key but yet satisfying conclusion. My only warning is to say that this is not an Icelandic Bend It Like Beckham a story of how the underdog does good so if you go in not expecting that you should enjoy this. My last comment on this subject  any film about football which doesn't actually contain hardly any scenes of football wins my vote! Douglas is a brilliant and challenging filmmaker who only in his early thirties now already holds the title as one of Iceland's top film directors. I look forward to seeing what he produces in the next few years and hope that his work starts reaching global audiences.".

This is the kind of humour that is rife throughout Eleven Men Out but sometimes the comedy can be so deadpan that you do have to pay attention or you will miss it.The ending too isn't quite as you would imagine. Again Douglas takes an almost gleeful approach deliberately toying with audience expectations to then deliver a low key but yet satisfying conclusion. My only warning is to say that this is not an Icelandic Bend It Like Beckham a story of how the underdog does good so if you go in not expecting that you should enjoy this. My last comment on this subject  any film about football which doesn't actually contain hardly any scenes of football wins my vote! Douglas is a brilliant and challenging filmmaker who only in his early thirties now already holds the title as one of Iceland's top film directors. I look forward to seeing what he produces in the next few years and hope that his work starts reaching global audiences.";

	schema:headline " Funny film from Iceland";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been a long time since we've had a genuinely funny film here in Iceland. Been to dramatic over the last years. This film is first and foremost a feelgood and light affair about a star football player that comes out of the closet and the way he and his family deal with it. It's not the old story of somebody coming out and having huge problems with it the main character here seems to have no problems with his gay life and it's more his teammates and most notably his teenage son and exbeauty queen wife that have some unclear issues about him being gay. The film decides to take the humorous road and it's refreshing to see a film about gay themes that does not take itself too seriously. It does have it's dramatic moments but the dramacomedy is a nice blend and the film makers manage to do this very well. The director has been very popular here in Iceland with his earlier films but has yet to do anything notable outside of Iceland this seems to be the film that might get him noticed abroad let's hope so anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film wastes no time getting to the meat of the story a successful player in one of Iceland's top soccer teams reveals to the press that he is homosexual. That revelation and how it is done produces the only good laugh. For the remainder of this gay caper the humor goes flat. Humor is of course cultural. Maybe in Iceland they find the film funny. The real underlying comedy is how the main character's homosexuality is the object of virulent reproach while the wife's chronic drunkenness is almost accepted as normal. As can be expected of such light fare all ends in a positive mood and with a big hurrah for gay pride.".

While the Cast especially the lead is quite stunning to look at most of the film's only laughs come from the lead's drunken exwife. The print of the film we saw was blurry and could not be focused. It was very hard to keep up on reading the subtitles they were very fast much faster than normal. The story just didn't go much of anywhere and the ending was quite uneventful. The look of the film is of course very cold and gray I assume this was filmed during the summer I can only imagine how gray cold and isolated it would look in winter. Lots of old lame gay jokes and of course the needless use of drag queens. why does every gay movie have to have a drag queen lurking about somewhere. Wait for the DVD on this one but don't expect much.".
