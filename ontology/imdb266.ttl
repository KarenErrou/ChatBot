That was normal procedure for them. In this edition the gag scenes were longer and the amount of music was much greater.The major skits involve a race track tout Chico conning Groucho  a physical exam Margaret Dumont who else? a delay of the big horse race and a bunch of other crazy skits. Some are good some go on too long.Maureen O'Sullivan of Tarzan fame among other films gives the film some beauty and Dumont is treated with more respect here than in the other Marx Brothers films. Groucho takes it easy on her because her character has the money that will save the day so to speak.This MB film has a ton of music from Chico on piano to Harpo with harp and flute solos plus a flute number with a group of black folks. Then there is Allan Jones crooning away to O'Sullivan with several ballads. Also there are several group numbers featuring the aforementioned group of blacks . I liked their rousing gospel numbers best of all the music.The ending of this movie reminded me of Horse Feathers in which the most outrageous football game was ever filmed. Here it was a horse race unlike any you would ever see. It is so ridiculous you just laugh out loud....and that's the idea of the movie.".

I have seen Duck Soup which I would say has to be at least one of their best seeing that I believe it to be one of the funniest comedies ever. I have also seen A Night at the Opera which is also often considered one of their best often the best. I myself found it much less funny than Duck Soup. I wanted to kill myself during the musical numbers of that film.Now I've seen A Day at the Races the Brothers' follow up to A Night at the Opera a smash hit in theaters. Generally Races is considered a weak followup to a great film. I disagree. I liked A Day at the Races much more than A Night at the Opera but a bit less than Duck Soup. All three Brothers are firing bullseye after bullseye. Harpo could stand to do a little bit more. He may have had the funniest role in Duck Soup. He was an utter maniac with total disregard for human life. When the Marx Brothers left Paramount for MGM their edge was dulled down a bit. Oh well Races still succeeds.Also except for the boring opera voice even the musical numbers work here. I love to watch Chico play the piano. That's hilarious. Harpo's harp number is less good but still not bad. The ballet sequence is also quite good. There's one more musical number that's just fantastic the poor black folk singing Who's that man? as Harpo runs around playing the flute. It's somewhat shocking to see a scene like this. It does not exploit them it may seem to now but it was probably quite inclusive and progressive in its day and it's a smash.".

	schema:reviewBody "A DAY AT THE RACES MetroGoldwynMayer 1937 directed by Sam Wood capitalizes on the current trend of horseracing movies done by the numbers during the 193738 cycle notably MGM's own 1937 releases of Saratoga and Broadway Melody of 1938 as well as Stablemates 1938. Starring those three Marx Brothers in their second collaboration for MGM following the enormous success of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA 1935 this horse opera being the longest running feature film of their screen career stopwatched at 111 minutes did prove quite successful then and because of its good track record still remains a sure bet comedy today.The first Marx Brother to be introduced in the story is Chico. He plays Tony a chauffeur for Judy Standish Maureen O'Sullivan whose sanitarium is in financial trouble. Morgan Douglass Dumbrille the owner of a nearby racetrack and hotel along with his associate Whitmore Leonard Ceeley want to take over the sanitarium so to convert it into a gambling casino. He offers Judy the option of accepting 5000 from them or face a mortgage foreclosure but she prefers to wait the 30 days. Gil Stewart Allan Jones her fianc has purchased HiHat Morgan's race horse for 1500 gambling her life savings hoping to win enough money to get Judy out of debt. However Mrs. Emily Upjohn Margaret Dumont an exclusive patient of the sanitarium expresses her need for a doctor even though there is really nothing physically wrong with her. Realizing that Mrs. Upjohn's financial support could save the hospital from ruin Tony notifies Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush Groucho Marx of Palmville Florida who is well acquainted with Mrs. Upjohn unaware he is a horse doctor and making him chief of staff. Then there's Stuffy Harpo Morgan's jockey with a natural flair for horses who gets to ride HiHat who turns out to be a jumper as well as quite fearful to the sight and sound of Morgan himself.The Music and Lyrics by Bronislau Kaper Gus Kahn and Walter Jurmann On the Blue Venetian Waters Sung by Allan Jones danced by Vivian Fayrecently restored to its original sepia tone Tomorrow is Another Day sung by Jones Blow That Horn Gabriel All God's Chillin' Got Rhythm All God's Chillin' Got Rhythm reprisefinale along with A Message From the Man in the Moon sung briefly by Groucho Marx otherwise cut from final print and heard instrumentally during opening credits. Tomorrow is Another Day is quite a good tune with Jones in fine voice singing to charming heroine O'Sullivan that shifts into a parade from the black community singing and dancing to All God's Chuillin Got Rhythm with the Marxes headed by Harpo playing a flute like the Pied Piper with one of the vocalists being future star Dorothy Dandridge.As already mentioned A DAY AT THE RACES is quite long in fact everything about the movie is long the song numbers the comedy routines the narrative and the horse racing finale so clever that it's been reused several times since then in other hydrazine resulting to perfectly timed structures although the water carnival ballet number performed by Vivian Fay near the beginning could have been shortened in fact substituted into another movie categorized as a musical. One of MGM's debits is having this look more like a lavish scale musical than a Marx Brothers comedy with the trio off screen for long intervals with occasional cutaways during the ballet as a reminder that this is a Marx Brothers comedy and not a ballet musical choreographed by George Ballachine. After it is all over Chico and Harpo get to do their traditional musical bits with piano and harp at length. Groucho doesn't do a song solo which is unfortunate because his style of singing and dancing always brings pleasure during these musical interludes.With this being the seventh Marx comedy it's evident that some of their routines are rehashes yet improvements from their earlier outings. At this point could anything new be added to their comedy material? In fact something has Harpo's mimed message through constant whistling facial and hand gestures telling Chico about Groucho falling victim to Flo Marlowe Esther Muir as schemed by Morgan. The Groucho and Chico exchanges are highlights the best being their seven minute Tootsie Fruitsie ice cream bit where Chico posing an ice cream vendor actually a race tract tout making a sucker out of Groucho by selling him racing tips that ends up being a stack of hardbound books taken from his pushcart. The madcap examination room sequence involving Harpo and Dumont are notable attention grabbers as well. In true Marx tradition Margaret Dumont falls victim to their shenanigans usually being the prime insult by Groucho through one of his classic remarx Emily I have a little confession to make. I really am a horse doctor but marry me and I'll never look at any other horse. Sig Rumann should not go unnoticed as Doctor Steinburg a pointed beard Viennese specialist who arrives to examine Mrs. Upjohn thus preventing Hackbush from performing his own examination on Emily.In spite of long stretches A DAY AT THE RACES does have its doses of winning streaks thanks to the staff and performers combined several recalls from A NIGHT AT THE OPERA. The film in general is not perfect but worthwhile comedy thanks to the Marx Brothers expert horsemanship. Recommended viewing during the late evening hours before hitting the hay. Formerly available on video cassette a format that had been in circulation since the 1980s which has since been discontinued in favor of the much improved DVD format A DAY AT THE RACES can be seen intact whenever shown on Turner Classic Movies.

A Marx Brothers fan like myself tends to fall in love with the woman after many years. Her beauty and naivety eventually charm even the most cynical Grouchophile...See it!";

Jones is once again doing the Zeppo part and helps out with all the racetrack shenanigans they pull. And of course unlike Zeppo Jones sings beautifully.Allan's in love with Maureen O'Sullivan who owns a sanitarium that the wealthy Margaret Dumont patronizes. Douglass Dumbrille wants it real bad and will do everything in the best Snidely Whiplash to get it from O'Sullivan. Dumont will help out but only if her personal physician Doctor Hugo Hackenbush takes over the sanitarium. Problem is that Dr. Hackenbush is a fake.Of course you know Dr. Hackenbush is Groucho. I've said this on many occasions. But there are two schools of thoughts as to who had the best character names in films. W.C. Fields or Groucho Marx.Jones has both Chico and Harpo as his sidekicks and of course like they had to save the opera in the first film they have to save the sanitarium for Maureen O'Sullivan and to do it they have to enter Jones's horse High Hat in the Steeplechase. What they did to delay the opera is nothing compared to the riotous stuff pulled to stall the race.But I like A Day At the Races most of all because it is the best showing of Chico in that Tuttsi Frutsi Ice Cream bit where the ignorant immigrant takes in the greedy Groucho with his racetrack tips. The only one whoever really got the better of Groucho. Chico invented disingenuous it was the only way to deflect Groucho's razor wit. A lot of people in the audience identified with Chico in fleecing Groucho so thoroughly. It's my favorite Marx Brothers moment.And if you watch A Day At the Races it might become your's as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forty years after the release of A Night At The Opera the rock group Queen released an album with the same title. When the following year they released another called A Day at the Races it was largely knocked for not matching the quality of its predecessor. The actual films follow this pattern too with Races coming two years later being held to be good but lacking in comparison. It's a fair assessment.Everyone knows the Marx brothers of course. There's Groucho The anarchic wise guy with the drawnon moustache Chico The likable Italian stereotype Harpo The mute childish slightly annoying one there for kid appeal and Zeppo The normallooking one who was always left as the straight guy. Zeppo didn't appear in either of these two films of course though gets his usual substitute  in Day it's Allan Jones as the stiff romantic lead.Even today Groucho is still very funny and his rapid oneliners hit the target Take these bags and run up to my room and here's a dime for yourself Oh no no no no  this is Mr. Whitmore our business manager. Oh I'm terribly sorry  here's a quarter. but after many lines there's a forced silence as if to anticipate the audience laughter. As a result it feels strangely artificial and muted never more so than in his first scene at the sanatorium. Things do get better particularly when he's appearing opposite Chico with whom he understandably has a greater rapport. Groucho talking to Whitmore via phone and Dictaphone using multiple voices is another winner.The need for a romantic subplot and occasional reliance on the traditional trappings of the American sitcom do hold things back. The Brothers would be held to have more art and attitude than Laurel and Hardy though they're nowhere near as amusing. Perhaps this is because Stan and Ollie generally avoid the overearnest sentimentality of a Marx Bros. Movie.Another major sticking point is the song and dance sequences. There are three in total all of them lasting over twenty minutes combined. That's twenty minutes where we could have had more verbal byplay from Groucho who is a little neglected in sections. An elaborate routine not all that well directed during the first forty minutes slows things to almost a standstill even before the film has really got going. It's really quite irksome and not what a Marx Brothers film is  or should be  about. Much funnier is Groucho doing the rumba. For someone so well known as a verbal comedian it's notable how much of a gifted physical performer he is too. Okay he's not a fullon slapstick contortionist like some of his peers but just seeing the way he walks into a room has me in hysterics.The film adheres to a formula as usual with Chico again coming across a piano and Harpo again coming across yes you guessed it. It's another musical interlude that is too selfconsciously cute and at six minutes too long. The best musical segment is a later sequence where Harpo leads a group in a rendition of Gabriel Blow Your Horn. This is marred only by t he fact that the group in question is the most stereotyped portrayal of black people ever laid to celluloid. After much hand shaking and eye rolling the brothers themselves get in on the offensive act by dousing their faces in oil in an attempt to blend in. Like Laurel and Hardy's Pardon Us this is a film that cannot be judged by contemporary sensibilities... it's just the way things were.Sometimes the mania can be a little forced and artificial  witness the examination scene where the brothers  Harpo particularly  do zany things just because they're zany and not because of any consequence of plot. The ending is satisfying though with a wellpresented sabotage of the horse race and the eventual song to play out. This isn't a perfect film by any means  judging it via the rather trite metaphor of a cake mixture then the ingredients aren't quite right. With two additional songs that were removed there's clearly too much music in the film. There's also slightly too much Harpo and there was room for more Groucho. The romantic subplot should have been scrapped and there are long stretches that unfortunately discard the need for dialogue. Yet while the cake isn't baked to perfection the basic ingredients are there and this is still if not wholly satisfying a worthwhile view. 610.POSTSCRIPT 2012 Now listen it was nobody's fault but mine. Words that Groucho should never speak. It's almost 11 years to the day since I reviewed this movie and as I'd only seen A Night At The Opera beforehand I really had nothing to compare it to. It was a little bold on my part reviewing a Marx Brothers movie when I really didn't know the Marx Brothers. Generally I'd still agree with most of it except for the examination scene which is at least an attempt to claw back what they once were albeit an unsuccessful one. For this is the end of the Marx Brothers an out of character endeavour that's way too plotheavy to register. Their longest picture it drags terribly and the boys who just want to help others is the anathema of the gang who sent Freedonia to war or cheated in college football games. It's the Marx Brothers stripped bare and declawed retooled as cutesy foils to a dreary romantic plot often support in their own film narratively speaking.There's still a certain amount of class to the production and enough funny moments to maintain my initial 610 rating but the MGM track record for Marx Brothers movies is a poor one letting just A Night at the Opera Q.V. stand as a genuinely worthwhile work. Should you care I take up the story in a review of Go West...".

A bit too much for me but he still sings lovely. The long dance numbers are uninspired and lose the comic flavor after a few minutes. We get it back in the wooing scene between Groucho and beautiful Esther Muir and in the rollicking good finale.

Groucho plays Dr. Hugo Hackenbush a veterinarian posing as a human doctor to bilk wealthy hypochondriac Margaret Dumont. Their scenes together are priceless as they always were. Maureen O'Sullivan is perfection in everything and here she brings out a kinder gentler side of the Marx Bros. Leonard Ceeley is great as Dumbrille's coconspirator who runs afoul of the Marxes and lives to regret it. Esther Muir is a riot as a blonde floozy who gets more than she bargained for while trying to seduce Groucho. A terrific Marx Bros. film with many memorable lines and scenes including 'Tutsi Frutsi Ice Cream.' It's a little long but never dull. The musical numbers were never my favorite parts of the Marx films unless they were comedy songs that were part of the story as in Animal Crackers or Duck Soup. Here though there is a great number called All God's Chillun Got Rhythm. I'm sure it will be controversial to sensitive types today but it's a lively upbeat number that always puts a smile on my face. It's one of the best musical numbers from any of the Marx films and just one of the many reasons I recommend you see this one.".

	schema:headline " Too much influence by the MGM standard that specifies that all movies must be made digestible for everyman";
	schema:reviewBody "The Marx Bros. had such a hit with A Night at the Opera that MGM wanted to cash in as soon as possible with another movie that is basically more of the same. That isn't to say that this movie doesn't have enjoyable parts but there is too much emphasis on the rather tired plot of the good woman here played by the MGM Jane Maureen O'Sullivan trying to save her business from the despicable villain Morgan Douglas Dumbrille.Another disappointment is that we don't get to see the usual sparring of Groucho and Margaret Dumont I think they share only a couple of scenes including the rather ridiculous Examination which had been such a staple in most of the Paramount films. Here Dumont portrays a hypochondriac and there is only so much you can find amusing about that. The one scene that is hilarious between them is when Groucho shows the pill she apparently has been prescribed and tells her how much water is needed to swallow it 5 or 6 gallons should do it. Never mind. Such a joke always falls flat when having to describe it.As for the musical numbers there aren't so many of them but they have totally been grinded through the MGM machine which states Make it big and give it class. The rather tasteless musical number with the Marxes in blackface is a product of a more unenlightened time and should therefore be seen as such and nothing more.The Marxes are of course the same as they always were and there is only so many times you can see them and still find them funny except maybe Groucho but one of the rather ridiculous scenes is between Harpo and Chico where Harpo makes Chico play a bizarre game of charades to figure out what is going on and it is sort of unnecessary. I have already mentioned the Examination scene but one thing is sort of funny about it and that is the great Sig Rumann who again gets to play the totally perplexed character he made a specialty and Groucho saying Stop pointing that thing at me unless you intend to use it referring to his beard.The horse race is somewhat funny but is bogged down by the rather poor editing job that many 30's movies suffer from and of course there is a happy ending where all the main characters march down the street singing which is also a typical MGM staple.So all things considered it is moderately funny but there aren't really any really hysterical scenes as in their former films and the age of the premise and the brothers themselves are also starting to show. That they would make 5 more or so movies as a team is of course surprising but it has been well documented why they did it see biographies.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Marx Bros. had such a hit with A Night at the Opera that MGM wanted to cash in as soon as possible with another movie that is basically more of the same. That isn't to say that this movie doesn't have enjoyable parts but there is too much emphasis on the rather tired plot of the good woman here played by the MGM Jane Maureen O'Sullivan trying to save her business from the despicable villain Morgan Douglas Dumbrille.Another disappointment is that we don't get to see the usual sparring of Groucho and Margaret Dumont I think they share only a couple of scenes including the rather ridiculous Examination which had been such a staple in most of the Paramount films. Here Dumont portrays a hypochondriac and there is only so much you can find amusing about that. The one scene that is hilarious between them is when Groucho shows the pill she apparently has been prescribed and tells her how much water is needed to swallow it 5 or 6 gallons should do it. Never mind.

The story this time is about Judy Standish Maureen O'Sullivan the owner of a sanatorium in financial distress. In order to save the sanatorium from the evil creditors the dubious horse doctor Hugo Z. Hackenbush Groucho Marx is hired since one of the rich patients Mrs. Upjohn Margaret Dumont is hopelessly in love with him. Certainly it is not the most original plot ever  it is quite similar to the one in most Marx films I have seen  nor is it the best but after all it is merely a vehicle for a number of sketches and as long as those are good enough it is fine by me.In fact for those who have seen a fair share of the Marx brothers' films a lot of things will be familiar. Margaret Dumont is the naive hysterical lady who never understands what is going on. Chico is the charming Italian who is trying to save the lady in trouble and gets his moment with the piano. Harpo is the mischievous and silent helper who of course gets to play the harp. Groucho is the quick guy with the killer oneliners strange posture and who has a keen eye for most girls except for Dumont. But the beauty of it is that it works since the sketches are different it does not matter much.Speaking of sketches A Day at the Races definitely has some of the funniest that the brothers have done. There is a hilarious scene in which Groucho is trying to fool the evil Whitmore Leonard Ceeley over the telephone regarding his credentials as a doctor. Another highlight is when Groucho is trying to get a tip from Chico at the race track but ends up with a library. And overall the sharp dialogue is truly excellent take for instance Dr. Steinberg's Sig Ruman claim that Mrs. Upjohn looks as healthy as any woman I ever met to which Groucho replies that you don't look as though you've ever met a healthy woman. Actually one of the musical numbers where Groucho is trying to pick up Flo Esther Muir while fending off Dumont is very amusing as well.While the musical numbers are always my least favourite part of the Marx films A Day at the Races offers some of the best ones. The classical dance segment is at least pretty and perhaps offers the best visuals I have seen in these films with stark black and white reflections in the water at which the scene takes place and the lindy hop number is very energetic. Only Allan Jones' Tomorrow Is Another Day is somewhat of a drag. That being said they still hamper the pace of the film severely and without them the film would be half an hour shorter without losing much in terms of comedy or plot they were perhaps needed in the vaudeville show but might just as well have been lost in the translation to film. Still music or not A Day at the Races finds the Marx brothers at their comedic peak and to me even surpasses classics such as A Night at the Opera.".

You can note it as the first sign of their decline or the last film they made that actually clicked but that it doesn't work that's taking your life in your hands. Yet I will.I cannot call A Day at the Races a movie with no great comic moments. I can't say that about any Marx Bros. movie even the execrable Big Store. The question is how often do they come and how often do you find yourself clicking the skip button on the DVD remote.The film has three unequivocally great bits TootsieFrootsie Ice Cream Chico and Harpo keeping Groucho from being found in flagrante delicto by Margaret Dumont and Margaret Dumont's medical examination. What surrounds these at least up to the 1 hr. 20 min point is lesser Marx but generally good excepting those scenes when Jack Jones's father and Mureen O'Sullivan are present or ballets or songs or spirituals or....A lot of it isn't the material or the brothers' delivery of it. We have another gooey and extensive Allan Jones romantic subplot this time featuring Tarzan's mate and Mia Farrow's mother Maureen O'Sullivan. And the musical bits outside of Harpo and Chico's solos are just too long and don't seem to have a real function in the film except to satisfy what was assumed to be the public's thirst for MGM musical numbers.But a lot of it is how the brothers are used. Groucho is much too much an avuncular type going for pathos with lines to O'Sullivan like What if I'm not the doctor you think I am? Groucho is a vet when everyone thinks he's a renowned M.D. It's not that Groucho can't do pathos. It's just that Groucho doesn't demean his abilities even if one would think he should. Can you imagine him saying I'm not the explorer you think I am to Margaret Dumont in Animal Crackers?? What's more Harpo seems unusually underused here. He has lots of scenes with Chico or with Chico and Groucho but virtually nothing alone unlike in A Night at the Opera or any of the Paramount films. When you don't have Harpo with his own bits even briefly that takes a lot away from a Marx Bros. film too.One plus to note in the film however is Margaret Dumont. On a web page as evidence of Ms. Dumont's legendary inability to understand any of the material she ever acted in it quotes Maureen O'Sullivan as saying that Dumont had referred to Mrs. Upjohn her character in Races as a serious part not like the others. Well it is serious in the sense it's a far more three dimensional character than Mrs. Potter Rittenhouse Teasdale and Claypool. In those roles the material basically gave Dumont the opportunity to play straight man to Groucho no mean feat and no one could have done it better. But Mrs. Upjohn is not merely stuffy or snooty or naiveshe's neurotic. Her need to be reassured she's sick when she isn't is a grand comic bit on its own as is her attraction then disaffection then attraction again to Groucho it's the only film where Groucho proposes to her seriously and she accepts. She won a Screen Actors Guild award for this and it's not too difficult to understand why.As stated before there's no Marx Bros. film that's worth total rejection and there's plenty of good Groucho insults and Chico con games here. It just would have been nice had the film been shorter had less plot less music more comedy and above all more Harpo.So I say watch until the examination screen skip the musical numbers except Groucho dancing with Esther Muir mute it whenever Irene Hervey's ex and John Farrow's wife are present turn it off and be happy".

The problem is that Hi Hat is not that good a racehorse.Hackenbush gets the notice to head to the sanitarium. He is a doctor but a horse doctor. Of course this creates mayhem that only the Marx Borthers could pull off.The protagonists all have their adversaries to deal with. A man named Morgan is out to take over the sanitarium and create a casino. Gil is short on cash to pay for expenses relating to Hi Hat so the horse is in danger of being taken by the sheriff. Fortunately for Gil Tony and Stuffy Harpo playing the role of the jockey are ready to help if necessary.The Marx Brothers are great as usual in this picture. Groucho's one liners are consistently funny. Chico plays the kindhearted con artist very well and he has his share of good lines too. And Harpo just makes you laugh without ever speaking and is great at it.The film also becomes part musical at a couple of points. Jones sings Harpo plays the harp what else? and Chico plays the piano and all three do a good job.There are a lot of memorable scenes in the movie. The race tips scene is a good one as is when Tony and Stuffy try to sabotage Hackenbush's date with a woman. There are plenty of laughs at the track as well which is actually Southern California's own Santa Anita Park. As of this writing I have seen five Marx Brothers films and this is my favorite.

The sets by Cedric Gibbons are gorgeous to look at a uniquely Hollywoodian blend of artdeco and tasteful Orientalism photographed to fantastic effect by Tony Gaudio and evocatively lit. The acting is topnotch with Karloff an exquisitely seductive Fu Manchu and the young Loy a delight as his sadistic daughter. This film could not have been made just a couple of years later it is decidedly preCode in its sexual frankness and the lusty demeanor of the characters. Exfootball star Starrett is more than sufficiently hunky stripped down to a loincloth in a torture scene! But then the torture of this movie is always a naughty delight it has so many things in store for us.Obviously the question with 'Mask of Fu Manchu' as with others of its time is Are you able to forgive its naive racism? You hideous yellow monster! our heroine hisses contemptuously but then again the Brits aren't exactly angels either the barbaric way these socalled scientists go about breaking open Genghis Khan's tomb desecrating everything on their way only barely concealing their avarice ...A really good film highly recommended.710".

This film could not have been made just a couple of years later it is decidedly preCode in its sexual frankness and the lusty demeanor of the characters. Exfootball star Starrett is more than sufficiently hunky stripped down to a loincloth in a torture scene! But then the torture of this movie is always a naughty delight it has so many things in store for us.Obviously the question with 'Mask of Fu Manchu' as with others of its time is Are you able to forgive its naive racism? You hideous yellow monster! our heroine hisses contemptuously but then again the Brits aren't exactly angels either the barbaric way these socalled scientists go about breaking open Genghis Khan's tomb desecrating everything on their way only barely concealing their avarice ...A really good film highly recommended.710";

	schema:reviewBody "Created by British author Sax Rohmer the evil Dr. Fu Manchu appeared for the first time in 1912 in a story serialized in one of the many pulp magazines of those years. While originally a personification of the racism present during the time of its creation the infamous Yellow Peril Fu Manchu has become one of the most famous characters in science fiction serving as model to other villainous character as one of the earliest examples of the Supervillain archetype. The fascinating evil genius and his nemesis Sir Denis Nayland Smith appeared in so many successful novels that of course film adaptations became the next step resulting in many different versions of the stories made since the first British film serial in 1923. Many talented actors like Harry Agar Lyons Warner Oland and Christopher Lee have played the famous criminal but the most famous interpretation of Fu Manchu is definitely the one done by horror legend Boris Karloff in the 1932 film The Mask of Fu Manchu.Based on Rohmer's story of the same name The Mask of Fu Manchu is the story of the discovery of Ghengis Khan's tomb where his legendary Mask and Sword are supposed to be hidden. British archaeologist Sir Lionel Barton Lawrence Grant has discovered the exact location but he is kidnapped by Dr. Fu Manchu's Boris Karloff criminal gang in order to proclaim himself Kahn's heir and lead the Asian nations to a war against the British empire. Knowing this Sir Nayland Smith Lewis Stone takes his own group of archaeologists and along with Barton's only daughter Sheila Karen Morley and her fiance Terry Charles Starrett attempt to find Kahn's tomb before Fu Manchu hoping to rescue Sir Lionel Barton in the process. However Dr. Fu Manchu and his daughter Fah Lo See Myrna Loy will prove to be terrible enemies for the British agent and his team.Written by the prolific writer Edgar Allan Woolf with Irene Kuhn and John Willard as collaborators the film is as faithful as possible to its pulp novel origins keeping the essence of the Rohmer's series of books in both style and substance. As in the novels the story flows at a fast pace mixing horror and science fiction as the adventurers must face the criminal mastermind who here is presented as a fascinating and very powerful adversary of Smith and his team. In fact it could be said that the writers seemed more interested in the villains than in the heroes as Fu Manchu and his daughter are easily the most developed characters. The treatment of Fah Lo See is really interesting as the script written in the years before the Hays Code allows her to be a very sexual predator and as wicked as her father.The Mask of Fu Manchu was directed by Charles Brabin a very experienced director of silents who after the introduction of sound directed several talkies before retiring. Brabin's experience in Silent films may be the reason behind the very visual flare of the movie as he gives an amazing use to Tony Gaudio's cinematography to create one of the most stunningly looking pieces of science fiction of the 30s truly capturing the feeling of the pulp novels where the story had its origins. As the writers Brabin seems to fall in love with his villains and injects them the haunting mix of sadistic eroticism that previous incarnations of Fu Manchu lacked. Interestingly this movie Brabin's 8th film with sound was also the first talkie directed by Charles Vidor who here received his first chance as an assistant in a big studio movie.As written above it's the villains what make The Mask of Fu Manchu special and fortunately the cast portraying them was the most perfect one for the job. Myrna Loy is simply gorgeous as Fah Lo See and while her role doesn't have too much screen time she makes every scene memorable as Manchu's daughter. Legendary horror icon Boris Karloff makes wonders in the role of Fu Manchu as he takes the character of the evil genius to higher levels of monstrosity. While the makeup by Cecil Holland is not as effective as the ones by Jack Pierce at Universal Karloff manages to be a very convincing Fu Manchu in probably the best representation of the character. As Fu Machu's nemesis Lewis Stone shows the necessary dignity and wit of the British gentleman he is portraying but sadly his screen time is very limited and instead we get more of the mediocre performances by Karen Morley and Charles Starrett who look very weak as the romantic couple.It seems like time hasn't been nice to this film when compared to other films inspired by pulp novels and not only because of it's constant racism towards the Asians like with the novels the Yellow Peril stereotype is quite notorious but mainly because it uses devises so typical of adventure films today that it make the film look dated and clichd however taking into account the times when this movie was made one can see it as the possible source of those clichs. On a different subject matter the movie indeed suffers from the bad performances of those put on the main spotlight as like many directors that started in silent films Brabin struggles with the most dialogbased scenes. Still Karloff Loy and Stone shine despite Brabin's own problems and the lack of talent of the two lead actors.True The Mask of Fu Manchu looks campy and terribly dated by today standards but it certainly has many characteristics that make it worthy of the title of classic. It's horror elements are few but it's an enormously influential film for the action and adventure genres an influence that can be traced even to the Indiana Jones series. While not exactly a perfect movie The Mask of Fu Manchu delivers a nice pack of thrills and fun and one of Karloff's finest performances. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "It didn't surprise me in the least that The Mask Of Fu Manchu was produced by Cosmopolitan Pictures. Even though the title is a bit of a misnomer. It isn't about The Mask Of Fu Manchu it's about the mask and sword of Ghenghis Khan which Boris Karloff as Fu Manchu wants to discover and appropriate for himself so he can become a kind of Far Eastern Mahdi.Cosmopolitan Pictures was the production outfit of William Randolph Hearst and while it's main reason for existence was to produce films for Marion Davies it did produce other films. The Hearst press especially on the West Coast was very big in stirring up antiChinese and anti Japanese feelings among the white people constantly using the phrase The Yellow Peril to describe how if they're allowed to emigrate her they'll be taking over in a few generations. The fictional Fu Manchu fit the Hearst agenda quite nicely.In the Fu Manchu stories it's like Professor Moriarty was the main protagonist. Fu Manchu's particular Holmes is Commissioner Nayland Smith played by Lewis Stone as stout a representative of the United Kingdom and their imperial pretensions as ever went out in the noon day sun.As I said Fu Manchu is after the warrior symbols of Ghengis Khan so he can lead the Oriental people to their rightful place. Interestingly this Oriental messiah seems to have a number of black slaves doing his bidding in the film. The British government as personified by Nayland Smith wants archaeologists Jean Hersholt David Torrance and Lawrence Grant to find the tomb and get this so the British can display it at the British Museum in London as a symbol of their superiority. Grant is kidnapped and tortured by Karloff but Grant's daughter Karen Morley and her boyfriend future Durango Kid Charles Starrett takes her father's place on the expedition.Though I think that The Mask Of Fu Manchu is every bit as racist in its attitudes as The Birth Of A Nation like The Birth Of A Nation it has some great performances. Led of course by that master of horror Boris Karloff. Karloff played so many different and varied types in his long career being Chinese was no big deal for him to play. Later on Karloff kind of made it up to the Chinese people by playing the educated detective Mr. Wong who unlike Charlie Chan never spoke in fortune cookie aphorisms.Myrna Loy is Fu Manchu's 'unworthy' daughter and this is at the height of the phase in her career where she played Oriental temptresses. She conceives a real liking for Starrett to turn him into her Occidental boy toy. She's a willing and eager accomplice in her father's dirty deeds perhaps to show herself as worthy.The Mask Of Fu Manchu is as racist a film as you can get but it's also holding up quite well as entertainment. And who was ever more sinister on the screen than Boris Karloff playing anything?".

I like Karen Morely usually but not in here where she plays an almosthysterical daughter of one of the good guys.Fu Manchu shows some of his unique methods of torture nothing graphic thankfully  not like today's blood and guts.Some of this is amateurishlydone but overall it still a legitimate amount of real horror and terror and the cast certainly is entertaining.

Almost always that's the case where the world is new andor synthesized from previous abstract sources.Metropolis of five years earlier is often celebrated as a film. Its only value is in the art design but that's miraculous in a way. Unfortunately the story is as thuggishly stupid as the notions it criticizes. And that mars a movie for me.This one is even more clever in the visual world it creates. And yes the story is dumb and also racist. But it is not hypocritical all the people involved are dishonorable worthy of a Tod Browning script.The visual notions are astonishingly varied. Nominally this is a mystical Chinese Northern Chinese more deeply mystical environment added to a 30's Germaninfluenced visual depiction of science. There are lots of electrical visuals zaps and blinkers. Abstractions of reality dominate staircases that stand alone monumental pedestals and other features in internal spaces statues and icons that become characters from props.The styles aren't Chinese at all but borrowed from any place or era with an association with the mystical.Deep deep shadows.

Direct precode references to sex and the implication that somehow rape on a national scale had something to do with mystical scientific power.Remember this is BEFORE Hitler's ascendancy.The story and most characters are irrelevant and that underscores the effect of the tone.Watch Indiana Jones if you must if you need movement.

Buried with him is his powerful sword and mask which have the ability to let the East rule over the world. A group of British scientists have finally found the grave and want to take the treasures from it to the British museum. But Fu Manshu is watching them. This evil doctor and his diabolical daughter finally see their chance to conquer the stuff of Ghengis Khan and rule over the world. They kidnap the British leader of the expedition and are prepared to torture him to death if only they get their hands on the sword and mask. The daughter of the professor and her boyfriend  also a scientist  do whatever they can to save him but Fu Manshu is too powerful. And when Fah Lo See  Fu Manshu's daughter shows deep interest of Terry  the daughter's boyfriend  chances to survive are becoming even smaller for the British scientistsI like to think the genre of horror is like good wine...how older it gets the better. So you can imagine how GREAT this film is. Although made in 1932 I must say I've rarely seen a film with so much creativity and originality. The story to begin with...it's fantastic and the format will be repeated many many times after this. The macabre atmosphere hanging around this movie is terrific. Dr. Fu Manshu is pure evil and the methods he uses to reach his target are unbelievable. Like the scene where he brews a special liquid to let people obey him...magical. Also the methods of torturing used in this film are the greatest I've ever seen. I bow my head with respect for the fact these rather shocking images were used in a 1932 film. And then there's ...BORIS KARLOFF. In my humble opinion the greatest actor who ever lived. An honor he surely deserves when watching this movie. His appearance body language and expressions fit perfectly. Just like he BECAME Frankenstein's monster he now BECOMES Dr. Fu Manshu. And while the Monster of Frankenstein was actually a depressed creature who only wanted some attention...Fu Manshu is a really horrible person. He only has one vision...rule the world. Whatever it takes. The character is supposed to be evil in its purest form and Karloff plays this really difficult role flawless. A must see film that comes with my highest recommendations...Also made during the 60's starring Christopher Lee as the diabolical doctor. the second best actor that ever lived...and still lives1010 ... move your butt and search this film !".

	schema:reviewBody "The Mask of Fu Manchu was MGMs attempt to cash in on the horror craze of the day. They even went so far as to secure the services of the biggest horror star Boris Karloff from Universal. Evendently Irving Thalberg the head of production at MGM thought the studio could make them bigger and better. MGM had released Freaks earlier the same year about a group of circus freaks but it didn't do well at the box office. So this time they decided to go with a major horror star.Dr. Fu Manchu Karloff a half mad and sadistic oriental leader hopes to become the new Genghis Khan by recovering Khan's mask and sword from his tomb. He then plans to unite all orientals and eliminate the white race. Also after the treasure are Sir Lionel Barton Lawrence Grant and his expedition which includes his daughter Sheila Karen Morley Professor Von Berg Jean Hersholt Terrence Granville Charles Starrett McLeod David Torrence and Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith Lewis Stone along to protect the treasure from falling into the hands of Fu Manchu.Fu Manchu abducts Barton and tries to get him to reveal the location of Genghis Khan's sword and mask. When he refuses Fu Manchu subjects him to the bell torture. To free Barton the party agrees to send Terrence to Fu Manchu with fake artifacts. Fu Manchu's equally evil daughter Fah Lo See Myrna Loy sets her sights on Terrence.After subjecting him to a lashing Fu Manchu injects Terrence with a serum that will compel him to do Fu Manchu's bidding. Terrance returns to Sheila and under Fu Manchu's influence tricks the others into coming back to Fu Manchu with the real treasure.When the tyrant finally gets his hands on the the sword and mask he has no further use with the explorers. First he plans to offer Sheila up as a sacrifice to the gods subject Smith to a slow descent into an alligator pit Professor Von Berg to impalement by a two sided wall of spikes while retaining Terrence for the amusement of his daughter.This film benefited greatly from MGMs excellent production values. The set pieces including the various instruments of torture are excellent. Being filmed before The Production Code was implemented in Hollywood in 1934 this film contains several racial remarks and sexual innuendos. Its no secret what the seductive Foh Lo See is up to.As was usual in Hollywood the lead oriental parts were cast with Caucasians and the socalled Britishers with Americans using phony accents if in fact they used them at all.Karloff seems to relish his part being as mean and evil as he ever was. Watch the bell torture sequence as an example. Loy was never sexier and probably never got the chance to play such a role again. Stone an MGM mainstay is also good as Fu Manchu's main adversary.Charles Starrett would go on to be Columbia's main B western hero in a contract that ran from 1935 to 1952. For the latter years he was better known as The Durango Kid.One of MGM's better forays into the horror genre.".

Please do get out more like go to the Middle East or Asia or Africa OK? Give me a break this is a fantastic movie and at least half a dozen comment on some racist motivation? Well let me see last time I checked the WHITE men said Fu Manchu was trying to unite all of Asia to take over the world hmmm where have I heard that in REAL LIFE? Was it IMPERIAL JAPAN? I guess the Emperor saw this and soon after invaded China to get a jump on the good Doctor 3 times over Manchu and promised a greater Asian area ever thought about that one you simpletons? You know I'm blown away that so many comment about racism in THIS movie when nothing I think is said about a movie like Frankenstein or The Werewolf or TONS of other movies which portray certain ethnic whites being stupid to some degree which you know I thought the villain was very smart here. You people live in little worlds and you haven't a clue how racist the real world is and the only part of this world where racism is even addressed is in the White dominated areas. But hey since I have been to every continent on this planet sans Antarctica I can tell you from experience that nationalism and racism is very much alive and well. The only ones who would point out how a great horror film is racist because the villains are Asian's and the good guys White are ignorant Americans and Europeans with nothing better to do and those who say it just to not sound racist. I think it's racist that you say a Chinese madman can't take over the world they have just as much a right to be bad as the big bad white oppressors! My kids are half Asian and half White and you know what with all the white man is evil crap they hear in their lives I make sure to tell them to be proud of their heritage both Asian but especially White it's at the forefront of civilization in the world. All those who suggest otherwise need to travel and see our world for what it is it ain't no Shangri La was that a racist movie too?. Mask of Fu Manchu is one of my favorites not because the White guys beat the Asians although boy am I happy I'm not a manservant to some Asian dude now thanks to those brave White guys! ranks right up there with all the first rate Universal horror flicks. 1010 unless you're a racist than it's an 11.".

Boris Karloff is largely wasted playing a completely wooden Fu Manchu. Myrna Loy as his daughter is very effective in a few spots but for the most part is not required to do much more then stare vacantly while being viewed in dramatic lighting conditions. The rest of the characters are complete throwaways with no personality to speak of and no reason to care what actually happens to them. The story itself is equally worthless and the dramatic conclusion painfully hokey.On the positive side some of the torture scenes with both Fu Manchu and his daughter have an uninhibited sexual sadistic energy which has rarely been equalled. In addition there are many wonderfully filmed scenes with highly dramatic lighting and very creative unusual sets. Unfortunately the quality of this is wildly inconsistent and totally ineffective in creating any kind of coherent atmosphere. The movie is mainly a curiosity piece a dated work of outrageous racism which occasionally shows a very unique artistic sensibility.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found some of the visuals and dialogue in this film quite amusing and have to admit there is entertainment value in it as an adventure mystery film. Yet the racism of the film and clearly colonialist attitudes cannot be excused despite how many other reviewers will argue that the time period of its production should be taken into account. I would like to focus on the last scene of the movie which speaks to the fear mongering racist imagination of Asians on screen. Throughout the movie we are presented with essentially two images of Oriental people. There is Dr. Fu a highly educated villain capable of bringing about the destruction of the Western world and the revival of absolute Eastern power. Then there is also the image of the dumb slave the halfnaked bodies in coolie hats at the Genghis Khan dig and Dr. Fu's burly men and dacoits all of whom rarely speak except for the rare scenes of nonsensical babbling. In the last scene when Smith Terry and Sheila are on board a ship towards England we hear the sound of a gong and an instant cry for terror from Sheila. It is not Dr. Fu who enters the scene it is a Chinese man working on the ship. Smith immediately asks him You don't have three degrees do you? and the man smiles revealing gap teeth and speaks in a thick and incomprehensible caricatured accent affirming that the party has nothing to fear. It is clear that he fits into the latter category described as a bumbling fool only fit for serving the whites on the ship. What might seem like a harmless punchline to wrap up the film instead implies much more that Fu's power lies in his ability to fuse Western knowledge and Eastern practices and this this power must be stamped out and replaced with the dumb mute subservient Orientals also presented in the film.".

If you can vibrate with joy at the sight of Boris Karloff in outrageous Mandarin make up his features lighted from below sneering racist agitprop then this is your kind of movie.Maybe we owe it to ourselves anyway to see this compounded Saturday afternoon serial. The name of Fu Manchu has become part of our vernacular lexicon. I mean Dr. Fu Manchu of course.";

Instead of going to Venezuela like one might think is most logical they head to America first to New York and then following a brief road trip New Orleans.This is where most of the story takes place  which is mostly just watching their relationship disintegrate and thoughts about takingthemoneyandrunning for Belmondo yeah Vanel has a big stack of cash that he had to take out of his security box in New York before the feds got wise  and it's not bad.

And it's not a major work.Or if it is Melville doesn't really have a lot of energy to make it more than just an interesting B movie no more no less. It is actually a crime movie if you think about it just different because it's not about a heist or guys in trenchcoats but about an older man trying to outrun the law and... himself I guess.Belmondo and Vanel make up most of the heart of the picture and keep it fascinating. You want to know what each one will do next  Ferchaux needs Michel more than he needs him  amid the sweltering heat and the old man's boycrywolf physical ailments. And Melville cast his two leads well. So well that it helps a little to distract from portions that don't work dramatically or feel dated. There's a midsection in the film while they're on their crosscountry trek that Michel stops rather suddenly for a female hitchhiker and they quickly become lovers ? in one of those MovieFantasyScenes where right after they pick her up they stop and Michel and the young woman have a swim and kiss and then... at the next stop she tries to run away with another truck driver ? It's something like that where Melville whether it's through himself or Simenon's text shows a bit of sexism or just not knowing what to do with a female character that could have become a fully developed character or a love interest and there IS a love interest sorta later in the movie in New Orleans though I wonder if this is also an excuse to just show a woman practically naked while Michel sits drunk. It's not a criticism I'd like to make against the director but I do he has his two main male characters fully developed and the actors inhabit them well enough that it disguises that everyone else in the movie has not much dimension at all. Well maybe the bartender has a little as a meanlookingdude of a sort.But Melville's love of America comes through and that helps a bit. And it's interesting to see him work in color for the first time though ironically I think I prefer when he has his more subtle washed out and blueish colors in later movies like Army of Shadows and The Red Circle. Here things are bright enough hard to tell fully from the nonAmamorphic DVD transfer and he gets the local color about right even as it's all shot oddly enough in his studio in Paris what you thought he'd trek out to America to shoot this? Heavens no though I'm sure a second unit for the rest of the footage.An Honorable Young ManMagnet of Doom has an intriguing performance from Belmondo in terms of 'what will he do next' and some good cinematography. But there should've been a little more 'there' there past the male camaraderie and themes of loyalty which yes it's fine and well drawn enough.".

But in the same time nine out of ten times there's a reason why certain films of a director's ouevre receive all the plaudits while others tend to languish in obscurity. Simply put Magnet of Doom is not among Melville's finest  probably not his worst either. It's just too awkward and clumsy to ever be truly successful from an artistic or technical standpoint and even though fans of the director will take pleasure in witnessing the early nurturing of those same ideas themes and moods that would later transform into what became his signature style Magnet of Doom lacks the singularity of purpose and stylistic confidence of something like Le Samourai. Melville weaves the plots of two characters an amateur boxer scraping to get by after his boxing career goes down the drain and the stalwart rich businessman on the run from the law presumably for someone's murder who hires the first as his secretary and travel companion into a road movie that takes us all the way from the petit bourgouisie cafes of France to Manhattan to the Deep South and bayous of New Orleans. If you can forgive the wooden delivery and stilted dialogue American nonactors are saddled with the choppy editing the occasionally clumsy and haphazard camerawork there's quite a few things to appreciate. Melville's guerilla tactics as he samples New Orleans nightlife with a camera shooting from the open car of a moving vehicle the documentary style of his footage of empty highway stretches slick diners smoky bars and neon motel signs small parts of a puzzle that in clicking together form a different kind of Americana. One seen through the eyes of a European not necessarily fascinated with what he sees. If the boxer's fixation on Frank Sinatra the son of Italian immigrants much like himself symbolizes the mythic quality of the New World a motley assortment of thieving hitchhikers soldiers spouting racial slurs and opportunist murderous bar owners reveals the seemy underbelly of the American Dream.Behind the slowburn atmosphere however behind the minimalism of the plot the sparse dialogue the intimacy of the monologues all typically Melvillesque ideas and themes that would later resurface in a more refined surefooted form there's not much of a story to speak of. Not only is the plot stretched pretty thin not only does it suffer from one too many improbabilities not plot holes necessarily but little distractions that accumulate in the course of time but it's handled in a somewhat awkward manner. The gradual shift of power in the duo's relationship as one learns to experience freedom and the other comes to term with solitude is not enough to carry the dramatic weight of the plot and beyond that there's not much of anything. And if Belmondo's character redeems himself in the finale for being a conniving selfserving scoundrel for most of the film he has the show stole from right under his nose by by the great Charles Vanel Les Diaboliques Wages of Fear To Catch a Thief who gives another terrific performance.".

Even rare TV screenings do not offer an improved version ARTE.The relationship between the young exparatrooperboxersecretary Belmondo and the old bank ownercolonial adventurer Vanel is quite interesting and also stands for the generational conflict of the 1960s. Obviously some of the plot is somewhat stretched but the tension between the main characters is excellently played out. Melville wanted Spencer Tracy for the Vanel part but Tracy's health situation made any form of outdoor filming not to mention insurance for this Impossible. Belmondo who is fooling around in Godard's Breathless and posing as a Bogart style tough guy really plays a film noir character in this one. The way he treats his girlfriend at the beginning of the movie makes his protagonist almost unlikeable. In the damp Louisiana setting at the end of the movie the whole affair really turns into a veritable noir.".

Often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive the entire set would obviously move.The best moments of the movie were the silent more old fashioned slapstick kind of moments. It shows that Ren Clair's true heart was at silent moviemaking. The overall humor is really great in this movie. Also of course the musical moments were more than great. This is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early French musical. Though the best moments are the silent moments that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog that gets very well delivered by the main actors who all seemed like stage actors to me which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant noworries atmosphere. No wonder this worked out so well since this movie is actually based on stage play by Georges Berr.It's a technical really great movie with also some great innovation camerawork in it and some really great editing that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences. There is never a dull moment in this movie!Ren Clair was such a clever director who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies. It's a very creative made movie that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie that never seizes to entertain.The last half hour is especially unforgettably fun without spoiling too much and is really among the greatest as well as most creative moments in early comedy filmmaking.The movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks.

	schema:reviewBody "I have lately got into the habit of purchasing any interesting DVD that the Criterion company releases. I figure that even if I dislike the movie Criterion usually supplies enough extra material to compensate for any shortcomings in the actual film. I read up on them and I buy the ones which are the most interesting to me.Le Million is my latest purchase and I must say that I was not disappointed in the film. It is cheery funny and romantic. Everything about it is quite excellent. The songs are wonderful. If I understood French I would probably hum them and sing them all day long. The acting is very good for this kind of movie. American musicals of the classic Hollywood era relied more on song and dance than the actual characters and story but in Le Million the characters are rather well developed and the story while not being anything extremely impressive is not at all lacking. I loved the developments of the relationships especially the relationship between the once best friends Michel and Prosper. The romantic moments are also very well developed. The direction is nearly perfect with several very memorable moments. Probably the single most perfect scene of the film occurs right after the lead couple has an argument. They hide on the stage of an opera performance and the opera singers sing lines which the couple Michel and Beatrice interpret to their own situation. This is definitely one of the high points in cinema history. The scene managed to make me laugh to win me over with a very sweet romance and make me smirk at just how clever the director was. I give this film a 910.P.S.  Some information for anyone who has the same faith in Criterion that I do and is planning to buy it. Amongst the Criterion discs I now own Le Million contains the fewest features. All it has is a photo gallery not all that useful one might flip through it once and a rare television interview with Rene Clair the director. This piece is of some interest. He was one of the many directors who had started out in silent film and when talkies were first appearing he said that they represented the death of film. I think most filmsavvy people understand what these directors meant when they said that but it is interesting to hear him explain it. Also if you have read the description of this movie on Amazon.com please note that they were wrong in one important respect not every line in the film is sung. In fact it contains no more songs than a regular musical. It is actually a lot more like a Chaplin or Buster Keaton or Marx Brothers film. My criticisms of the disc are not that important. Heck Criterion has the right to smack me around for making those complaints. The fact is their people probably spent hundreds of hours fixing up a film which only 20 now 21! people have voted for on imdb and only about a hundred people if that will ever see the film. Heck if you look at the Criterion web site Le Million is nowhere to be found. I have no clue why not. It's something they should really be proud of of course their web site is surprisingly horrible. They did a fine job on this film. Bravo! They deserve all the money I can stand to give them!".

	schema:reviewBody "Le Million is a 1931 musical directed by Rene Clair. It's wonderful that it's available on DVD for audiences to see and enjoy it. The story concerns a starving Parisian artist Michele Rene Lefevre who is having a bad day. He is being hounded by every creditor in town and as his fianc Beatrice Annabella walks into his apartment he is embracing his model. Then he realizes that he has won the Dutch lottery with his friend Prosper JeanLouis Allibert but the ticket is in his coat pocket and the coat is gone. The citywide hunt then begins for the coat which was taken by Beatrice and given to a needy person who sold it to the opera singer Sopranelli. There is a hilarious scene in Sopranelli's dressing room as various people try to get the ticket out of the coat pocket. Beatrice and Michele wind up behind some scenery on the opera stage and relate to the duet that's being sung.This film and Clair obviously influenced such talents as the Marx Brothers Ernst Lubitsch and Rouben Mamoulian. All the performances are good with the beautiful Annabella a brunette here a standout as the ballerina Beatrice. Annabella was signed by 20th Century Fox and brought over to America around 1938 made Suez with Tyrone Power and the two fell in love and decided to get married. In order to dissuade her and his biggest star from marrying Zanuck offered her several films in Europe but she refused to leave her fiance. Zanuck made sure she didn't work much after that effectively blacklisting her. She had a big Broadway success worked on behalf of the troops during World War II and returned to France after her divorce from Power. She retired in 1954. Her radio work with Power and this film show what a wonderful actress she was.Very good film  highly recommended.".

And that is what Clair does here  beginning with some entertaining misadventures that introduce the characters he then sets up the main story about the lottery ticket and from there on it builds up nicely both in humor and in complexity. The climactic sequence in the opera house is a wellcrafted extended slapstick sequence that also includes some interesting parallels.The cast works well with Annabella particularly standing out with her engaging performance as Batrice.The style is an interesting contrast from what eventually became the norm in movie musicals.

The delightful mix of silentmovie style slapstick spoken and sung dialogue opera parody and song moving camera and intercutting obviously influenced Rodgers and Hart and Rouben Mamoulian who a year later attempted the same sort of musical Love Me Tonight with Chevalier at the Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Clair's unique genius is in his ability to twist reality and create a fairytale world. In this film he sustains his particular brand of magic from the first model shots of the roofs of Paris to last scenes backstage at the opera. Yes the story is very silly and highly improbable but the charm of it the Parisian charm is undeniable.

The partygoers ALL look up and see the man and tell him IN SONG that they're celebrating and they have a story to tell. They toss him a bottle of champagne. They sing and dance as the shot dissolves to a couple alone in the room kissing. It's an astonishing opening sequence. And so Rene Clair begins to weave his magical charming funny story. I like to bore people by telling them that I can tell if I'm going to like a movie within the first five minutes. Le Million took me all of five seconds. It is nothing more or less than a farce a romp with people of all shapes and sizes all with varying motives tearing through hallways and popping in and out of doorways with dizzying regularity. Two coinciding chases collide. A serious opera morphs into a game of touch football. And every so often  quite often in fact  people just start singing! There's a lovely operetta duet onstage that frames the real thing going on behind the scenes. And best of all with all the fun poked at various characters and all the little satirical jabs there isn't a meanspirited moment in the entire film. How rare is that? I wonder if Blake Edwards thought of this film when he was writing the script for VictorVictoria. And yes Virginia there is a fat lady  and she sings!".

He rushes to get his coat where the ticket is but learns his girlfriend Annabella has given it away which leads to a wild chase in hopes of getting it back. I wasn't sure what to expect when entering this film because I had heard that it contained some pretty strange things but within minutes I was caught up in the story and the way it was being played out. I don't think the movie is laugh out loud funny but it doesn't really need to be. In fact I think the story could have gone for more slapstick and gotten bigger laughs but in a strange way it's smarter than that and goes for something completely different. Having the actors sing their dialogue makes this film come off very fresh today and I can't imagine and fresh and unique it must have been in 1931 when many sound films didn't sound all that great. The delivery of the music is topnotch and many of the songs are better than what Americans were hearing in their musicals then. Another major plus are the performances which are all very charming but Lefevre really carries the thing as he floats around like a feather and really hits all the right moves. The one thing that didn't work too well for me was the rather long sequence at the opera. I thought some of it went on a tad bit too long although the football scene here was greatly directed.".

Even the classicals in La Boheme was well made despite as some one pointed out fat soprano. It had some other features too one of them was the beautiful geometric pattern of roofs in the panoramic scan in the beginning and also interesting geometric patterns of the apartment during Tulip Chase also in the early parts these were pure piece of art. The story is nothing complex but may be because there had been several movies on this theme one I liked better was Becker's Antoine et Antoinette but that was more than 15 years junior to it so a lot of merit point comes here.

This film is certainly not light however.  While there are no razor blindings or ant infested ears the pope does fall victim to a firing squad of radicals.  In fact I believe Bunuel succeds in leaving the viewer much more disgusted and upset by confronting him with the stark realities of the Catholic faith and after all isn't that what surrealism is all about?  It must be said that in order to understand and appreciate this film one must have a very good understanding of a variety of religious thinkers and of the historypractices of the catholic church.  If you don't have such a background but are still lucky enough to get a chance to view this film by all means take it more likely than not it will inspire you to investigate the matter further and Bunuel conveniently mentions the names of all most all the writers he references in the film so take that list to a library read up and watch it again you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " plenty of scabrous bits of Bunuel's Catholic and faithbased criticism and questioning the parts are much greater than the whole";
	schema:reviewBody "I might be tempted to call the Milky Way a masterpiece but for all of the excellent scenes that dance along on the edge of being silly strange deadserious and scathing in attack Luis Bunuel doesn't make it quite an easy first viewing. It is alongside Phantom of Liberty though maybe moreso considering its picaresque flow a difficult film to follow at times as the folds go in and out of the two pilgrims on their way to Compostela as if in an ocean current. We see Jesus and his disciples. We see some 15th or 4th century sermons and heretic slayings and practices sometimes seeming as mystical as something out of the Dark Crystal. And there's even a duel between two sides of the Catholic coin debating between specifics in the nature of god while fencing furiously. It's what could be defined if one were looking for an easy label true surrealism pointed right at the edge of contradictions of the daring of the random and of chances taken at the expense of all authority be damned and at the same time it's a drama of fanaticism and faith in general. What is it to believe and actually buy into these guys who at their most genial are storytellers and at their worst will burn you at the stake for not going for God in threes versus God as one? Bunuel at the least for his admirers makes an attempt with his collaborator JeanClaude Carriere to raise questions in the midst of raucous entertainment. Although Bunuel can be even greater when being devilish and playful eg Discreet Charm the Milky Way displays the filmmaker reveling in the history and nature of heresy in a construct that's maybe more daring. One truly can't expect what will come next as one may see a scene with a priest flipflopping about whether or not the Holy Ghost is in the communion wafer or not and soon thereafter taken back to the asylum and then a scene with a ragtag group of evangelicals in the woods who may or may not be paying heed to God or to the Devil or both or a chef being questioned about how Jesus walked and then a cutaway to how Jesus really walked. As the two pilgrims go along their way having their own delirious encounters missing by a bit being struck by lightning debating Christian free will one hoping for a car to crash which does and then seeing some angel of death or other in the backseat and in their continuous streak of being turned awaykicked out by those who would take them in if not for essential hypocrisies a pattern does start to form if one could call it that or at least the essential pieces to Bunuel's puzzle.A lot of times one laughs at the subtlety and the outrageousness should Jesus shave do nuns crucify one another how much can a priest pontificate about not having sex under any circumstances. But it's actually after the film ends that even more ideas start to come around. And yet Bunuel is so cunning so deadpan with how he directs the actors some part of his repertory some not that it skims into becoming straight drama which in that case would make it almost dull the film actually faced some unfair criticism when first released that Bunuel had suddenly made a film cherishing the things he used to damn.

	onyx:emotionText "I might be tempted to call the Milky Way a masterpiece but for all of the excellent scenes that dance along on the edge of being silly strange deadserious and scathing in attack Luis Bunuel doesn't make it quite an easy first viewing. It is alongside Phantom of Liberty though maybe moreso considering its picaresque flow a difficult film to follow at times as the folds go in and out of the two pilgrims on their way to Compostela as if in an ocean current. We see Jesus and his disciples. We see some 15th or 4th century sermons and heretic slayings and practices sometimes seeming as mystical as something out of the Dark Crystal. And there's even a duel between two sides of the Catholic coin debating between specifics in the nature of god while fencing furiously. It's what could be defined if one were looking for an easy label true surrealism pointed right at the edge of contradictions of the daring of the random and of chances taken at the expense of all authority be damned and at the same time it's a drama of fanaticism and faith in general. What is it to believe and actually buy into these guys who at their most genial are storytellers and at their worst will burn you at the stake for not going for God in threes versus God as one? Bunuel at the least for his admirers makes an attempt with his collaborator JeanClaude Carriere to raise questions in the midst of raucous entertainment. Although Bunuel can be even greater when being devilish and playful eg Discreet Charm the Milky Way displays the filmmaker reveling in the history and nature of heresy in a construct that's maybe more daring. One truly can't expect what will come next as one may see a scene with a priest flipflopping about whether or not the Holy Ghost is in the communion wafer or not and soon thereafter taken back to the asylum and then a scene with a ragtag group of evangelicals in the woods who may or may not be paying heed to God or to the Devil or both or a chef being questioned about how Jesus walked and then a cutaway to how Jesus really walked. As the two pilgrims go along their way having their own delirious encounters missing by a bit being struck by lightning debating Christian free will one hoping for a car to crash which does and then seeing some angel of death or other in the backseat and in their continuous streak of being turned awaykicked out by those who would take them in if not for essential hypocrisies a pattern does start to form if one could call it that or at least the essential pieces to Bunuel's puzzle.A lot of times one laughs at the subtlety and the outrageousness should Jesus shave do nuns crucify one another how much can a priest pontificate about not having sex under any circumstances. But it's actually after the film ends that even more ideas start to come around. And yet Bunuel is so cunning so deadpan with how he directs the actors some part of his repertory some not that it skims into becoming straight drama which in that case would make it almost dull the film actually faced some unfair criticism when first released that Bunuel had suddenly made a film cherishing the things he used to damn. How curious deranged and honest even in this part of the appeal the playing of both sides. While it is fairly well known that Bunuel became an atheist following a strict Catholic upbringing one quote of his also the name of a documentary on the Criterion DVD is I'm an atheist thank God it's never clear whether Bunuel will take one side or the other.

Early in the film we hear the line A religion without mystery is not a religion at all. A heresy that denies a mystery can attract the weak and the shallow but can never blot out the truth. My ears perked up. I was keenly interested in a film that was going to confront both religion and its opposition head on.Two modernday travelers are on the road as the film opens from Paris to Spain. It's the customary episodic framework of the poor enduring as transient vagabonds feeling purpose in heading in a particular direction. It's also the even more customary fable of the wandering adventurer and his companion in search of revelation and virtue. Spanishborn absurdist filmmaker Luis Bunuel juxtaposes these narrative customs into a sort of cinematic reality existing in a unique dimension. The pilgrims are contemporary but time and space chaperon them in a continual instant and an allencompassed earth science.The protagonists of blasphemy and tradition portray their ideals in ageold Palestine in the Europe of the Middle Ages in the Age of Reason and in today's hotels and fashionable restaurants and on its boulevards. The Holy Virgin her son Jesus and his young brothers an arrogant ecclesiastical headwaiter and his submissive workers a bleeding child by the roadside the pope facing a firing squad the Whore of Babylon ambushing ramblers the Marquis de Sade the Jansenist fencing with the Jesuit Satan himself decked out as a rock star an overzealously formal schoolmarm and her programmed little students chanting anathemas selfrighteous bishops and demented priests on the lam this panoramic cast of characters in itself a smirking takeoff of Hollywood's epic ensembles somehow expresses the barren conceptions of Christian dissent. Is there such a thing as the Holy Trinity? Was Christ God man and Holy Ghost one after the other at the same time or was he invariably just God the Father disguised as a human so as to be seen? Was Jesus solely the mortal embodiment of a supreme spirit? Was his anguish then just facade? Because if he experienced pain at the hands of mortals was he a god? Was Christ merely a smidgen of God's psyche? Are we free to discern between the exploits of Jesus the man and the teachings of Christ the god? Was Christ indeed two men one born of God the Father the other of Mary the Mother? Did Mary become pregnant in the same manner that light exceeds through a window glass? Did Jesus have brothers?As Buuel conceives visual substance to these religious contemplations he does so with far flung ability in banter and farce. The escaped lunatic believes that Christ is in the host like the rabbit is in the pt. The pope's death by firing squad is something we'll never see. The debate of doctrine by the hostile matre d' and his waiters is in the royal practice of slapstick comedy. The dueling clerics clanking swords for Jesuitical piety and Jansenistic sin are a comic rendition of the vintage MGM swashbuckling jousts pared down to knowingly meaningless and irrational argument.However side by side with the broad comical tone Buuel is here tussling with the inconsistencies between faith and faithlessness. The young heretic who dons the hunter's garb and shoots at the rosary receives it back from the hands of the Virgin Mary and lets tears cascade down his heretical face. Really as Pierre tells Jean when lightning strikes God knows all but we don't know what he knows. Buuel apparently favored scenes which could just be pieced together by the ends in the editing room producing long mobile wide shots which follow the action. He aggregates all of these significations and implications into a streaming uninterrupted visual existence recognizing the curious obscurities of both the comformists to the approved form of Christianity and the professed believers who nonetheless maintain contrary theologies and reject churchprescribed doctrines while prosecuting the dogmatic certitudes of both. How else could you do it? It's a concept for a film that could only befit a surrealist.".

However THE MILKY WAY is still a milestone in the Surrealist director's career his previous effort the chic and sexy BELLE DE JOUR 1967 had performed exceptionally well at the boxoffice  hence Bunuel was given carte blanche on the next one typically he responded by delivering that which on the surface amounts to the exact opposite of what was expected of him a distinctly uncommercial venture! That said one can't very well overlook the director's approach to the material it takes the form of a picaresque odyssey dealing with two men's pilgrimage from France to the burial site of a revered saint in Spain and their many bizarre adventures along the way Paul Frankeur and Laurent Terzieff appear in the lead roles. They meet scores of people who either help hinder or simply baffle them  a few of these are actually historical figures such as the Marquis De Sade incarnated by Michel Piccoli or even symbolic ones say Pierre Clementi's brooding Satan most however are clergy even if one proves to be a fugitive from a lunatic asylum! or common people with a vested interest in Theology for instance the maitre d' played by Julien Bertheau  who after imparting much spiritual wisdom to his 'congregation' denies food to the weary protagonists! The journey is interestingly bookended by the duo's meeting with first a man Alain Cuny who predicts they will each have a child and then a whore Delphine Seyrig who offers herself up for the task what ties the two scenes together is that both strangers supply the same cryptic names to the proposed offsprings i.e. Ye Are Not Of The People and No More Mercy! Incidentally the film's episodic structure would be adopted again by Bunuel indeed it's improved upon in two subsequent films  both sublime and uproarious  namely THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE 1972 and THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY 1974 in fact one could say that these three films comprise a trilogy whose loosely interrelated narratives in which literally anything goes basically encompass all of Bunuel's many and varied concerns over the years. THE MILKY WAY is certainly the most intellectual of the director's works but it's all stylishly deployed he'd retain the deceptively glossy look of BELLE DE JOUR for which some would subsequently accuse him of selling out! throughout all his remaining efforts and undeniably hilarious for those not offended by blasphemous irreverence.Some more of the film's indelible images involve Frankeur thinking of himself as Jesus about to shave off the trademark beard and being dissuaded from doing so by Mary Edith Scob Bernard Verley then is endearing as a thoroughly commonplace if snobbish Christ  his chilling last words taken from St. Matthew's Gospel that he came to cause discord within the family unit and that woe befall anyone who loves somebody else more than him must constitute one of the most wicked finales to any film! Terzieff's casual swearword costing them a lift by an ultraconservative driver his own jinxed nature wishing a man who has bypassed them to die horribly in a road accident which happens soon after ditto when daring God to strike him with lightning and being amazed by the practically instant reply from on high later during a school activity in which little children are indoctrinated in religious intolerance Terzieff also loudly imagines a group of revolutionaries the events of May '68 were still vivid in people's minds executing the Pope  played by Bunuel himself!  via firing squad. Incidentally the director's own voice is heard  reciting a prayer in Latin!  on the radio of the aforementioned burning car in the same vein coscriptwriter JeanClaude Carriere  a regular Bunuel collaborator  makes an infrequent appearance before the cameras as a decadent bishop presiding over an orgy in the forest another sequence that is exclusively in Latin. Two more stalwart presences from the Surrealist master's canon are Claudio Brook playing another highranking church official exhuming the body of the saint  to whom our heroes and we are told thousands every year have come from afar to pay tribute  so as to excommunicate him in view of facts which have only just come to the fore! and Georges Marchal seen dueling for his steadfast beliefs but the point of the discussion is so muddled that it's soon forgotten by the participants  by the way a crucified nun is also prominently featured in this scene! For the record this film contains one of Bunuel's most famous dictums spoken by an undefined character during a transcendental sermon by a particularly insistent priest namely My hatred of Science and Technology almost brings me to the absurdity of a belief in God! According to the extras on the Criterion DVD these include an elaborate trailer an introduction by Carriere an interesting interview with noted film critic Ian Christie and a 37minute featurette which is given its due elsewhere the conception for the script came at the 1967 Venice Film Festival after a screening of JeanLuc Godard's LA CHINOISE the Nouvelle Vague exponent's fullblown induction into the realm of Political Cinema. Incidentally it's also said here that THE MILKY WAY garnered the best reviews of Bunuel's entire career!".

THE MILKY WAY is certainly the most intellectual of the director's works but it's all stylishly deployed he'd retain the deceptively glossy look of BELLE DE JOUR for which some would subsequently accuse him of selling out! throughout all his remaining efforts and undeniably hilarious for those not offended by blasphemous irreverence.Some more of the film's indelible images involve Frankeur thinking of himself as Jesus about to shave off the trademark beard and being dissuaded from doing so by Mary Edith Scob Bernard Verley then is endearing as a thoroughly commonplace if snobbish Christ  his chilling last words taken from St. Matthew's Gospel that he came to cause discord within the family unit and that woe befall anyone who loves somebody else more than him must constitute one of the most wicked finales to any film! Terzieff's casual swearword costing them a lift by an ultraconservative driver his own jinxed nature wishing a man who has bypassed them to die horribly in a road accident which happens soon after ditto when daring God to strike him with lightning and being amazed by the practically instant reply from on high later during a school activity in which little children are indoctrinated in religious intolerance Terzieff also loudly imagines a group of revolutionaries the events of May '68 were still vivid in people's minds executing the Pope  played by Bunuel himself!  via firing squad. Incidentally the director's own voice is heard  reciting a prayer in Latin!  on the radio of the aforementioned burning car in the same vein coscriptwriter JeanClaude Carriere  a regular Bunuel collaborator  makes an infrequent appearance before the cameras as a decadent bishop presiding over an orgy in the forest another sequence that is exclusively in Latin. Two more stalwart presences from the Surrealist master's canon are Claudio Brook playing another highranking church official exhuming the body of the saint  to whom our heroes and we are told thousands every year have come from afar to pay tribute  so as to excommunicate him in view of facts which have only just come to the fore! and Georges Marchal seen dueling for his steadfast beliefs but the point of the discussion is so muddled that it's soon forgotten by the participants  by the way a crucified nun is also prominently featured in this scene! For the record this film contains one of Bunuel's most famous dictums spoken by an undefined character during a transcendental sermon by a particularly insistent priest namely My hatred of Science and Technology almost brings me to the absurdity of a belief in God! According to the extras on the Criterion DVD these include an elaborate trailer an introduction by Carriere an interesting interview with noted film critic Ian Christie and a 37minute featurette which is given its due elsewhere the conception for the script came at the 1967 Venice Film Festival after a screening of JeanLuc Godard's LA CHINOISE the Nouvelle Vague exponent's fullblown induction into the realm of Political Cinema. Incidentally it's also said here that THE MILKY WAY garnered the best reviews of Bunuel's entire career!";

	schema:reviewBody "Le fantme de la libert Buuel 1974 seems to take off right from this film as if it were a sequel visually and conceptually.  This film however is much more determined to denounce the contradictions and hypocrisy of different religions while Fantme has even more artistic freedom.  Also this is much more coherent and if there is any danger of getting heavyhanded Buuel knows how to joke himself a way out using illusionism or a mild shocktreatment.  It is simultaneously very rational and miraculous.  The anticlericism and subversive desires frequently come to the surreal surface.  I can't help but see this as an inspiration for Monty Python's 'Life of Brian' 1979 because that film also remotely feels like an off the wall road movie in which anything can happen.The subject matter was sort of tough for an atheist heretic? like me but the humour with which Buuel lets the characters throw the crucial differences between religions at each other is hilarious.  E.g. in the middle of a duel between a Catholic and a Jesuit 'Prior will is mere impulse.  My thoughts and my will are not in my own power ... ma liberte est un fantme.' 'What does freedom mean anyway?  How can I be free if what I do is determined in advance?' etc.  And why would all the personnel of a restaurant be caught up in an eloquent discussion about the existence of God while they are at work?  See for yourself.  Cinematographer Christian Matras also Le Grande Illusion 1937 continues to improve Buuel's visual style using zoompanzoom shots for instance but keeps it sober.910".

The coherent narratives of Los Olivados Criminal Life of Archibaldo de la Cruz Exterminating Angel or even Discrete Charm of the Bourgoise.Bunuel loved ambiguity and abstraction. He loved making people feel uncertain of things in all his movies  yet many of them maintain a serene smooth surface nonetheless  there may be dream sequences in them and things out of the ordinary happening yet they don't jump around in the madcap way this movie and L'Age D'Or do constantly making the viewer adjust to a new scene with seemingly no relation to the last which is afterwards resolved when the pilgrims appear and reinstate continuity.The two pilgrim characters are our tour guides through a patchwork of historical vignettes involving important religious events.The highlight of the film for me was when a priest is talking to a man and a woman through a locked door locked on the advice of the innkeeper presumably to keep the chaplin from coming into their rooms and preaching to them and the chaplin is talking to them about how Mary could have given birth and remained a virgin. He thinks of an example of this like light coming through a window. Bunuel cuts from the priest sitting outside the room to the couple inside the room and suddenly the priest is sitting inside the room talking to he couple. In the next shot he is outside and the following shot inside again. A superb example of cinematic irony.I'm actually not quite sure what i thought of the film  its certainly not among my favourite Bunuels Discrete Charm of the Bourgoisie Exterminating Angel Los Olivados L'Age D'Or but its the sort of film that clearly rewards repeat viewings. As another reviewer commented a knowledge of religious history reaped rich rewards from it which makes me wish i knew a little more than i did.Clifford's Commendations Like with any Bunuel film if you're christian and you get it you won't like it! If you're not christian it'll help if you know some christian history to get all the laughs and satire on offer. Without this knowledge from personal experience the film has fruits to offer but you won't enjoy it as much as many other Bunuels.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two drifters Paul Frankeur and Laurent Terzieff go on a pilgrimage from France to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Along the way  they beg for food a man Alain Cuny with cape  hitchhike and face the Christian dogmas and heresies from different Ages . Both of whom meet up with Jesus Bernard Verley showing off his abilities  Virgin Mary Edith Scob doing miracles  and the Marquis de Sade Michel Piccoli who is with a young girl in chains  a prostitute Delphine Seyrig and also Satan Pierre Clementi who appears during a car accident . This is a typical Buuel film  as there are a lot of symbolism and surrealism  including mockery or wholesale review upon religion especially Catholicism . Luis Buuel was given a strict Jesuit education which sowed the seeds of his obsession with both subversive behavior and religion  issues well shown in Milky way . Here Buuel makes an implacable attack to the Catholic church  theme that would preoccupy Buuel for the rest of his career . Interesting and thoughtprovoking screenplay from the same Luis Buuel and Jean Claude Carriere  Buuel's usual screenwriter . After returning his native country Spain by making Viridiana this film was prohibited on the grounds of blasphemy as well as The milky way or Via Lactea  both of them were strongly prohibited by Spanish censorship . The stories in La Voie Lacte 1969 are based on real historical episodes . Luis Buuel and JeanClaude Carrire did extensive research for the film primarily in the Dictionary of Heresies by Abb Pluquet. It is packed with surreal moments  criticism  absurd situations and religious elements about Catholic Church  furthermore Buuel satirizes and he carries out outright attacks to religious lifestyle and Christian liturgy . According to his autobiography My Last Sight  Luis Buuel got the idea of making the film after reading  Historia De Heterodoxos Espaoles  by Marcelino Menndez y Pelayo. Pretty good cast gives fine acting  it is mostly formed by nice French actors such as Alain Cuny as Man with cape  Edith Scob as Virgin Mary  Bernard Verley as Jesus Julien Bertheau as Hotel Maitre and Michel Piccoli as Marquis Sade  Pierre Clementi as Devil and Claudio Brook as Bishop .The motion picture was compellingly directed by Luis Buuel who was voted the 14th Greatest Director of all time . This Buuel's strange film belongs to his French second period  in fact  it's plenty of known French actors . As Buuel subsequently emigrated from Mexico to France where filmed other excellent movies . After moving to Paris  at the beginning Buuel did a variety of filmrelated odd jobs  including working as an assistant to director Jean Epstein . With financial help from his mother and creative assistance from Dal he made his first film  this 17minute Un Chien Andalou 1929 and immediately catapulted himself into film history thanks to its disturbing images and surrealist plot . The following year  sponsored by wealthy art patrons he made his first picture  the scabrous witty and violent Age of Gold 1930 which mercilessly attacked the church and the middle classes themes that would preoccupy Buuel for the rest of his career . That career though seemed almost over by the mid1930s as he found work increasingly hard to come by and after the Spanish Civil War  where he made Las Hurdes  as Luis emigrated to the US where he worked for the Museum of Modern Art and as a film dubber for Warner Bros . He subsequently went on his Mexican period he teamed up with producer scar Dancigers and after a couple of unmemorable efforts shot back to international attention with the lacerating study of Mexican street urchins in Los Olvidados 1950 winning him the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. But despite this newfound acclaim Buuel spent much of the next decade working on a variety of ultralowbudget films few of which made much impact outside Spanishspeaking countries  though many of them are well worth seeking out . As he went on filming The Great Madcap  The brute Wuthering Heights El  The Criminal Life of Archibaldo De la Cruz  Robinson Crusoe  Death in the garden and many others . And finally his FrenchSpanish period in collaboration with producer Serge Silberman and writer JeanClaude Carrire with notorious as well as polemic films such as Viridiana  Tristana  The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and his last picture  That Obscure Object of Desire .".

	schema:reviewBody "The Milky Way ends like a documentary would  with the following sentences Everything in this film concerning the Catholic religion and the heresies it has provoked especially from the dogmatic point of view is rigorously exact. The texts and citations are taken either direct from Scripture or modern and ancient works on theology and ecclesiastical history. This perfectly explains what its topic is. Having been raised a Jesuit Luis Buuel developed an obsession with religion which he incorporated in his movies. His negative portrayal of the aforementioned caused most of his movies to be found extremely offensive and some were even banned. The Milky Way is one of these controversial movies.The story is not easily summarised since this is a surrealist movie  some scenes seem to be randomly inserted into it to break its continuity. Mostly it follows Pierre Paul Frankeur and Jean Laurent Terzief on their pilgrimage from France to Santiago de Compostela. While on the road these two men encounter many people of different time periods in history beg for food and look for someone to take them to Spain for free.While the movie is very objective in its portrayal of Christianity through history its goal is to criticise it especially the Church and its members. However it is not antireligious  it is more of a satiric view of the many pointless theological fights throughout history and of certain Christian principles. It should be seen by atheists and believers alike and it will likely due to its subject polarize its audience ones may love it and the others might hate it. In spite of that the important thing is to realise that even the neutral facts are easily used as arguments against religion. Therefore I think one of the movie's messages is that we should at least question the opportunity of culturally imposing religion in everyday life. But this review shouldn't turn into a discussion about the basis of religion especially because there is so much more that can be said about The Milky Way. Although it occasionally seems messy and unclear since it is along with Le fantme de la libert aka The Phantom of Liberty 1974 one of Buuel's most surreal movies these characteristics make it even more enjoyable.Perhaps absurdly the movie feels very real since there is no soundtrack and the characters behave naturally in a common environment although there are some strange scenes like for example a person being in and outside a room at the same time. This unusual combination of realistic and unrealistic segments gives the movie a vibe of likable uncertainty. The cinematography is guaranteed to impress you particularly if you've never seen a surrealistic movie before as I said the bizarre dreamlike situations are quite enjoyable and funny and the symbolism in certain scenes is simply superb. Because of its frequent use of the forementioned symbolism The Milky Way is complex and can be interpreted in many ways. It is very difficult to praise this movie without spoiling it considering it works really well as a whole and as many independent stories linked by Pierre and Jean's pilgrimage and each story needs to be summarised to be understood. So just watch it it's worthy of your time.Rating 910 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com".

The cinematography is guaranteed to impress you particularly if you've never seen a surrealistic movie before as I said the bizarre dreamlike situations are quite enjoyable and funny and the symbolism in certain scenes is simply superb. Because of its frequent use of the forementioned symbolism The Milky Way is complex and can be interpreted in many ways. It is very difficult to praise this movie without spoiling it considering it works really well as a whole and as many independent stories linked by Pierre and Jean's pilgrimage and each story needs to be summarised to be understood. So just watch it it's worthy of your time.Rating 910 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com";

	schema:reviewBody "The Milky Way is set in comparatively modern times. Two vagabond pilgrims make a journey to Spain. Specifically to Santiago de Compostela. The remains of James the Apostle were thought to be interred there. On the way they meet various characters from different time periods. Including Jesus the devil the Virgin Mary Jesuits Jansenists the Marquis de Sade assorted clerics and a prostitute. All provide vignettes in which points of heresy are debated. People are routinely condemned to death or challenged to duels based on the fine shading of the wording of faith. It runs like a cross between Pilgrim's Progress and The Canterbury Tales with just a touch of Life of Brian in passing.But what puts the Milky Way in a class apart from most films of its ilk  even reverent biblical epics  is its careful adherence to the wording of the theological debates running through Christianity's history. According to Buuel who deserted Catholicism for atheism at the age of sixteen Besides the situation itself and the authentic doctrinal dispute it evokes the film is above all a journey through fanaticism where each person obstinately clings to his own particle of truth ready if need be to kill or to die for it. The road traveled by the two pilgrims can represent finally any political or even aesthetic ideology.Strangely the film was welcomed on release both by Buuel's antireligious following and to his embarrassment the The Holy See itself. According to his biographer Buuel had planned for many years a film that would affirm his atheism the intellectual scepticism he held towards a church he had renounced in his teens. Director and producer compiled a list of apostasies and repression and concluded that most heresies came from six areas of doubt 1 The double nature of Christ. Was he God or man? God and man? God pretending to be man? 2 The Trinity how can three natures coexist in the same entity? 3 The Immaculate Conception. Mary a virgin was nevertheless Christ's mother. 4 Transubstantiation. Can bread literally become the body of Christ? Is this just a metaphor? 5 The problem of God's omnipotence. Is God allpowerful? If so do we enjoy free will? 6 Evil. Did God create evil? The list suggested no obvious structure so they simply dramatized incidents illustrating the heresies linking them with a pair of wandering modern pilgrims.Now if you've read this far you may well already be interested in theology whether as a believer or atheist but it highlights one of the big shortcomings of the film. The psychopathology of Christianity is mainly of interest to its own theologians. While the film will just about hold you if you have already pondered such questions others may be wondering why he spent so long dwelling on such bilge. Having dispensed he claims with such imponderables is he simply exorcising old ghosts from his early teens? One religiousbased reviewer wrote Whilst it's certainly sceptical about Christianity the fact that it's been written by people who know their Catholicism inside out and are not afraid to make a film that is inaccessible to those do not means the film at least deserves some respect even if ultimately we disagree with its somewhat tenuous conclusions. It is a position with which I could only guardedly agree.One thing troubles me says a young acolyte in one of the film's Spanish Inquisition periods. The burning of heretics  may it not go against the will of the Holy Spirit? The inquisitor replies It is the secular justice of men that punishes them. Not because they are heretics but for their sedition. Pushing his luck the acolyte counters with But then those whose brothers have been burnt will burn others and so on. Each one believing he possesses the truth. Why these millions of deaths? A stern glance and the acolyte desists  before he too is cast to the flames. The logic seems more applicable to the constant conflicts between Islam and Christianity  or at least Palestine and Israel. In terms of burning people the Catholic Church triumphed over every other brand of Christianity with unfettered brutality.Perhaps Buuel found it amusing or even instructive to make this film. The millions of deaths and the fanaticism that led to them is not condemned. To the believer perhaps they were God's will. But to this reviewer at least Buuel maybe falls short of his usual high achievements in elevating the good or bringing down hypocrisy. The Milky way is clever enough  even erudite  but ultimately an intellectual exercise rather than the powerful film it could have been.nb  six areas of doubt are quoted from Baxter's biography of the director".

An ambitious cineessay on the history of heresy within Catholicism it's intellectual ambition in no way get in the way of its ability to affect the viewer as a work of cinema. Indeed it might be the most cinematic film in Bunuel's oeuvre. The cinematography by Christian Matras of Grand Illusion fame is uncharacteristically beautiful for a Bunuel film and although this is allegory at it's most ambitious it is also a film about life on the road.This was a late career movie for Bunuel and he was already in his late 60s when he made it. But few of his films seem to me to be possessed by such youthful rigor. Perhaps Bunuel working in France at the time was inspired by the rebellious whipersnapper directors of the then still new French New Wave particularly Godard whose Weekend this film sometimes resembles. The final particularly blasphemous scenes present Christ not as a unifier but a figure whose words and they are taken directly from the Gospels are meant to create a vicious anarchy of interpretation.".

Catholicism is weird.In The Milky Way Luis Bunuel essentially creates a surrealist narrative by taking Christian and especially Catholic thought to its direct interpretation. It works very well for some neat set ups and interesting moments but then again that's always the problem of taking on a religionif you take the texts literally sure you can prove a point. You're also missing their point. And when it comes to dogma well of course it's absurd! I don't know in this case I can't claim to be too impressed with Bunuel's statement.However I can still be impressed by his directing particularly since the guy knows where to put the camera. Like any later Bunuel and most other Bunuel as well The Milky Way should be watched by aspiring filmmakers so that they can more fully understand the concept of blocking. In this movie especially he favors a dolly indolly out technique which really helps provide emphasis while keeping a distance. It's like a curious person running over to take a quick look understanding that they don't belong and then backing off. That pretty much perfectly represents Bunuel's feelings on the issues I think.PolarisDiB".

It is only venomous weird and coarse.The first thing obvious when one studies the large savage attacks on Christianity and the clergy by the surrealist masters like Luis Buuel and Fellini is the peripheral marginal cheap and frivolous shallow character of the things aimed at stuff on the outskirts treated with patent dishonesty and illwill. In other words the attack is so badly so stupidly aimed directed that it's almost touching by its naive and uncultured poison. Of course such attacks may and in fact are hurtful and harmful especially with an equally uncultured and naive audience.Luis Buuel the undevout mastersigns this receipt that recycles in mere lack of wit the vast majority of the cheap clichs of rabid anticatholic propaganda. The movie looks almost like the adaptation of a 16th. century antiRoman lampoon skit.His hatred damaged his integrity and pushed him towards infantile nonsense.It is stunning how little tries Luis Buuel to understand something anything about the Church i.e. the Christianity as suchand how eager he is of engrossing huge amounts of the chaff and the offal and garbage of the most filthy livid viscous anticatholic hatred. After all the man was the contemporary of several major creative Catholic andor Christian theologians. His ignorance and complete lack of culture and wit are astounding.It is disgusting that Luis Buuel identified with the generation that dreamed of shooting the Pope.

I think both of them did the film because of the opportunity to spend time on the Riviera. That's as good a reason as any I've ever heard.The two stars are a pair of fortune hunters.

Bet you never thought of that as a torch song. But when Marlene does it in her inimitable style it has possibilities.But what I can't figure out is why DeSica was given 18 year old Natalie Trundy to go after. I mean the writers couldn't have had him trying to work O'Connell's sister instead of a daughter? He really comes across as a dirty old man. It's the main weakness of the film.Among the supporting players is Italian comedian Renato Rascel who would costar with Mario Lanza in The Seven Hills Of Rome the following year. He plays a pawnbroker who wants his tickets redeemed or Marlene's jewelry. Seems as though she had an agreement with Rascel's brother to allow her to wear the jewels for the casinos. Rascel wants an end to that practice and he and Dietrich have some great scenes together.The wide screen color cinematography of Monaco and the Riviera are absolutely breathtaking. I'm glad color was used for this beautiful spot on the planet.According to a recent biography of Marlene Dietrich Vittorio DeSica had two great passions pursuit of young girls in real life like Natalie Trundy and the gaming tables. He was a candidate for Gamblers Anonymous DeSica when he won financed his films that way.

Both have a planto find a rich person to marry and bail them out of their predicament. Unfortunately they find each othernot realizing the other is no better off than they are. Both use all their charms and power of persuasion at the fancy resort town of Monte Carlo...but it's all for naught and they eventually realize their mistakes.Soon a rich American Arthur O'Connell and his young daughter Natalie Trundy arrive in Monte Carlo and Dietrich and De Sica decide to try to woo both of them as a marriage to either of them could end their money troubles. However he has an Italian accent and she has a German oneand they inexplicably poses as brother and sister when they insinuate themselves into these Americans' lives. What happens next? See the film yourself! Overall a pleasant and inconsequential film made more enjoyable by the stars and the lovely locale.

	onyx:emotionText "Vittorio De Sica and Marlene Dietrich both play members of the nobility who live the high life but both are completely broke. Both have a planto find a rich person to marry and bail them out of their predicament. Unfortunately they find each othernot realizing the other is no better off than they are. Both use all their charms and power of persuasion at the fancy resort town of Monte Carlo...but it's all for naught and they eventually realize their mistakes.Soon a rich American Arthur O'Connell and his young daughter Natalie Trundy arrive in Monte Carlo and Dietrich and De Sica decide to try to woo both of them as a marriage to either of them could end their money troubles. However he has an Italian accent and she has a German oneand they inexplicably poses as brother and sister when they insinuate themselves into these Americans' lives. What happens next? See the film yourself! Overall a pleasant and inconsequential film made more enjoyable by the stars and the lovely locale. In fact I think if the movie stank it would STILL be worth seeing as the sites are breathtaking.By the way early in the film when the pair Dietrich and De Sica are shooting skeet it's obvious the guns AREN'T loadednot even blanks. It's kind of sloppy and silly to watch.";

Dietrich looks as though she had been on a starvation diet and wiggles her way across the screen in some extremely tight dresses without the slightest hint of sex appeal. Even when the film was made it must have seemed oldfashioned. Now it looks as though dinosaurs still roamed the land. Just about watchable for the locations and as a curiosity for Dietrich fans. Technically the film is interesting as being one of the first to use the Technirama process which rivalled Cinemascope but used a larger frame size so the picture is much clearer. Whether this benefited the actors is debatable but the scenery is pretty good. The whole film is available on YouTube but of course the quality is nothing like the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Mothman Prophecies is a solid thriller. It's supposedly based on true events but even if it weren't it would be worth a look. Richard Gere stars as a Washington Post reporter who inexplicably finds himself in a small West Virginia town where a series of strange goingson have been happening. His wife was killed two years prior in a mysterious car accident and there seems to be a connection between her death and the strange happenings in Point Pleasant. Holding the key behind the mystery seems to be a large mothlike creature who tends to show up in places where the loss of human life is about to occur. Gere meets up with several locals who claim to have seen the Mothman and after a while this creature begins communicating with him. The creature warns people of tragedies about to strike plane crashes earthquakes and Gere thinks this creature can even put him in contact with his dead wife. Gere is given a warning about an upcoming tragedy near Point Pleasant but can he act in time to stop it? Or should he even try? The film is very moody and sullen. The direction and photography are top drawer and they enhance the mood greatly. The acting is terrific as well. I usually can't stand Gere but he's great in this film. Laura Linney would seem miscast as a local cop but by the end of the film she will have proved how truly talented she is. Will Patton is outstanding as a local resident who has several runins with the Mothman until it drives him crazy.What exactly is the Mothman? According to this film he's some type of oracle. He can see bad things that will happen and he can even see through to the other side. Does he cause these tragedies? The film would seem to argue not. Though he may have caused the fatal car accident that took Gere's wife early on. Apparently the concept of the Mothman has been around for a while but this film gives a pretty good explanation of it for those of us who had never heard of it before.The film came up short of its 40 million budget in theaters. I blame this on a terrible marketing campaign and some bad reviews from the big name critics. Don't let their reviews scare you away. This film is very good. I was hooked after seeing only a couple minutes of it. It was the very effective scene where Gere and Patton first meet up at his home one evening. That was well done! Be warned however. The film will likely leave you feeling very mortal and maybe even depressed. There is a really cool newage rock song during the credits that also adds to the mood.Consider this film a thinking man's Final Destination. The climactic scene at the end could have even wandered in from one of those movies. The Mothman Prophecies is worth about 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:headline " About as eerie as it gets";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on actual events that occurred in the 60's. John and Mary Klein are a happy couple who have just purchased a new house. The excitement over their new place is shortlived when they have a car accident following the purchase. Mary winds up in the hospital with a head injury but the CT scans reveal that she has something far worse wrong with her. She eventually dies leaving a devastated John to discover that she had been drawing sketches of mothlike figures during her time at the hospital. A year passes and John is scheduled to do an interview for his Washington Post job. On his drive to the interview he mysteriously winds up in Point Pleasant West Virginia with no recollection of how he got so far out of his way. Mysterious events are plaguing this small town events that may be connected to what happened to his wife.I first saw this way back on opening night and loved it. As someone who is really into the unexplained myths and legends this film is right up my alley. The story of the Mothman is one of the most fascinating I've ever come across and while The Mothman Prophecies takes a great deal of liberty with the story it's a terrific film all the same.I've never cared for Richard Gere but I fully admit that he's very good here. He nails the confused distraught mental state of John Klein and is very believable in the role. Laura Linney is also solid though that's no surprise. The standout though is Will Patton. One of my favorite character actors his portrayal of the rugged Gordon Smallwood an individual who seems to have a deep connection to the Mothman is absolutely perfect. This guy rarely fails to impress the hell out of me. He just has an awesome screen presence.The abnormal occurrences throughout the film certainly produce an unsettling atmosphere. Coupled with eerie imagery and surreal filming techniques they help the film become quite nightmarish. The use of sound is most effective as well with all sorts of bizarre noises being heard including the odd screeching noise that the Mothman was said to have made in some of the real accounts. We also get a moody score that's a perfect fit for the film. Just listening to the soundtrack is guaranteed to give you chills. I know from experience. Speaking of chills one of my favorite scenes is when Klein speaks with the Mothman entity having dubbed itself Indrid Cold on his motel room's phone. It's a wonderfully tense scene and Cold's voice gets under your skin.The effects of the occurrences on the small town of Point Pleasant are well explored as many different aspects and accounts are introduced. The town itself comes off as a bleak and unnerving place. Almost lifeless. The occurrences have basically killed off the town's livelihood. Gere's John Klein becomes increasingly paranoid the longer he stays in Point Pleasant and when his dead wife appears to the sheriff he becomes increasingly tortured. It isn't long before he's driven to a distant and isolated state of being much like Gordon before him.The climactic scenes do not disappoint either. The scene where Klein realizes what is really going to happen makes for a powerful moment and the final scenes on the Silver Bridge are as tense and suspenseful as they are exciting. It's a very welldone climax both dramatically and from a technical standpoint. A fine way to finish the film.Overall this is a deeply eerie surreal piece of work. Nightmarish really is the best word for it. It also has interesting characters and some emotional moments. I'm a big fan.".

He knocks on a nearby house to call for help and the man who answers the door attacks him saying Klein's been around three days in a row. But has he?Two years earlier John's wife died from injuries sustained in a car wreck and before she died in an apparent delirium she had been etching weird drawings. Could her drawings have some connection with this town?Based on true events The Mothman Prophecies follows John through his search for the truth. People in the town report seeing a strange being  are they lying or are they misinterpreting? Are they simply seeing UFOs or is there more to the story? Intrepid reporter that he is John wants to know more  although of course his thirst for knowledge is accompanied by a need to know what happened to his wife why did the car crash?.Thrillers such as this one are hard to come by. It's not exactly a horror movie but there are more than enough creepy moments to send a few chills reverberating through your body. It's a film that relies less on special effects than on such quaint ideals as character motivation and development and atmosphere. In fact this movie's just brimming with atmosphere. We've all seen those cheesy movies in which a car runs out of gas along a desolate country road and then BAM  some serial killers make dinner or belts out of the hapless occupants. But in this case the monster is hardly ever seen thereby heightening the scares.At the centerpiece is Gere as Klein. I've never ever been a Gere fan it seems to me he has one expression. He's never been terribly emotive and has been known in recent years more for the age disparity with his female costars than for anything else they get younger he stays the same old dude. Call him ruggedly handsome if you will but vacuity is never really appealing.But this is not your typical Gere at all. He definitely turns in the best work of his career. Sure he was appealing in Pretty Woman but it was Julie Roberts' movie. Officer and a Gentleman? Ok but that was Lou Gosset Jr.'s movie. Primal Fear? Red Corner? Runaway Bride? No no no. This is acting on a ledge for Gere. It's a true departure from the romantic comedies and the sly psuedomysterydramas. Ordinarily I would think such a movie would expose Gere for the terrible actor he is. But I would be wrong. This movie was so well written and directed that Gere rose to its level rather than sinking it. That's a huge credit to him as an actor.Now I need to differentiate between good acting and appeal. An actor can look good or be charming in a role and still be a bad actor by contrast an actor can look uncharming and turn in a great performance. But what's key is how the actor draws the audience in  do they sympathize with his plight? Are they on his side? How good of an actor he is will answer that question.Gere's Klein starts out as an average joe and then we get to see him slowly descend into madness  we even descend a little with him. That vaunted atmosphere is so vibrant and realistic that we turn when he turns and feel things he feels. This is an absolute hallmark of excellent filmmaking by Mark Pellington whose only other big film was 1999's Arlington Road. The writing is crisp and eminently believable and the acting in addition to Gere including Laura Linney Debra Messing and Will Patton is simply superb. And don't forget the prophecies part of the title either this Mothman entity issues warnings to whomever it deems worthy. Which sounds good as long as one can interpret them correctly. Apparently many have not.The story is based on actual events that took place in Point Pleasant West Virginia but this is no Amityville Horror story. With Amityville one could distance oneself from the experiences of the family involved we could say that it would never happen to us it was only a movie. This is a little trickier with The Mothman Prophecies. It's a creepy tingly movie that gets under your skin and crawls all over your heart.".

The plot takes Gere to the OhioWest Virginia border where he meets with the local residents who all seem to be having their troubles with strange lights weird phone calls and a bird like creature which they call the Mothman. Klein investigates the mystery at the cost of his own sanity and career.The film is very scary but lacks the pace and fibre that made the John A. Keel's book an awe inspiring read. There are no Men In Black UFO's alien impregnated women phone tapings or a clear resolution to some of the character's fate. In fact only about 10 of the book is actually reproduced in the film. The other 90 seems to have been plucked from an episode of the Xfiles'... but what a good episode it is! This is a film that has high production values. The lighting camerawork sound and editing are always on top form which is something that prevents the movie from disappearing into the ranks of science fiction B movie hokum. The Mothman Prophecies' looks simply weirdly' gorgeous on the big screen.There is not enough Mothman revealed to the viewer but country folk Gordon Smallwood the well cast and superbly acted Will Patton creates a much needed conduit into the effects that the Mothman has on the people of Point Pleasant and this is what the film is really all about  The consequences that the supernatural can have on the psyche of a small backward town's population. Although the ending is Mothman free it certainly does jolt the emotions and evokes a sort of belittling sympathy for the human beings of this planet.Watch this film and then go read the book for a much better look at really went on.

	schema:reviewBody "I just got back from the first showing of the first day of release of The Mothman Prophecies and I am left with only four short wordsGo see it. NOW!Simply put The Mothman Prophecies is the scariest horror movie since RING Since many Americans won't be able to see RING for quite some time they should consider tasting another slice of the terror pie with Mothman. It's already a strong candidate for best horror film of 2002...and even as a hardcore genre fan I'd have to put it on my list of favorite horror movies of all time.I had been fascinated by the Mothman myth since 1995 when I first read of its existence in a book of legends and folklore. Since then I've often thought about making a horror film based on the story. And as you might guess some one clearly beat me to the punch! The film takes some bizarre allegedly true events that occurred in the mid60s in Point Pleasant West Viriginia and updates the strange phenomena to present day using a somewhat fictionalized story.Richard Gere plays John Klein a character that I assume is based on real life author John Keel a Washington Post reporter whose wife dies of a brain tumor shortly after a bizarre seemingly unexplainable car accident. After she dies he finds pictures she drew during her final days pictures of a bizarre looking winged creature with glowing red eyes.Flash forward two years. Klein is on his way to meet the governor of Virginia when his car breaks down. He goes to get help I won't reveal the creepy details of this sequence and learns that he is nowhere near his destination. Rather in the space of 90 minutes he has somehow managed to travel 400 miles to Point Pleasant West Virginia. There he encounters Sgt. Connie Parker played by Laura Linney who tells him of the many strange going ons in the town...specifically the accounts of a bizarre creature from witnesses who are by all accounts reputable. She shows him a sketch that one witness drew of the creature and it is nearly identical to the bizarre drawings Klein's wife had done before her death.You can probably guess where the film is headed from this point in fact that's part of the beauty. Astute viewers will always be one step ahead of the characters onscreen and one step behind...The Mothman or just director Mark Pellington. Each is pretty damn good at scaring people.Pellington his his second feature Arlington Road a top notch thriller along the lines of Rosemary's Baby. Here he goes for a more Twilight Zone approach with the did it really happen? factor of films like The Amityville Horror Snuff and Cannibal Holocaust thrown in for very very good measure. Pellington has been gaining quite a bit of critical attention for this film and rightfully so. If he keeps up one can see Mark Pellington Victor Salva and Alejandro Amenbar doing for the horrorthriller genre what John Carpenter Wes Craven and Dario Argento did for it in the 70s.Some critics have been apt to attack the film for its reliance on classic horror movie conventions...as if this is a bad thing. It's quite ironic considering that it is the film's good old fashioned sensibility that makes the proceedings so overwhelmingly effective. It does not rely on cheap scares postPC gore or loud sound effects to jolt its audience. The film's power is rooted in its fundamentally chilling story and taken to another level thanks to Pellington's assured direction. He never condescends to the audience and he never goes for anything less than the extreme. He knows how to push audiences to the edge of their seat...and fortunately for horror fans he does not know when to stop. Hitch would certainly be proud.Yet the best element of The Mothman Prophecies is that like the films of Hitchock it is intended for its audience and continues to engage them long after rolling the end credits. The film has a wonderfully selfreflective structure and a haunting ending Owen Gleiberman's comparison of this film to Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now is much deserved. However many questions are left unanswered. Many plot threads still hang. Like Bob Clark's unnerving Black Christmas The Mothman Prophecies does not provide the closure that most mainstream audiences would demand. The audience is forced to think about the film and what it means long after it's over. Mark Pellington insures that the Mothman's glowing red eyes will indeed stay fixed in our brains alongside the film's other haunting imagery. So remember grown ups and young people alike....sleep with the light on.My Grade A".

So remember grown ups and young people alike....sleep with the light on.My Grade A";

	schema:reviewBody "In 196667 a series of weird supposedly supernatural events occurred in or near Point Pleasant West Virginia. Much of what happened centered on local residents' purported encounters with UFOs confrontations with meninblack phone calls from entities whose voices sounded electronic or metallic and sightings of a winged semihuman creature that came to be known as mothman. A few locals also were made privy to future predictions prophecies some of which in fact did materialize but others didn't. One of the alleged predictions was a December 1967 disaster that did occur and which this film dramatizes.Available literature suggests a high probability that some though by no means all of the Point Pleasant events were the resulting activities of a practical joker a prankster by the name of Barker who died in the 1980s. Other events appear to have been too bizarre and too widespread to be attributed to a lone carnival barker pun intended.The Mothman Prophecies is not a very good factual account of the Point Pleasant events. Indeed the film's setting is the present not the 1960s a fact which the film slyly evades. The filmmakers evidently decided to use part of the historical record and then dramatize it in a way that would have cinematic appeal to today's audiences.And so the film aims to be a supernatural thriller a suspenseful study in the theme of what is real vs. what is not real. There's lots of dark atmosphere with offbeat gyrating camera shots ominous music and dialogue to match. The overall effect is one wherein unseen forces are lurking in the shadows.For some viewers this supernatural tone thus provides intense escapist entertainment. For me the hocuspocus factor was too high and the film exuded a sense of forced melodrama. Further the film did not lead to any satisfactory resolution. What it did lead to was a nicely staged reenactment of the real life December 1967 disaster.Maybe someday someone will make a documentary about the meninblack element of the Point Pleasant events. If the underlying research is honest and thorough the resulting film could illuminate a 1960s drama that while not supernatural in nature had and still has implications that are as scary as they are real.".

Richard Gere is surprisingly entertaining as someone who essentially doesn't say much and just gets creepedout.  A lot.  His character isn't that challenging for any actor so there won't be any Oscar gongs headed his way for this. Laura Linney is excellent as the town sheriff like someone straight out of Twin Peeks. The other characters are pretty much just there to move the plot along rather than to catch your interest. The first half hour or so is entertainingly tense but then the film lulls for the plot in the middle. The ending is satisfyingly and beautifully tidy with a wonderful action sequence that clears up the vast majority of the weirdness from earlier on. The tight ending while pleasurable and final is also one of the reasons that the movie isn't better than it is. There is no sensation upon leaving of question or edge. No concerns about turning the next corner for fear of what might be there. This is perhaps why this movie feels like Channel 5 and perhaps why its a 12 not a 15.

	schema:reviewBody "With a story that has events taken from real life it always has a higher chill factor. Again I don't getoff on slasher or horror flicks. The thing that does get to me and always has is things that could or did actually happened. The acting albeit I am not a real Gear fan per say but the character that he played was done to the bone. This is the story of John and Mary Klein newlyweds.I felt the hair stand up on the back of my neck in 2002 when I went to see this. It was the perfect time of year for a story of mystery and horror. It was set right in fall turning into winter. Debra Messing was a young and beautiful wife to Richard Gear's character they seemed at very least to be the perfect little young couple. From the house hunting mission that they were on to the trip back to their home when the first symbol appeared it was very chilling. The type of scare that is deep settling and the onset of an abrupt frigidness encompasses your body. The man that he John went to meet in regard to the 'phonecall' played by the very talented Will Patton Gordon Smallwood was an eerie outing that proved deadly for Patton's character. The Priest that met with Klein to explain some of the occurrences but not all. Right on down to the drive that should have taken four or five hours that seemed only twenty minutes to the primary character played by Richard Gear. I can say I have felt that I have been in that situation before. A sort of 'time' mystery traveling. I walked out of the theater with a thoroughly washed out emotional chill factor inside of me. It was strange. The real stuff always is to me though.A couple years later I saw it again in 2004 at home after renting it and with the lights out at 12 midnight the chilling effect doesn't grow weaker! This film whether some are impressed or not is a solid 'spinetingler'. I rarely get moved by a film with shocking or even scary stories but as this one was told I have to say this was brilliant in it's execution. The players were convincing with these people at the helm of the story it came across feeling cold and real. The hairs on my neck stood up a couple times! For me thats quite an accomplishment. The temp in my home seemed cooler as the story went on. The fact that there were no phonyphony looking effects of ghoulish slasher type action in the story made it hit home even deeper. This was a highly well crafted thrill cast. I recommend this for anyone looking to be mesmerized by a welltoldstorythat will intrigue just about anyone. ".

They go to work punch the clock and then go home and do it all again the next day.  But what about the ostensibly small percentage of people that seem to think like Neo from the Matrix did that there is just something not quite right with the world we inhabit?  These people have a slightly askewed perspective of what is right what is wrong and how it all comes together.  These are the people that are always asking why?  Why does something happen and in the greater scheme of things how does it all matter?  Is there really a reason for everything or do some things just happen....because?The Mothman Prophecies is a riveting story about how some people seem just slightly ahead of the rest of us.  It is a story of trusting your feelings and not going mad or getting committed in the process.  And finally it is one of the scariest films I have ever seen.  Make no mistake about that.Based on true events.I read an article that stated that this is a film that Hollywood actually had to tone down.  In most cases when film makers get a hold of material they have to beef it up to make it more palpable for an audience.  But this is just the opposite.  Mark Pellington had to simmer some of the events in the film because he felt that if they actually filmed what was purportedly claimed the audience would not believe the absurdity those events.  If that is the case it frightens me to think what was left out because as it stands this film is on the brink of utter temerity.  There is a head first slide into the bizarre and the film never fails to literally chill your bones.  No film that I can think of and that includes my favourites like Jaws Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street has made me feel as helpless insignificant or as small as this film does.Richard Gere plays John Klein which one can only assume is really a character based on the novelist John A. Keel who wrote about the events the film is based on.  He is a Washington Post reporter who has just bought a new house with his wife whom he loves very much.  After a horrible car accident his wife is hospitalized and just before she dies she draws numerous pictures of what can only be described as an evil looking moth like creature or perhaps even the Angel of Death.  She begs the question to John You didn't see it did you?  Which begs the question to us why not?Soon after John ends up in Point Pleasant West Virginia and has no recollection of arriving there.  Here he meets Sgt. Connie Parker played by Laura Linney and Gordon and Denise Smallwood two of the locals.  Soon after he arrives strange things begin to happen and shortly he and Connie become entangled in an imbroglio with mysterious implications.  Many of the locals claim they have seen something similar to what John's wife drew just before her death.  And Gordon played with pure twilight zonesque manerisms by Will Patton seems to be the most affected by this phenomenon.  He begins to hear voices predicts future disasters and finally claims to have met a mysterious figure.  All the while Klein begins to see and hear unexplainable things.  And here in in my opinion lies the key to the film.Mark Pellington John A. Keel and screenwriter Richard Hatem seem to explore the subliminal irrational workings of the unknown.  There are too many subtle yet distinct elements that show up in the film.  But they are not at the surface they are just beneath.  They're in front of our eyes the whole time but only if you look hard enough.  Much of this film deals with paranormal activities and the paranoid revelations of the people in one town.  But it doesn't stop there.  Klein is from a town six hours away and eventually he seeks the opinion of a man in Chicago who wrote a book that claims he felt the same things.  So there are people that have experienced these unexplainable phenoms all over the country.  And this is where the film goes off into a level that I have never seen before.In order for people to have seen this figure or to be able to comprehend it the film suggests that there has to be an open mind.  As an old proverb once said the mind is like a parachute it only works if you open it.  Klein seems to have his eyes and mind wide open after his wife's death.  He hasn't quite let go of her and this somehow enables him to communicate with whatever it is that is out there.  There are times when whatever it is seems ripe with duplicity but more times than not whatever this figure says what he predicts what he prophecises it comes true.  Klein's wife's death marks the nascency of his exploration into the abnormal.The theory of the unknown is what is dissected in such infintismal but succinct ways that on a first viewing you may not recognize them.  We hear stories about people being committed to psyche hospitals because of their failed attempted interpretations.  We hear of people that claim they are being watched by a higher being but feeling this is not really Godlike and not really evil.  It is just an entity.  We see people predict future disasters we see dreams that prophecize death.  And all the while these people are looked upon as being pariahs.  It is much easier to get up go to work and watch television than it is to think and perhaps accept the fact that there is something just beyond our control that lurks in murky places in our minds.  There is even further sublime evidence that the director and writers feel this way.  There are constant anomalous images filmed with an ethereal glance.  These are images that we now take for granted without batting an eyelash.  Things like phones televisions pictures and electricity are all given to us in metaphoric and literal glimpses.  The creators of this film seem to be telling us that if we can believe in the use of technology technology like capturing a moment in time on a piece of paper or if we can receive someone's voice transmitting hours away through a few cords and wires then why is it preposterously inconceivable that Dark Angels or Mothmen really do exist?  Perhaps like the film tells us they only exist to those of us that can open our stagnant minds a little more than the next person.More times than can be counted horror films insult us with loud computer generated noises and blood that seeps from the walls and CG monsters that chase characters that no one cares about.  It is easier to make a horror movie like the modern version of the Haunting or the modern version of 13 Ghosts.  Those are paint by number horror flicks that require no thought and no effort.  But when you get a master like Shyamalan and now Pellington creators that are intransigent in their beliefs and vision it creates pictures that not only scare you to your very soul they create pictures that open your eyes and minds to whole other possibilities.  Mark Pellington has now proven to me that he is a master.  Arlington Road was a surprising film that left you paralyzed with fear and your mind spewing questions long after the curtains came up.  The Mothman Prophecies especially for horror fans will invoke discussions long after the lights come on.  I realize this review may be a little long but this is the tip of the iceberg when it comes all that can be discussed in the film.  There is a whole other religious element to the movie that hasn't even been explored.  For instance notice that both major events in the film happen on Christmas Eve.  Why?One final note to critics that lambaste this film for all of it's so called short comings.  True this film does not offer an explanation or a true conclusion to what took place.  But isn't that just the perfect note for it to end on?  According to the prophetlike character Alexander Leek you are not supposed to understand this phenom.  He tells Klein that you will go mad trying to figure it out.  This is the only way to end the film.  In a lesser film with an inferior director and writer this film would have culminated with Klein and Connie finding some ancient manuscript in the basement of the library that tells them how to destroy it.  They would have went to hallowed ground and summoned it and gotten rid of it.  But this is not the tenth sequel of Friday the 13th and this certainly isn't  with all due respect to Miner and Cunningham Steve Miner and Sean Cunningham.  This is an astute director teamed with a cunning and observant writer who believe in the pulchritude and darkness of the story and give it the respect that it deserves.  This is not only one of the best horror films I have ever seen it is one of the best films I have experienced in my 30 years.  This is the pinnacle of film making from all parties involved.10 out of 10.....A MASTERPIECE BY A MASTER OF MANIPULATIONOne final note.  I just wanted to give special mention to the entire sound crew who did such a brilliant job with this film.  Pellington and Hatem collaborated beautifully to give me one of the most harrowing experiences I have been privy to in a theater but the film would not have been quite as pulse pounding if it weren't for the sound team.  Kelly Cabral Pud Cusack Claude Letessier David Parker Ross Simpson and Mark Jan Wlodarkiewicz working with musical composers Tom Hajdu Andy Milburn and Jeff Rona created some of the creepiest sounds and musical overtures in quite some time.  When you think of great music and sounds from the horror genre you think of Carpenter's eerie piano piece from Halloween Charles Bernstein's dreamlike haunting score from Nightmare On Elm Street and John Williams ominous cello from Jaws.  This is on par with all of those.  And even though this team of musicians may never know it your work is appreciated by all of who love horror films.  Thanks.".

Many of the locals claim they have seen something similar to what John's wife drew just before her death.  And Gordon played with pure twilight zonesque manerisms by Will Patton seems to be the most affected by this phenomenon.  He begins to hear voices predicts future disasters and finally claims to have met a mysterious figure.  All the while Klein begins to see and hear unexplainable things.  And here in in my opinion lies the key to the film.Mark Pellington John A. Keel and screenwriter Richard Hatem seem to explore the subliminal irrational workings of the unknown.  There are too many subtle yet distinct elements that show up in the film.  But they are not at the surface they are just beneath.  They're in front of our eyes the whole time but only if you look hard enough.  Much of this film deals with paranormal activities and the paranoid revelations of the people in one town.  But it doesn't stop there.  Klein is from a town six hours away and eventually he seeks the opinion of a man in Chicago who wrote a book that claims he felt the same things.  So there are people that have experienced these unexplainable phenoms all over the country.  And this is where the film goes off into a level that I have never seen before.In order for people to have seen this figure or to be able to comprehend it the film suggests that there has to be an open mind.  As an old proverb once said the mind is like a parachute it only works if you open it.  Klein seems to have his eyes and mind wide open after his wife's death.  He hasn't quite let go of her and this somehow enables him to communicate with whatever it is that is out there.  There are times when whatever it is seems ripe with duplicity but more times than not whatever this figure says what he predicts what he prophecises it comes true.  Klein's wife's death marks the nascency of his exploration into the abnormal.The theory of the unknown is what is dissected in such infintismal but succinct ways that on a first viewing you may not recognize them.  We hear stories about people being committed to psyche hospitals because of their failed attempted interpretations.  We hear of people that claim they are being watched by a higher being but feeling this is not really Godlike and not really evil.  It is just an entity.  We see people predict future disasters we see dreams that prophecize death.  And all the while these people are looked upon as being pariahs.  It is much easier to get up go to work and watch television than it is to think and perhaps accept the fact that there is something just beyond our control that lurks in murky places in our minds.  There is even further sublime evidence that the director and writers feel this way.  There are constant anomalous images filmed with an ethereal glance.  These are images that we now take for granted without batting an eyelash.  Things like phones televisions pictures and electricity are all given to us in metaphoric and literal glimpses.  The creators of this film seem to be telling us that if we can believe in the use of technology technology like capturing a moment in time on a piece of paper or if we can receive someone's voice transmitting hours away through a few cords and wires then why is it preposterously inconceivable that Dark Angels or Mothmen really do exist?  Perhaps like the film tells us they only exist to those of us that can open our stagnant minds a little more than the next person.More times than can be counted horror films insult us with loud computer generated noises and blood that seeps from the walls and CG monsters that chase characters that no one cares about.  It is easier to make a horror movie like the modern version of the Haunting or the modern version of 13 Ghosts.  Those are paint by number horror flicks that require no thought and no effort.  But when you get a master like Shyamalan and now Pellington creators that are intransigent in their beliefs and vision it creates pictures that not only scare you to your very soul they create pictures that open your eyes and minds to whole other possibilities.  Mark Pellington has now proven to me that he is a master.  Arlington Road was a surprising film that left you paralyzed with fear and your mind spewing questions long after the curtains came up.  The Mothman Prophecies especially for horror fans will invoke discussions long after the lights come on.  I realize this review may be a little long but this is the tip of the iceberg when it comes all that can be discussed in the film.  There is a whole other religious element to the movie that hasn't even been explored.  For instance notice that both major events in the film happen on Christmas Eve.  Why?One final note to critics that lambaste this film for all of it's so called short comings.  True this film does not offer an explanation or a true conclusion to what took place.  But isn't that just the perfect note for it to end on?  According to the prophetlike character Alexander Leek you are not supposed to understand this phenom.  He tells Klein that you will go mad trying to figure it out.  This is the only way to end the film.  In a lesser film with an inferior director and writer this film would have culminated with Klein and Connie finding some ancient manuscript in the basement of the library that tells them how to destroy it.  They would have went to hallowed ground and summoned it and gotten rid of it.  But this is not the tenth sequel of Friday the 13th and this certainly isn't  with all due respect to Miner and Cunningham Steve Miner and Sean Cunningham.  This is an astute director teamed with a cunning and observant writer who believe in the pulchritude and darkness of the story and give it the respect that it deserves.  This is not only one of the best horror films I have ever seen it is one of the best films I have experienced in my 30 years.  This is the pinnacle of film making from all parties involved.10 out of 10.....A MASTERPIECE BY A MASTER OF MANIPULATIONOne final note.  I just wanted to give special mention to the entire sound crew who did such a brilliant job with this film.  Pellington and Hatem collaborated beautifully to give me one of the most harrowing experiences I have been privy to in a theater but the film would not have been quite as pulse pounding if it weren't for the sound team.  Kelly Cabral Pud Cusack Claude Letessier David Parker Ross Simpson and Mark Jan Wlodarkiewicz working with musical composers Tom Hajdu Andy Milburn and Jeff Rona created some of the creepiest sounds and musical overtures in quite some time.  When you think of great music and sounds from the horror genre you think of Carpenter's eerie piano piece from Halloween Charles Bernstein's dreamlike haunting score from Nightmare On Elm Street and John Williams ominous cello from Jaws.  This is on par with all of those.  And even though this team of musicians may never know it your work is appreciated by all of who love horror films.  Thanks.";

	schema:reviewBody "While several horror movies advertise themselves as being based on true events they are usually just fabrications of the actual material. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's brutality and nightmarish setting make the movie's inspirationthe Ed Gein murders something to look into especially since the events inspired Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs. The Amityville Horror is a question of truth or myth. Was that house haunted? We don't know mostly because Hollywood had to exaggerate everything. However 2002's The Mothman Prophecies comes along and when one is knowing of the real story and John A. Keel's book the movie makes you think differently about true story horror. Music video director Mark Pellington has given us a movie that not only interests genre fans but actually pulls through on bringing you a big case of the creeps.Washington Post writer John Klein is happily driving with his wife Mary one night after going house hunting. Suddenly something catches Mary's eye and the car swerves and crashes. John visits Mary in the hospital before she dies and one of the last things she asks him is You didn't see it did you? We ask ourselves what exactly did she see? We don't know. Strangely John finds himself in the West Virginia town of Point Pleasant within hours where weird things are occurring. Lights are flashing across the sky John is getting strange phone calls and people are reporting that they've seen a large winged creature with red beaming eyes. John teams up with Point Pleasant sheriff Connie Mills to discover what is going on in this town. What is the mothlike creature attacking this town's locals? What does it want? Is it intending to do harm or is it an omen of things to come? When faced with the observations presented in Keel's book The Mothman Prophecies only makes a few minor changes including the time the actual events took place. The story shifts from the 1960's to present day. But otherwise it stays very true to its source material which leaves the audience completely in awe. Director Pellington and screenwriter Richard Hatem refuse to let the story be fabricated and we love them all the more for it.This supernatural chiller keeps its suspense factor high by not treating the audience like idiots. It doesn't stick to any of the usual horror standards. No one says I'll be right back. The film doesn't succumb to boobs and gore. The script keeps the relationship between John and Connie from turning the movie into a sappy love story which makes the leading characters more sympathetic and pure at heart thanks to Richard Gere and Laura Linney's great performances.What really gets to you about The Mothman Prophecies is that you are left questioning right up to the end what this creature's motivations are. You never know if the apparition exists to warn people of future disasters or to bring fear into the hearts of the townspeople. We're also not really sure if the Mothman is actually real. What if it's just a figment of imagination what our minds want us to see and believe? We're always more frightened when we don't know what we're supposed to be scared of. A nice addition is Pellington's decision to stick to the less is more formula and he does it extremely well. He never shows us the monster only flashes of light in varied colors and what we our told of the creature's appearance. Only true fans of horror will appreciate this.All of the tension builds up to a perfectly staged and nerverattling climax that poses more questions. The film builds slowly to produce this giant ball of supernatural horror. This may test the patience of moviegoers who take their horror with ridiculous explanations and CGI effects. But the story of The Mothman Prophecies was always meant to leave you with questions. The movie is scarier that way. By the time the credits have rolled you are emotionally devastated stunned and ultimately freaked out. What could have been an X Files wannabe turned into something much more horrifying than anything The X Files could have created. The Mothman Prophecies is truthful horror at its finest. Watch it at night with the lights off and prepare to be spooked.".

Pleasant often because it is an interesting town with Revolutionary War history and such and I can say that this film is mostly fiction but that's okay!The true facts are these  Many different people saw the mothman creatures in the late 60's in the Pt. Pleasant area.  There were no direct warnings or communications simply specters without explanation.  These phantoms were taken seriously only becauseas noted by Laura Linney in the filmthey were seen not by flakes or freaks but by responsible members of the community.The Silver Bridge did collapse after a period of the mothman sightings and they were never seen or reported again in the region since.It should be noted that in this region the mothman sightings and the bridge collapse are seen as two separate incidents.  People around here really don't perceive the mothmen as auguries of the bridge collapse. However connecting those dots for the book and film creates for a clever scenariobarring any disrespect to those who died in the bridge collapse.That most of this film is a trumped up version of the actual events shouldn't matter.  The film is merely exploring the scenario and by using a real town with a real story it draws us into the sense of community and fear that could pervade if such things did occur.The film is very well done and very effective in its use of paranoia and our fear of the unknown.  There is no axe murderer roaming the woods no monsters shown with giant fangs.  Only the brief fleeting images of the mothmen and their unexplained presence.Director Mark Pellington is great at using very few tricks to accomplish a lot of atmosphere.  He is respectful to the people of Pt. Pleasant and West Virginia and never takes the low road of playing the people off as rubes. It is that smart decision which makes this film work.  If we didn't respect the community we would never be drawn into this world.Richard Gere gives his usual excellent performance and continues to be one of the most underappreciated actors when it comes award time each year. He is the definition of a rational and intelligent man drawn into a situation that overwhelms him.Laura Linney is also excellent and as a West Virginian myself I must say she plays a Mountaineer our parlance for West Virginian better than any actors I can think of since those in Matewan.  She never condescends to the character and employs an excellent dialect which is just as subtle as the dialect one would find in Pt. Pleasant instead of the overbearing hillbilly dialects other actors often employ.  Linney continues to amaze with subtlety and I am always looking forward to more of her work.Debra Messing has a brief role but she does make a mark and get a chance to show that she has dramatic acting chops which she refined onstage in roles such as Angels in America.  I would like to see her in more dramatic work since I enjoy her comedic work on Will  Grace each week.I also thought Alan Bates made a marvelous turn in the film as a professor in more sense than one of the mothman.  He has some great lines including when Gere asks why the mothmen don't explain their presence if they are superior creatures  You are superior to a cockroach do you ever bother to explain yourself to a cockroach?At the end of the film a title says that the cause of the bridge collapse was never known.  This is a classic example of Hollywood having fun since the cause was never a mystery at all.  The bridge was designed with what was called an Ibar which meant the entire bridge was held up with one single joint!  It rusted and snapped under the weight of stopped holiday traffic as shown in the film.  Because of this such bridges all over the nation were shut down and subsequently replaced.  The Silver Bridge collapse remains the worst bridge disaster in American history.  The collapse scenes are terrifying yet respectful of the actual tragedy.Kudos to Pellington and his marvelous cast for making such a thoughtprovoking and engaging film.It should be noted that Pt. Pleasant has a great sense of humor about the mothmen and they even have events for people to come and enjoy the lore. If you are in the region stop by downtown and find some fun paraphernalia.".

Based on true events the film examines a series of inexplicable occurrences through the eyes  and mind  of one man played by Richard Gere. The plot sounds creepy and the fact that its based on true events sure makes it more engaging. The film looks and sounds scary as well and there are a few scenes that are bound to get underneath your skin. The film is still kind of disappointing as they don't really explain the movie so well and your left with too many unanswered questions. Sometimes its hard to take the movie seriously as there are some scenes that don't make sense or that the scene kind of feels like a joke. Like said before though the film should still creep underneath your skin. Richard Gere stars and he gives a very good performance. He makes up for starring in that awful film called Autumn in New York. Laura Linney also does a good and these two really keep the film moving. Mark Pellington directs and he does a good job of keeping the film at a nice pace and making the film look creepy. The ending was done decently and it sure makes you think about what happens. The Mothman Prophecies will leave its mark on you and you may have trouble getting it out of your head when its time to go to sleep. The film is almost two hours long so you may start to get bored if you find the film to be stupid. Pretty much if you like the XFiles or The Forgotten then you should enjoy this thriller. The Mothman Prophecies may not be top notch thriller but its still worth checking out and will make a good rental to watch at night. Rating 6.710 a sometimes scary thriller that's worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Mothman Prophecies is a film like no other I have seen but is often held to a standard and expectation of your typical horror or thriller from which most criticism for it unjustifiably surfaces.First The Mothman Prophecies is a very sincere film. Most horror films are ostensibly slapstick caricatured and full of overstatement of a very broadly recognised fear death. The vehicles for this fear are usually monsters murderers or disasters of which the victims are helpless though these do the job of shocking us out of our seats their effect given their near ridiculousness rarely lingers. The intensity of The Mothman Prophecies however is based from the outset on the loss of a perfect love and our very limited nature in the grandness of existence despite all other things that happen supernaturally this is what truly haunts our protagonist. It is in this that the helplessness which brings about fear finds its vessel.Another interesting point is that these supernatural mothlike beings that turn up before a disaster are not trying to kill anyone yet they are or should I say Indrid Cold is utterly terrifying. When Klein receives THE phone call you know which one! I felt the very worldview that keeps me feeling safe very much under attack. Whenever I am in a dimly lit room alone I wonder how shaken I would be if such an event happened to me. The explanation for this that there may be things beyond our primitive nature and capability to understand is profoundly reasonable...Which brings me to my point Most horror films are sold on the merit that they make you jump sudden knife attacks monsters leaping out etc. The horror in The Mothman Prophecies is something entirely different something profound poignant existential. It is a film that will reward the insightful reflective and empathic individual not the thrillseeker and will continue to scare and compel such individuals long after viewing  for these reasons I would recommend watching this by yourself.It is the departure from your typical horrorthriller which I believe warrants a 10 for The Mothman Prophecies. It is a film that adds something unique to the rich cinema tapestry. I could talk about the competent performances the strange cinematography or the alleged origins of the story but what really sets this film apart is the way it scares like no other in the genre by which it has been defined.".

Soon any plot or sense of realism is lost  what about our hero's job? what day or night is it? what does he do most of the time in Point Pleasant? why and how does his initial meeting with a young couple happen at night in the quarry instead of the day and do they really mention all the sexual details we see as they relate their mothman encounter? All the irrelevent camera shots encourage the viewer to ponder irrelevent questions Is that little guy in the sound lab making a music CD of his glasslip rubbing? Do ethereal mothfolk really leave slime when hit by a car and are there accident attorney mothpeople that represent them in mothcourt? To make something creepy or uncanny you need some realism to subvert as one can see in One step beyond and Xfiles.

It is of little consequence I suppose  cerebral implosion has always interested me as a physiological condition. That this great film has inspired a universal rating of only 6.6 bears testament to my belief that today's viewing audience are for the most part cretins  or getting there!

This particular film however incites my anger towards these negative and terminally limited people like no other I can recall! Together with RED CORNER AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN PRETTY WOMAN and PRIMAL FEAR not necessarily in that order THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is up there with Gere's best work. It's up there with ANYONE'S best work! In essence a brilliant movie length episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE it was always going to be a failure to those expecting MOTH MAN to be leaping out of the screen with slavering maw the cretins better look that one up! rancid breath and fleshstripping claws. This is no action movie as one cranially displaced reviewer complained. It is a film that you must work WITH listen TO and build upon! Mark Pellington directed his guts out with this one and he has produced an unequivocal winner vastly superior in my view to even ARLINGTON ROAD which though interesting was a bit iffy towards the conclusion I thought.The briefest of plot outlines follows. Gere is a reporter for the Washington Post. He is very much in love with his wife. Following an auto runin she is hospitalised and diagnosed with a rare form of brain tumor. Before she dies she leaves several extremely strange sketches of something on a notepad. Gere later finds himself on a road to Pleasant County having no idea how he got there and wishing to divulge nothing further comes across many uniquely odd and supernatural turns. He is convinced some terrible tragedy will strike the township. Does it? Is he one step short of a psycho ward? Is this the greatest suspense movie of all time?  Maybe you had better watch it!Will Patton gives an absolutely riveting support performance but there again  EVERYONE here is just about out of their tree. Cinematography script production values are ALL just superb. Despite what others may say there is not one boring moment in this film if you have ANY awareness at all! The conclusion and let's forget the minority who think they saw it coming  THEY DIDN'T is so well done. both emotionally and effect wise it lifts the film so far above others of its ilk its not funny!

	schema:reviewBody "I love the Muppets the show and most of their movies. However this special was a big disappointment. Granted it has its good points I loved the chemistry between Kermit and Miss Piggy the production values are at least decent and I liked Gonzo very much here. Also the Muppet performers do do a decent job with weak material.Pretty much everything else is a big disappointment. The story was fresh and original I agree at first glance but it was a completely different story when it came to the execution. Most of it actually is very predictable and rushed. This isn't helped by the fact it is too short.I also agree about the special's writing. The script is pretty much terrible Gonzo and Fozzie have their moments but most of the other Muppet parts are underwritten and very rarely was it funny. The jokes were also very lame and childish and the sentimentality gets mushy.The music was also a big disappointment. Other than Gonzo and Fozzie's duet which was compared to everything else delightful the music is little more than mediocre and I say forgettable too. The lyrics are also trite and the melodies are unmemorable afterwards.The Muppets do try their best and I was thrilled at the return of some old favourites but let down severely by bad material and I missed Gonzo and Rizzo's chemistry which was always delightful. The cameos are even more disappointing. Some of the characters are somewhat superfluous to the story or are poorly explored I concur that the whole believing in Santa thing was quite poorly done and Paul Williams' cameo especially is completely out of place and unfunny.In conclusion I am a Muppet fan but I have to agree A Muppets ChristmasLetters to Santa is quite weak. It has its moments but it is a shame especially about the writing and music. 410 Bethany Cox".

The songs by Muppet veteran Paul Williams were nicely done though only the FozzieGonzo duet about wishing to be Santa seems like a future classic. The celebrity cameos are hitormiss but do provide some amusements especially that of Williams and Nathan Lane. I recognized the kid from that Disney movie that starred Dwayne The Rock Johnson. It's too bad that Jane Krakowski and Jesse Martin weren't utilized more for their musical talents. Still if you love the Muppets you'll be glad to see them in A Muppet Christmas Letters to Santa.".

At the 30 minute mark of the 44 minute feature Kermit Gonzo Fozzy and Pepe are just arriving at the North Pole. The film spends less than a minute there with a beautiful exterior that goes to waste. We meet 1 elf and never venture inside. Then it's back to delivering the letters again and the viewers finally see Santa 10 minutes before the film ends rushing the meat of the story giving Santa the letters and making wishes come true.If the writers had been more intelligent they would have spent only 10 minutes on delivery and the journey to the North Pole. The other 34 minutes then could have been spent in hijinks at Santa's Workshop instead of the Post Office and going from house to house making 3 or 4 special children's wishes come true.You might be better off rewatching The Muppet Christmas Carol Muppet Family Christmas or even It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas which parodies It's a Wonderful Life.

	schema:reviewBody "I was so psyched to see a new Muppets special. There's been such slim pickings after Muppets From Space. A Very Merry 2002 was a wee cluttered but is palpable for multiple viewings. The wholly unwatchable Muppets Wizard of Oz however was a stinking turd of a movie. Even this fan who is a hardcore Muppet freak couldn't make it through the whole thing. So I was crossing my fingers for this one. Sigh. It was better in the fact that I made it through the entire thing. Of course it was only an hour and they took so many commercial breaks that the darn thing was probably only about 35 minutes total. Many things could have helped what felt like a halfassed hack job. Ooh let's make up some random crap and make the Muppets do it never taking into consideration how the characters should really behave the writers said I imagine. First who the heck is Claire? And why should we care? What is the point of introducing two new characters that no one knows and no one cares about for a measly onehour special? Look I get it. You want humans. Whoopie. Do like with Nathan Lane and Uma Thurman and give them bit roles. I'm sorry but when it's the Muppets Anything it should be them starring. And Jane Krakowski was completely wasted here. How sad. What would have been much more believable would be if one of the letters was Robin's Kermit's nephew. And Kermit feels compelled to get to Santa. Which brings me to my next pointwhy the hell is GONZO the focus? He while an interesting character is not the main driver in the Muppets. Kermit is. He is the main character in the Muppets. That's how it is that's the natural way of this franchise. It's just like Jerry is the main character of Seinfeld like Carrie is the main of Sex and the City. Sure we learn about the other three sure there are other bit ones introduced. But the core remains the same and the leader does as well. The four main Muppets are Kermit Fozzie Gonzo and Piggy. Those are the four that everyone thinks of and those are the four who are at the center of each story with Kermit as the lead. Not that I have a problem with Gonzo oh no. I like Gonzo. He's just the second best friend in this situation not the star. Now some may say But hey wait Gonzo was the focus of Muppets From Space. He can carry a picture! It worked therebecause it was a plausible storyline. You couldn't do aliens with any of the other main Muppets except maybe some of the band. Also Gonzo was his normal self in Spacestrange out of the box running around like crazy. Just as he should be. In Letters though it's like someone gave him too much Paxil. He's got no zip no spunk none of his usual quirkiness. He's just slightly depressed and much too mellow for his character. Speaking of wrong characters we now come to my biggest sticking pointPiggy. Now my disclosure is that Miss Piggy has been my favorite Muppet and even personal hero since I was about 2 years old. I've always seen her as a confident woman who knows what she wants and doesn't let anyone hold her back. Who for instance hit Kermit and brought back his memory in Muppets Take Manhattan? Who stood by her frog in A Very Merry Muppet Christmas? Who was the costar for Kermit in the Christmas Carol? She is a strong woman in more ways than one and when the chips are down she sticks by her friends. But this Piggy? Despicable. They made her a selfish brat as they did in Oz. If this were the real Piggy she would've stuck by her friends especially her frog. I could picture her perfectly being jealous when Joy showed up which would've been more natural than to just write her out in the first five minutes. Was it because her eyes look so darn funny? Was I the only one who noticed that? What did they lose her original prototype or something?In fact not just Piggy but the whole crowd would stick by the main characters and help out. That's what Muppets always dothey support each other like a team. They carpool to California in the Muppet Movie to break into the movies. They put on each Muppet Show together. They saved their Theatre in A Very Merry by sticking by each other. It's completely wrong to think that anyone of them would walk out on each other. Sure some tried to punk out in the Great Muppet Caper but eventually they all came together to save the day. Besides returning letters versus possibly getting killed? Please. One can hardly compare the two and really fault their hesitation. And speaking of the other characters Family Guy was right. Wrongsounding Muppets is the worst. Waldorf sounded so weird Janice wasn't right and the friend I watched with said Hey wasn't Beaker's voice higher? I understand that many of the originals have moved on either to different projects or to that great Muppetland in the sky. I'm just surprised that these talented voice people can't bend their vocal chords a little further to sound a little more like the characters they're playing. I know it's hard. But it's disheartening to hear a character's voice come out strange when you thought you knew that voice perfectly. To sum up it was OK to watch once making it better than Oz. But I wouldn't want to see it again making it only slightly better than Oz and not on par with what the Muppets should be putting out.".

There's nothing wrong with the TV platform as many Xmas specials have become classics a few Muppet efforts among them but the atmosphere matters and Letters to Santa is slightly better than the 2002 in that regard. I don't know what it is I can't put my finger on it but maybe the real locations detract from the feeling.

	schema:reviewBody "To be fair this special was a lot better than The Muppets' Wizard of Oz but it's still not that good. There aren't any adult jokes that'll make your kids embarrassed to watch it with you or vice versa but there are some other things that make this film pretty weak.Following the classic Muppet Christmas special tradition the premise is pretty simple after an event at the post office Christmas Eve morning Gonzo accidentally doesn't mail a letter to Santa Claus for one of his friends. He Kermit Fozzie Rizzo and...Pepe I will pay someone to step on him fly to the North Pole to give the letter to Santa...Yeah that's it.What's good about this special? Well it has a lot of nice tender heartfelt moments. Gonzo sings the intro to a song in the film he sings What's in your heart? I don't care for the rest of the song but that part is very nice I still find myself singing that sometimes. There's another song he shares with Fozzie later called I Wish I Could Be Santa Claus. To be honest it really doesn't fit with the scene but it's a very lovely song. The special ends with all the Muppets gathering together for Christmas that's rather nice. Also there are a few funny moments. My favorite part is Nathan Lane's cameo! Not only is he funny but his interaction with Bobo is funny as well this is probably the first film I found myself fully enjoying Bobo without him being annoying!So what doesn't work? Well for starters it's slow. Some scenes feel like filer like the scene where Kermit Fozzie and Gonzo are on the roof or where Pepe talks to the gentlemen in the restaurant. Besides the musical numbers I mentioned earlier I can't name any other song they're either annoying or forgettable. Also why are the Muppets in an urban New York setting here? It seems too weird. Finally I think it goes back to one of the problems Kermit Swamp Years had it's very childish. There's one adult joke I noticed of course it came up Pepe's here! but other than that I can't really think of any material here that will get adults invested. I will say though kudos to this film for having Santa Claus be in this movie without saying Christmas is about Santa! Christmas specials today often do that and it's really annoying irritating and well just untrue. Especially with the Muppets conforming their entertainment in their past productions they could have easily taken that route. I'm glad they didn't.I think this special is cute. It's a nice special kids will enjoy OK but I don't think adults will enjoy it too much aside from a couple of heartfelt moments and a few jokes. To be honest this special is kind of forgettable aside from those things. It's cute but it's not what I want to see from the Muppets. I'd say give this one a pass. BOOYIKA!".

Wackiness ensues.Seriously that's the story. That's it. There is nothing else to see here and cue an excuse for a series of cameos and musical numbers. But personally I have no problem with that. With some fairly recognisable faces cropping up and a frankly movie stealing performance from Nathan Lane these make the film watchable enough. As an aside a little game I've started playing when ever I see Jane Krakowski in something these days is pretending she's actually Jenna Maroney the actress she plays in 30 Rock playing the character in the movie I'm currently watching. You know now that I'm typing that I'm not sure it's such a cool thing So anyway the cameos are fun how about the songs? Not to bad I suppose. I don't expect another 'Rainbow Connection' anytime soon but I'd like to at least be able to hum them to myself the next day. Other than 'My Best Christmas Yet' the songs are just a little to forgettable. The only one that really sticks out is actually the 'miming' the Muppets do to 'Things we said Today' which runs over the closing credits as does a bunch of 'gaff' takes. It seems that Kermit and Co. have been taking lessons from Jackie Chan because we get to see them fluffing lines missing cues and generally just messing about a bit. Which is a whole heap of fun. It's quite obvious that the performers are having an absolute blast here and love their work and the characters they are creating. Considering it's the Muppets that is only as it should be.The writing is nice with some great one liners and fun word play. I like this movie there just isn't a whole lot I think I can say about it other than it's enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a bit of a Muppets fan when their not being too cheesy and concentrating more on entertaining both the kids and the adults annoyingly this is one of the times when they are cheesy in this short TV movie. Basically it is Christmas Eve and the Muppets Kermit the Frog Steve Whitmire The Great Gonzo Dave Goelz Fozzie Bear Eric Jacobson replacing Frank Oz Pepe the Prawn Bill Barretta and Rizzo the Rat also Whitmire are all sending their letters to Santa in the North Pole. It is when they return to their apartment that Gonzo notices three letters including one from his best friend sweet little girl and neighbour Claire Madison Pettis have been undelivered. After trying a few attempts to find a way to get the letters delivered Gonzo insists that all the male Muppets should help him take the letters to the North Pole themselves while mean Miss Piggy also Jacobson stays behind for a vacation. They get a ride from Taxi Driver Whoopi Goldberg to the airport and find North Pole Airlines where clerk Joy Uma Thurman gives them their tickets before getting caught by a security guard. Officer Frank Meany Nathan Lane who has been a bully since not receiving his most wanted present from Santa eventually lets them go but they only get to the North Pole hanging tight onto the plane wing. After looking like they are too late to see Santa Claus Richard Griffiths he overhears them and comes down to give them a sleigh ride and read the letters Claire's Meany and Pepe before dropping them off home and it turns out all Claire wanted was friends round. Also starring Whitmire as Statler and Beaker Goelz as Waldorf Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Zoot Barretta as Swedish Chef Rowlf and Dr. Teeth Jacobson as Animal and Sam the Eagle Mayor Michael Bloomberg Jane Krakowski as Claire's Mom Steve Schirripa and Tony Sirico as Mobsters and Paul Williams as Elf. There aren't really any highlights I can remember in this apart from of course the cast cameos but even they and the puppet characters we have grown to love over the years can't save this from schmaltzy Christmas mush a silly short seasonal family comedy adventure. It was nominated the Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for the Paul Williams song I Wish I Could Be Santa Claus. Adequate!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Muppets are no strangers to the Holidays. They have had many a film produced incorporating Christmas related themes. The best and most popular of them all was The Muppet Christmas Carol 1992. But that hasn't stopped the Henson Company. Before Kermit and his friends came back with their return film The Muppets 2011 they were still doing productions for the small screen. Prior to this another holiday made for TV production was released  It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie 2002. Other than that this is the Muppet's latest outing at the holiday season. Is really good? Mmmmm..not unanimously but it is decent enough to be seen.This time viewers follow their favorite characters at the post office waiting to send their holiday mail. When Gonzo forgets to put his in the mail it's up to Kermit and friends to find a way to get them to Santa on time. Here's what does work. First and foremost The Muppets and voiceactors themselves. They are always key and the fact that they were of main focus all the time was great. The humor also works because of the certain situations Kermit and his friends get into. The gags range from bad jokes silly puns and goofy reactions the Muppets make. Thankfully these eyeinducing moments aren't as bad they could be because it's the Muppets. Another element that will have viewers happy to see is the tone of this movie. Unlike It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie2002 which had a very mean spirited tone this feature has a much more upbeat feel and that's especially good.Another good component was the cameos of various actors. This ranges from Whoopi Goldberg Uma Thurman Nathan Lane and even Michael Bloomberg. Camerawork by Luke Geissbuhler the DP of Borat 2006 was appropriate as was Chris Caswell's musical score. However this is where things don't work. For one the running time is too short. Yes it is a TV movie but so was It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie 2002 and was well over an hour. The problem with this is that it cuts everything down to an unnecessary length. This goes for cast cameos and even the Muppet characters. That can be a bit frustrating if this is a Muppet Movie and you only see a few of the Muppets instead of the whole bunch for more than five minutes.Along with that is issue of writing. The story for this movie is cute but again with a shortened running time everything must fall in place quickly or it won't work. With this comes clich and convenient contrivances that either defy logic or are impossible to begin with. It's not to say it isn't funny or doesn't work but the story almost had a finale that would've seemed more mature and realistic than what was chosen. There can always be a happy ending but that doesn't mean it has to be exactly the way the audience expects it to be. Adding to the bit of blandness are the songs that the Muppets sing composed by Paul Williams. It's not that they bore but they're not as memorable as other Paul Williams pieces. It certainly won't be an hour wasted but it could've been better.It has all of the basic components to make a really good Muppet Christmas movie but it instead comes off as fairly generic. The main problem is its running time which trims down several parts that make up a good Muppet film.".

I am pleased to report that the postHenson muppeteers have finally redeemed themselves in Letters to Santa.Henson's son Brian took his first stab at continuing the holiday genre in 1992 with a remake of Dicken's Christmas Carol.

It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie 2002 forgettable it starred David Arquette. Ring a bell?. Letters to Santa puts all of the above to shame curiously the junior Henson served as neither writer nor director in this one but did provide the voice of a very unmuppety Sal Manilla. Why?.The premise is totally believable compared to say Muppets in Space 1999 which was kind of awesome but there's no way sponge chickens can breathe in space okay. I'll spare you any spoilers.Pepe the Prawn is the new Beaker but it's time to retire Bobo the Bear.The cameos were mostly spoton but I'm not sure that today's kids will know who many of these faces are and some faces they shouldn't e.g. Steve Schirripa or the dude from Law  Order in the same way that I recognized Joan Rivers or Liza Minnelli in the 1984 classic set in Manhattan. Nevertheless Paulie Walnuts turned in an Emmyworthy performance. Uma good move. Never looked better. Glowed like an angel. And mad props to Michael Bloomberg for well being Michael Bloomberg.Decent music. Modern yet timeless. Sweet and corny. Someday my kids will watch it every year the same way I still look forward to Emmet Otter's JugBand Christmas 1977. Whether they like it or not.".

Lots of characters offering their running gags great cameos beautiful sets and a lovely finish. The songs weren't quite up to par but I was glad they decided to have musical numbers.

However the way most of the Muppets were brought in for quickie appearances the including of the guest stars Whoopi was worthless and Richard Griffiths just looked and sounded terrible as Santa the plot seemingly jumping from A to D without much effort into giving us B and C to tie it together smoothly even the songs didn't hook us like they normally do...this was just a pretty eh effort. I hope the writers put more real effort into it next time instead of just wanting to throw a holiday special with the Muppets on TV to do it.

Muppets Take Manhattan on the other hand never fails to entertain me still makes me laugh out loud the pursesnatching scene Kermit in his Bert Convy 'fro and even tugs at my heartstrings.What's particularly nice about this adventure is that it's an affectionate love letter to Hollywood musicals of yore without being overly parodying. The musical comedy cliches are presented in a matteroffact manner just as we were expected to suspend our disbelief when Ruby Keeler went out onstage a nobody but came back a star! we suspend our disbelief to encompass a group of talking animals putting together a big budget Broadway musical in 2 weeks. These kind of hoary plot devices are presented straightfaced without any selfconscious winking or irony.The songs are all pretty darn terrific the showstopping Together Again finale is as good as any contemporary musical number of the last 20 years or so while It's Time for Saying Goodbye always puts a lump in my throat it's sentimental without being maudlin. The finale HeShe Makes Me Happy goes from being sweet to comically overthetop in less than 3 minutes and it's a joy.The expected parade of cameos work well within the structure without being intrusive. My particular favorites are Liza Minnelli's the whole Sardi's scene is wonderful Linda Lavin's another terrific comedy moment YOU are Mr. Enrico Tortellini of Passaic New Jersey! and Joan Rivers' another gem. The Muppet performers are their usual endearing selves lovable warm likable. The love triangle between Kermit Piggy and the human Jenny plays surprisingly well and Piggy's jealous reactions are hysterical.These days family entertainment usually means disgustingly whitewashed pap that anyone over 10 or 11 would find either sedating or inane. Disney's live action 101 Dalmations and its sequel spring to mind. The Muppet movies proved that a Grated film could be intelligent witty funny and entertaining for all ages. It's a formula that has yet to be improved upon and The Muppets Take Manhattan just might be the best example of it.".

It's a sendup in part of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical only here there's the usual lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments Lou Zealand's boomerang fish Gonzo's waterstunt display the whisper campaign among many others but also with a lot of heart too. The Muppet writers aren't shy of the conventions on the contrary they embrace them to the point where it's almost refreshing to see such a 'lets put on a show' story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream. While not as totally original in scope as the Muppet Movie it's got many catchy and memorable songs excellent locations all over Manhattan and even some intonations of interspecies dating and marriage! Cameos include Liza Minneli a frog? Elliot Gould as the cop Brooke Shields propositioned by a rat Edward I. Koch Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers.

Once again cameos and fun songs make up the film that recaptures the charm that The Muppet Movie had but lost with The Great Muppet Caper. There is also a little drama too though as Kermit gets in an accident and ends up suffering from a case of amnesia. Perfect for all audiences the kiddies should gobble this one up with furious force. 4 stars out of 5.".

Once again cameos and fun songs make up the film that recaptures the charm that The Muppet Movie had but lost with The Great Muppet Caper. There is also a little drama too though as Kermit gets in an accident and ends up suffering from a case of amnesia. Perfect for all audiences the kiddies should gobble this one up with furious force. 4 stars out of 5.";

Okay the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City. You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is Kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in New York City. It's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a rather enjoyable and harmless entertaining Muppet movie featuring most of the well known Muppets. It really isn't their best or most memorable one though.Lets face it and be honest here this movie really isn't the greatest made or best written one. The only real reason that the movie still works out is thanks to the Muppets. The humor actually isn't that much good since its mostly simply written and the events are predictable. Nevertheless the movie still manages to become funny because of the humorous and well known characters that need no introduction.For me it really was in this case Miss Piggy that makes the movie work out. Her character features by far the most humorous and enjoyable situations. Miss Piggy is basically a Muppetfavorite of every one! She is such a great and comical character. Also the idea alone that a grown up man such as Frank Oz is with his hand inside a silly looking pig and doing a very feminine voice is reason enough already to crack me up. I really respect the Muppetperformers and their timing and handling is always just great especially Frank Oz who always is subtle and handles the most enjoyable Muppet characters. Besides acting Frank Oz also was the person who directed and wrote the movie.The movie concentrates a bit too much on just the two main characters of the movie Kermit and Miss Piggy. Also the human cast gets wasted because of that but of course also most of the Muppet characters. They put too many Muppets in the movie but doesn't provide them with enough room to let them shine or their characters speak out. They tried to do so by putting in some extra solo sequences featuring some of the Muppet characters which felt like a last minute addition but was amusing though distracting nevertheless. The movie also features Rizzo the Rat in his first big movie role but it's too bad that he didn't teamed up with Gonzo yet in this on. The movie could had really used another and distracting from the main plot comical duo besides Kermit and Miss Piggy.The movie yet again features many cameo from well known actors and other celebrities. Celebrities and Muppets always have been a great combination. Not only well known at the time celebrities make a cameo but also the Sesame Street characters do so toward the ending.It's obvious that they used this movie as a vehicle to also use some new puppet techniques that in my opinion however don't work out and are redundant. Showing the Muppet's legs when they walk bad idea! Putting someone in a Miss Piggy suit when she is on rollerblades bad idea!Though the movie is mostly forgettable it of course still features some great sequences such as the one with the Muppet babies. It also of course features some good comedy moments and it obviously makes this an enjoyable simple movie to watch but it's all not quite enough for this movie to really make a lasting impression. Out of all the Muppet movies this is probably the one with the most less replayability factor.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "After getting the formula about right with The Great Muppet Caper the series takes a strange turn with 'Manhattan' only a few years later. Veteran Muppet Frank Oz takes the helm from Jim Henson and makes a few minor but noticeable changes. Gone are the nods and winks to the audience for the most part and the film is far more plot based and linear than the slapstick shenanigans of the first film.Kermit and the gang are finishing college and pondering their futures which will very likely result in them all moving on separately and losing touch. However Kermit boldly concocts a plan that will see the gang remain together by heading en masse to Manhattan to launch a massive stage musical called Manhattan Melodies with all the Muppets as performers or stage hands.Unfortunately after just a few short days no success and low on funds the various characters are forced to disperse and forge their own future with the promise from Kermit to summon them all ifwhen the musical gets greenlit. Kermit takes a job in a diner and everyone goes their separate ways.In many ways this is a more depressing film than the first two  even with the frog killing theme  for long periods of time the characters mope and ponder a future alone and it seems that the Muppets will never again operate in unison. Of course this isn't how the film ends but even in a puppet movie you don't need to be kept sad for over half the running time.The jokes are less frequent and the tone less tongue in cheek. The cameos are still plentiful but are more 'look here's the famous cameo' than in other films. The inclusion of the Muppet Babies in a thinly veiled promo for the spinoff is as entertaining as it is blatant and in some ways is a minor indictment on the dull tone of the rest of the film that it can be upstaged by a flashback.There is another attempt at a grand sequence with Piggy taking a skate through the park but it is far less successful than either of the sequences from Caper and the big finale was an apt but desperate ending to proceedings.Final Rating  6.5  10. I by no means am saying steer clear of Manhattan but after the Muppet Movie got the ball rolling and Caper took such a great leap forward it is disappointing that the franchise would take a step back like this.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Muppets Take Manhattan is about the Muppets trying to get their show into Broadway. First of all the Muppet characters are great. I loved Kermit Piggy and Rizzo in the movie. Everyone else should have stayed home for this one. Look I love the Muppets but one of the things that just does not work in this movie is that there is an overabundance of characters and most of them are not really used at all. Take Gonzo and Fozzie for example. Great characters but in this movie they really had nothing to do and most of the other like ten muppets were kind of shoehorned in. Muppets movie or not rule number one of screen writing is everything that happens in the movie should advance the plot in some way and there were so many characters that did not belong in this movie because they had nothing to do. The story should have focused entirely on Kermit Rizzo and Piggy which is what they kind of did but they also let the other characters interfere every now and then and it took me out of the movie.The movie really starts off strong but after the first 30 minutes or so it's really hit or miss. The humor isn't as clever as in the first part of the movie and things just conveniently happen like Kermit getting hit by the car to get the amnesia subplot going on or the son of the producer picking up the script to the Muppets' play. Also there was a part where I laughed out loud but it's unintentionally funny. The part where Piggy gets her purse stolen and she chases the guy with the roller blades they show these shots from far away of Piggy chasing the guy and it's just so clear that it's someone in a Piggy costume chasing after the guy. I laughed really hard at that.The movie has some great sequences like when they split up and they sing. That's pretty good and the best part about this film is the Baby Muppets sequence. I love that part. Some great songs and the design of the Muppets is great of course. Very lighthearted movie and really not offensive but I would say most of it is forgettable mostly due to the script. But I still had an enjoyable enough time with The Muppets Take Manhattan although the script isn't too solid and there are way too many characters for me to care. It's an OK movie with one or two great moments.6.510".

Nowhere near the classic Muppet Movie but the songs are nice and the Muppets endearing as ever. It's kind of a solo movie for Kermit for awhile. The human cast is good with several littleknown actors in supporting parts. The celebrity cameos this time include Dabney Coleman Brooke Shields Elliott Gould Art Carney Joan Rivers Gregory Hines and Liza Minnelli. Most importantly this movie introduced the Muppet Babies in a fantasy sequence. The Muppet Babies would go on to be an adorable cartoon series that was a beloved part of my childhood. This movie is the last of the Muppet films made while Jim Henson was still alive. It will surely please fans and those who love movies with heart and humor and magic.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're keeping up with all my reviews you should know how I feel about the previous Muppet movies. The Muppet Movie was great and The Great Muppet Caper was amazingly hilarious! So how do I feel about this one? I think this one is good. It's not bad it's not great...I think it's good.Synopsis Kermit and the gang are graduating from college They figure they'll take Kermit's musical Manhattan Melodies and put it on Broadway. However they find out that becoming successful on Broadway is harder than they thought  I guess becoming rich and famous in Hollywood is much easier than making it on Broadway. After having no luck and a little blow up from Kermit the gang decides to split ways for a little while until the musical is sold on Broadway. Kermit stays in NYC and tries everything he can to get Manhattan Melodies picked up by a Broadway producer. After a while it's finally sold and letters are written to everyone so they can come back and prepare for this show. However there are 2 catches the show will be put in 2 weeks and Kermit is nowhere to be found. After he sells the musical he gets hit by a car receives amnesia and puts on a new identity Phillip Phil.This movie has most things that all the other Muppet movies traditionally have but there are two things that make it seem different. The first is the tone. Something about this New York City onlocation atmosphere gives a very different tone to the Muppets. Or maybe it's the script itself. I don't know but something about the tone of the movie seems different compared to other Muppet movies. Secondly there's no breaking the fourth wall in this movie. At first I thought that was kind of nitpicky. But when you think about it the Muppets always broke the fourth wall in their productions they include themselves in our reality. We're watching a movie and they always let us know that. Here we're on the outside looking in just like in most productions. The screen separates us from these characters this time. That's kind of weird.But like I said there are still a lot of the same things here that are in other Muppet movies. The songs are really nice the cameo appearances are great and we get more of those awesome complicated Muppet scenes! The rat scat scene in the kitchen works really well and everybody really loves the Muppet babies scene! Remember the TV series Muppet Babies? Yeah it's based on a scene from this movie and it's quite charming! Again it doesn't really have a purpose for the movie but it's fun and it gave us a great TV show.I have to say something else I love about this movie it's the end when we see a bunch of Jim Henson's Muppets. We see everyone from The Muppet Show Sesame Street and one of the characters from Fraggle Rock. It's scenes like this that make me both happy and sad at the same time. I get the sense that Jim Henson wanted his Muppets to always be together. Now that they're all owned by different companies we'll never see that again. That is not unless the companies wise up and choose to continue Jim Henson's legacy...But I digress.This isn't the best Muppet movie but it's still a very good one. I enjoy it a lot and I think you'll love it as well. You'll laugh you might even cry apparently the saying Goodbye song has the power to make people cry. You'll enjoy this movie just fine! BOOYIKA!".

There are cute cameos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance sequence from Rizzo and the Rats choreographed by the late great Jim Henson himself and the film certainly entertains.

	schema:headline " The Muppets Take Manhattan";
	schema:reviewBody "The third Muppet movie and arguably the best location for a Muppet movie. Seriously is it just me or does Manhattan just feel like the exact spot where most Muppets would live their home. Obviously the fictional street of 'Sesame Street' is located in Manhattan which leans towards the idea that Muppets perhaps come from that borough. But despite that Muppets just feel right on the east coast.Anywho this time around the Muppets have graduated from college. During this time they have been putting on a popular show called 'Manhattan Melodies'. Upon receiving positive feedback and some advice the gang decides to try their luck at getting their show on Broadway. Predictably at first the Muppets have no luck at all and are forced to break up and find work elsewhere. During this time Kermit continues to sell their show in an attempt at getting on Broadway. He gains help from a local diner owner and his daughter along with Rizzo the Rat and his friends. Problems arise when Kermit is hit by a car loses his memory and then goes missing. The Muppets are summoned back to Manhattan to help find Kermit time now being of the essence because in the meantime their show has been picked up.So once again it has to be said we have another Muppet movie with a somewhat lackluster plot. Yes I know these movies are essentially for kids. Yes I know its a Muppet movie and the emphasis is more on sight gags pratfalls musical numbers and just the look of the Muppets themselves. But this story isn't really interesting it holds no real excitement it doesn't really engage you. I like that its grounded but dare I say a bit too grounded and pedestrian.Again I don't want to nitpick a Muppet movie too much...but these things just jumped out at me. For starters when the gang has no initial luck and Kermit throws a hissy fit they all decide to just leave. This felt a bit odd to me OK they need money but no need to depart for entirely new locations across the USA! Also was it me or did anyone else find Rowlf getting a job in a dog pound kinda weird? In this universe Muppets live alongside humans so why would a human hire a Muppet dog to guard other Muppet dogs? Surely that's bound to lead to trouble. Also Gonzo gets a job at a circus or funfair and Piggy stays behind to secretly watch over Kermit in case he gets his amphibia leg over. Both of which were way too predictable.Having Piggy stay behind to covertly watch Kermit also gives us yet more romantic mush I'm afraid. It seems that every Muppet movie has to have multiple sequences of tiresome romance between the two. I mean sure that is the whole schtick between these characters and it can be funny at times but Jesus! Fortunately this does lead to a really good chase sequence where Piggy rollerskates after a mugger in Central Park he pinches her purse. The sequence is well done utilising a stunt person within a Miss Piggy bodysuit with a fixed expression. Something that has been done before and works pretty well from a distance.This movie is also notable for the first onscreen appearance of Muppets in baby form 'Muppet Babies'. Yes there is a dream sequence within this movie where most of the Muppets are seen in a nursery frolicking around. The Muppets the nursery and the pastel colour scheme we see were all carried across into the cartoon of the same name. It's literally a live action version of 'Muppet Babies' and it looks terrific. Whilst the small baby Muppets are adorable the small animatronic baby Muppets were both adorable and visually excellent. Its sequences like this that prove how much more effective live action effects are.I think the problem with this third movie is the lack of real standout moments. There really isn't too much here that jumps out at you other than the baby Muppets and the Central Park rollerskate sequence. Seeing Rizzo and friends cook in the diner kitchen was cute. Some nice remote controlledwire puppet action with some clever visual trickery thrown in. Kermit being hit by a car and seeing him twitch on the tarmac was a legitimately disturbing sequence back in the day...aaand it still is today. And lastly I did like the frog advertisers Gill Bill and Jill. These guys felt very much like typical 'Sesame Street' characters to me with their rhyming names identical looks and speech pattern.Then of course you had the big finale where Kermit and Piggy finally get married. Something that you'd think would be an epic sequence living long in the memories of all who grew up with the picture alas no. Although the sequence is pretty epic in scope with a good hundred plus Muppets on set including 'Sesame Street' characters AND Uncle Travelling Matt from 'Fraggle Rock' it pails in comparison the first movies finale sequence. That's the problem really it just kinda felt like they were trying to recapture that classic silver screen moment from the original movie which was bigger more impressive and is iconic.Following on from the classic original and wacky hijinks of the second was a hard act to follow. Heck even the cameo roster wasn't very impressive for this one with many bigger stars pulling out. On the whole I wouldn't say this is a bad Muppet movie it's just not a very memorable one. It has its moments which are fun and visually pleasing what Muppet movie isn't visually pleasing?? but they are few and far between leaving the whole affair a tad muted. 610".

Lastly many moviegoers are very uncomfortable watching a dowdy frumpy widow who would pass unnoticed almost anywhere discover her aching capacity and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age.The Mother is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality  a woman who isn't ready to stay home watch the telly and vegetate after her husband of nearly three decades and a controlling dominating chap at that packs it in with a massive heart attack.May Anne Reid and her husband have two children each dysfunctional in his or her own way.  The male son lives with a beautiful wife who may well be driving him to the Bankruptcy Court with her extravagant commercial venture. Paula Cathryn Bradshaw is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer.  She's attractive not pretty and she seems to have a close relationship with mum  at first.Back at her house after burying her husband May determines to not stay there.  Rejecting typical widowhood with its legacy of boring days and no adventure she goes to stay with Paula who has a young son.  Paula's boyfriend Darren Daniel Craig is a ruggedly handsome contractor who seems to be taking an awfully long time to complete an addition to May's son's house.  May is quite taken with harddrinking cokesniffing Darren whose treatment of Paula ought to have alerted May that he was for sure a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Cads.What follows is a torrid affair between Darren and the besotted and now bubblingly alive dare I say reborn? widow.  The love scenes are graphic but take second place to amateur artist May's pen and ink sketches of their trysts which then play a role in the enfolding drama or debacle take your pick.The theater in Manhattan was packed for today's early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of May's age.  That some were shocked or disturbed to see her disporting herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement.  This blindingly honest look at an older woman's awakened passion after decades of dutifully obeying her husband's desire that she stay at home and raise kids she also mentions he didn't like her to have friendswhat a guy surfaces a number of issues.  While May's dalliance with Darren doesn't constitute incest there are real psychological dimensions and issues with a mother bedding her daughter's lover.  And Paula isn't made of the stoutest stuff to begin with.  The affair once disclosed allows the peeling open of the motherdaughter relationship which from Paula's viewpoint left something to be desired. Ms. Bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother's support as well as her loveshe hasn't been dealt a terrible hand by life but it isn't a bed of roses either.May is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect indeed demand a future of happiness.  But she is also inescapably vulnerable. She's fishing in uncharted emotional waters. Who controls her relationship with Darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand much less resolve.  In her sixties she's still a work in progress.Something's Gotta Give recently showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited.  After all it's Jack Nicholson and the always beautiful Diane Keaton cavorting in the world of the rich.  And to insure that no serious psychosocial issues were explored Keaton's young girlfriend Amanda Peet daughter of Keaton not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her older wouldbe lover never hopped into the sack.No easy out here.  Anne Reid's inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others.  Her naked body bursts with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction to others the comments of audience members leaving today reflected all these views.Kudos to director Roger Michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy.910.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to imagine a director capable of such godawful crap as 'Notting Hill' pulling off something as sensitive and as attractive as this but well here's the evidence and it's quite compelling. Several have alluded to TV drama and yes this does have a seventies Play for Today feel at times but is always a cut above mainly I think owing to some quite superlative acting from Anne Reid and to a fine script which shadowboxes with clich without ever getting one on the nose except maybe right at the end. I didn't like either the tracking shot of indifferent goodbyes through the hallway nor the ohwhatabeautifulmorning final scene she deserved a more studied finale than that I think after all that hard work. The slippers business was a bit OTT too on reflection.What I mean about avoiding clich well I for one had a sinking expectation that the mature man May's daughter tries to set her up with would be cast in 2 dimensions as a repulsive old bore so as to point the contrast more painfully with the attractive virile young geezer he is unwittingly competing with. Instead we get an unexpectedly subtle and sympathetic cameo of a lonely clumsy not entirely unlikeable and very human fellow who nevertheless doesn't have much of a clue about entertaining a woman. It was around that point I started to sit up and pay more attention. Here was a script that let the actors breathe and do something interesting with fairly minor parts. Almost Mike Leigh in that respect minus the contrived catharses that the latter inexplicably goes in for.And of course I was as everyone probably was dumbfounded by what Anne Reid does with her character and with her body. She's not the repressed dutiful housewife discovering herself for the first time this is far too simplistic for the character we have. Again and again there are allusions to her having been a bad housewife not to mention that thing she does with trays trying to look nurturing and comely and only succeeding in looking awkward. The daughter accuses her of having sat in front of the TV all day instead of well whatever her motherly duties might be presumed to have been she has no answer. She never was a model wife and mother at least not to herself  that's where a lot of the poignancy comes from the sense of someone having wasted a life trying to fulfil a role she simply wasn't good at ever.".

	schema:headline " Shockingly Intelligent";
	schema:reviewBody "A fierce shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted British writer Hanif Kureishi who wrote My Beautiful Laundrette this is the best thing he's done since then. It's about intelligent people whose lives don't add up to much. They've squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels. The only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex. He has his own motives but Kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion. This is a film in which people and places feel familiar where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen. In some respects it's a bit like Sunday Bloody Sunday but it's an altogether tougher piece of work. The director Roger Michell allows scenes to build instinctively. And it is beautifully acted.As the eponymous mother Anne Reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture. There is not a false note in her extraordinarily livedin performance and that very fine actor Daniel Craig displays shadings to his character than even Kureishi hasn't tapped into. If the film strikes a false note it is perhaps in the character of the talentless daughter caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces or should that be the other way round and even messier life but she is so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless. The film is also extremely beautiful to look at DoP Alwin Kuchler and must rank unhesitatingly as the best British film of the year.".

May and I share something in common not widowhood but age or rather the loss of youth and the invisibility and untouchability that come with age.I could relate to May's need for passion her need to be loved her need not so much for sex but simply to be touched. But as we grow older we are ironically shut out and shunted aside and denied the very thing our souls cry out for. Note There are some disturbing and shocking images of sexuality in The Mother but don't let them put you off and blind you to the real message of the film. May at least rediscovers another passion within  to create art  and so is able to live again. Not all of us are so fortunate. In this respect I identify more with May's daughter Paula who when love and passion fail and die feels that her creative expression is no longer valid and worthwhile and destroys her works in a fit of despair.May is a woman in her late 60s I am a gay man in my late 40s. Yet our stories are similar in so many ways. What May experiences in a matter of weeks I have felt over the past decade. My passion has yet to be rediscovered.It is no accident that The Mother was scripted by Hanif Kureishi who gave us My Beautiful Laundrette a love story about two gay men in the flower of youth. The Mother is at the other end of the spectrum a story about age and the denial of passion. To paraphrase the title of another Kureishi film The Mother might aptly be titled Sammy and Rosie Get Old.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERSI have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes her terribly uneasy. She came to mind when I reflected on the audience's reaction to The Mother. People gasped when May Anne Reid writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover Darren Daniel Craig or later saw sexually explicit drawings by May. I doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings' content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex.Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi My Beautiful Laundrette My Son the Fanatic again proves why he's among the most trenchant storytellers on either side of the Atlantic. His story's not easy to take. This searing family drama isn't a film you can claim you enjoyed watching because it's raw complex and often makes us very uncomfortable. Nevertheless it's powerfully good stuff.Kureishi and Roger Michell who directed Notting Hill of all things craft an unsentimental wrenching and superblyacted portrait of an older woman who realizes after all these years she can and should still enjoy all of life's pleasures. In a wonderfully epiphanous moment when her son Bobby asks her not to be difficult May shoots back Why not?Why not indeed.Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn as May. It's subtle restrained powerful and sad often all at the same time. Watch Reid when May observes Darren and Paula Cathryn Bradshaw in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub. Or when she begs Paula to open the front door after a disastrous date. Reid's eyes and face reveal all of May's anguish and despair. In the film's most devastating moment May drops to her knees before Darren willing to do anything for him only asking him to be kind. This is a tremendously gutsy performance by a remarkable actress.I enjoyed Michell's use of natural sound especially when May and Toots first arrive at Bobby's place. It perfectly illustrated the cacophony around May and Toots the flippant manner in which their own family welcomes them.This film at times reminded me of the honesty and rawness of Mike Leigh's work except The Mother hangs on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat.My one quibble Michell's decision to give May and Darren's first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility. The lovers remain out of focus while in the foreground a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze. And the only sound is of May in the throes of passion.The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig who completely envelops the role of Darren plough their way so fearlessly into these roles that it's unfair to hide their characters' almost primitive energy from the audience. Especially since Michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceral.This film doesn't have immensely likable characters. We sympathize with May but she too causes her daughter's suffering. But I doubt Kureishi intended to people his story with likable folk. His point I believe was to unmask a family that's already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens. It's unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable.".

The naturalism is palpably realistic such that when Hanif Kureish's script crosses a line to go a bit over the top it's upsetting and jarring.

Anne Reid gives the gutsiest older woman performance since Kathy Bates in About Schmidt and Helen Mirren in Calendar Girls but those were mostly played for laughs and didn't reveal the painful delayering of inhibitions. Her character's continued low selfesteem to the point of accepting abuse is difficult to watch.  Except for a very atypical appearance in the first Lara Croft Daniel Craig has avoided depending on his magnetic hunkiness on screen.

	schema:reviewBody "What a moving film. I have a dear friend who is in her sixties and for the past 15 years has told me that people don't see her anymore and she longs for companionship. Being in my late 40s I am beginning to see what she has been complaining about. You are no longer youthful beautiful or touchable. When May says ...this lump of a body... wow. How our bodies change and how we are told it is no longer beautiful. I love when she begins to change what she wears...the colorful scarf...no longer the frumpy wife.It is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time. Sad in that May betrays her daughter's trust...beautiful in that she finds herself through the difficulty of the affair and chooses to move on and finally have her own life. I love the character's daring to even initiate the love affair.Mostly I love the movie because finally it is a picture that shows the intricate nature of relationships be they familial or not. We see Paula's vulnerability yet she will have what she wants at all costs...when she tells her mum that she will have a baby for Darren whether he wants one or not after her mother asks if Darren even wants a child. The movie hits the mark on the how relationships can change and yet reveals what has been there all along dormant. May has stifled her own creativity to raise a family. A family that she didn't really want but was something you just did when she was young. I love the scene when Darren calls her an old tart and she smiles and says I was never called that before. It was truly a gem of a movie.And Daniel Craig. Well i just love him. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is he pleasant on the eyes he is a real talent. What a neat role. He is much more than any 007 that is for sure and I look forward to seeing him in more roles of this nature. The scene where he is pleasuring May and the look he gives her is sort of a look of wonder that he has such control over this woman and also one of pleasure of being able to give this to her. He is actually enjoying giving her pleasure. A wonderful scene. The contrast is the love scene with Bruce. Bruce is totally absorbed with his own pleasure...two completely different men.Alas...I wonder where is my Darren?".

	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning of the film we watch May and Toots preparing for their trip to London for a visit to their grown children. One can see Toots is not in the best of health but he goes along. When he dies suddenly May's world begins to spin out of control.The film directed by Roger Michell based on a screen play by Hanif Kureshi is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening into a world that she doesn't even know it existed until now.May's life as a suburban wife was probably  boring. Obviously her sexual life was next to nothing. We get to know she's had a short extra marital affair then nothing at all. When May loses her husband she can't go back home so instead she stays behind minding her grandson at her daughter's home. It is in this setting that May begins lusting after young and hunky Darren her daughter's occasional lover.Darren awakes in May a passion she has not ever known. May responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes. May who at the beginning of the film is dowdy suddenly starts dressing up becoming an interesting and attractive woman. She ends up falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her sated with a passion she never felt before.Having known a couple of cases similar to this story it came as no surprise to me to watch May's reaction. Her own chance of a normal relationship with Bruce a widower ends up frustratingly for May who realizes how great her sex is with Darren. The younger man we figure is only into this affair to satisfy himself and for a possibility of extorting money from May. Finally the daughter Helen discovers what Mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has made.The film is a triumph for the director. In Anne Reid Mr. Michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of May. Also amazing is Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will react to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also vital to the story as she is the one that has to confront the mother about what has been going on behind her back. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small part as Bruce the older man in Helen's class and is quite effective.The film is rewarding for those that will see it with an open mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's a very fine review by law prof on these pages and not much for me to add. Ann Reid puts in a superb performance as the middleaged mum whose desires are reawakened by her bullying husband's sudden death and Daniel Craig plays the Rough Trade tradesman with great gusto. There's also a wonderful cameo from Oliver Ford Davies as an elderly and inept suitor for Mum's hand. The story is told very clearly with sparkling photography  the cheerful visual atmosphere being rather at odds with the grim storyline.My problem however with the film is that everyone in it is either completely repulsive eg the son and daughter in law and the rough tradesman or is behaving badly. Mum is a sympathetic character but she makes all the wrong choices and behaves pretty selfishly though we do get an inkling as to why. She wouldn't be the first Mum to kick over the traces after a long marriage to a dominant partner. But we wind up feeling sorry for her daughter rather than Mum because she gets done over not because she is otherwise sympathetic.The trouble with movies like this that though they are true to life and emotionally convincing they leave an unpleasant aftertaste. Are we all that selfish and immature? Well families are dangerous places and the majority of murders are committed by a member of the victim's families but relatively speaking murder is a rare crime. Competition between mother and daughter for the same trashy lover is probably pretty rare also. When it does happen a film about it is probably justified. Still at the end we wind up with noone to like which rather muffles the impact of the story.".

The story lowkeyed and purely human is brutally honest and utterly absorbing thanks to the acting of Anne Reid Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The cinematography is stunning. The score is hardwired to the plot. The storyline is epic brilliantly clothed by writer Hanif Kureishi in mundane lives. This story addresses big issues with the subtlety of an impressionist painting. And some of those big issues are highly controversial which probably explains the lack of awards won despite many nominations. It is simply one of my alltime favorite films.".

	schema:reviewBody "In what has to rank as one of the mainstream cinema's most daunting pieces of subject matter this BBC produced film explores the sexual relationship between a 60something woman and a handyman 30 years her junior. Reid plays a grandmother pushing 70! whose feeble husband has managed to keep her tied to him and mostly subservient to him throughout their marriage mostly due to the times more than from a deliberate cruelty on his part. While visiting their upwardly mobile and emotionally distant son in London and also their daughter who lives in the same vicinity the husband Vaughn dies abruptly. Faced with a life of sitting in a chair watching the telly Reid decides to return to London and reconnect with her children and grandchildren who barely know her. Her extraordinarily neurotic and selfish daughter Bradshaw is carrying on an affair with the same handyman Craig who is building a conservatory onto the son's townhouse and asks Reid for advice about how to handle him. As Reid begins to strike up an acquaintance with Craig she begins to find him appealing to herself and starts to unlock a lot of pent up feelings regarding her long lost sexuality and feelings of intimacy. Craig who appreciates Reid's kind manner and thoughtful intellect becomes drawn to her as well causing plenty of drama and turmoil in an already unstable family. What could have been the world's most tawdry and tasteless film is saved by the deeply committed performance of Reid in the title role. She is given plenty of time to paint her character before the more sensationalistic scenes take place. It's a bit of a commentary on society that there's any discomfort at all in seeing a woman in her late 60's go to bed with a man far younger when when do the same thing quite frequently but the disparity exists nonetheless. The scenes here are handled about as well as they could be in presenting the passion and sexuality of the situation without becoming too explicit. Craig does a very nice job here as well displaying a much skinnier and less tantalizing body that he would later present in Casino Royale but his character does seem to pendulum a lot with little or no explanation. He and Reid establish a nice chemistry between them in the scenes prior to their sexual liaisons. Other performances are strong if not always appealing. Davies appears as a suitor more close to Reid's age and is alternately pleasant and repellent. The pace of the film is sure to test the patience of some viewers as it takes its time to build the story and includes a lot of quiet dreamy scenes. London has rarely been presented this sunnily the director also did Notting Hill which makes for a nice contrast to the sometimes downbeat goingson. The film was shot using only natural or ambient light which may be why the director shot during so many sunny periods versus the stereotypical cloudy ones. It's a challenging work but not without rewards. Just as in 1955's All That Heaven Allows a widow with two snotty children who long for her to stay at home with the TV creates a stir when she begins seeing a younger laborer with whom she's established an emotional connection. Now of course it's been ratcheted up with sexuality and the angle of the man being the daughter's lover as well but the story thrust is pretty much the same.".

The central family is anything but warm supportive and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life as a widow. The Mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some societies an elder parent is both unwelcome and seen as a burden to grownup children whose careers and status seeking overshadow all else. As May comes to realize the world is still important to her the lonely widow finds her libido reawakened and alive with her daughter's boyfriend Derrek Daniel Craig a carpenter and rough sort. May embarks on an uninhibited sexual affair with Darrek whose character is sympathetic to her at first but his flawed nature is quickly revealed through the pressures of the women who surround him.This is the kind of role Hollywood actresses of a certain age whine is never written for them but they would never appear in because of the frankness overt sexuality unglamorous wardrobe little makeup and social commentary on the vapidness of the very society that most film industry middle age actresses are enchrenched. The performance of lead actress Anne Reid ranges from quiet to giddy and her interpretation blossoms on screen from the drab widow to a sexually alive and freed up middle age woman whose performance is sans facelift hair extensions botox and liposuction. She bares more than her soul onscreen with Craig.Craig as the enabling handyman who beds mother and daughter turns in another stellar performance that is at first sympathetic to the widow's situation but in the end is without redemption. As his true nature unfold and he is literally the rooster in a henhouse his aimless inability to say no to the exwife boring girlfriend and her mother is blamed as the root of his ineffectual existence. While good with his hands at building a conservatory he is unable to construct meaning in his life.One of the best films from Britain in years it is simply adult in its storyline. The Mother is the rare kind of film that is perhaps too honest for American audiences to tolerate having no car chase no bling no rap soundtrack to drown out the cretin performances by TV starlets and buff studmuffins. The Mother reflects how the aging baby boomers are now disposable people that offspring are willing to overlook send to the retirement home and get out of the way. May doesn't know what to do as she is made alive by Darren isn't willing to go to the old folks home and finds her kids are more conservative than she ever was at their age.".

	schema:headline " An honest and nonexploitative family affair";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity. Anne Reid previously best known in the UK for her TV roles including 'Dinnerladies' a Victoria Wood scripted series on incompany catering workers if you're wondering gives a performance of finely judged understatement as May a late60s bereaved mother of two chattering class adults in an innerLondon borough. Her husband Toots Peter Vaughan dies on their visit to the male of the latter species Bobby and we see the pair being rather casually greeted by Bobby and his family. May's teacher daughter Paula Cathryn Bradshaw lives nearby however and the relationship between May and Paula initially appears closer. Thus when May decides she cannot live in her own home and comes back to London she is able to stay in Paula's house and do some childminding of Paula's more appreciative offspring.It is on May's visits to Bobby's house that she embarks on an affair with Darren a mid30s friend of Bobby who is working on a house extension. In what may be the first mainstream British film to so portray it it is May and not Darren Daniel Craig who initiates the encounter and at least to begin with it seems that the relationship is founded on mutual respect. There is no explicit sexual content at least in the DVD I saw differences in the IMDb cast list suggests the existence of other versions and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not exploitatively. More strongly portrayed is the relationship between May and daughter Paula a recent convert to 'therapy and selfexploration' who announces that mummy has never been supportive of her. Paula is also Darren's lover and when she finds May's explicit but rather poor drawings of Darren and May together things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion. Only in an English film perhaps could a daughter announce that she is going to hit her mother politely ask her to stand up and duly wallop her.In the mean time May is being drawn into a putative relationship with a decent but older of her own generation member of Paula's writing group. The contrast between the ensuing unwanted intercourse and her affair with Darren is clearly made it is at that point that May starts to acquiesce to Paula and Darren's worm begins to turn he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money if not all along but for some of the ride.

	onyx:emotionText "This is an excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity. Anne Reid previously best known in the UK for her TV roles including 'Dinnerladies' a Victoria Wood scripted series on incompany catering workers if you're wondering gives a performance of finely judged understatement as May a late60s bereaved mother of two chattering class adults in an innerLondon borough. Her husband Toots Peter Vaughan dies on their visit to the male of the latter species Bobby and we see the pair being rather casually greeted by Bobby and his family. May's teacher daughter Paula Cathryn Bradshaw lives nearby however and the relationship between May and Paula initially appears closer. Thus when May decides she cannot live in her own home and comes back to London she is able to stay in Paula's house and do some childminding of Paula's more appreciative offspring.It is on May's visits to Bobby's house that she embarks on an affair with Darren a mid30s friend of Bobby who is working on a house extension. In what may be the first mainstream British film to so portray it it is May and not Darren Daniel Craig who initiates the encounter and at least to begin with it seems that the relationship is founded on mutual respect. There is no explicit sexual content at least in the DVD I saw differences in the IMDb cast list suggests the existence of other versions and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not exploitatively. More strongly portrayed is the relationship between May and daughter Paula a recent convert to 'therapy and selfexploration' who announces that mummy has never been supportive of her. Paula is also Darren's lover and when she finds May's explicit but rather poor drawings of Darren and May together things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion. Only in an English film perhaps could a daughter announce that she is going to hit her mother politely ask her to stand up and duly wallop her.In the mean time May is being drawn into a putative relationship with a decent but older of her own generation member of Paula's writing group. The contrast between the ensuing unwanted intercourse and her affair with Darren is clearly made it is at that point that May starts to acquiesce to Paula and Darren's worm begins to turn he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money if not all along but for some of the ride. So May finds herself superfluous to both of her children's needs and finally does return home but later leaves on a jet plane for pastures new.The film's strength is that it portrays with unflinching but sympathetic truth the nature of contemporary adult parentsibling relationships where bereavement may leave the surviving parent feeling more alone than if they had noone to care for them.

Spending most of her days at Bobby's house she gets to know her son's friend builder and daughter's boyfriend Darren. However as she struggles to find direction in her life May starts an affair with Darren despite him being almost half her age.I don't know anyone who actually went to see this at the cinema and I'm not sure how much success it had on the big screen in the UK however on television it seemed much more at home and fitting to the surroundings. Having seen the trailer I thought that this would be about the affair between May and Darren and in some ways it is but it is more about the grief and loss suffered by May that leads her to that relationship. It sounded very interesting but in reality too much of it is half done and not developed to the point where it totally works. The grief itself is used as a foundation for the affair where really it should have been explored in itself. The affair never really grips because a we don't fully understand the grief and b it isn't convincingly done. It happens too suddenly and I didn't find myself understanding the whys  although it may be the fact that I cannot relate to that degree of loss and the possible reactions.With this as the main problem it is hard to keep with the story as it brings in other aspects such as motherdaughter relationship Darren's mental state etc all of it is interesting but really should have been the topping to a great portrayal of grief  it wasn't and as a result some sections of this just didn't work very well. The story is still interesting but the grief was the focus for me and I found the script too quick to leave it behind and look at the action that results from it instead of it itself. The direction is very good and has lots of nice touches giving the film a sense of reality while also focusing on details around the actual shot.The cast are also pretty good despite the lack of material to match what they could have done. Craig steals the film although this is part of its weakness because really his character is an aside rather than the focus. He deals well with the more complex aspect of his character and gradually takes us to the point where he is revealed  it is very convincing and I say again that Craig is a very fine actor who is worth watching in coming years. Reid is the star of the film and her quiet sense of loss is well handled in her performance even if the script and director didn't give her enough to work with. I never really got to the heart of her character but this was not her fault and I did wonder at times if she had herself. Bradshaw and Mackintosh both give realistic performances that are worth seeing and add layers to the film.Overall this is an OK film but not as good a one as I had hoped to be watching. The film starts well with May living a boring life and then dealing with the loss freedom? that her husband's death brings but this isn't that well explored as we rush headlong into the affair and all its complications. This means the foundation is not there and what should have been detaillayers on the film just come out as distractions at the end of the day. The cast try hard but this is too hard for them to cover for and in the end the film feels rather half done and unconvincing. Maybe worth trying once but it didn't do it for me I'm afraid.".

Bradshaw and Mackintosh both give realistic performances that are worth seeing and add layers to the film.Overall this is an OK film but not as good a one as I had hoped to be watching. The film starts well with May living a boring life and then dealing with the loss freedom? that her husband's death brings but this isn't that well explored as we rush headlong into the affair and all its complications. This means the foundation is not there and what should have been detaillayers on the film just come out as distractions at the end of the day. The cast try hard but this is too hard for them to cover for and in the end the film feels rather half done and unconvincing. Maybe worth trying once but it didn't do it for me I'm afraid.";

The Jantzens have been owning the 18th century manor house Immenhof for over a 100 years breeding and selling ponies. Only recently Jochen von Roth has returned from POW camp and is now trying to establish a stud farm in the old forester's house about 5 kilometers from the manor house. Both Oma Jantzen and von Roth are struggling with finances. Owing to debt Jantzen may have to face the auctioning off of all her possessions. Into this situation arrives Ethelbert the sisters' posh cousin from the big city we never learn which. He is making quite a fool of himself in his red and white riding dress falling off ponies and into traps but Dick feels drawn to him nevertheless.

	schema:headline " Mother 1926 d. Pudovkin";
	schema:reviewBody "Mother follows a divided family during a workers strike in the Russian Revolution of 1905. After the father is killed in a skirmish and the son is sentenced to work at a labor camp the mother revises her ideology and helps to plan a prison escape. The film concludes with troops subduing the revolt and the death of the mother and son at the hands of the soldiers. Vsevstol Pudovkin's 18931957 method of montage more closely resembles Kuleshov's brick laying method where the combination of cutting helps to more effectively convey or dramatize an event in contrast to Eisenstein who advocated a montage of colliding images to generate a meaning that cannot be depicted on film. The film may be silent but the sounds are transmitted from the image. We feel the silence drop in the bar as the father demands vodka. Mother marks a clear development in the structure and formation of the motion picture but modern day audiences may be desensitized to the films spell. The film utilizes a cinematic language familiar to the contemporary moviegoer but we may take the easily followed continuous action and cutting that develops suspense for granted as we witness everyday movie vocabulary in its conception. While Pudovkin shared different theoretical views from Eisenstein the film includes abstract sequences as well. After the death of the father Pudovkin cuts to several images of trees blowing in the wind as a break in the action. He draws a parallel between blocks of ice plummeting down a river and the crowds of people marching while also establishing simultaneous action for a crucial plot point near the end of the film. Mother also experiments with subjectivity as we iris to the mother's memory of her son hiding weapons using an xray vision effect to show the storage beneath the floorboards and as we are given images of water and a child after Pavel reads the getaway plan as if to show his yearning for freedom. While the portrayal and privileging of a hero the prison escape sequence and the climactic chase renders Mother rather Hollywood ultimately the film is too tragic to be a Hollywood film.".

The plot of the film is simply outstanding. While some would say it was to be expected since the film is based off of a novel by Maxim Gorky it should be noted that good source material does not guarantee cinematic success. The film follows a mother and her revolutionist son Pavel as they navigate a series of difficulties resulting from her son's allegiance.With no speech a major challenge for silent films is the creation of multidimensional characters. Pudovkin overcomes this challenge by being able to capture the emotions of the characters. I thought the mother was exceptionally interesting. Her struggle did not only represent that of a loving mother but also that of a movement. Pudovkin make great use of the camera whether it was a side profile emphasizing the pensiveness of the character or a welltimed frontal closeup he facilitates our ride on this emotional rollercoaster.For the most part I really enjoyed the pacing of the film. While the pacing did vary in tempo it was always well within its own groove. Even in the extremely exciting conclusion one did not get to feel the extremely fastpaced tempo of a Battleship Potemkin which I believe speaks to the differences between the directors. On that note it was interesting to see how Pudovkin's use of montage differed. His cuts were far more gradual and subtle when compared to Eisenstein's in Battleship which contributed to the stability of the film.All in all Mother was a good watch and one of the stronger films that we have seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pudovkin's Mother is a film about the feelings of the working class speaking to the proletariat as the foundation of the nation. Through all its symbols and plot the film aligns itself with that category of cinema aimed to refresh the enthusiasm for Communist ideals. It is almost as if it is a duty to keep the memory of the first rebels fighting against the powerful and allpervasive bourgeoisie. In that sense the film sensitizes its audience towards fighting along the ideas of the party. However banale and meaningless such a pursuit would be for today's audience the manner in which Pudovkin realizes in conveying this message is remarkable. Overall we see extremely good and good cinema.The movie is about a young man Pavel who is aligned with the worker's cause and organizes a strike. His mother is always in the background a perfect symbol of the Russian peasant woman in her simplicity and emotion. The family suffers because the father is a drunkard and very violent man. Pavel's involvement with the strike and the fights that result lead eventually to the murder of his father. The tension builds up to the trial and then continues as the workers try to liberate Pavel from prison One of the aspects I've liked most about this movie is the fascinating montage. The techniques used in the film make it align itself with other productions from that period like Eisenstein's or Kuleshov's which emphasized the capturing of details and using short shots that would convey the plot in a different manner than the overly selfexplanatory long shot. Hence we have the details of physical contact in the altercations the portrait of the lady who protects the working class seen through a dusty glass some beautiful closeups showing the emotion of the characters especially the mother caressing hands eyes and other shots that put together make this film a fine piece of cinematography.The film's symbolism is also evident and a strong feature of the film.We have the tumultuous flow of water and blocks of ice which stand for the excitement of the revolution and the peasants as a force. The mother itself is a symbol of unity. We see her at first a sensible being faithful but naive and ultimately helpless in the face of the corrupt bureaucrats. In the end we see her a strong figure holding the flag with pride. The suspense is built up in an interesting way during the trial scene with multiple symbols of the superficiality of the old order the hiccups of Pavel's defender which suggest ridicule the sleeping man and the mare a symbol of aristocracy and superficial ideals. The film ultimately presents the clash of two camps the peasants who are represented as pure and filled with ideals with the mother the beautiful woman and young people as representatives versus the camp of bourgeoisie with corrupt and indifferent characters sometimes violent sometimes diabolic but never invoking any sympathy to the audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Five movies were made based on Gorky's novel in 1920 by Aleksandr Razumnyi in 1926 by Vsevolod Pudovkin in 1941 by Leonid Lukov in 1956 by Mark Donskoy starring Aleksey Batalov as Pavel Vlassov and in 1990 by Gleb Panfilov. Also Bertolt Brecht put the novel on stage in 1932. Hanns Eisler created based on the novel a cantata for chorus solo voices and two pianos in 1935.From all this list undoubtedly impressive by number and persons implied I was able to watch only the silent made in 1926 by Vsevolod Pudovkin. Politics aside it is a masterpiece. He was one of the greatest Soviet filmmakers of the 1920's avantgarde in the same line with Kuleshov Eisenstein and all the others and this movie proves it brilliantly.Pudovkin's movie has an architecture that is radically different from that of the novel. One is talking about very recent events the other is framing the facts and personages into a paradigm. Both are strongly motivated politically but the two political moments are very different the novel is made in the aftermath of the 1905 Revolution it's real time life while the movie comes in the first years of Soviet power preoccupied to build the official history of the revolution in other words the founding mythology. While Gorky tells us a story of life flowing naturally with personages of flesh and bones Pudovkin demonstrates a paradigm deals with a myth in the making. And in any myth the facts and personages are no more just facts and personages like anything else from real life they are prototypes aiming to convey a sense. I'll give you only one example the bridge over the river separating factory and the neighborhood. At Gorky it's just a bridge nothing else. At Pudovkin it is a path you take to leave your submissive life and enter the revolutionary struggle. So it becomes a prototype within a paradigm conveying a metaphysical significance.Gorky's novel inaugurates the Socialist Realism it means its approach is realist to the bone so its style is traditional following the traditional Realism of the 19th century that were to be observed by all Socialist Realist artists. Does also the movie belong to the Socialist Realist style? I don't think so. I would say that by the contrary it belongs hundred percent to the avantgarde of the twenties so it rejects totally the tradition. It is a Constructivist oeuvre calling in mind maybe the Expressionist movies made in Germany in the same epoch. These artists of the twenties totally committed politically while thinking to build the new society based on their radically new form of art and throwing over the board all that was old traditional classic Realism included. The thirties would stop them forcefully they would have to obey to the party dogmas or go to hell the first circle or beyond.A few words about the cast Vera Baranovskaya made a remarkable performance in the role of the mother she would play one year later in the following movie made by Pudovkin The End of St. Petersburg Nikolai Batalov 18991937 who played in the role of the son was also Soldier Gusev in Aelita a fine role in a fine movie it seems that he was not related to Aleksey Batalov who played Pavel Vlassov in the movie of Mark Donskoy from 1956 and last but not least Pudovkin himself in the role of a police officer the guy really enjoyed the negative roles".

Both are strongly motivated politically but the two political moments are very different the novel is made in the aftermath of the 1905 Revolution it's real time life while the movie comes in the first years of Soviet power preoccupied to build the official history of the revolution in other words the founding mythology. While Gorky tells us a story of life flowing naturally with personages of flesh and bones Pudovkin demonstrates a paradigm deals with a myth in the making. And in any myth the facts and personages are no more just facts and personages like anything else from real life they are prototypes aiming to convey a sense. I'll give you only one example the bridge over the river separating factory and the neighborhood. At Gorky it's just a bridge nothing else. At Pudovkin it is a path you take to leave your submissive life and enter the revolutionary struggle. So it becomes a prototype within a paradigm conveying a metaphysical significance.Gorky's novel inaugurates the Socialist Realism it means its approach is realist to the bone so its style is traditional following the traditional Realism of the 19th century that were to be observed by all Socialist Realist artists. Does also the movie belong to the Socialist Realist style? I don't think so. I would say that by the contrary it belongs hundred percent to the avantgarde of the twenties so it rejects totally the tradition. It is a Constructivist oeuvre calling in mind maybe the Expressionist movies made in Germany in the same epoch. These artists of the twenties totally committed politically while thinking to build the new society based on their radically new form of art and throwing over the board all that was old traditional classic Realism included. The thirties would stop them forcefully they would have to obey to the party dogmas or go to hell the first circle or beyond.A few words about the cast Vera Baranovskaya made a remarkable performance in the role of the mother she would play one year later in the following movie made by Pudovkin The End of St. Petersburg Nikolai Batalov 18991937 who played in the role of the son was also Soldier Gusev in Aelita a fine role in a fine movie it seems that he was not related to Aleksey Batalov who played Pavel Vlassov in the movie of Mark Donskoy from 1956 and last but not least Pudovkin himself in the role of a police officer the guy really enjoyed the negative roles";

The basic plot premise is anything but basic as the line between reality and fantasy is almost indistinguishable through most of the film.  What is going on?  Who really knows...I'm not sure even director John Carpenter knows. But what we do get is a guessing game of what is real and unreal in a very stylish sophisticated almost bizarre fashion.  The film opens in a mental asylum with protagonist Sam Neill being put in a padded cell whilst in a straightjacket.  The setting is larger than life.  The characters around Neill are caricatures for the most part.  John Glover plays a doctorDoctor Saperstein...a possible homage to Rosemary's Baby with complete camp. David Warner another doctor begins talking to Neill and asking him about what happened.  The rest of the film then details what Neill did working with regards to a lost author named Sutter Cane.  The plot is much more complicated than that and may take subsequent viewings to fully understand WHAT can be understood.  The end result is at the very least a very gratifying one as Carpenter constructs a dreamlike story that has obvious roots in both the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft and Stephen King.  The acting is good all around...Neill is excellent as John Trent.  He makes a very believable presence in a sea of unreality.  Julie Carmen is also very good in her role.  Look for Charlton Heston as a publisher and Bernie Casey in a cameo as well.  Kudos to Mr. Carpenter for bringing his visions of horror to the silver screen once again.  This may be his best film...certainly his most thoughtprovoking and sophisticated.".

	schema:reviewBody "In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great directionwonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best.In The Mouth Of Madness tells the story of private investigator John TrentSam Neillan investigator who investigates phony insurance claims. NowTrent is asked to investigate the disappearance of best selling Horror novelist Sutter CaneJurgen Prochnow. Unfornately for John Trent this not going to be a typical investigation and for John Trent will be an journey he will never forget and it will blur the lines of fiction and reality and will be a battle for John's sanity.During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen by critics and most Horror fans as dead. I don't think the Horror genre was dead I think the Horror genre was in a coma and was waiting to wake up. During the time the Horror genre was seen as dead there was a few great Horror films that came out during the early to mid 1990s and one of those Horror films was John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness. In the Mouth Of Madness is the final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy which also includes The Thing and Prince Of Darkness and when it was released in 1995 In The Mouth Of Madness flopped at the box office like most of Carpenter's films. But In The Mouth Of Madness has gain a cult following among Carpenter fans and Horror fans over the years be the film is great and unique. If The Thing was about an Alien Invasion and Prince Of Darkness was about a dark religious theme then In The Mouth Of Madness is about Horror literature coming to life and drawing the line between fiction and reality. That is what so brilliant and scary about this film is the story and concept of the filmwhat if the stories of authors such Stephen KingH.P Lovecraft or Clive Barker came to life and you are not sure what is reality or what is fiction? In The Mouth Of Madness answers this question in a scary way. ITMOM is a Psychological Horror film in the truest since of the words because it's a Horror film that not only scares you physically but also mentally because when you watch ITMOM you are not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it all in John Trent's mind or Sutter Cane's mind and you are put into a frightening and bizarre journey into darkness. With Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy was about the end of the world and possibly for this film the end of the world doesn't come from human beings explosions or diseases but books. The film was greatly influence by the works of H.P Lovecraft whether it's the title of the film or the scenes with monsters and supernatural things hiding in the dark and visuals that are haunting and disturbing. The screenplay by Michael De Luca is wellwritten and original with the dialog being cynical but at the same time very scary and creepy. John Trent is a classic Carpenter Antihero is a private detective in the spirit of FilmNoir like classic detective characters like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow and like those characters Trent is cynical and a loner. While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopelesssad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trentwith Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda StylesCane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Canewith Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton HestonJackson HarglowDavid WarnerDr. WrennJohn GloverSapersteinBernie CaseyRobinsonFrancis BayMrs. Pickmanand Willeim Von HomburgSimongive good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy.The direction by John Carpenter is excellentwith Carpenter giving the film a dark and frightening atmosphere and always moving the camera.

	onyx:emotionText "In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great directionwonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best.In The Mouth Of Madness tells the story of private investigator John TrentSam Neillan investigator who investigates phony insurance claims. NowTrent is asked to investigate the disappearance of best selling Horror novelist Sutter CaneJurgen Prochnow. Unfornately for John Trent this not going to be a typical investigation and for John Trent will be an journey he will never forget and it will blur the lines of fiction and reality and will be a battle for John's sanity.During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen by critics and most Horror fans as dead. I don't think the Horror genre was dead I think the Horror genre was in a coma and was waiting to wake up. During the time the Horror genre was seen as dead there was a few great Horror films that came out during the early to mid 1990s and one of those Horror films was John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness. In the Mouth Of Madness is the final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy which also includes The Thing and Prince Of Darkness and when it was released in 1995 In The Mouth Of Madness flopped at the box office like most of Carpenter's films. But In The Mouth Of Madness has gain a cult following among Carpenter fans and Horror fans over the years be the film is great and unique. If The Thing was about an Alien Invasion and Prince Of Darkness was about a dark religious theme then In The Mouth Of Madness is about Horror literature coming to life and drawing the line between fiction and reality. That is what so brilliant and scary about this film is the story and concept of the filmwhat if the stories of authors such Stephen KingH.P Lovecraft or Clive Barker came to life and you are not sure what is reality or what is fiction? In The Mouth Of Madness answers this question in a scary way. ITMOM is a Psychological Horror film in the truest since of the words because it's a Horror film that not only scares you physically but also mentally because when you watch ITMOM you are not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it all in John Trent's mind or Sutter Cane's mind and you are put into a frightening and bizarre journey into darkness. With Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy was about the end of the world and possibly for this film the end of the world doesn't come from human beings explosions or diseases but books. The film was greatly influence by the works of H.P Lovecraft whether it's the title of the film or the scenes with monsters and supernatural things hiding in the dark and visuals that are haunting and disturbing. The screenplay by Michael De Luca is wellwritten and original with the dialog being cynical but at the same time very scary and creepy. John Trent is a classic Carpenter Antihero is a private detective in the spirit of FilmNoir like classic detective characters like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow and like those characters Trent is cynical and a loner. While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopelesssad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trentwith Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda StylesCane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Canewith Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton HestonJackson HarglowDavid WarnerDr. WrennJohn GloverSapersteinBernie CaseyRobinsonFrancis BayMrs. Pickmanand Willeim Von HomburgSimongive good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy.The direction by John Carpenter is excellentwith Carpenter giving the film a dark and frightening atmosphere and always moving the camera.

	schema:reviewBody "I gotta say that when I first saw this movie it blew me away. It's not as good as The Thing but it's a great horror movie. It has everything that makes John Carpenter the master of horror. He is one man that can still scare the crap out of me.In The Mouth Of Madness is about Sutter Cane Jurgen Prochnow this century's most widelyread author. When Cane disappears his publishing company Arcane run by the very grufflooking Jackson Harglow Charleton Heston enlists John Trent Sam Neill an insurance investigator to find him. Trent agrees after he is almost killed by an axewielding maniac that turns out to be Cane's agent. He and Arcane editor Linda Styles Julie Carmen find Cane's fictional town of Hobb's End and then all hell breaks loose.First things first. I loved the opening score. It starts off very simplistic and then goes into full hard rock mode. Excellent music throughout too.Onto the characters. Before I say anything I have to say the Sam Neill is one of my favorite actors. He can truly act expressing a full range of emotions angry annoyed happy cocky flabbergasted etc. You name it he can pull it off. Anyway Sam Neill plays John Trent perfectly. This is a guy who's good at his job and he likes it. He can see right through you see what you're capable of. It's fun to watch him try to make sense out of all the madness around him especially once he arrives in Hobb's End. Julie Carmen unfortunately looks as if she's about to fall asleep or that she's stoned I don't know which probably both throughout the whole movie. She serves her purpose though. Let's talk about the real star of this movie. As with Sam Neill Jurgen Prochnow is perfect as Sutter Cane. I can't think of anyone who could have played the part better. This man's got the look the voice and the attitude to make Cane extremely believable. If anyone can play the bringer of the apocalypse it's this guy. Charleton Heston looks like he's got something stuck up his butt but plays Harglow just fine I think this actually helps his character!. I personally think he could beat the crap out of Sutter Cane if it really came down to it. The other characters are all minor but one deserves an honorable mention. David Warner as Dr. Wrenn is great. This man can handle himself and can give Sam Neill a run for his money even though he doesn't try to here.The gore and special effects are fantastic. It's nice to see a movie in the 90's where CGI is nonexistent. The only two movies where CGI has tricked me into thinking what I was watching was real or at least animatronic are Jurassic Park and Starship Troopers. Most of the time I or anyone else for that matter can spot CGI easily. Not so in those two movies. Anyway I go off on tangents a lot so get used to it everything from the deadundead cop the axemaniac's eyes the creature that's part of Cane's back and the vile abominations was superb. Nice work guys at KNB! No complaints here.I will admit that Carpenter got me with almost every boo scare in the movie particularly the one at the end used to a far better effect here than at the end of Resident Evil. But those scares are only temporary. When someone says a movie was really scary I want to see something that will stick with me and always be in the back of my mind. These are the best kind of scares which define true horror. We don't get very many of these types of scares anymore which really makes me mad. But just as I had hoped Carpenter pulls it off here and in a few of his other movies too perfectly.Finally I loved the ending! Apocalyptic endings always so much more satisfying than happy endings. Carpenter is always known for his hook endings and this was one of his best.I've said it before and I'll say it again John Carpenter was is and always will be the master of horror. 'Nuff said.".

This makes the basis of a totally cool movie.John Carpenter always used 2.351 photography and in this film we get a screen filled with creepy imagery and cool locations. The film was shot entirely in Canada in 1993 and was released in 1995. It is set basically in the city and in the fictional town of Hobbs End. When I say that Hobbs End is fictional I really mean it. In the film the town does not exist but Sam Neill ends up there. Some dark magicklogic at work methinks.This is definitely a horror film for the thinking audience.

	schema:reviewBody "In The Mouth of Madness is one of John Carpenter's better flicks. It features the usually bland Sam Neill in a surprisingly good and likable performance and is packed with oodles of intriguing concepts and spiffy details. The music is good it was cowritten by Carpenter and the movie has a great look. There are also lots and lots of ginchy makeup effects and while some are better than others the kid who turns into an old man looks like a kid wearing a Spencer's Gifts Old Man mask and fright wig but the sheer abundance of them make this unique.Neill plays John Trent a nononsense insurance investigator who loves his job and has disdain for most of humanity but with a sense of humor. He's sent to find a missing megaselling author Sutter Caine Jurgen Prochnow in a role that would have been kickass if played by Stephen King whose books are a nationwide craze. Trent ends up in Hobb's End a town right out of Caine's books literally where the morbid tales of fiction are becoming reality.The movie although muddled in places too repetitive on purpose and too reliant on flash forwards has lots of things to say about the perception of reality and it interesting and entertaining.The supporting cast is good John Glover and David Warner are psychiatrists a subdued Charleton Heston is a publisher and Bernie Revenge of the Nerds Casey is Trent's boss but the highlight is Frances Bay as the sweet Mrs. Pickman. She provides the film's high points and ends up looking like something from the director's The Thing. The weak link in the cast is the leading lady Julie Carmen who delivers every line like she just chugged a case of Nyquil. In addition to her lousy acting she's dressed in ugly outfits and has a kind of inyourface ugliness. In one scene there is a special effects dummy head in place of Carmen's and the dummy head outacts her.This is not as great as The Thing but better than They Live as far as John Carpenter's paranoid realitybending flicks go and is worth checking out.".

The writer is Michael de Luca who also wrote the script for Lawnmower Man another movie about breaking the limits of reality.Now the film is not perfect. It is a bit cheesy at times and the movie feels dated even for 1994. The cast helps bring it to life.

	schema:headline " Carpenter at his most surreal most sickening and in his own devilish way most selfdeprecating";
	schema:reviewBody "I think In the Mouth of Madness falls into that column of John Carpenter films that fans of his will either like a lot or wont and I could understand the points made for the latter. It is a little hard to get into at first as being a very strong film based on the sharply timed shocks and paranoia of Carpenter's horror as a director as well as the ideas presented by the writer and it does veer into going into the same wild level of deliriousness that soon enough becomes the lead character. But it's a work as well where Carpenter is testing himself and succeeding in a carefree but controlled way where he goes for having his cake and eating it too. He gets to throw up on the screen some grisly and as a possible tip of the hat to the groundbreaking effects from the Thing a sometimes funny knockoff special creature effects and with some masterful displays in editing through the images of abstractions into the character's subconscious while questioning what he's doing all the time or at least the genre he and others notably Stephen King make their bread and butter.It's a sort of slightly smarter pulp scifihorror piece not quite at the insane brilliance of They Live though perhaps in its more deliberate fashion a little creepier as investigator John Trent Sam Neill is investigating the disappearance of a severely popular horror novelist who's books sometimes make people go a little nuts. Trent sees this firsthand from novelist Sutter Cane's agent who comes at him wielding an axe it's one of those pure points in the film that mixed the macabre and satire something Craven didn't quite get at with New Nightmare. He thinks it's a hoax and soon discovers that he may be in a fictional? town called Hobbs End in New Hampshire. What he finds in typical Carpenter fashion is describable as being a psychological flipflopper where Trent goes from thinking it's all a gag with it being very elaborate to it suddenly not being at all. Creatures supplied wonderfully by KNB start popping out disgusting ones that aren't much human and it even gets to Trett's female companionliterary liaison on the trip. Soon Cane is found in some dank cellar Jurgen Purchnow one of Carpenter's most chilling villains in how subtle he is and he has a new book ready for Trett to bring to the world...This isn't quite where the film gets weird though it's probably a little before or a little after this point and the kind of weirdness I had been hoping to build up. Although it does get close for writer De Luca to being shaky with balancing really dark humor however in small doses and depending on how seriously one takes the more overt horror elements and at the plight of Trent's mindset in the midst of total Armageddon Carpenter levels the playing field without missing too many beats. I kept having my mouth hang open either in a 'what the hell' mode or just in sort of plain shock. But it's an entertaining mix and match all the way for a genre fan and Sam Neill is definitely up for the challenge of playing as well levelheaded and rational Trett for the first half then slowly but surely descending into his own subconscious state of peril or perhaps Trent losing sight on what is perceived as reality or not. Only Neill could go between serious dramatic roles to films like this and Jurassic Park where his characters' confidence as the practical pragmatist starts to waver as a descent into disaster goes further and further.What Carpenter ends on in the last section of his apocalypse trilogy isn't necessarily a closedandshut ending either I sense that he wants things to be a little closer to the Thing's end where it's all doom and gloom but there's a wink to the protagonist's state of mind. Trett's last minutes wandering the streets and going into the movie theater watching himself doesn't really spell anything conclusive I think which adds all the more to the fun and intrigue. He could just be still in his hospital room still in the world that dismisses Cane as pulpsensationalist trash albeit successful pulpsensationalist trash a little relevant today eg Dan Brown and not among the total bats mess that the world has become while locked in his padded room. It's a question left to the viewer and a smart one to put up in a film that has by this point thrived mostly on its own sensationalism as well tongueincheek in the guise of crazy smalltown breakout scenario. As a Carpenter fan I say bring it on.".

It does lose a little something once the mystery elements are deemphasized and the lunatic imagery takes over but there is something here for a variety of horror fans those who crave imaginative effects work and those who simply enjoy the idea of imagination run amok as characters end up in a place where fantasy and reality are no longer distinguishable from each other. It also utilizes a doomsday theme and is the final film in what the director calls his Apocalypse Trilogy after The Thing and Prince of Darkness. The visual effects are simply spectacular with the renowned KNB group obviously having a ball coming up with assorted gore and creature gags.Sam Neill who'd previously played the villain in Carpenters' Memoirs of an Invisible Man stars here as John Trent a cynical freelance insurance investigator who is good at what he does and also enjoys what he does. He's hired by a publishing magnate Jackson Harglow Charlton Heston to look into the disappearance of a phenomenally successful horror author Sutter Cane an obvious nod to a certain other famous horror writer. When he and his travelling companion Linda Styles Julie Carmen arrive in the small town of Hobbs End  a place that supposedly only exists in Canes' mind  things take an extremely bizarre turn and poor Trent one of those hardcore rational types who is sure there must be some logic to all of this is taken for a dark and interesting ride.This had been written a few years previous by future big time Hollywood executive Michael De Luca and was intended to be a derivation of concepts created by the legendary H.P. Lovecraft. Carpenter clearly saw the potential for some true horror in this script and does a bangup job in crafting a continuously ominous mood and plenty of weird atmosphere. As usual his score composed in collaboration with Jim Lang is excellent. The ending is downright brilliant at least in this viewers' opinion and getting there is just as much fun. Neill is superb in the lead this is almost entirely his show although the great German actor Jurgen Prochnow makes the most of his limited screen time as Cane. Some of the supporting actors  David Warner John Glover Bernie Casey Peter Jason Frances Bay  aren't seen all that much but it's still nice to see them here.Like a lot of Carpenters' work it just wasn't appreciated that much in its time 20 years ago now but it's gained a fair amount of respect in the years since among horror fans.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The bizarre thing sometimes about writing and reading fictional books are they are always about heightened or different realities. Each of the characters that are written and involved in the action depending on how their written feel like regular people despite whatever role their suppose to play. In a way these things are practically creating a certain existence and when we read or write these stories we suspend our disbelief because depending on how much we enjoy the story we want to almost believe it's real.This is my third favorite movie from my favorite movie director John Carpenter and it's also one of my personal favorite films in general but also the last in his apocalypse trilogy my favorite is The Thing It's one of those surreal horror films or just films in general you don't see often it's something that shows up on an occasional amount of years or could slip though the cracks. This isn't just a film it's an experience because it thinks outside the box and beyond. It was also a little love letter and satire of H.P. Lovecroft stories which is cool because I'm a fan of his stories.I like it's plot which it's a bit uncannily similar to the film The Ninth Gate but that's a different story. Anyway in format it seems like a simple tracking mission mystery but what makes those kinds of plots interesting is one thing always turns into another and this film does that but takes a more radical approach because it screws with you perception of reality in the film and pulls the rug from under you when you least expect it to.The protagonist despite unreliable is good Insurance investigator John Trent played well by underrated actor Sam Neil. John is a cynicrealist and control freak. He loves to exercise disillusionment and his job supports it but the thing about him is he has a low viewpoint on humanity in general probably due to the encounter of one scam artist too many in his profession. This fallible almost could make him unlikeable but what makes him likable at least to me is he always has a sense of humor he's not afraid to satires on himself this almost gives us a small sense of hope that he will be capable of doing what he should to combat evil. But as I've said he's an unreliable protagonist I like at times how you question this character's sanity because there are time it seems like he could be losing it like when he cut the covers of the paperback copies of Sutter Kane. And just the simple fact these are forces that are forces beyond his control and understanding. The antagonist Sutter Kane is also great despite not being in the film that long he just has this presence where on the outside he seems like an ordinary guy like most authors are but you sense there is something supernatural about him after all everything he's written has came true.I love the unsettling feeling it gives you once again John's trademark feeling of isolation doom and dread which help successfully add to the feeling that the world could be ending. From all the weird crap that happens in the film you just aren't sure of anything. The special effects from K and B are great I even like the town setting which are reminiscent of the Silent Hill video game series since it always takes place in a town with supernatural activity. We see some Chtulu like creatures some street gang that look all messed up and one scene that always gave me the creeps was the infamous boy on a bike scene it was creepy because it underlined the inescapable truth that we were young once but growing old. And my favorite set piece is the Black Chirch which is the spookiest church I've ever seen with it's inverted crosses and that mural one look at it gave me the creeps. There is just so much going on in the film that it would require more than one watch to see it all. It's the philosophical conundrum of the giant floating turtle all over again only in a really twisted sense in that story it was about how our world was really the back of a giant floating turtle in this film it's on the possibility our world is really a story written by a writer. And of course the music as usual is great I love the theme song it's just so cool it's one of my favorite movie themes ever.The film really gets at our perception of reality are we really in reality or could we truly be characters from a book after all as a saying goes life is a story. As well as something dark that is if we really have it in us to save humanity as a whole. The task to finding a book has became a cause to save humankind but the thing is Trent is good at dealing with only the practical problems in his profession which is pulling the curtain of fraud from fraud here it's different because the problem is supernatural which are forces beyond his understanding which makes Trent powerless despite Trent's efforts at trying to save humanity we discover they prove fruitless.In the Mouth of Madness is a roller coaster ride into the heart and soul of darkness that you wouldn't mind riding again and read some good books.Rating 4 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "With such classics as Halloween Assault on Precinct 13 They Live and so many more under his belt Carpenter created his best film to date in 1995.

	schema:reviewBody "I think that this movie is the best and most faithful to the works of the late cosmic horror author H.P. Lovecraft not just in the appearance of the monsters and the plot ideas but in the idea that we are all so small and insignificant to the horrible things that we have no knowledge of. There are a few flaws in it but I don't let them get in the way of a great movie.The movie begins with John Trent Sam Neill being dragged into an insane asylum in a straitjacket trying to tell the orderlies that he's not insane. He is visited by Dr. Wren David Warner who is trying to help get him out of there. When asked how he got to the hospital Trent tells him about his job as a freelance insurance investigator and that it all started with the disappearance of Sutter Cane Jrgen Prochnow. At the diner Robbie Bernie Casey who runs the insurance company Trent worked at is at a diner trying to convince him to start working for him and tells him that there's a claim that Sutter Cane is missing that cost millions. Suddenly an axewielding maniac smashes the diner window and asks Trent Do you read Sutter Cane? before he's shot to death by police. Later Trent is told by Linda Styles Julie Carmen that Cane's books have a mentally scarring effect on his less stable readers. He discovers a couple nights later that Hobb's End the town from many of Cane's novels is real and starts to see the nightmarish truth behind the strange behavior of his readers ... and his own existence.Really creepy movie that deserves to have others similar to it and a great homage to one of my favorite horror authors. My only complaint is Julie Carmen. I don't remember much about her in Fright Night Part II but her acting in this movie was really bad. Still it doesn't kill the movie and towards the end Trent says something that has haunted me for a long time Every species can smell its own extinction. The last ones left won't have a pretty time with it. In ten years the human race will just be a bedtime story for the children a myth. Nothing more. 1010 highly recommended for Lovecraft and horror fans".

There's really been no arguing that statement since Halloween and after you get a taste of his Apocalypse Trilogy it will be engraved forever in your unconscious. At first consideration a movie about a book seems like a retread and certainly illfated for the horror genre. Thankfully Carpenter binds the idea like a hardcover classic and shakes our preconceptions of the timeless film adaptation.Beware the hobby that eats. Benjamin FranklinHobbies that become obsessions often alienate us from the rest of society. Yet reading although when we are young is almost a magical escape from reality is more and more as we grow older and progress through schooling simply about unanimous interpretation and less about anonymous opinion. We can all of course hold our personal thoughts on an excerpt but even the Bible itself has been analyzed to the point that most passages are agreed upon by the majority of experts as to their meanings. Before you read to much further into this review try to empathize with the writer at this junction of expression. If a book has a theme and the theme is powerful enough to capture the reader for a certain amount of time wouldn't it be the author's integrity to attempt to change the reader's viewpoint after completion of a novel?The question posed by In The Mouth Of Madness the third and last installment in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy is what would happen if a book contained a theme and underlying message so strong that it not only changed the readers' lives but their entire perception of reality? Some may credit Wes Craven for laying out groundwork for this startling look at popular culture in New Nightmare but the major difference for In The Mouth Of Madness is the seriousness of the subject. There are plenty of people that cite films as being big inspirations in their lives but there is a much vaster populace that will directly relate themselves to a book whether religious fictional or historic. What if these people were to read a different type of book by an insane genius and took the inspiration in a slightly different way? It is after all the most handson experience to be in control of your own imagination.The story offered in the movie is very conceptdriven. A worldrenown novelist Sutter Cane played by Jurgen Prochnow of The Seventh Seal disappears off of the face of the planet right before the publication of his proclaimed last book in a series that has stormed the country with fanatic rage. It becomes the job of Sam Neill as John Trent an insurance investigator to decide where Sutter Cane has holed himself up and whether the whole fiasco is actually a publicity stunt. Julie Carmen as Linda Styles Cane's editor accompanies him in his search. Charlton Heston also has a cameo appearance as the executive of Cane's publishing company.To get off on the right foot Trent caves in and begins to read the Cane books. Immediately he realizes the potency of the writing and begins having nightmares. So when he convinces himself that the author has retreated to a town called Hobb's End located in New Hampshire we can't help but wonder whether he is already losing his mind. Hobb in ancient writing was a word used to refer to the devil and the town with the namesake is not found on any modern map.So Styles and Trent are in a sense signing away their souls. Hobb's End as it turns out is one of the most memorably creepy towns in movie history. Sutter Cane is pretty easy to find on the other hand once they arrive. Too bad nobody packed a Bible is all I can say. It turns out that Cane has already planned for their arrival leading Trent to become the skeptist and Styles to act more as a guide for the duo. Hobb's End is directly out of Cane's last novel and it definitely adds to the atmosphere when Trent is being read directions from it as if it were a travel guide.Well I've avoided spoiling many of the plot points and surprises in this film. This is one of the few horrors that I find myself watching again and again without losing understanding of the original foreboding ambiance or respect for the scenes where blood pressure raises. Loosely based on H.P. Lovecraft stories and with a lot of homage paid to Stephen King and many of the campy Bmovies that Carpenter grew up watching this film is indeed chilling and thoughtprovoking.A reality is just what we tell each other it is.In The Mouth Of Madness 1995 1010".

Some may credit Wes Craven for laying out groundwork for this startling look at popular culture in New Nightmare but the major difference for In The Mouth Of Madness is the seriousness of the subject. There are plenty of people that cite films as being big inspirations in their lives but there is a much vaster populace that will directly relate themselves to a book whether religious fictional or historic. What if these people were to read a different type of book by an insane genius and took the inspiration in a slightly different way? It is after all the most handson experience to be in control of your own imagination.The story offered in the movie is very conceptdriven. A worldrenown novelist Sutter Cane played by Jurgen Prochnow of The Seventh Seal disappears off of the face of the planet right before the publication of his proclaimed last book in a series that has stormed the country with fanatic rage. It becomes the job of Sam Neill as John Trent an insurance investigator to decide where Sutter Cane has holed himself up and whether the whole fiasco is actually a publicity stunt. Julie Carmen as Linda Styles Cane's editor accompanies him in his search. Charlton Heston also has a cameo appearance as the executive of Cane's publishing company.To get off on the right foot Trent caves in and begins to read the Cane books. Immediately he realizes the potency of the writing and begins having nightmares. So when he convinces himself that the author has retreated to a town called Hobb's End located in New Hampshire we can't help but wonder whether he is already losing his mind. Hobb in ancient writing was a word used to refer to the devil and the town with the namesake is not found on any modern map.So Styles and Trent are in a sense signing away their souls. Hobb's End as it turns out is one of the most memorably creepy towns in movie history. Sutter Cane is pretty easy to find on the other hand once they arrive. Too bad nobody packed a Bible is all I can say. It turns out that Cane has already planned for their arrival leading Trent to become the skeptist and Styles to act more as a guide for the duo. Hobb's End is directly out of Cane's last novel and it definitely adds to the atmosphere when Trent is being read directions from it as if it were a travel guide.Well I've avoided spoiling many of the plot points and surprises in this film. This is one of the few horrors that I find myself watching again and again without losing understanding of the original foreboding ambiance or respect for the scenes where blood pressure raises. Loosely based on H.P. Lovecraft stories and with a lot of homage paid to Stephen King and many of the campy Bmovies that Carpenter grew up watching this film is indeed chilling and thoughtprovoking.A reality is just what we tell each other it is.In The Mouth Of Madness 1995 1010";

He doesn't seem to care that the gorgeous Catherine Deneuve and her reallife sister Francoise Dorleac aren't really dancers or that even the real dancers are sometimes slightly out of sync  they simply carry on with their numbers through sheer star power and happy sangfroid.

Only Rochefort is about tragedies constantly being averted or diverted  if Umbrellas was drenched in a perpetual rain shower Rochefort is pure sun.Gene Kelly is also on hand to do a few cameos as Francoise's love interest  and his main dance is a charming quicktime take on what he used to do on a much broader canvas.  George Chakiris is as we remember from West Side Story a charming dynamo Danielle Darrieux is her usual sublime self and keep an eye out for a young Michel Piccoli as the ardent Monsieur Dam. Michel Legrand's score again as usual relies a bit too heavily on its big theme  but it's also about as jazzily sophisticated as musical scores ever got.

It's not the same kind of operatic musical as it's predecessor and is much more a product of it's time and sadly that makes it much more inaccessible to modern audiences. What you get here is a romantic farce in the old MGM tradition with lot's of garish 60'sstyle color and costumes definitely in tune to Michel Legrand's astounding jazz score.  The campy outdoor dance numbers date but thankfully give way to dynamically orchestrated instrumental versions of Legrand's music.  This is definitely a movie for those who enjoy cinematic musical comedy it's visual appeal is undeniable and each shot is lovingly designed and framed.  Deneuve and Dorleac are amazing beauties and presented in their prime which is reason enough to enjoy the picture.  Michel Legrand's score is far more complex melodically and orchestrally than his more famous one for UMBRELLAS it's a joy to listen to.  About the best compliment I can pay THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT is to say that it brilliantly precedes and shines with more talent and energy than the recently released MOULIN ROUGE a film that surprisingly has a lot in common with it.  Demy doesn't need any CGI MTVediting or pop songs to get it's simple lovely message across!  It's very nice indeed to have a restored version on DVD of Jacques Demy's LES DESMOISELLES DE ROCHEFORT!".

It's clear from Frame 1 that this is a film to which you either have to surrender as the credits roll or squirm in embarrassment for the next two hours. Demy's 'fairytale' is as unashamedly full of coincidences as any Shakespeare comedy even to the extent of employing one set of twins albeit nonidentical but played by reallife sisters Catherine Deneuve and Francois Dorleac. If you're going to stop and wonder why the streets are always available for dancing in  i.e. trafficfree  or why Danielle Darrieux runs a cafebar which is little more than a counter a glass roof and no substantial walls then you're in the wrong movie. Demy loved chocolatebox movies and he complemented them with chocolatebox music from Michel Legrand  I was pleasantly surprised to realize that I already knew the main love them via its English lyric by Alan and Marilyn Bergman You Must Believe In Spring recorded definitively by Marlene VerPlanck  and the score on the whole is lush without being memorable and ranging from fifties type small combo jazz to allout string ensembles and if everyone  including Gene Kelly  except Danielle Darrieux is dubbed so what. Jacques Perrin is also on hand as a lovesick sailor what else and after seeing him play more or less the same role narrator in both Cinema Paradiso and Les Choristes the effect is like seeing a photograph of a friend acquired in middle age when he was a young man. Definitely worth a second viewing and who knows I may even go so far as to buy the DVD.".

Demy loved chocolatebox movies and he complemented them with chocolatebox music from Michel Legrand  I was pleasantly surprised to realize that I already knew the main love them via its English lyric by Alan and Marilyn Bergman You Must Believe In Spring recorded definitively by Marlene VerPlanck  and the score on the whole is lush without being memorable and ranging from fifties type small combo jazz to allout string ensembles and if everyone  including Gene Kelly  except Danielle Darrieux is dubbed so what. Jacques Perrin is also on hand as a lovesick sailor what else and after seeing him play more or less the same role narrator in both Cinema Paradiso and Les Choristes the effect is like seeing a photograph of a friend acquired in middle age when he was a young man. Definitely worth a second viewing and who knows I may even go so far as to buy the DVD.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jacques Demy loved the American musical genre as seen already in some of the films that preceded this one most notably The Umbrellas of Cherbourg one of the best musical pictures of all times from France. Even with his magnificent Lola he inserted music and dance in it. Mr. Demy followed his earlier success with Les Demoiselles de Rochefort. Unfortunately French audiences didn't like this new musical at all which was a shame. But the public can be fickle and perhaps the story didn't hold the public's attention in the new film. In 1996 Jacques Demy's widow the talented Agnes Varda a director on her own right lovingly restored this movie and the public responded to it the way they should have done thirty years before.The film was Jacques Demy's way to pay tribute to American musicals especially the glossy pictures produced by MGM in its heyday. He even got the valuable cooperation of Gene Kelly a man who felt at home in France and who is an asset in the film in an inspired appearance. The film consolidated the cooperation between Demy and Michel Legrand his invaluable collaborator. Mr. Legrand's music is tuneful as it advances the action in the film.The plot is simple and yet the viewer is won over by the characters in the story. There is a feeling of love throughout the film and of hope. The twin sisters and their ambitions are at the center of the story. Also their mother who had loved and lost finds happiness at last with the man she longed for.The cast is impeccable. A young Catherine Deneuve is a pleasure to watch. Her real life sister Francoise Dorlac a beautiful actress who died much too young is another great asset in the film. The wonderful Danielle Darrieux plays the mother. Michel Piccoli is Monsieur Dame the owner of the music instrument shop who never stops loving Madame Yvonne the twin girls' mother. Gene Kelly makes a magnificent appearance he also contributed to the dancing numbers. George Chakiris and Grover Dale have some good moments. A young Jacques Perrin plays the sailor who is looking for his ideal woman.Jacques Demy made a film that while it will not please everyone is a feast for the eye. Agnes Varda also needs to be given credit for the great job she did in restoring her late husband's work.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there ever was a musical that could sweep me off my feet and love the world this would be it. Jacques Demy's THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT is the perfect musical  a kaleidoscopic venture into pastel and springlike colors energetic dancing and near nonstop singing all tied up in a plot that really isn't a plot as much as a continuous expression of longing. Beginning with the fantastic opening montage that introduces George Chakiris and Grover Dale two men involved in what seems to be a musical act that has come to town surrounded by a pitchperfect cast of sensual very Sixties dancers the camera then pans into the apartment of the two twin sisters Solange and Delphine Garnier. Both are making do as music and dance teachers but long for more... excitement experience and of course love. They're framed by other characters who get introduced one by one into the story and each of them have a secret love they share for someone who they may not even know as in the case of Maxence the sailor who has painted Delphine's portrait without ever having seen her.The great thing about THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT is how simple its story is and how utterly beautiful it looks. All of the characters are looking for their other half and all will in one way or another find themselves in that special someone's arms. Francoise Dorleac and Catherine Deneuve never looked more radiant together paired in matching outfits singing their anthemic introduction theme which has apparently become a favorite theme song in France. It's a shame that Dorleac died at the conclusion of filming this film she has a strong sensual presence that outshines her sister's wellknown and loved glacial sensuality. I wonder what kind of actress might she have become... but it's all speculation. Dorleac has actually more screen time than Deneuve and while her pairing with Gene Kelly may be a tad questionable she was barely 25 at the time he was thirty years her senior what a pairing it is. Both are perfectly matched both seem to be made for each other and Kelly never looked or danced better. Note how he seems to be winking at the camera as he almost flies into a reverie after bumping into Dorleac as if he were saying I still got it after all these years. And he's right... the perfect consummate dancer. Not one performance rings false in THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT. Danielle Darrieux's regal beauty enhances her characters sadness Michel Piccoli is genuinely affecting Chakiris and Dale are energetic and Deneuve seems completely at ease even in her relatively smaller part. Watch how she in her second number with Dorleac affectionately reaches out to her. It's a small yet perfect reaction to someone whom she would lose so soon.".

This is a definite must see from Maxence to Yvonne from Solange to Simon Dame you will get to know and learn to love the people of that little town of Rochefort... 910";

At first I thought it might be one of those really trippy depressing French movies I just love but it was way better. It was electrifying it was explosive it was tres psychedelique. I loved seeing George Chakiris playing a good guy in this. I'd never taken real notice of Catharine Deneuve before but I did after this. Her sister was so cute she almost looked Irish with the red hair and freckles. The music was outstanding I kept humming bits and pieces of it throughout the next few months while I searched for the soundtrack which I was blessed to have found on an old Philips label LP. The cover was a bit torn at the top but I didn't care. I had THIS music in my living room any time I wanted it. Can't wait to get the newly released CD. I hear the Twins song is in English and it may or may not be anticlimactic but I'll give it a whirl anyway. Most extra tracks don't turn out to be much. I wouldn't want to see the English version because of course the words wouldn't really have the same rhythm and not sung by the same people and all. No it's best to let sleeping dogs lie. I learned to deal with reading subtitles back in 1984 so this was no biggie for me. In fact I prefer subtitles.".

Then throw in the Hullabaloo dancers with even the males in gogo boots and be prepared to laugh. Which is appropriate because on one level Jacques Demy is gleefully and affectionately satirizing the movie musical tradition. What you are not prepared for is how after about 40 minutes you realize that you really like this thing.It is fast paced extremely original and very pretty ultimately its innate charm just wins you over. At the end you are shocked to find that this silly satire stands alone atop all of Demy's other films. His legacy of optimism beauty and unashamed sweetness.Catherine Deneuve who is usually the 180 degree antithesis of perky has to play a lively and fairly outthere young woman. It must have been quite a struggle for Demy to get this much animation from her but her unnatural performance adds to the already surreal feel of this film. I might have cut the scene where she puts something in the oven as it reminds you of that rabbit in Repulsion.What is interesting is that early in the story Demy has let you know how his characters will be paired off by the end then he uses a ships passing in the night device to build suspense as the viewer waits for the inevitable that never quite seems to happen. Ultimately everything falls into place and there is a charming resolution.My only complaint is that I thought Deneuve and Jacques Perrin's Maxence should have connected one scene earlier in the caf when he came back to get his seabag. This would have made a better montage when cutting between the DorleacKelly and LegrandDarrieux connections.The best scene is a great musical montage at the midway point of the film as the three waitingtobeconnected story lines are reflected by cuts between three different songs occurring simultaneously in different parts of the town with the tempo increasing with each cut.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an utter delight although I will agree with one commenter that the choreography itself is quite pedestrian. In fact neither of the divine sisters Deneuve and Dorleac can dance but it is wonderful to see them together it is heartbreaking also as if a document of the grief that Deneuve has always clearly suffered since their fondness for each other given the tragic event to come is one of the most bittersweet real things about the film.On the other hand...Chakiris and Grover Dale CAN definitely dance and they can make even the repetitive choreography work. They aren't brothers but there's one scene in which they sing of their rejection by girls which as it ends seems to indicate that they were probably not exactly hostile toward each other...and who can blame them? With the gorgeous sisters they are a mirroring beauty contest and Chakiris is stunningly hot here whether dancing or not. Their costumes were unashamedly and sublimely sexy with those funny neckties and when I first went to France in 1970 their were two brothers in Fontainebleau who dressed very much like thisand these are the only two times I ever saw such clothing with this touch of ballet to it. I definitely think they were imitating Chakiris and Dale just a couple of years later for a little provincial town not far from Paris is not too long...Even Gene Kelly who looks remarkably youthful and whose presence is as welcomeand slightly out of place in a very nice way as always wears white pants a pink shirt and a lavender jacketall of it a natural sensuality that almost evokes the 18th century.I will admit that the sadist's murder is not handled with any grace. Everyone reverts to cheer immediately after any mention of it and this is just silly. It should either have not even been part of the story or there should have been an appropriate gravity given it That shouldn't have been too difficult as it was such things as Maxence and Yvonne joking about 'immiNantes' immediately after talking about the newspaper report were idioticit takes the rococo attitude way too far and merely makes the charming Rochefort provincials seem unfeeling and cardboard. This is the film's one serious flaw which other mediocre aspects e.g. preposterous amounts of street dancing of the same lame sort and to no purpose are not since it just seems all rather goodhearted even though superfluous. Legrand's music is often like this pretty and serviceable just as it was in 'Parapluies' and later in 'Yentl.' I think one of the most magical things is the way all the lovers are finally matched up except for Delphine and Maxence. Maxence hitches a ride in the 'caravan' to Paris and we know that Perri and Deneuve will find each other there but in a film that has not relied too much on subtlety this ending up in the air with something implied however obviously is delicious and unexpected.".

The horrible aspects kept me from really watching every minute but the wonderful aspects made me try. This is a French musical that is almost all singing. The plot moves along barely and lacks the clarity of say a Fred Astaire musical or any other American affair and it doesn't have dance very often or very well done. But boy does it go from one song to another.The stylizing is terrificevery set is modern and clean inside and out on the streets of 1960s Paris. If you are a fan of Catherine Deneuve she's a bit inaccessible beneath the heavy wig and makeup and amidst all the singing. In fact there is nothing sincere going on here unless you can reach beneath the veneer of the music and its styleThat's the trick here adapting to this very very different way of telling a story. I don't think it's brilliant but it has elements that will appeal to people already comfortable with the vocabulary and the arch falseness of it all. Because actually deep down and very shallowly hidden is a heartrending story of two young woman wanting true love. Of course they are impossibly beautiful and the fact they are even marginally single is hilarious but such is a movie and a musical.You might recognize a song or two here but for the most part the musical aspects are vehicles for replacing normal dialog. What a cool idea...if only done with more verve and imagination. Even the filming for all its clean perfection is a bit dry at least compared to the muscular films of American 1950s Leonard Freed vintage. Furthermore the two sisters who are the leads are a bit stiff physically not natural dancers I guess and the entire movie including their parts is dubbed in later recordings and it sounds and looks a bit odd. The 1960s were a rough time for feature movies everywhere and this is struggling to create a paradigm that surpasses television and is rich and sparkling and perfect. The production values are high for sure. But be prepared. It's a stiff stilted narrative and the music is not overly memorable. Two large stakes driven into a somewhat stiff corpus. There's even a dance with a supposed basketball dance troupe. Oy.You know what? I think if you've gotten this far watch the first ten minutes. You'll either barf or fall asleep or be really curious. It's a fair sample of the remaining two hours. Good luck!".

	schema:reviewBody "Three years after his gracefully audacious film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg filmmaker Jacques Demy made a followup of even broader scope a pastelcolored Gallic pastiche of Hollywood musicals. While the format of Cherbourg is a series of bold recitatives that build on the emotionalism of the simple love story at the movie's core Rochefort is a more standard musical within an elaborate tableau of activity set in the seaside town of Rochefort. The featherweight plot centers on beautiful twin sisters both with a passion for music and romance and what happens to them when a variety troupe sweeps into town one weekend.Demy fills the 1967 movie with so many references and tributes to Hollywood musical classics that it all feels overstuffed and overlong with our attention darting constantly among a gallery of superficial characters in various predicaments of lessthanearthshaking consequence. This would all be more acceptable if the musical sequences could transcend the paperthin storyline. It is in this area that Demy provides a decidedly mixed bag of pleasure and contrivance. Norman Maen's ensemble choreography seems to mimic Jerome Robbins' acrobatic style quite a bit obviously a conscious nod to the presence of George Chakiris as one of the main characters. However the numbers look and feel less like West Side Story and unfortunately more like a sixtiesera TV variety show. Michel Legrand who wrote the music for Cherbourg composes a light jazz score here that is catchy but more transient in nature. There are no memorable set pieces like I Will Wait for You or Watch What Happens here but rather a series of pop tunes with inane lyrics that motor the story along like a sputtering Vespa.Catherine Deneuve and her reallife sister Francoise Dorleac who died tragically in a car accident right after completing this movie play the twins Delphine and Solange Garnier with aplomb. They have a relaxed air with each other that gives the film its one element of realism. Their opening song The Twins Song provides a charmingly silly introduction as they perform to the camera in matching outfits. Running a glassencased caf in the town square their mother Yvonne is played by French screen legend Danielle Darrieux the only one who actually sings her own songs in the film. Chakiris and Grover Dale dance with skillful dexterity as the girlchasing carnies Etienne and Bill though as both are Americans their voices are obviously dubbed.Dubbing is a less intrusive ploy with Chakiris and Dale than having Gene Kelly lipsync to someone else's voice which Demy does here in recruiting the screen legend to play Andy Miller an American composer who comes to visit an old schoolmate in town. Looking fit and youthful for 55 and dancing like he never left the MGM lot Kelly provides a wonderful albeit brief spark to the film and one instantly recalls An American in Paris and On the Town as he dances so lithely on the streets. However it's jarring to hear someone else's voice come out of his face regardless of the language barrier. Having Andy fall in love with the thirty yearsyounger Solange is also a bit of a stretch but it provides a nice excuse for Kelly and Dorleac to have a graceful valedictory pasdedeux in the music shop.Although musical numbers are plentiful there are dialogue scenes that slow the movie down considerably and the musical chairs aspect  which includes an artistic sailor Jacques Perrin a volatile gallery owner Jacques Riberolles and Andy's modest friend Guillaume Michel Piccoli  gets exhausting to track. There is even a pointless subplot about an axe murderer. Still the movie has certain charms that will draw a specific audience inclined toward this genre. Ghislain Cloquet's colorful cinematography has been vividly captured in the 1998 restoration which is what the 2002 DVD contains though the outdoor shots sometimes bleaches out the intended colors. Other than a few trailers there are no other extras with the DVD package.".

It was a huge hit and he tried to do it all over again with this movie. Sadly he didn't come close.It's a story about some carnival that visits the French town of Rochefort. It involves the carnival dancers two identical twin sisters a son of one of them and various other uninteresting people. It's mostly about their finding love and happiness...or something. Seriously I was so bored I began to lose interest.OKthis LOOKS great. It has bright beautiful colors there's some really incredible dancing in this and everybody can sing actually lip sync very well. The problem is the stories aren't very interesting. They're annoyingly predictable and full of characters who have no emotional depth whatsoever. They're always singing and smiling and dancingalways! In Umbrellas you got to know and care about the charactershere you could care less. Also all the songs sound the sameit's gets monotonous quick. There are WAY too many songs tooI must have counted at least eight in the first half hour. Every time they come on the story comes to a screeching halt and we have to sit through another musical number.Acting you can't really judge since nobody is actually playing a characterbut Catherine Deneuve is surprisingly dull and George Chakiris smiles nonstop. Gene Kelly hams it up unmercifully in a small role.I love musicals but this one goes on forever it runs about 125 minutes and has way too many songs. If they had cut down on them the movie would have been considerably shorter and perhaps better. But as it stands I can only give it a 5.This remains an unknown movie despite Umbrellas successful reissue. There's a reason for that.".

	schema:headline " Early Brando Classic Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1950 film had a triple threat in bringing it to the screen.  There was Stanley Kramer producing Carl Foreman writing and Fred Zinneman directing. Mr. Zinneman also distinguished himself as a director with the likes of FROM HERE TO ETERNITY THE SEARCH MAN FOR ALL SEASONS and THE NUN'S STORY.  The film is also under the title of BATTLE STRIPE.It marked the introduction of Marlon Brando to the movie goers fresh from his Broadway success as Stanley Kolowski in STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE which he also brought to film.  And what a debut this dynamic actor made in the world of film and acting.  It was the time of James Dean Montgomery Clift and Brando.  Brando plays a war veteran paralyzed in combat facing the torturous ordeal of rehabilitation as a paraplegic.  He is thorough and totally convincing in the role.  Playing his fiance and eventually his wife is the lovely Theresa Wright in another heartwarming performance that is expected of her.  She works well with Brando which I'm sure was no easy task.In supporting roles outstanding were Jack Webb and Richard Erdman as fellow veterans.  Webb was excellent and far from his DRAGNET persona. I also liked Everett Sloan as the doctor who had to deal with watching the men face the reality of the world as it was.

	onyx:emotionText "This 1950 film had a triple threat in bringing it to the screen.  There was Stanley Kramer producing Carl Foreman writing and Fred Zinneman directing. Mr. Zinneman also distinguished himself as a director with the likes of FROM HERE TO ETERNITY THE SEARCH MAN FOR ALL SEASONS and THE NUN'S STORY.  The film is also under the title of BATTLE STRIPE.It marked the introduction of Marlon Brando to the movie goers fresh from his Broadway success as Stanley Kolowski in STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE which he also brought to film.  And what a debut this dynamic actor made in the world of film and acting.  It was the time of James Dean Montgomery Clift and Brando.  Brando plays a war veteran paralyzed in combat facing the torturous ordeal of rehabilitation as a paraplegic.  He is thorough and totally convincing in the role.  Playing his fiance and eventually his wife is the lovely Theresa Wright in another heartwarming performance that is expected of her.  She works well with Brando which I'm sure was no easy task.In supporting roles outstanding were Jack Webb and Richard Erdman as fellow veterans.  Webb was excellent and far from his DRAGNET persona. I also liked Everett Sloan as the doctor who had to deal with watching the men face the reality of the world as it was.  Arthur Jurado plays a young veteran that works hard to bring himself back to normalacy whatever that is.

The Men also came out at around the same time as Warner Brothers Bright Victory about blind veterans and their adjustment to society.The Men did not have the strong support of a major studio but it had Marlon Brando who was winning raves at this time for his portrayal of Stanley Kowalski in Streetcar Named Desire. Many a time Broadway stars before and since did not recreate their career roles on film because Hollywood wanted box office insurance. Stanley Kramer's independently produced film risked no money for a major studio and proved Marlon Brando could both be a screen presence and a box office draw. So Brando and the entire Broadway cast with the exception of Jessica Tandy got to preserve A Streetcar Named Desire as it was first seen on stage on the strength of his good notices for The Men.Brando dominates the film with combination of charm and bitterness not too many other actors could achieve. He's condemned to a wheelchair not sure what if any of the functions of his lower body he will be able to use and control. His bitterness nearly drives away Teresa Wright who loves him in spite of all.Look for good performances by Howard St. John and Dorothy Tree as Wright's parents Everett Sloane as the doctor treating spinal cord injuries like Brando's and Richard Erdman as Brando's horse playing veteran friend. You might remember Erdman from Stalag 17 as barracks chief Hoffman. He's just as good here in The Men.The wars change but the injuries to life and limb to our armed services remain the same as do the problems therein. In that sense The Men is a timeless classic and the debut of a legend.".

Reviewers like Renee should realize that there was NO measure of handicapped public awareness in 1949. People would whisper stare and step away from people in wheelchairs. Hand controls for cars ramps  wide doors for wheelchairs in public restraurants homes and hospitals were still quite new. I know I was there at my dad's side for many many years. The point of the film was the interest about people overcoming obstacles. The cast was believeable and very outstanding. I find this film to be a very enjoyable memory into seeing again my dad with all his wheelchair friends that I grew to know. My dad and many of the veterans in this film started the Paralyzed Veterans Association or PVA. This organization is still helping needy veterans. My dad lived a very full life. While there are less and less of these The Men still alive their courage and this film's insiteful positive message is worth expressing today. This is an interesting character driven film hurrah! This film or it's cast should NOT be compared or confused with the politically radical biography film Born of the Fourth of July. They are a study in opposites.

	schema:reviewBody "The Men 1950Well you do have to see a movie like this partly to see Marlon Brando before his stellar rise to fame ultrafame in On the Waterfront 1954 and Streetcar Named Desire the next year 1951. This is his first role and he's already the famous complex simultaneously macho and tender Brando. He plays Ken and he is bedridden because he can't walk.Around him are a host of actors amateur and professional who are all unable to walk probably permanently from war injuries. This is a story of adjusting to being in a wheelchair getting others to accept you like this and ultimately getting to accept it yourself. It's an emotional more than a physical battle and a powerful one.The doctor in charge is in some ways the main character or the most present throughout and he's strong if somewhat uncomplicated in his portrayal of a devoted tireless medical worker. He's played by Everett Sloan who has just come off a bizarre but terrific role as a rich lawyer with difficulty walking in Lady from Shanghai a Welles movieand Welles gave Sloan his entrance into Hollywood in Citizen Kane.The woman who is both lovingly sympathetic and also scared in her uncertainty as Ken's girlfriend and wife. She's kind of perfect turning into that somewhat disconnected 1950s housewife before our eyes influenced surely by her officious if kindly parents a kind of 1930s Republican do good but also look out for yourself first attitude. It's a perfect fit set up by the screenwriter and worked by with surprising believability by the young director Fred Zinnemann From Here to Eternity with Stanley Kramer producing. These two men were among the most socially conscious in a postwar Hollywood that had many directors trying to make a difference in their films Kazan and Lumet would be two others. And The Men is certainly about showing a problem with realism and optimism at the same time. It's a kind of parallel to the film noir films which made dramatic fictions out of many returning servicemen. This was closer to the reality for many.Is it a great film? For some small reasons no as much as Brando is convincing in his role. For one thing it's just too clear what the motivation of the director and producer is so the movie movies forward without clear dramatic tension even though you don't quite know the outcome. For another the acting is generally very good without being wrenching and the subject is frankly wrenching. It feels a little like we're being given a lesson a good lesson but still a bit like schoolwork made vivid on the screen. This will be apparently right from the first scene where a room full of wives and girlfriends ask questions frank and important questions of the doctor who wisely and frankly answers them.Good stuff great stuff and as a film experience incomplete stuff.".

It's a perfect fit set up by the screenwriter and worked by with surprising believability by the young director Fred Zinnemann From Here to Eternity with Stanley Kramer producing. These two men were among the most socially conscious in a postwar Hollywood that had many directors trying to make a difference in their films Kazan and Lumet would be two others. And The Men is certainly about showing a problem with realism and optimism at the same time. It's a kind of parallel to the film noir films which made dramatic fictions out of many returning servicemen. This was closer to the reality for many.Is it a great film? For some small reasons no as much as Brando is convincing in his role. For one thing it's just too clear what the motivation of the director and producer is so the movie movies forward without clear dramatic tension even though you don't quite know the outcome. For another the acting is generally very good without being wrenching and the subject is frankly wrenching. It feels a little like we're being given a lesson a good lesson but still a bit like schoolwork made vivid on the screen. This will be apparently right from the first scene where a room full of wives and girlfriends ask questions frank and important questions of the doctor who wisely and frankly answers them.Good stuff great stuff and as a film experience incomplete stuff.";

It's not a feelgood movie but one that gives valuable insight into the challenges faced by many men returning from war.

I really thought these were excellent casting decisions as big name actors would have made the film seem more polished and Hollywoodized. Sure we all are familiar with Brando now but at the time he was a newcomerand a good representation of an average guy.Because the film involves paralyzed veterans and takes place mostly at a VA hospital with actual paralyzed vets playing the nonstarring roles the film is very realistic and will most likely elicit a few tears.

It's also worth noting that yes attitudes in the fifties were a lot different on many of the social issues that we don't even think about today.The drama is in the fact that people had to DEAL with them within the context of the times. To me one of the values of The Men is that it addresses an issue that most people at the time just wanted to sweep under the carpet. I think it probably helped a lot of vets at the time validate their experiences. Sadly it also foreshadowed the horrific inundation of parapleigics and quadrapleigics we were to experience during the Vietnam era. So it's a fifties movie and we should expect it some overacting and moralizing. Still it was a valuable contribution at the time and Brando's performance is still worth watching perhaps moreso if you have any experience with these patients. Renee needs to get a life.".

The only problem with this movie is that except for Marlon Brando's and Teresa Wright's characters the other characters are somewhat cartoonish acting which in this case is the fault of the writers. In the scenes between Brando and Wright the movie is very realistic and intriguing but with the other characters especially the other paralyzed veterans the movie seems to take the form of a stage play in which every character is a witty smartaleck. This is really a shame considering that all of the supporting players especially Jack Webb and Everett Sloane were at least as talented as the marblemouthed Brando. That said the movie is still pretty satisfying and entertaining. Star Trek fans look out DeForest Kelley has a very small role in this movie as one of the doctors who follow Sloane around early in the movie when he checks out all the patients.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the film that boosted Marlon Brando's career  his first screen role as a paraplegic war veteran who refuses to come to terms with his condition. Brando plays it out as well as one might expect he shows his emotions more often than he says them and even when he does say out loud what he is feeling it is the tone of his voice rather than his words that convey what his character feels. Brando's performance is even more commendable when what he is working with is considered. The film's screenplay is not really great. Too much is explained to us by the characters talking such as Sloane's lecture to the family members. The film has the atmosphere of a propaganda piece  the dialogue is generally hammy with wooden delivery from the supporting actors and the style of having everything literal rather than subtle is very typical of wartime propaganda. There is a distance therefore to the film however Brando does manage to overcome it and still bring in some sense of realism.It is a melodramatic film and probably too melodramatic to be really effective. The style of acting by the supporting cast  which for lack of a better word can be described as unsubtle  really doesn't suit the film. The music score does not help much either nor does the lighting design in which darkness often surrounds one or two aspects of the frame which are shot to stand out with bright white light. Zinnemann does not do a fantastic job directing but that said the opening sequence to the film is excellent  the camera pans across to see Brando who then signals and rises out of frame behind him other men approach that before could not be seen... right up to the point when Brando is shot in a surprise attack. Zinnemann's style is evidently noir based with a lot of shadows and the beginning narration by Brando is exactly the type one expects in noir. And there are good camera angles too. It is an adequately directed film but not masterful in that regard. Overall it is certainly a worthwhile film. While the script might be wooden at times it does address a lot of issues well particularly the struggle to keep one's manhood plus Brando's excellent performance is certainly worth seeing.".

The supporting cast is good too I enjoyed seeing Sloane in this I had only seen him in Citizen Kane. It's not one of those sugarysweet movies it has a realistic plot so be prepared if you're lucky enough to catch this one on TV.";

The main topic of the film is paraplegia and the effects that has on the sufferer and his relationships not only of the main character Ken Brando but also on the other veterans in the ward. The film is obviously going to feel outdated there is nothing that can be done about that yet the themes running throughout the film are still relevant. This film isn't trying to setup the disabled as having no place in society or that love will never happen for them it is exploring the feelings encountered by all involved. The main theme is how suffering from paraplegia causes the sufferer to feel inadequate  feeling like less of a man  the loss of masculinity is paramount to the film. Whilst not exactly a melodrama this film can be placed into that category for many reasons such as the use of music throughout the film and the very convenient 'forced closure' ending...which if anybody believes then more fool them. Brando is very watchable in this film and apart from a couple of questionable casting decisions the rest of the cast are perfectly adequate in their roles.".

Although its focus is on these men their struggles with their condition and their attempts to accomodate some sort of normality the film  manages to make some wider points puncturing the military triumphalism still prevalent in the US exposing the hypocrisies and intolerance of society and especially the family questioning the assumptions of a science that would take the place of religion we are first introduced to the doctor giving a lecture on paraplegia in the hospital chapel.'The Men' would have us believe that it is a realistic work because it deals in a straightforward downbeat fashion with a difficult theme simply denied by the artifice of mainstream Hollywood.  We are told firmly and early on that there will be no miracle cure for these men we will therefore be denied any sugary uplift at the end any reconciliation being provisional and fraught.  The cast is lowkey and characteractordriven this was Marlon Brando's first movie role and he is frequently subordinated in screen time to the group dynamic of the veterans in the hospital.  There will be as much tough talking strong language and violence as the censors will allow.So 'The Men' has its heart in the right place.  The road to cinematic hell is paved with good intentions.  'The Men' is a prime example of the cinema of Stanley Kramer where narrative and entertainment is sacrificed in favour of didactic preaching.  The film begins with a nightmare war sequence borrowedinfluencedpilfered byfrom King Vidor's harrowing 'The Big Parade' as a platoon of soldiers slowly populate an eerily empty desertscape.  There is no natural sound just ominous martial music and stylised movements.  After this moderate inventiveness and the shooting that prompts the narrative proper we go into voiceover as Ken Wilozek Brando gives vent to his selfpityingly bleak feelings about his paraplegia.  If this suggests a demoting of the visual in favour of the verbal at least we're getting the experience from the victim's own viewpoint.  But no.  The filmmakers don't trust us enough to empathise and understand and so we're given a cinematically inert lecture and questionandanswer session from Dr. Brock explaining the tenets and consequences of paraplegia. The audience is not being asked to share a traumatic experience but is being given a stern lecture about a pertinent issue of the day.  You could argue that this scene functions like the end of 'Psycho' where the inane psychobabble is satirised but there is no such distance here  the doctor is clearly a good man behind his gruff exterior trying to do his best for these men without giving them any false hopes.  As the film continues so does the lesson with facts examples statistics experiments dutifully expounded.One of the men says he feels like a freak.  And this is the way the film presents the men.  Their plight is presented from the outside to the outside an explanation of something unusual to a 'normal' audience.  The few attempts at expressionism only serve to make men seem ridiculous such as the intrusive Rachmaninoff pastiche during Ken and Ellen's reunion or the preposterous Wagnerian blast that greets Ken's first effort to move.Brando does his best but his eruptions of violence here should be compared to his seminal performance in the next year's 'Streetcar named desire'.  In that film violence was an inevitable product of a fully worked out character here it is forced by violent music and horrorfilm style into something grotesque Boris Karlofflike the horror genre's obsession with the body taken out of context turning realism into kitsch 'The Men' is in any case impossible to take seriously if you've seen Brando's wonderful parody of his performance here in 'Bedtime Story'.  Zinnemann's camera rarely moves  movement arises from montage from editing different camera angles between two overcomposed shots.  This has none of the dynamics of Eisenstein resulting in a static aesthetic perfect for the film's intellectual reach.".

Which is really a disappointment because they don't know what they're missing!Think of every poem you've read about the sea and man's relation to it and you might get a clue as to the depths of feeling that this film has.  It's like Hemingway Pablo Neruda and W.B. Yeats all rolled into one.  It's extremely simplistic just shots of how a small family fishes hauls seaweed for fertilizer there is no soil on the island and dodges waves so high that its foam sprays above the clifftops. Not to mention an incredible sequence where five fishermen try to catch and kill a shark that is a good deal larger than their boat!What's most exhilarating about this film is that while you're watching it you can't help but think that these people are crazy to choose to live in such a desolate and difficult place but then you try to imagine them elsewhere and you know that they are as much a part of that environment as the stubborn seaworn cliffs are.  After even thirty minutes of the film the roar of the ocean and the cries of the gulls fill your head to such an extreme that you know that such people could live no where else.  This film is reminiscent of Roberto Rossellini's film Stromboli about the inhabitants of a small village on a volcanic island.  There are a few brief pockets of sentimentality due to the score but the filmmakers thankfully left out the music during all of the film's most important scenes. Overall what you have is an incredible cinematic experience that makes you think and imagine what it would be like to live a life where every day is a struggle with the elements of nature and a fight for survival yet filled with the deepest awe and respect for nature and for living.".

The minimalist story really isn't much just an attempt to provide some excuse for various actions in the film. This film is really not a documentary at all.  One of the special features on the DVD is a short film called Making the Myth or something like that which is all about how the film was made how Flaherty scripted various scenes etc.  As noted in the a previous review the entire shark scene was something Flaherty pushed recognizing that shark hunting sells.  However according to Making the Myth basking shark hunting had gone out over 50 years earlier.  Apparently Flaherty also thought that if he got people hunting the sharks for his move they might start it up again as a local industry. We found a good portion of the dialogue almost unintelligible.  Especially at the start we thought they we speaking Gaelic!  Still the dialogue is really unnecessary.  Flaherty uses old fashioned dialogue cards like in a silent film to explain what's coming up.     Overall this was a very interesting film to watch.  Since it's just over an hour long it's a good one to see when you have some time but don't want to commit to any Major Movie Event!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is beautifully filmed with some real highlights. The seas off the Aran Islands on the west coast of Ireland can be awesomely stormy and you will probably never see more impressive footage of such as in this film. There is a fantastic sequence of a twoday battle to catch a Basking Shark and the final scenes of three fishermen in a currach on the stormy sea trying to make it to shore are hairraising. The many shots of spectacular cloud formations over slivers of land are enough to make an Ansel Adams envious.The theme of man fighting the elements in a harsh environment just to survive is hit pretty hard. The family depicted is indeed living a primitive existence. They carry seaweed in baskets on their backs up steep cliffs to compost for soil to plant their potatoes they patch their canvashulled currachs with rags and tar they spear sharks for meat and oil.By watching the extras on the DVD you learn that Man of Aran is actually a historical reenactment of what things might have been like in a bygone era  and a highly romanticized reenactment at that. By the time Man of Aran was made 1934 the people on the Aran Islands had not hunted sharks for decades the seaweed was carried on mules there were welltodo islanders who owned large acreages of fertile soil cattle were sent to market by forcing them to swim to ships anchored hundreds of yards off shore. And director Flaherty processed all of his film on the island so things could not have been all that primitive. I can think that this movie influenced subsequent work. In The Field a key plot element is having Richard Harris do backbreaking seaweed hauls up steep cliffs and Bergman's famous black figures silhouetted against the sky in The Seventh Seal are derivative of similar images in Man of Aran.I felt duped by this being called a documentary but be that as it may I found Man of Aran well worth watching for what it is.".

They carry seaweed in baskets on their backs up steep cliffs to compost for soil to plant their potatoes they patch their canvashulled currachs with rags and tar they spear sharks for meat and oil.By watching the extras on the DVD you learn that Man of Aran is actually a historical reenactment of what things might have been like in a bygone era  and a highly romanticized reenactment at that. By the time Man of Aran was made 1934 the people on the Aran Islands had not hunted sharks for decades the seaweed was carried on mules there were welltodo islanders who owned large acreages of fertile soil cattle were sent to market by forcing them to swim to ships anchored hundreds of yards off shore. And director Flaherty processed all of his film on the island so things could not have been all that primitive. I can think that this movie influenced subsequent work. In The Field a key plot element is having Richard Harris do backbreaking seaweed hauls up steep cliffs and Bergman's famous black figures silhouetted against the sky in The Seventh Seal are derivative of similar images in Man of Aran.I felt duped by this being called a documentary but be that as it may I found Man of Aran well worth watching for what it is.";

	schema:reviewBody "We had jounced across Galway bay in a 45 minute ferry ride boarded a pony trap for an hour's ride in a twowheeled carriage upholstered with leather and duct tape and driven by an ancient Irishman named Tom Flaherty whose first language was Gaelic. He deposited us at the Atlantic side of the island at a tiny museum for break.  My husband opted for the hike to the headland to view a crumbling 20th century fort while I browsed the museum. It was there that I spied a poster for Man of Aran  only 2.50 Euros per person.  It sounded vaguely interesting a way to pass time til the pony trap driver returned to take us bouncing back to the ferry boat landing.We climbed the steep stairs and were seated in a room overlooking the centuries old stone walls that crawl haphazardly over the rugged terrain. A large high definition television sat before us and we waited for the lady at the downstairs desk to come turn it on.  We were joined by four more people the blinds were drawn and the warbly scratchy sound track and grainy black and white documentary began. We were gripped immediately by the story  part adventure part documentary part drama. It was easy to believe the severe conditions the arduous back breaking work of gathering kelp fishing in the heaving surf rocky slippery shores having just witnessed them in person. A few of the scenes are a little fakey but we're talking 1934 here and if you'd ever seen that pounding surf at the foot of that towering cliff you'd know why they perhaps went Hollywood in the shark hunting scene. If you can't see it in its place of origin by all means make the effort to find a print.  This is a classic. By the way our driver Tom Flaherty would have been 12 years old when the film was made but the directorproducer Flaherty was an American from Hollywood and much distrusted by the natives. He had one heck of a time making the movie so the brochure at the desk informed us. In typical local resident style our driver had never seen the movie and did not claim to be related to the director.  He dropped us at the ferry and speaking endearing terms in Gaelic to Brownie his faithful cart horse urged her back up the path to the pub for his daily pint of Guinness.".

	schema:headline " hard life on an Irish island";
	schema:reviewBody "Robert Flaherty known as the Father of the Documentary made his directorial debut with this look at life on the island of Aran off the coast of Ireland. The people on the island spend their days digging through the rocks to get soil to grow crops and also hunting basking sharks.

I definitely recommend Man of Aran.The DVD includes an interview with Flaherty's widow Frances years after they made Man of Aran.

Flaherty wasn't a documentarian. He didn't purport to be a disinterested observer whatever that is. He staged his films this has never been in dispute and he never made any attempts to hide the fact.

What I find hard to grasp about this film is just how anyone could take such dramatic footage and create such a sadly tedious result out of it...In many ways this is a silent film but as a silent it is illserved by its too sparse intertitles and its apparently especially composed music which is used in talkiefashion as a bland wash of sound behind the images rather than responding in any way to what is on screen. The visuals ought to be full of tension and I felt that the homogeneous deployment of the music actually undermined what tension was there.Which was not much. The impression I got was that the director was trying to put in every frame that he had shot on location with the result that everything happens with extreme longueurs. Unfortunately very little of what we are seeing is explained which doesn't help. Eventually it is usually possible to work out what is happening but the approach is neither conducive to the interest of a documentary nor to the coherence of a narrative film.Considered as a talkie on the other hand the film makes poor use of dialogue  which is in practice largely incomprehensible and unhelpful when the characters' words can be made out it's clear why intertitles were felt to be necessary. I wasn't clear whether the characters are in fact speaking Gaelic most of the time as I had originally assumed or whether the recording quality is just so poor as to make it hard to understand their accented English.So far as narrative goes practically nothing actually seems to happen. I'm afraid I actually fell asleep in the middle of the film at some point after the interminable shots of the curragh hooking a basking shark in realtime were followed alas by an intertitle stating that the action was going to continue for a further two days..! but worryingly didn't appear to have missed anything when I woke the woman and boy were still gazing out from the cliffs the boat was still out on the waves and the only thing that had changed was the weather. Basically the curragh arrives at the start of the film there are some shots of soil gathering and starting the cultivation of a new field this was the most interesting and 'documentary' section of the whole picture where we were actually given enough information to learn something! and then the curragh and its crew set out again after a quite harmless basking shark which is almost as large as the boat. A storm. The boat is smashed after the crew abandon it on the stony beach  I'm afraid I chiefly hoped the filmmakers paid for the loss  The End.The rest is all endlessly arty shots of the waves smashing against the cliffs on Aran. Very little shown of the everyday life of the inhabitants no explanation of the fascinating history and unique handling qualities of the curraghs the last descendants as it happens of the Irish leatherskinned craft of the Middle Ages not enough human interest to arouse more than an abstract concern over the fate of the little family. The footage is spectacular and oh! what a film the BBC documentary section might have made out of it  what an incestuous thriller the silentera Hitchcock might have concocted around that scenery and those lives...Flaherty contrives the astonishing feat of making it both remarkably boring and oddly uninformative.".

	schema:reviewBody "When this movie was shot in 1966  the second unit took the different scenes located in France between Cannes Villefranche sur mer and Monte Carlo. I was then a young student in economics at the Nice University and my godfather was one of the top executives of Columbia pictures for Europe. I was at the time very interested in movies and wished to find a job in this sector so I asked Max Maxwell Setton see his profile in IMDb to get me an internship for the summer. That's how I was hired in August 1966 to work during the shooting of the movie besides Claude Ganz who was in charge being an executive from the French subsidiary. These have been some 3 or 4 four weeks of great fun I must say. During the shooting some problems or funny situations occurred which will perhaps amuse the reader.The scene of the hovercraft was shot in Juan les Pins of course there was no hovercraft and they only shot the scenery around it superimposing it later in the studios. But if my memory does not fail me with some guys of the unit we went that evening in one of the night clubs of the town le Vieux Colombier and had the chance to see for free the famous singer Jacques Brel. Matt Helm passes before it at minute 2627 of the movie with his car.The chase between the Mercedes and Matt Helm was shot on the small and steep and sinuous road which goes from Beausoleil on the coast after Monte Carlo and winds up to Eze Village where there is an ancient Roman archaeological site called La Turbie. During the shooting the stunt driver who drove the Mercedes lost control of the car while passing over gravel and smashed into the entrance of a villa! This was a big problem for two reasons one because the car if I remember well belonged to some citizen of Nice and was brand new two because we had a strict schedule and to repair it was posing a problem the unit succeeded to have the spare parts send by Mercedes by plane direct to Nice. 3 years before I was on the same road going down to reach the lower main road I had just got my driving license. While beginning to brake before reaching one of the steep turns I realized horrified that I had no more fluid in the breaks and the car was accelerating dangerously fortunately by pumping madly on the pedal I succeeded to regain the pressure and when we reached Nice had the circuits checked!A funny thing happened to me the day of the shooting on the private beach of the Carlton Hotel in Cannes. I was supposed to go to the bank to collect in cash the payroll for the extras and at the same time to bring with me 5 very beautiful girls who appear on the scene on the beach. This scene is shown to Matt in the car when his mission is explained to him at the beginning of the movie.I was 25 at the time had a very common car which could take only 4 passengers plus the driver.

	onyx:emotionText "When this movie was shot in 1966  the second unit took the different scenes located in France between Cannes Villefranche sur mer and Monte Carlo. I was then a young student in economics at the Nice University and my godfather was one of the top executives of Columbia pictures for Europe. I was at the time very interested in movies and wished to find a job in this sector so I asked Max Maxwell Setton see his profile in IMDb to get me an internship for the summer. That's how I was hired in August 1966 to work during the shooting of the movie besides Claude Ganz who was in charge being an executive from the French subsidiary. These have been some 3 or 4 four weeks of great fun I must say. During the shooting some problems or funny situations occurred which will perhaps amuse the reader.The scene of the hovercraft was shot in Juan les Pins of course there was no hovercraft and they only shot the scenery around it superimposing it later in the studios. But if my memory does not fail me with some guys of the unit we went that evening in one of the night clubs of the town le Vieux Colombier and had the chance to see for free the famous singer Jacques Brel. Matt Helm passes before it at minute 2627 of the movie with his car.The chase between the Mercedes and Matt Helm was shot on the small and steep and sinuous road which goes from Beausoleil on the coast after Monte Carlo and winds up to Eze Village where there is an ancient Roman archaeological site called La Turbie. During the shooting the stunt driver who drove the Mercedes lost control of the car while passing over gravel and smashed into the entrance of a villa! This was a big problem for two reasons one because the car if I remember well belonged to some citizen of Nice and was brand new two because we had a strict schedule and to repair it was posing a problem the unit succeeded to have the spare parts send by Mercedes by plane direct to Nice. 3 years before I was on the same road going down to reach the lower main road I had just got my driving license. While beginning to brake before reaching one of the steep turns I realized horrified that I had no more fluid in the breaks and the car was accelerating dangerously fortunately by pumping madly on the pedal I succeeded to regain the pressure and when we reached Nice had the circuits checked!A funny thing happened to me the day of the shooting on the private beach of the Carlton Hotel in Cannes. I was supposed to go to the bank to collect in cash the payroll for the extras and at the same time to bring with me 5 very beautiful girls who appear on the scene on the beach. This scene is shown to Matt in the car when his mission is explained to him at the beginning of the movie.I was 25 at the time had a very common car which could take only 4 passengers plus the driver. To carry 6 persons including me was breaking the law. When we were near the Cannes Croisette what I feared happened and I was arrested by a cop!

Buono was barely in the film and was almost 100 camp. Malden has a much bigger role and some surprisingly serious even cruel moments. Of course you could argue that The Silencers had the superior set of girls and it's true that Camilla Sparv doesn't have the exotic looks of Daliah Lavi or an equally active role. She does have great abs though. AnnMargret gives an energetic performance and proves to be a most helpful assistant to Matt Helm though their 20 years of age difference does make them kind of awkward as a romantic couple. She also has great abs. Overall an enjoyable film about on the level of a lesser James Bond adventure. 12 out of 4.".

	schema:reviewBody "Murderer's Row 19669 like all four of Deano's Matt Helmers is so bad it's good.It always appeared as though Dino never read the scripts beforehand never cared about the plots...just plain never cared. I guess that was part of his and the film's charm. But it must have driven his directors up the wall including Murderer's Row's Henry Levin.The sets are cheesy as hell as is the music by Lalo Schiffrin. But veteran costumer Moss Mabry's creations especially for the gals are terrific. Very hip very 1969  yet still very cool today.I am not really an AnnMargaret fan but she's really good here. And glamorous Swedish actress Camilla Sparv is stunning! Bad guy Karl Malden is appropriately sinister slightly amiable and yes bad. And his righthand man Tom Reese Sgt. Velie on one of the great TV series ever Ellery Queen has a cool chrome steel plate atop his head  nifty gimmick.Deano's four Matt Helm flicks made in between taping his TV show and partying between 196669 were all the Andre Champagne of spy flicks compared with Bond as the Dom Perignon.Why is it that I will ALWAYS watch them whenever they're on TV? I mean I'm drawn like a fly to youknowwhat. I can't resist them. I guess it's because they're a guilty pleasure. Cheesy but still a lot of really stupid fun.".

But it must have driven his directors up the wall including Murderer's Row's Henry Levin.The sets are cheesy as hell as is the music by Lalo Schiffrin. But veteran costumer Moss Mabry's creations especially for the gals are terrific. Very hip very 1969  yet still very cool today.I am not really an AnnMargaret fan but she's really good here. And glamorous Swedish actress Camilla Sparv is stunning! Bad guy Karl Malden is appropriately sinister slightly amiable and yes bad. And his righthand man Tom Reese Sgt. Velie on one of the great TV series ever Ellery Queen has a cool chrome steel plate atop his head  nifty gimmick.Deano's four Matt Helm flicks made in between taping his TV show and partying between 196669 were all the Andre Champagne of spy flicks compared with Bond as the Dom Perignon.Why is it that I will ALWAYS watch them whenever they're on TV? I mean I'm drawn like a fly to youknowwhat. I can't resist them. I guess it's because they're a guilty pleasure. Cheesy but still a lot of really stupid fun.";

'The Silencers' starring Dean Martin as agent 'Matt Helm' was one of 1966's biggest hits. The sequel  'Murderers' Row'  was planned for a Summer 1967 release but after delays on the Bond spoof 'Casino Royale' was rushed out early to be Columbia's big Christmas release.BIG O kidnaps the inventor of a deathray weapon known as a 'helio beam'. so I.C.E. fakes Matt Helm's death to convince them he is no longer a threat. Posing as a mobster called 'Jim Peters' our hero flies to the French Riviera where danger awaits. BIG O villain Julian Wall  Karl Malden  intends using the beam to destroy Washington D.C.As a comedy 'Murderers' Row' just about makes the grade but as an action movie it is poor. A car chase in the Riviera for example is spoilt not only by the lack of music but by the vehicles photographed through fisheye lenses as they go round corners. Herbert Baker's script uses little of the Donald Hamilton book going for cheap laughs at the expense of Dino's image as a boozer. It is a pity as the novel was one of the author's best.Dino's refusal to do location filming resulted in a plethora of standins and bad process shots. Bad S.F.X. too  a man falling off a cliff near the start is obviously a dummy even the explosions look fake. In the last film Matt had a gun that fires backwards here its a gun that has a delayed action. Ironhead  Tom Reese  Wall's henchman intended to be another Oddjob is wrongly used for slapstick purposes. Karl Malden acts like he's in a different film Camilla Sparv is woefully underused while AnnMargret is too young to be Matt's love interest  her disco scenes go on forever . The pop group 'Dino Desi  Billy' features in one scene. One of them was Dean Martin's son. Hi Dad! he calls out to Matt. I also suspect that some scenes were not filmed. For instance after leaving Susie's apartment Matt is suddenly in the clutches of BIG O. How did he get there? On the plus side Lalo Schrifrin's music is good  particularly the opening theme  and Sam Leavitt's lush photography nice. Some jokes work. When Matt is arrested he complains I'm an American citizen!. The chief of police  Marcel Hillaire  is not impressed We will play the Stars  Stripes when you are in the Electric Chair!. Matt replies Then I'd have to stand up!.Henry Levin the director also made the vastly superior spy spoof 'Kiss The Girls  Make Them Die'  1966  which starred Michael Connors Dorothy Provine and TerryThomas.Incidentally why would a picture of Frank Sinatra be so prominently displayed in a French discotheque?".

What can you say about a moviea spy thriller no lesswhose only attribute is that it might increase one's appreciation for the talents of Dino Desi and Billy the pop trio featuring star Dean Martin's now deceased son Dean Paul and the son of Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball that had some marginal success as recording artists in the mid60s?

That doesn't make it good but so little in Murderer's Row is that their warbling is the highlight.  As for ol' Dino many of his screen performances have been dismissed by critics as sleepwalking but most sleepwalkers probably couldn't light a cigarette or hold a glass of bourbon which Helm doesn't drink but that's a plot device not worth exploring here with the steadiness Martin displays throughout the Henry Levin directed film.  Martin is awake but only I fear to make sure he gets his paycheck. As for Levin's direction it consists of ensuring that Martin and his costars don't bump into each other.  They don't.  In fact you'd think they were all in different movies.  At least you'd prefer to think they are. Murderer's Row  I like that title but wonder if it refers to the producers who made this waste of film.  Everything about it reeks of a cynical disregard for everything but the cash register at the boxoffice. It rang all right loud enough for Matt Helm to ride again in two more movies but not even Dino could sing such a weary tune that long.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dean Martin's back for a second spin as Matt Helm in Murderers' Row. In this one Helm sets out to track down a missing scientist being held captive by the evil and hysterical Julian Wall Karl Malden  a man bent on world domination. His plan is to use the scientist's ray I can't remember what kind of ray but does it really matter? to destroy Washington D.C. Helping Helm is the scientist's swinging daughter Suzie AnnMargaret.Almost everything I wrote in my comment for The Silencers applies to Murderers' Row. The bit about the plot not mattering  even more so in this case. The notion of Dean Martin playing Dean Martin  again nothing could be truer. Dino surrounded by beautiful women  AnnMargaret is a knockout in Murderers' Row. The booze the jokes the gadgets etc.  it's all here. The best part is that once again it's all handled in a breezy easy manner that makes watching Murderers' Row a lot of fun. I don't know that I enjoyed it quite as much as The Silencers but I did find it entertaining.

	onyx:emotionText "Dean Martin's back for a second spin as Matt Helm in Murderers' Row. In this one Helm sets out to track down a missing scientist being held captive by the evil and hysterical Julian Wall Karl Malden  a man bent on world domination. His plan is to use the scientist's ray I can't remember what kind of ray but does it really matter? to destroy Washington D.C. Helping Helm is the scientist's swinging daughter Suzie AnnMargaret.Almost everything I wrote in my comment for The Silencers applies to Murderers' Row. The bit about the plot not mattering  even more so in this case. The notion of Dean Martin playing Dean Martin  again nothing could be truer. Dino surrounded by beautiful women  AnnMargaret is a knockout in Murderers' Row. The booze the jokes the gadgets etc.  it's all here. The best part is that once again it's all handled in a breezy easy manner that makes watching Murderers' Row a lot of fun. I don't know that I enjoyed it quite as much as The Silencers but I did find it entertaining. The best bits include watching Dino try to keep up with the overthetop dancing of AnnMargaret Karl Malden his performance as the villain is the one thing about Murderers' Row that is actually better than The Silencers AnnMargaret's groovy wardrobe and Helm's freeze and delayed firing guns.

	schema:reviewBody "Murderer's Row is one of those rare sequels that's actually better than it's predecessor. That's not saying much however as the predecessor is basically a softcore porn film minus the nudity. This movie is a step up in most ways having better direction a more coherent plot Which is to say it has a plot something the former film mostly lacked and more interesting locations and subject matter. Certainly it's a far more 'watchable' film than the first one in the series but as with all the Matt Helm flicks it kind of falls apart in the middle.Ann Margaret is dropdead gorgeous in this movie and very energetic however the scenes of her dancing in a disco just go on way the hell too long and the producers seem undecided as to whether they want her to be the love interest for DeanHelm or if they want her to be a poor innocent lamb that he rescues. She has a boyfriend character who shows up awkwardly throughout the film as if to point out that nothing is going on between the sex kitten and the dirty old man. Oddly Helm has fairly few romantic interludes with women in this film and aside from Ann none of them really make much of an impression. This film seems to be going out of it's way to avoid being as unrelentingly naughty as it's predecessor. Ann's character herself is rather incoherent and implausible there's not a lot of acting involved there but she lights up the screen when she's on it. Karl Malden is fun to watch simply because he seems to keep forgetting he's foreign in the movie and wanders in and out of a vague accent. Martin himself is more consistent in this film than in the previous one and endlessly likable as ever.There's something that should be really really cool in the last third of the film  a chase sequence between two real hovercraft but alas it's shot so blandly And without accompanying music! that it just kind of kills all the energy in the film. This is strange since it's obviously supposed to be the movie's centerpiece.In essence this film is kind of an outgrowth of the Rat Pack's mostlyunfortunate habit of making what moreorless amounts to High concept home movies and then releasing them theatrically. It's not bad stuff it succeeds mainly on the amiability of it's stars but after all is said and done you don't have much else to show for it.".

Martin stars as the boozing womanizing secret agent who poses as a photographer by day and tries to prevent world domination by night in between snuggles with various voluptuous females. Malden is the villain this time out. He's stolen a device and the professor who created it with the intention of blowing up Washington D.C. Martin must foil his plans before the professor gives in to torture and reveals the proper equations necessary to destroy the Capitol. Along to help but actually quite in the way is the professor's shimmying gogo dancing windup toy of a daughter AnnMargret. The film is full of the usual groaninducing entendres wayout spy gadgets and the requisite pallet of curvaceous lovelies but it's all so sloppily handled that only a certain amount of enjoyment comes of it. Despite the presence of AM and the stunningly beautiful Sparv as Malden's helpmate there doesn't seem to be an abundance of sexual byplay between Martin and the women. Martin looks tired bored and lazy through much of the film though he's Shakespearean compared to his appearances in the Matt Helm promotional trailers. It's a wonder that audiences took him seriously  if they indeed did  a few years later when he starred in Airport as the airline pilot after this string of cinematic gumballs. AM is decked out in an array of ludicrous costumes a longsleeved turtlenecked swimsuit? which are at once amusing and annoying. Her character makes no sense continuously gyrating in a disco while her father is missing but maybe she isn't supposed to. Her lengthy scenes in the nightclub are a high camp time capsule. Malden has a bad uneven accent which comes and goes. He gives his role some energy and presence but it isn't enough. Sparv is completely lovely throughout but is given virtually nothing to do at all. One minute she seems to be calling the shots and the other she's a flunky for Malden. Reese is an interesting presence as a Bondlike henchman with a steel plate grafted onto his head. What may have been inventive at the time a Hovercraft chase scene the use of undulating machinery as an execution device communication through microphones unfortunately comes off as pretty boring nowadays at least the way it is presented and directed here. The impressive use of real hovercrafts is done in by benign handling and unjudicious editing. There is some striking Monte Carlo scenery but none of the stars appeared to have gone there. There's a ton of body doubling and rearprojection throughout. AM fans will love all her frenetic dancing but others will find little to lift their spirits with this one. Watch out for a hilarious dig at Frank Sinatra in which his photo is projected against the wall of the disco while frugging dancers appear to pound on him with their hands followed by another more obvious indignity.".

I am convinced that it's not spoof enough to be funny and it's not exciting enough to be thrilling. This middle ground is cute but it doesn't rise to the top.

Age does take it's toll on our opinions and we're 32 years down the line hence my rating's decline from perfection.One must keep in mind when viewing this film that if you expect it to be a Disney story about seagulls then you are going to be gravely disappointed. In fact Richard Bach the writer fought tooth and nail to prevent exactly that Disney influence in the face of a studio that wanted to add animated fake mouth movements over the photography of the seagulls.The story is presented through the persona of seagulls but it is NOT about seagulls. Like the book of the same name the movie is actually a metaphor about people and life and the pursuit of learning and something better than pack mentality. Those viewers who keep an eye toward those subtle metaphysical principles will recognize the jewel at the heart of the movie. Those viewers with no thought of higher principles or those looking for an animal movie may conversely wish they had never heard of it.Alas the movie studio seemed to be populated by the latter group. Ultimately infighting between Bach and the promouthmovement studio honchos who wanted to retrofit the movie after its release resulted in the demise of the theatrical release within a few weeks of opening. Granted there was a limited audience for the movie but Bach didn't care since those who needed the message would find it and I personally think it would have lasted longer if left alone.The photography is stunning and the soundtrack by Neil Diamond is stellar. Granted by today's standards both the movie and soundtrack are dated but then so is anything made in the 70's.When it came out originally I took everyone I knew to see it who was even slightly interested in such metaphors and all of them loved it. It remains to be one of my favorite movies in principle even today despite the dating.If you are going to watch it today just allocate two hours of your life that are free of constraints in which to relax and learn one small simple quiet lesson and then enjoy the spectacular scenery while you are doing it. If you can do that you will love it.".

The animatronics rememeber they didn't have CGI back in the 70's are first class and it really does look like live seagulls.The movie is probably about the right length though at 95 mins perhaps trimming by 10 mins would not have harmed it.As you'll know it's a feelgood story about the quest to be a better gull and the importance of tolerance and forgiveness.I was a bit disappointed that one of the KEY SPOKEN LINES in the book was omitted from the script. When the young Jonathon is asked by his mother why he doesn't eat and is all bone and feathers he replies I don't mind being bone and feathers Mum. I just want to know what i can do in the air and what i can't that's all. I just want to know Considering the key part of the book is that Jonathon forsakes the squabbles and feeding frenzy to learn how to fly properly i would say that line is a pretty important one.Still it's a decent movie which is pleasant to watch.".

They're such beautiful elegant birds with a confident even noble appearance. And they fly beautifully. A seagull's flight is one of the most graceful and fascinating things to see. As beautiful as they are they're equally well known for their foul temperament...One of the most different things about this movie is the fact that it has only birds seagulls on screen and no human characters at all. Plus this is an animal movie different from the others. Instead of home pets this one is about seagulls.The story is about the title character who is different from all the seagulls of his flock. Flying is his favorite thing. He flies with art and passion but he dares to do things that other seagulls don't do such as flying as high as possible the more the merrier  for him sky is the limit and flying in unusual speeds as well as doing other tricks that other seagulls don't attempt. Of course that by being overambitious he's taking great risks...Jonathan faces the reality of being different his flock doesn't accept him and actually outcast him. However that doesn't stop him from keep trying to learn and improve his flight skills so that he reaches what he is desperately trying to. And even though he later finds another flock which accepts him the way he is he still loves his previous flock and wants to show them his talents.This movie is certainly artistic when it comes to filmmaking.

This work in my book is the one thing he's done worthy of the awards for it. Awful conceit about the man. When it came out I raced after work to catch the early showing and could hardly stand afterward for how completely moved I was. I knew it would go over like a lead balloon and it did. It was gone in no time. But boy for us writers and lovers of music. If you have the least smidgen of philosophical spirituality you will adore the movie the book and the music. If you have mature children preteens or teens with high ambition they'll hug you for it especially cut 7 Anthem on the CD. The album back when had voluminous notes of how Diamond went to Hawaii and mulled months over how to best do the book justice. It was nominated or won for cinematography and editing so you know already it was gorgeous. It brings tears of joy.".

This is pure Secular Humanism. I say this because some people thought this was a Christian film and it is not. It only confuses people because there are analogies that could easily apply to Jesus to the Pharisees and to Heaven itself.

	schema:reviewBody "After getting the book as a Christmas present in 2005 I was so in love with the story that I decided I must also watch the film exactly one year later the DVD arrived on my doorstep from Play.com.First thing's first I consider this to be one of my most favourite files the reason I enjoy it is because to me it's very symbolic and the film includes all of my true loves the sea sky and gulls. I often warn people about this film before showing it to them because it's seriously a matter of personal taste. The average person probably wouldn't be interested in this.I absolutely love the music and I now have the soundtrack together with the beautiful photography the nature scenes and gulls I believe it was a work of art a masterpiece. So deep.. I've now watched it about 20 times or more and still never bored of it!Call me crazy but I cannot get enough this I know the story inside out.. I know that it's a metaphor but the fact is it's still based on gulls! That's what really makes it enjoyable for me because I never get tired of watching birds especially my beloved gulls..The plot is simple not confusing. Jonathan sees more to life than just fighting for fish all day long he wants to learn how to master the gift of flight. In real life gulls and other birds actually do fly for fun. He wants to take flying to new levels he wants to reach the top literally and surpass everyone below for they aren't thinking any further and don't even want to. Jonathan expands his knowledge on flight throughout life and beyond meeting very few gulls like him and teaching others the joy of learning. It's inspirational because as the book suggests Jonathan lives within us all and we can so easily relate to him wanting to do what he wants to do and dealing with peer pressure almost the other gulls put him down and tell him that his learning is wrong. This often happens to us in real life some people are weak and go with the crowd while others continue to be themselves.One thing about this film that eeks me the fact that so many people compare it to a Christian's story.. about heaven and Jesus and all but really those are the type of people who see the bible's story EVERYWHERE THEY LOOK. This is NOTHING to do with Christianity if anything the devil chanting at the end of the film shows that stereotypical Christians are discriminative and you're better off NOT listening to their silly rules!Besides that watching this film always brings me to life like Jonathan my passion is flying. I really cannot get enough of those beautiful flying parts and the whole thing is something I hold close to my heart.OK I admit I may be a little biased because I'm absolutely gull crazy... I don't think there are any gull nuts who wouldn't enjoy this.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the first time ever in his career making movies Hall Bartlett knew exactly what he was doing. He was adapting a bestselling novella by Richard Bach about a prophetic seagull and he was going to turn it into a major motion picture. It was going to be an independentlyfinanced film with as little studio interference as possible. And by the end of the tenmonth shooting schedule Bartlett had mortgaged his home and invested every last one of his savings into the film's 1.5 million budget he was willing to do anything to make his dream project a reality. I was born to make this movie he declared. He was absolutely right. In his entire 30 year filmmaking career Bartlett helmed a series of flops misfires close calls small gems and at least one masterpiece Jonathan Livingston Seagull 1973.The film was absolutely reviled when it came out. Reviews were terrible. Then there were the lawsuits. Richard Bach sued Bartlett when Bartlett refused to honor Bach's right to final cut. Neil Diamond threatened to sue Bartlett if he didn't incorporate more of the music from the soundtrack into the film Diamond was also upset when composer Lee Holdridge requested to share credit with Diamond over the music. Ovady Julber the director of 1936's La Mer sued over suspicions that Bartlett's film might have plagiarized his work. And toes were stepped on. Associate Producer Leslie Parrish had worked hard to hire the crew members and help take care of the real seagulls being used for the production these seagulls were trained by Ray Berwick and Gary Gero and stored in a room in a Holiday Inn but in the end Bartlett demoted Parrish's credit from Associate Producer to Researcher.In spite of the tension which occurred behind the scenes Jonathan Livingston Seagull belongs right up there with Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 as one of the great surrealist films released in the later half of the 20th century. It is a rich liberated celebration of a writerdirector's artistic sensibilities free of any constricting narrative rules enhanced with the help of the cinematography by helicopter photographer Jim Freeman and veteran cinematographer Jack Couffer the latter of whom was hired after his impressive work on Walt Disney's True Life Adventure series. That Couffer's cinematography netted the film one of two Academy Award nominations is not surprising in the least it remains one of the finest examples of natural footage ever captured on celluloid.Neil Diamond and Lee Holdridge's score for the film has often been dismissed as overbearing but I've always begged to differ. Among the other songs used on the soundtrack Be represents Jonathan's independence while Dear Father epitomizes his selfdoubt and Skybird his liberation. To me the film's soundtrack remains exhilarating and it is also a reminder of Hall Bartlett's often overlooked talent for juxtaposing the right kind of music with his cinematic stories.Jonathan Livingston Seagull was not embraced by critics or audiences but I have a feeling that Bartlett himself always knew deep down that he had left the public with a masterpiece. Maybe he knew that he wouldn't live to see the film get the attention it deserved. Maybe he was aware that the film's mediocre reception would outlive him. After this film he would only go on to make two films The Children of Sanchez and Love is Forever. Neither was particularly impressive. But I wish he were alive to know how much I love this film. I wish he knew how much it has changed the way I look at movies. And I wish he knew how much I cherish the way he ends the picture with Jonathan's immortal closing monologue Look with your understanding. Find out what you already know. Use it Fletcher. Teach it show it forth. And you'll know the way to fly.".

	schema:reviewBody "1973 Martha a Californian housewife in her early thirties is married to Peter CEO of a construction company. When flower power was in full bloom Martha and Peter concentrated on building a home and putting their daughters through private education. With Peter increasingly away on business a restless Martha begins to feel there's something missing from her life might those hippies have been onto something? One day her old schoolfriend Susan drops by for coffee clutching a copy of Kahil Gibran's 'The Prophet' and 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' the latest publishing phenomenon.Why don't you take a swim in lake you? smiles Susan and leaves the books for Martha to ponder over. Days pass until out of curiosity Martha picks up the little blue book with the outline of a seagull on the cover. This Richard Bach fellow's topped the 'New York Times' bestseller lists for 38 weeks  a respectable writer. They've even made a movie of it. And Martha has always enjoyed nature documentaries. Whatever would Peter say? Oh phooey  for the first time in her 27 years Martha is spreading her wings...Dedicated to the real Jonathan Livingston Seagull who lives within us all this is an allegory for living one's life without fear to fly for the fun of it and learn what perfection really is. It's 'The Little Engine That Could' with feathers. Or Herman Hesse with a mouthful of herring.Although the story was inspired by John H Livingston a top American pilot of the 1920s and 1930s Richard Bach a new age forerunner to the likes of Deepak Chopra and Paulo Coelho has denied he is the real author of the novel merely acting as a conduit for some higher power fortunately there's not yet a legal precedent for robbing superior beings of their royalty cheques.Whoever the writer one cannot underestimate the impact the book had on the 'Me' generation with its hodgepodge of Eastern philosophy and selfempowerment speak later ridiculed by writer Beverley Byrne as Horatio Alger doing Antoine De SaintExupry or the Qur'an as translated by Bob Dylan.Composed of fewer than 10000 words it broke all hardcover sales records in fiction  and tellingly nonfiction since 'Gone With The Wind' shifting more than a million copies in 1972 alone. 'Reader's Digest' published an abridged version and Richard Harris won a Grammy in 1973 for his spokenword albumofthebook. Naturally given its earning power studio execs were inclined to jump all over it.Shot in California where else and New Mexico for 1.5 million and sporting a soundtrack by Neil Diamond the film version concerns the education of the eponymous seagull voiced by James Franciscus. Driven by a desire for limitless flight There's got to be more to life than fighting for fish heads! and an embarrassment to his parents and his girlfriend he is banished by the elder of his flock for flaunting the proscribed rules of speed and altitude.He encounters two other outcasts who teach him to soar to a higher plane of existence where dwell a flock of enlightened gulls led by a wise old bird named Chiang who takes him under his wing.

	onyx:emotionText "1973 Martha a Californian housewife in her early thirties is married to Peter CEO of a construction company. When flower power was in full bloom Martha and Peter concentrated on building a home and putting their daughters through private education. With Peter increasingly away on business a restless Martha begins to feel there's something missing from her life might those hippies have been onto something? One day her old schoolfriend Susan drops by for coffee clutching a copy of Kahil Gibran's 'The Prophet' and 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' the latest publishing phenomenon.Why don't you take a swim in lake you? smiles Susan and leaves the books for Martha to ponder over. Days pass until out of curiosity Martha picks up the little blue book with the outline of a seagull on the cover. This Richard Bach fellow's topped the 'New York Times' bestseller lists for 38 weeks  a respectable writer. They've even made a movie of it. And Martha has always enjoyed nature documentaries. Whatever would Peter say? Oh phooey  for the first time in her 27 years Martha is spreading her wings...Dedicated to the real Jonathan Livingston Seagull who lives within us all this is an allegory for living one's life without fear to fly for the fun of it and learn what perfection really is. It's 'The Little Engine That Could' with feathers. Or Herman Hesse with a mouthful of herring.Although the story was inspired by John H Livingston a top American pilot of the 1920s and 1930s Richard Bach a new age forerunner to the likes of Deepak Chopra and Paulo Coelho has denied he is the real author of the novel merely acting as a conduit for some higher power fortunately there's not yet a legal precedent for robbing superior beings of their royalty cheques.Whoever the writer one cannot underestimate the impact the book had on the 'Me' generation with its hodgepodge of Eastern philosophy and selfempowerment speak later ridiculed by writer Beverley Byrne as Horatio Alger doing Antoine De SaintExupry or the Qur'an as translated by Bob Dylan.Composed of fewer than 10000 words it broke all hardcover sales records in fiction  and tellingly nonfiction since 'Gone With The Wind' shifting more than a million copies in 1972 alone. 'Reader's Digest' published an abridged version and Richard Harris won a Grammy in 1973 for his spokenword albumofthebook. Naturally given its earning power studio execs were inclined to jump all over it.Shot in California where else and New Mexico for 1.5 million and sporting a soundtrack by Neil Diamond the film version concerns the education of the eponymous seagull voiced by James Franciscus. Driven by a desire for limitless flight There's got to be more to life than fighting for fish heads! and an embarrassment to his parents and his girlfriend he is banished by the elder of his flock for flaunting the proscribed rules of speed and altitude.He encounters two other outcasts who teach him to soar to a higher plane of existence where dwell a flock of enlightened gulls led by a wise old bird named Chiang who takes him under his wing. Under Chiang's tutelage Jonathan learns how to instantly 'jaunt' to anywhere in the universe. The secret is to begin by knowing that you have already arrived. As Chiang explains Your whole body from wingtip to wingtip is nothing more than your thought itself. Break the chains of your thought and you break the chains of your body too.

As he flies about he wonders if there's more to life than just eating fish heads how high he can fly and is there some special purpose to lifeall in a liveaction twohour film! Yes this is 253 of why you should hate the 1970sright between the song Muskrat Love and Richard Nixon! Okay there really is no such listbut if there was this film would be on it! That's because this is a godawful film that was actually embraced by with it people and made the book a huge bestseller and the film a mustsee. And to make it worse the film is so deadly serious and tries so hard to be philosophicalwhile all it really consists of is a seagull flying about as inane dialog blares on the screen. Could this get any worse?! Well yes because while the music does sound lovely Neil Diamond also sings several songs that made Heartlight sure to be included if there was a reasons to hate the 1980s list seem hardedged! So what positive things do I have to say about the film? Well the cinematography is lovely and must have been spectacular on the big screen. Also when Neil Diamond isn't singing the music is lovely. However with two hours to the film these reasons become irrelevant after just a few minutes as the rest is just a ponderous pile of....well... guano. And the fact that so many oncerespected actors LOVED the project and agreed to do voices for it is a testament to the power of mood altering drugs and hippie psychology!! Harry Medved included this in his book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. While I have disagreed with some of his choices I can heartily agree that this film merited no DEMANDED inclusion! In summation I'd rather eat glass than see it again! It's THAT bad!!!".

Yes this is 253 of why you should hate the 1970sright between the song Muskrat Love and Richard Nixon! Okay there really is no such listbut if there was this film would be on it! That's because this is a godawful film that was actually embraced by with it people and made the book a huge bestseller and the film a mustsee. And to make it worse the film is so deadly serious and tries so hard to be philosophicalwhile all it really consists of is a seagull flying about as inane dialog blares on the screen. Could this get any worse?! Well yes because while the music does sound lovely Neil Diamond also sings several songs that made Heartlight sure to be included if there was a reasons to hate the 1980s list seem hardedged! So what positive things do I have to say about the film? Well the cinematography is lovely and must have been spectacular on the big screen. Also when Neil Diamond isn't singing the music is lovely. However with two hours to the film these reasons become irrelevant after just a few minutes as the rest is just a ponderous pile of....well... guano. And the fact that so many oncerespected actors LOVED the project and agreed to do voices for it is a testament to the power of mood altering drugs and hippie psychology!! Harry Medved included this in his book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. While I have disagreed with some of his choices I can heartily agree that this film merited no DEMANDED inclusion! In summation I'd rather eat glass than see it again! It's THAT bad!!!";

I am still not sure what it is that went so wrong  but in the end it seems to have ended up as one of the worst movies of all time.

	schema:headline " A film inside of a painting Up close and personal with 16th century Flanders";
	schema:reviewBody "The Mill and the Cross is a movie inside of a painting specifically The Way to Calvary 1564 by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Pieter Bruegel Rutger Hauer is the main character in the film which takes turns following him as he decides how his painting will take shape and who will be in it and also follows the local peasants who go about their daily business in middle of 16th century Flanders. The background is always the actual painting's background with the mill high up on a rock looking down on a large field where most of the action occurs.Bruegel's patron is Nicolaes Jonghelinck Michael York a successful Flemish banker who spends his time learning from Bruegel about the people in the painting and what each section represents and also pontificates to nobody in particular about the current state of affairs in Flanders. In 1564 Spain ruled what is now Antwerp and Flanders. The Spanish militia seen in the painting in their red tunics seemed to be preoccupied with chasing down and torturing Protestant heretics. There are gruesome scenes in the film with a man tied to a wagon wheel hoisted up in the air with no defense at all while the birds have at him. A woman's fate is no better as she is shoved alive into an open grave while the red tunics fill the dirt in on top of her.The Way to Calvary itself does not show these particular atrocities. Instead it has Jesus in the center hoisting his own cross towards his crucifixion. The exact moment the painting captures is Simon helping him with the cross because Jesus stumbled and fell down. Everyone's eyes are on Simon at this time instead of Jesus. In the foreground is Mary Charlotte Rampling. She is helpless as she sits on the sidelines because there is nothing she can do to prevent the red tunics from carrying out their mission. The rest of the painting shows hundreds of peasants either watching the proceeding or going about their chores. Children play games on the hillside a local peddler sells his bread a horn player dances around and above them all the miller observes from his windmill.The Mill and the Cross is at its best when Bruegel is explaining his inspiration and how he plans to incorporate all of his ideas and scenes into one large landscape. He looks closely at a spider's web to discover where the anchor point on his painting will be and how to section off the rest of the action. Just as intriguing are the scenes of everyday life in 1564 Flanders. A young couple gets out of bed and takes their cow to the field for the day. Bruegel's wife and children wake up after him and get ready for breakfast which is a small slice of bread. The miller and his apprentice ready the mill for the day's tasks and the large wheels and gears moan into action.Rutger Hauer is excellent as Pieter Bruegel and he appears to be serving his artistic penance to atone for his ridiculous participation in Hobo with a Shotgun earlier this year. Michael York is taking a break from his voice over work and TV appearances to finally show up in a serious film again. Charlotte Rampling is sort of the odd man out here. Her screen time is sparse as Mary and she spends most of the time misty eyed observing all of the peasant movements around her.The Mill and the Cross is a Polish production directed by Lech Majewski who also aided in adapting the screenplay from a book of the same name by Michael Francis Gibson. The film was an official selection at this year's Sundance Film Festival and will most likely earn an Oscar nod for Best Costume Design. The costumes are remarkable and frequently take center stage over the performers.The Mill and the Cross is a bit reminiscent of The Girl with a Pearl Earring but instead of showing how the painting is made from the outside this time the filmmakers actually take you inside of the painting itself and walks on the same landscape as its subjects. There is little dialogue in the film which is not a problem because it is so absorbing to just sit back and watch the peasants wander around the area and Bruegel figure out how to tie everything together. I will not give it away but the final shot of the film is as wonderful as the rest as the camera backs up and reveals something to the audience.If you are a movie patron with patience and an interest in art history The Mill and the Cross is for you. If you get bored in movies without guns flash bangs and screaming stay away.".

The way it works out the scenery and milieu of a period based on a single painting is brilliant and ambitious. The miseenscene might in fact be the only and singular point of it all. So on that level eleven stars. Terrific. Mindblowing.But that exercise in naturalistic recreation in enlivening a masterpiece on canvas by Bruegel from 1564 is not to me enough. You will know after ten minutes whether to continue. I have heard of people being just spellbound by it all so that hopefully would be your feeling. I tried to make the characters have meaning on some level either in their interactions or in their actions alone or through what they did to the world around them. Much of what happens feels more medieval than Renaissance to me but I'm sure that was researched thoroughly. Bruegel was painting at a time when the Renaissance from Italy had made its way thoroughly north to the lowland countries and beyond.It is fun and indicative of the seriousness here that both Michael York and Charlotte Rampling took part late in their careers. That was one of the draws for sure. But don't expect revelations there either. Expect in fact only what the director Lech Majewski intendeda film version of the painting set in its larger context but always based on and drawing from this one admittedly fantastic painting. Which might be your starting point before launching into this one and half hour homage.".

I learned a lot about the ideas behind it and the way it was set up. Seeing it explained gradually throughout the story will let me remember it better than reading about it in a book.We also learned a lot about how people lived those days. A special mention should be devoted to the parts where this film demonstrates that life goes on regardless of politics war and religions. We also saw many forgotten customs about bread threshold cleaning and much more that I want to leave as an exercise to the close observer.A dramatic moment at  of the film is where the painter raises his hand and life comes to a stand still including the mill on the hill that stops by a hand signal of the miller. It seems no coincidence that the miller very much resembles how our Lord is pictured usually and also that he oversees the whole panorama from his high position. As soon as he signals the mill to resume working the whole picture relives from its frozen state.A large part of the audience stayed for the final QA. We got much information about the post production effort required to get the colors right and creating the different layers to get everything in focus. Further the film maker told he wanted to make a feature film from the start. It was considered a Mission Impossible by the people around him. How wrong they were!All in all a lot goes on in the film much more than I could oversee during the screening. Maybe I should try to grasp more of the fine details during a second viewing. I don't think I saw everything that the film makers did put into this production.".

How wrong they were!All in all a lot goes on in the film much more than I could oversee during the screening. Maybe I should try to grasp more of the fine details during a second viewing. I don't think I saw everything that the film makers did put into this production.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Mill and the Cross 2011 The Polish film The Mill and the Cross was cowritten and directed by Lech Majewski It stars Rutger Hauer as Pieter Bruegel and costars Charlotte Rampling and Michael York.The film consists of an attempt to bring to life Bruegel's 1564 painting The Procession to Calvary. I have seen this painting in the Kunsthistoriche Museum in Vienna. Once you've seen it you don't forget it because it is filled with people and action. Although in the painting Jesus has just collapsed under the weight of the cross so in a sense action has been frozen for a few seconds.The painting is also remarkable for a very strange symbola windmill placed high atop a stony crag. In the film Bruegel explains that the miller looks down from his mill and sees everything that is happening below just as God looks down from heaven and can see everything. So the mill and the miller work symbolically. However in a practical sense the mill would never be that high on an large steep stony crag. If a mill were really in that location no one could bring the wheat to the mill or take away the flour. The other dominant vertical structure is a cartwheel raised high on a long pole. This was the device used by the Spanish rulers of the Netherlands to execute and display prisoners. The prisoner was tied to the wheel and the wheel was hoisted far up in the air. The device prevented anyone from helping the personif aliveor removing the body. Only the carrion birds could reach the body which they did with predictable results.Technology in the 21st Century makes everything possible so it's no surprise that the painting is reproduced in the film in a real landscape. Sometimes all the figures are frozen but other times you can see a cow moving or some other action taking place. The special effects are routine by now but the manner in which they are used is not routine.We really have the sense that we are looking at a landscape and the artist is putting it down on canvas before our eyes. This is a highly creative way to look at life the way an artist sees it and then look at the way life is transformed and committed to canvas.We saw this film on the large screen at the excellent Rochester Polish Film Festival. It really will work better in a theater. However if that's not an option it's worth seeing on DVD.".

How state of the affairs came to that? I would track it down to Pope Alexander VI Borgia and total corruption of the Curria of the late 1490s.

	schema:reviewBody "Set in Flanders during the 16th century It is inspired by Peter Bruegel the Elder's 1564 painting The Procession to Calvary. The drama depicts Breugel's creative process conceiving and rendering the painting while life goes on around him the gentle humour in the pastoral activities of the peasants including Breugel's own family along with the arbitrary and horrible crucifixion of alleged Protestants by the redtuniced Spanish Inquisition militia sent from the Vatican.If you're looking for an interesting narrative action character development witty dialogue or any dialogue at all you're out of luck. The film is in English but the amount of melodramatic mutterings from the only 3 English speakers would barely fill a page all of the rest of the actors are Polish. This film dies on a small screen. If on the other hand you're able to watch it on the largest possible screen in HD you're in for a rare treat. The narrative is not what it's about it's almost entirely about the remarkable imagery.Bruegel was inspired by the work of Hieronymus Bosch both in his depiction of religious events and his style of rendering. Like Bosch Bruegel depicted many scenes of human activity within one painting art as a narrative medium for the illiterate. In The Procession to Calvary Christ carrying the cross is depicted small in scale at the centre of the composition surrounded by many other apparently unrelated groupings. The whole scene is dominated by a mill in the background sitting precariously on an impossible rock perch. Bruegel seems to have been working in the period before the formal rules of perspective entered the visual language of painters. His figures do shrink in size from foreground to background but the terrain they occupy appears parallel or flat to the picture plane.This quality seems to make it ideal for the director's whimsical depiction of the painting taking shape in the artist's mind groupings of real figures all apparently shot in isolation animate the entire surface of the painting waiting to be frozen in time by the Bruegel's brush. Seeing the painting briefly in this manner is one of the most charming moments of cinematic art in recent memory.The director doesn't stop there in his use of a Bruegelesque approach to a visual medium Bruegel could't have imagined. There are numerous scenes where the camera gazes steadily on elaborately staged action in the distant background while something else transpires in close up. Both parts are in sharp focus. Trying to achieve this incamera would present the cinematographer with an impossible depth of field situation. I expect a lot of scenes were carefully staged in this way to be digitally knitted together in postproduction. In every scene the colours and textures are a visual feast and the lighting looks deceptively natural. The costumes are stunning and the production design like a painting by Bruegel.As for the dialogue this film might have been better without any maybe a bit of voiceover at best. Rutger Hauer's craggy features make him entertaining enough to watch as Bruegel. He needn't have opened his mouth. Michael York as Bruegel's patron Nicolaes Jonghelinck just looks old and Charlotte Rampling as Mary delivers her standard serenely sad gazes but is otherwise forgettable.".

The reconstruction of the idyllic landscapes of the colorful atmosphere of the 16th century cities of the epochal clothing and of the coldblooded reign and the executions by the Spanish mercenaries are simply phenomenal helped most significantly by a brilliant cast and a fantastic color grading.

	schema:headline " Ridiculously impossibly beautiful";
	schema:reviewBody "To understand my review I should say where I'm coming from. I'm not especially interested in or moved by art. I AM however interested in history. I found this movie utterly fascinating as a depiction of history specifically of history as it was commonly lived. As opposed to for example Caravaggio or The Agony and the Ecstasy both of which I found too obsessed with story at the expense of showing me something I didn't know about history. The movie IS boring as some people have complained in the sense that nothing much happens and indeed long stretches of time go by without a word being uttered. I did not try to watch it in one go but rather spread out over four nights and I think this pacing worked very well for my purposes allowing me to sink into the world for 25 minutes or so then leave when I was saturated. It is an added bonus that the movie is so beautiful so crisp so sharp in its colors so mannered in the composition of almost every scene. Another reviewer complained that this crispness and vibrancy is not really true to the Bruegel. Maybe so. I've not seen the original and the pictures I have seen certainly have more muted colors and less well defined edges. But as I said I don't care about the art as much as the history and the history seems IMHO done very well. Towards the end Bruegel makes a rather heavy handed and utterly obvious reference to Auden's Muse des Beaux Arts and the point that ordinary life goes on regardless of whether great events are happening somewhere. And that is mostly the ethos of the movie  the portrayal of the ordinary events of life of the time whether kids playing or barnyard animals being tended against the backdrop of the specifically out of the ordinary of that time and place namely the search for and treatment of heretics.The only criticism I have is that as opposed to the Auden reference which is actually rather delightful there's rather too much woe is humanity why must be this way? spoken voiceover throughout. Mary says pretty much nothing but these vapid irritating and completely contentfree clichs and maybe half of what Nicolaes Jonghelinck says is along the same lines. The movie would have been a whole lot stronger if it had simply shut up during those scenes and allowed the visuals to speak for themselves.The one recommendation I would make is to try to see this at the highest resolution possible at least BluRay. The texture in almost every frame is so rich that you'd be missing out if you were to view it at DVD resolution let alone at VHS quality. Finally some other reviewers have complained that the scenes where everyone freezes are poorly executed that one sees the animals moving along with the occasional person in the background and wind motion. This criticism IMHO misses the point. Obviously if the director wanted a Ken Burns effect he could easily have obtained it just take a photo and pan over it. The point of the minor movements in an otherwise still frame IMHO is to act as metaphor for the artist's mental composition. The bulk of the characters have been established and they stand still while the artist's mind toys with minor modifications of a few characters which we see as those characters moving more or less substantially.".

In the movie on the contrary colors are running rampant in the most tasteless computer generated sort of way.Bruegel's palette is certainly not bright. Maybe the director had Flemish 15th century art with its bright colors in mind? But no he didn't. Flemish masters used glazing to let the light travel through multiple layers of paint to achieve marvellous illusions of tangibility and depth. In the movie though the colors seem to be borrowed from a candy store. Bold and artificial. Everything in this film is digitally enhanced but acting. Acting is a pure zero while the visuals are a zero digitally enhanced.The lighting indoors reminds of Caravaggio at best but it's way too crude. The first scene with the lovers is lit with Caravaggio in mind but the director decided to throw in a bit of Flemish Art. Hence a brightly lit window. Unfortunately the result is a caravagesque painting torn and another one Flemish visible through a hole.So what's this film about? Spanish oppression. Well with no plot no acting no drama it's a worthless comment. About the recreation of Bruegel's famous painting? No way. The painting is shown in the movie and it's obvious that it has nothing to do with it artistically. Well even though out of place could it be on Barogue art? The lighting indoors is certainly meant to be Baroque. That can be true but than the director has not succeed. If you are interested in Baroque there are quite a few infinitely better films. Even an entertaining and unpretentious Alatriste succeeded in recreating Velasquez way better than The Miller and the Cross in recreating anything.This film is nothing but European artsy pop junk. Will there be an end to artsy directors fooling the public? I gave the movie two stars because at least some viewers might get interested in Pieter Brugel's art after seeing a Road to Calvary painting.".

With its very elaborate scenery and the painstaking efforts that went into the recreation of the painting it's a technical masterpiece.Sadly that's all that can be said in favor of the film.The storyline if there really is any jumps around from scene to scene in a seemingly random manner. None of the characters really interact and the acting is more like posing for a painting than acting. That might have been the goal but it doesn't work here. In a sense it's really not a movie but it rather has the style of a dramatized documentary.But it isn't a documentary either. At no time was any care given to real historical realism. In the film a reference is made to the city of Antwerp but the city you can visit today and please do I'll give you a tour looks more historically representative of the era than the film. I read and heard that enormous care was given to elements like the choice of the right kind of materials for the clothing. That may be true. But it brings nothing to the film as an experience nor is it informative in any way. I read reviews where the reality with which the way of life in 16th century Flanders was depicted is greatly applauded. They are misguided. None of the building style interiors music or daily customs depicted are found anywhere in 16th century Flanders. They look like 13th century Poland. Because a lot of it was shot there. The landscape may resemble that of the painting but clashes with reality. You might argue that it was the film maker's intent to closely resemble this highly symbolic painting. And I would agree. But he does this with great superficiality. It would have been much more interesting to show and contrast 16th century reality with the symbolism in the painting. But the director seems unable or unwilling to make the distinction. And thus we are left with a succession of 'tableaux' that visually resemble what's on the painting with no reference to reality then or now.You might argue that the director put in a lot of symbolism some of his own. But the way the director tries to cram every pixel the film was recorded digitally with symbolism seems random too a bit like a poet who believes his job is done when his sentences rhyme in a pleasing way never mind the content. Sometimes he even attempts to be critical or sarcastic. Watching the scenes near the end where people are dancing and singing is downright painful. But there is no message in this. Noone cares? Life goes on? Life is hard and then you die? One person might call it an ode to the resilience of the ordinary people but it might also be a protest against the callousness of the masses. The film takes no position.The director seems to know exactly what certain markets expect in terms of 'historical Europe' but seems to have no interest in the history and culture itself.If you are interested in a better film where symbolism tempo acting and story have a meaning then I refer you to a real masterpiece about art oppression and persecution Andrei Rublev by the Russian master Andrei Tarkovski.".

But the way the director tries to cram every pixel the film was recorded digitally with symbolism seems random too a bit like a poet who believes his job is done when his sentences rhyme in a pleasing way never mind the content. Sometimes he even attempts to be critical or sarcastic. Watching the scenes near the end where people are dancing and singing is downright painful. But there is no message in this. Noone cares? Life goes on? Life is hard and then you die? One person might call it an ode to the resilience of the ordinary people but it might also be a protest against the callousness of the masses. The film takes no position.The director seems to know exactly what certain markets expect in terms of 'historical Europe' but seems to have no interest in the history and culture itself.If you are interested in a better film where symbolism tempo acting and story have a meaning then I refer you to a real masterpiece about art oppression and persecution Andrei Rublev by the Russian master Andrei Tarkovski.";

Thus The mill and the cross is an exploration of at least three subjects. There's the torture and execution of Jesus Christ as described by the New Testament  there's the painting made by Breughel  and there's the life of the painter who was unlucky enough to live through some VERY interesting times complete with war tyranny doctrinal schism and religious violence. In lesser hands this could have meant a complete muddle but the movie succeeds in combining all of these elements into a cohesive and harmonious whole. The movie is a feast for the eyes thanks to a very innovative combination of computergenerated effects painted backgrounds and handpicked locations. The costumes too are superb. But it is first and foremost a meditation on religious theological and moral themes. Which is as it should be...I recommend the movie to everyone even to readers who are not Catholic or Christian. The movie touches upon universal themes such as the nature of Mankind's seemingly eternal capacity for mischief. It is not a coincidence that some of the worst enormities are committed by followers of what is supposed to be a religion of peace and unity. However I would like to give you one advice and that is not to watch the movie in the company of a professional art historian. Breughel lived a long time ago and his work was drenched in a very subtle symbolism meaning that it can be analyzed and reviewed ad vitam aeternam.

Elizabeth Shue looks as beautiful as ever and does a great job as Chris Parker.  Keith Coogan does a great job as well.  Other notable cast members are Vincent D'Onofrio Penelope Ann Miller Geroge Newbern Bradley Whitford and Lolita Davidovich.  Also I have to hand it to director Chris Columbus he did a superb job with this film.  Amazingly enough this was his first directorial effort too.  Good job Chris!  It's always good to see where directors come from if you didn't know he went on to do Home Alone Home Alone 2 Lost in New York Mrs. Doubtfire Bicentennial Man and Harry Potter The Sorcerer's Stone just to name a few.There are so many good things about this film!  This movie's got action adventure and comedy.  The comedy in the film is absolutely fantastic! There are a few scenes that crack me up just thinking about them.  ...And there are a great number of quotable lines that everyone that has seen this movie will remember.Anyhow I strongly suggest you see this film!  I really hope that you enjoy the film if you haven't seen it already.  Thanks for readingChris".

	schema:reviewBody "Adventures in Babysitting is a movie that I'll never forget. One of the reasons why this film is so memorable is because of the Chicago locations. For the past 25 years or so there have been lots of good movies shot in and around Chicago as well as the suburbs such as Risky Business Ferris Bueller's Day Off and The Fugitive just to name a few. But Adventures in Babysitting is probably my favorite movie to be made in Chicago. I saw this movie when it first came out in the summer of 1987 a year after Ferris Bueller which Adventures bares somewhat of a resemblence to and while I was watching the film it felt to me like I was part of the adventure. Today this is still a very entertaining picture and a lot of fun. Elisabeth Shue is terrific in her first leading role as Chris Parker a 17yearold high school senior who prepares for a big date with her boyfriend at the beginning of the film. But he cancels the date and since she's now free for the night she's asked to babysit for the Anderson kids. She agrees. Once she gets over there she gets a frantic phone call from her best friend Brenda Penelope Ann Miller who's run away from home and is now stranded at a bus station in downtown Chicago. Terrified after witnessing a shooting Brenda asks Chris to pick her up because she blew all her money on the cab ride to the bus station. Hesitant Chris has no choice but to take the two Anderson kids Sara Maia Brewton and Brad Keith Coogan with her to pick up poor Brenda. Also going along for the ride Brad's horny best friend Daryl Anthony Rapp. Once they get on the expressway things start to go wrong. Very wrong. This is where Adventures in Babysitting turns into a fun movie. The foursome experience car troubles runins with a friendly car thief a mob group the thief works for who spend most of the movie chasing the kids through the streets of Chicago and two gangs on a train a short trip to a hospital when one of the kids is slightly injured by a member of one of those gangs a brief stop at a frat party a chase to the top of a highrise building and a show stopping classic scene in a blues bar. And much more happens as the hapless Brenda continues to wait and wait and wait for Chris to come get her. Adventures in Babysitting was directed by Chris Columbus in his directing debut after writing screenplays for a couple of Steven Spielberg produced movies Gremlins The Goonies and Young Sherlock Holmes. Since this film Columbus has gone on to direct some of the biggest box office hit comedies of alltime such as Home Alone Home Alone 2 and Mrs. Doubtfire. Adventures in Babysitting was nowhere near as big a hit as those films but it did modestly well. I would have loved to see a sequel to this. It would have been interesting to see what kind of misadventures were next for Chris and company. Shue Brewton Coogan and Rapp all seem to be having a blast on screen and I would too if I were up their on the screen. Even though Miller doesn't seem to be having a good time she's a scream as Brenda she would later show off some real good acting in Kindergarten Cop and Awakenings. And Vincent D'Onofrio of Men in Black and currently The Cell has one of his first film roles in a very small part as the owner of a auto repair shop where the broken down car gets fixed. Adventures in Babysitting is a movie that's great fun from start to finish and never lets up. This comedyadventure is awesome! out of four".

There is an air of innocence to the whole thing before these more conscious and overtly cynical days that we know and hate now  maybe a reason why 1980s retro is all the rage now... that and things are cyclical.I thought the film WAS charming although entirely farfetched in its plot lines although I think that was kind of the point. The characters while not being very complicated were warm and at least not entirely twodimensional and the little girl was quite cute and not extremely annoying as could have happened.Overall I'd recommend it to hounds who love to watch 80s films.".

There is an air of innocence to the whole thing before these more conscious and overtly cynical days that we know and hate now  maybe a reason why 1980s retro is all the rage now... that and things are cyclical.I thought the film WAS charming although entirely farfetched in its plot lines although I think that was kind of the point. The characters while not being very complicated were warm and at least not entirely twodimensional and the little girl was quite cute and not extremely annoying as could have happened.Overall I'd recommend it to hounds who love to watch 80s films.";

The movie opens with Chris Parker played by Elizabeth Shue in a very early starring role first finding out that her boyfriend can't make their big date that night. So she agrees to babysit Sara and Brad Anderson played by Maia Brewton and Keith Coogan both of whom have dropped off the face of the earth apparently in the last 10 or 15 years. Sara's kind of a brat and Brad has a crush on Chris. Brad's best friend Daryl played by Anthony Rapp who went on to appear in Dazed and Confused and Road Trip who is an annoying wiseass also drops by. Things go okay until Chris gets a call from her best friend Brenda Penelope Ann Miller who says that she ran away from home and is now stuck at a bus station in the city with no money and no way home and of course she can't call her parents. This prompts Chris to take the kids including Daryl on a little trip and of course hilarious hijinks ensue.They have a tire blowout and are helped by a mechanic with a hook for a hand. Their car is then stolen and they go to try to get it back. They're caught by the mobsters running the car ring and have to escape which they achieve by walking along a very thin metal beam overhead. But the mobsters catch them trying to leave forcing them on the run and leading to one of the funniest scenes in the movie going through a blues club the singer stops them saying Ain't nobody leaves here without singing the blues. So they do Chris leading singing a song about their predicament. It's both cute and hilarious with the others joining in singing backup And we should be in bed!.The rest of the movie is about them being chased through the city by these mobsters and of course there's one funny bit after another with some suspenseful bits thrown in for good measure. This is all hilarious but the best scenes are the ones interspersed throughout with Brenda trying to get along at the bus station. Penelope Ann Miller truly steals the show scared out of her skull she has to contend with such problems as a bum yelling at her to get out of his house a phone booth getting her glasses stolen by a bag lady the look on the bag lady's face when she puts them on and realizes she can see is priceless a hot dog vendor who won't help her out Then I don't have a wiener! he says when she says she doesn't have any cash and a jumbosized sewer rat she tries to rescue thinking it's a cute little kitty cat because she can't see. This is probably the best part Penelope Ann Miller has ever had and she demonstrates a surprising talent for screwball comedy.Like I said the rest of the young cast is great Shue pretty much began her career here and Coogan Rapp and Brewton who was also very funny on the also underrated TV show Parker Lewis Can't Lose which I'm dying to see come out on DVD put in funny though clichd parts. Adventures in Babysitting is one of those movies that just sounded kind of dumb based on the title like Buffy the Vampire Slayer but if you haven't seen it give it a try anyway the brilliant gags and the strong acting made it work.".

This is a fun flick that I still watch 'til this day and have so much fun with. I would always recommend this also for anyone I truly hope it is discovered by new generations. I still enjoy singing along with the Babysitting Blues I think I finally feel Chris's pain after all I'm too old to babysit. D 710".

It has a flawless cast headed by Elisabeth Shue Chris Maia Brewton Sara Keith Coogan Brad and Vincent D'Onofrio Dawson. Spoilers ahead Here is a little bit of how the film starts out. Chris who is babysitting Sara and Brad His Friend Daryl Anthony Rapp also stayed over and they had to make a trip into Chicago to pick her friend Brenda Penelope Ann Miller who ran away from home and they essentially go through hell trying to pick up Brenda and get back home. Some of the things they went through included being chased down by the mob Daryl stole a copy of Playboy that has betting information because he saw the centerfold is a dead ringer for Chris and ending up in in an allblack blues bar with the rule being Nobody gets out of here without singing the blues. so they have to singing Babysitting Blues which not only the owner but all the customers get into. Finding out that the guy she was seeing is actually a creep who instead of being sick As he claimed was taking another woman out to dinner. She thought it was beneath her to strike back but Daryl did not. He kicked him in the ass and his face fell straight into a cake. Having their car break down and have to be towed to Dawson's Garage without enough money to get the repairs and without the money can't get home. This is a great scene because Sara thinks he is Thor He looks like him and is able to melt his heart and he gives them a break on the price. There are about 4 or 5 other incredible scenes that I love in this movie and there is not one wasted moment from start to finish. It goes without saying I love this movie and although I have seen thousands of films it cracks my Top 10. Saying I give it 1010 is redundant.".

I did find it to be just a little boring at times and a lot of the material that was supposed to be hilarious was not as funny as the director probably thought it was but who could hate a movie as cute and lovable as this? My favorite parts in the movie are all the scenes that involve Brenda. The scene where she picks up the rat thinking it's a cat and the scene where she tells the homeless man that he just moved were incredibly humorous. The whole film was sort of slapshtickish and I like slapstick when done right. Not a masterpiece but still a great time.

That's the whole point so don't be afraid to indulge!!! It really takes you back to your teen years especially if you ever babysat and wished for some excitement instead of boredom. Chris Parker a marvellous Elisabeth Shue is a beautiful high school senior who was anticipating celebrating with her boyfriend Mike Bradley Whitford regarding their anniversary. However the jerk as the viewers know stands her up with some really lame excuse and she ends up babysitting for the Andersons who have a very curious and adorable daughter Sara Maia Brewton and a teenage son Brad Keith Coogan grandson of the great Jackie Coogan who secretly makes puppy eyes at Chris. Brad's obnoxious best friend Daryl Anthony Rapp shows up and wants in when Chris receives a frantic phone call from her best friend Brenda a wonderfully comedic Penelope Ann Miller who has run away from home only to be stranded at a downtown Chicago bus stations with some really pricelessly goofy characters. Our heroine dares to take the rugrats with her to rescue her pal and they encounter one outrageous adventure after another. In the process they blow a tire meet up with an amputee truck driver witness an assault end up being dragged down to a automobile heisting operation chased by the bad guys singing in a blues club one of the best sequences come between a gang war on a subway crash almost literally a frat party and discover that Chris's guy has been twotiming her with an easy chick and end up at the Anderson's party downtown. And they do finally accomplish their mission to rescue Brenda while trying to beat the progenetors home!!! Whew!!! No wonder Chris decides that this is going to be her first and last job!!!! The 60s soundtrack does nothing to hurt the film in fact it enhances it especially the opening track He Kissed Me by the Crystals. A moment that every girl dreams about. The situations are hilarious with as always the charmingly clueless yuppie parents funny villains and resourceful protagonists. I applauded when Daryl returned a long overdue favor to Mike in the French restaurant and the facial expression on Daryl's face on the freeway when they are approached by Handsome John Pruitt just takes the cake!!! And that George Newburn as college guy Dan is such a cutie. Vincent D'Orinifo's appearance is notable as well. Fun fun fun! Oh gee Daryl are you a gearhead and a sex fiend? A laugh riot!".

	schema:headline " Ends up as a bit of a misadventure for the audience but there is some fun to had out of the film.";
	schema:reviewBody "The opening scene of Adventures in Babysitting curiously retitled A Night on the Town for British audiences has Elizabeth Shue's character Chris Parker dancing to an old record from the 1960s as she gears up for a romantic evening out with a partner. It is a scene that perfectly sets the tone for the film wacky titles upbeat and likable song fast edits and happy people dancing as they prepare to be with the one they love. It is a scene that not only sets up the tone of the film but it is also a scene that will come and go a scene that the film will not revisit or somuch as even reference later on since just minutes later Chris' bubble will be burst and she will be off down a different path.Such is the cut and thrust nature of films that rely on cause and effect as their narrative base it is very rare for a film to refer back to a scene from ten minutes ago because something so drastic would have happened to propel the story into its next situation. I hate to refer to films made since the one I'm talking about but 2005 film Cellular is a good example of a film that presents us with one situation the hero must overcome before leading into another and then another  all the time not looking back the closing half an hour of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is another good example. But then again I'm a big fan of those two films and whilst Adventures in Babysitting is good fun it does not hold up as a film nor as a realistic piece of entertainment.The most frustrating thing that glares the most out of the film for me anyway were the inconsistencies apparent within the character of Sara Anderson Brewton who is the youngest member of the family being babysat at eight years old she is also the smartest and there's your problem. Unfortunately most of the logic in this film is replaced for good excuses to try and get laughs out of the audience. Sara is smart enough to have the dialogue to make us think she is clever but is actually foolish enough to climb out of a window on the fortieth floor of a skyscraper her imperative inclusion to the story is once again utilised as she is able to overcome the plot point that involves being able to turn a money grabbing mechanic into a good Samaritan this time through innocence. The third example of Sara's inability to be an 8 year old human being or indeed the writer's inability to create an 8 year old human being is when shortly after they have been caught carjacking by a carjacker and are hurtling along to a gangster's warehouse Sara pulls out a chocolate bar and finds it in her heart to offer some to all in the car  she is not terrified like her brother his friend and Elizabeth are even if she should be the most terrified.But then we have to suspend belief to go along with the film's running gag that these incompetent human beings can get their way out of any jam no matter how difficult. Elizabeth is a 17 year old babysitter who has jeopardised everyone's situation at the expense of a friend although you cannot blame her Brad 15 Coogan is a kid who is attracted to Elizabeth and his friend Daryl Rapp who is equally sexually active at least in his own mind and enough to want Elizabeth to rape him. But while these kids can get out of jams such as escaping a building full of gangsters who will no doubt kill them in due course the film does not elevate itself above that level of 'here comes the situation here is the situation there goes the situation' which is disappointing as there is a certain likability for all of the characters involved. Daryl may think with a body part that is not his brain on more than one occasion but he carries a degree of innocence that just keeps him from being another one of these American teenagers obsessed with women something that does not work AS a character IN a film.But whilst the characters remain inconsistent and the plot remains basic the actual cause and effect situations are nothing that special either. The carjacker does not have time to deliver the kids somewhere safe before driving on the kids actually stop half way through their escape from certain death by singing 'the blues' in a music club and they even find time to go to a student party during the course of their adventure. It's not that these events aren't interesting they are just too unrealistic and heavy handed to warrant good viewing. If your idea of comedy and tension is to have the kids actually stop and sing to a crowd of blues fans this is the film for you otherwise I am surprised they did not merely barge through the barrier and continue to escape  maybe they could've even asked for help from the musicians as they outrun the murderous gangsters.But whilst incompetence would have them go on this adventure in the first place as it is Brenda Miller who sparks the journey off it is incompetence and inconsistency that actually gets them through the journey that matters. The bad guys nearer the end are not waiting for them in the garage despite having the address and would rather follow them to the third act setting than nab them there and then but glaring errors seem to be accepted by director Columbus embraced even as these people survive the city streets like cacti survive the blistering sun. It may not be smart nor that funny but the adventure is enjoyable in places even if you need your brain suspended for the majority of the runtime.".

The third example of Sara's inability to be an 8 year old human being or indeed the writer's inability to create an 8 year old human being is when shortly after they have been caught carjacking by a carjacker and are hurtling along to a gangster's warehouse Sara pulls out a chocolate bar and finds it in her heart to offer some to all in the car  she is not terrified like her brother his friend and Elizabeth are even if she should be the most terrified.But then we have to suspend belief to go along with the film's running gag that these incompetent human beings can get their way out of any jam no matter how difficult. Elizabeth is a 17 year old babysitter who has jeopardised everyone's situation at the expense of a friend although you cannot blame her Brad 15 Coogan is a kid who is attracted to Elizabeth and his friend Daryl Rapp who is equally sexually active at least in his own mind and enough to want Elizabeth to rape him. But while these kids can get out of jams such as escaping a building full of gangsters who will no doubt kill them in due course the film does not elevate itself above that level of 'here comes the situation here is the situation there goes the situation' which is disappointing as there is a certain likability for all of the characters involved. Daryl may think with a body part that is not his brain on more than one occasion but he carries a degree of innocence that just keeps him from being another one of these American teenagers obsessed with women something that does not work AS a character IN a film.But whilst the characters remain inconsistent and the plot remains basic the actual cause and effect situations are nothing that special either. The carjacker does not have time to deliver the kids somewhere safe before driving on the kids actually stop half way through their escape from certain death by singing 'the blues' in a music club and they even find time to go to a student party during the course of their adventure. It's not that these events aren't interesting they are just too unrealistic and heavy handed to warrant good viewing. If your idea of comedy and tension is to have the kids actually stop and sing to a crowd of blues fans this is the film for you otherwise I am surprised they did not merely barge through the barrier and continue to escape  maybe they could've even asked for help from the musicians as they outrun the murderous gangsters.But whilst incompetence would have them go on this adventure in the first place as it is Brenda Miller who sparks the journey off it is incompetence and inconsistency that actually gets them through the journey that matters. The bad guys nearer the end are not waiting for them in the garage despite having the address and would rather follow them to the third act setting than nab them there and then but glaring errors seem to be accepted by director Columbus embraced even as these people survive the city streets like cacti survive the blistering sun. It may not be smart nor that funny but the adventure is enjoyable in places even if you need your brain suspended for the majority of the runtime.";

You take a situation that in reality might wind up with a bunch of young people on the evening news as rape andor murder victims and you turn it into an adventurous lark. Love the '80s!This is a highly entertaining movie. The characters are fun and wellwritten. The dialogue is great. It has the feel of a John Hughes movie. Elisabeth Shue is so good in this. It's impossible not to have a crush on her after watching this film. The kids are all good with Maia Brewton stealing practically every scene she's in. Her love of Thor was a big kick to me as a kid since I was also a big fan of Thor and all the other kids I knew had no clue who he was. The scene where she meets Thor for real is one of the many highlights of this film for me. Just a great movie from a great decade. You should definitely check it out.".

ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING as well as films such as BETTER OFF DEAD was a decent film that actually had something to say to teensand it could be enjoyed by adults as well what a concept. While the story does have its sexy jokes teens who know more than adults and silly escapades it manages some originality and some genuine laughs. It's cute how an innocent little trek into the city results in a long series of unbelievable and dangerous consequencesmany of which are quite funny.

With the help of her boyfriend Robert Hoffman from Umberto Lenzi's Spasmo she starts her investigation while the killer proceeds to cut the witnesses' throats with a straight razor. There's nothing special about 'Death Walks With a Cane' it's a routine giallo with little originality about it. You've got all the usual stuff here violent murders weird characterscrazy plot twists but there's still something missing. Firstly  suspense the movie is pretty damn low on thrills. Secondly  sense of style. What kind of giallo is this without stylish locations? The story is supposed to be taking place in Rome but the action mainly revolves in some unphotogeic back streets. No gorgeous architecturejust old shacks. The most upsetting thing about the film is the camerawork flat and uninspired with lots of pointless zooms and occasionally out of focus. Only during the murder scenes do the proceedings look a little more lively with some nice camera angles. The murders are gory and quite well executed. The score for the film composed by Roberto Pregadio isn't progressive or groovy or pounding or anything at all. Merely generic. There's a good deal of nudity in 'Death Walks With a Cane'. Robert Hoffman who was just excellent in Spasmo and Scott do what they can with the material they're given battling through some hysterically funny dialogue. The supporting cast includes Simon Andreu and Luciano Rossi who's always played demented creeps in westerns and police films. Sadly this time Luciano Rossi is wasted as just one more red herring. The film isn't great still worth a look for giallo fans but had a potential to be a lot better. If you want to see the same cast in a decent film watch Death walks at midnight.".

	schema:reviewBody "Passi Di Danza Su Una Lama Di Rasoio aka. Death Carries a Cane of 1973 certainly isn't one of the many essential Italian Gialli from the time. However Maurizio Pradeaux' film is still a creepy and stylish little film that my fellow GialloItalian Horror fans should enjoy. The Italian Giallo has brought forth many masterpieces and while this film isn't one of them it is nonetheless very enjoyable. This is not least due to the ravishing and wonderfully charismatic genrebeauty Nieves Navarro who blessed quite a bunch of notable Gialli with her presence.Overall Passi Di Danza... which shares some features with Luciano Ercoli's La Morte Accarezza a Mezzanotte Death Walks at Midnight 1972 is rather routine stuff. The when beautiful Kitty Nieves Navarro is looking through coin operated binoculars at a tourist observation point she becomes witness to the brutal knifing murder of a girl. At first the cops laugh her report off when they actually discover the murder victim they suspect Kitty's boyfriend Alberto Robert Hoffmann. Bodies pile up as whoever could give hints for solving the crime ends up murdered...As mentioned above Passi Di Danza... is rather routine stuff which in case of a Giallo isn't a bad thing. The murders are stylish and brutal though not too spectacular by brutal Giallostandards the music is eerie and hypnotic though nothing special by the high Giallostandards and the camera work and settings are stylish and elegant though again nothing spectacular by Giallostandards. Nieves Navarro who is credited as Susan Scott is once again great. The ravishing Miss Navarro is once again given several opportunities to take her clothes off and makes a protagonist that is both very sexy and likable. The blonde Anuska Borova who seems never to have appeared in any other films is almost equally sexy in her double role. Robert Hoffmann is good enough in the male lead. The rest of the cast includes regular leading man Simn Andreu who appeared alongside Nieves Navarro on several other occasions including Luciano Ercoli's three Gialli Forbidden Fotos of a Lady Above Suspicion Death Walks With High Heels and Death Walks at Midnight and regular creepyman Luciano Rossi who appeared as a supercreep in all subgenres of Italian Cultcinema. Overall Passi Di Danza... may not be offering anything new or particularly overwhelming but it's a formula Giallo that offers style suspense sleaze and brutality and that my fellow fans of the genre should enjoy.I recommend tracking down the Italian version since the English dubbing is abysmal. My rating 6.510".

As was the case with THE FORBIDDEN PHOTOS OF A LADY ABOVE SUSPICION 1970 Scott is decked out in some horrendous 70s fashions worst of all an oversized cap like the one Jack Nicholson  in The Joker's guise  would wear in BATMAN 1989!. Besides the film's overall visual style is pretty uninspired apart from the stalkings done from the killer's POV with its eye squarely on the narrative's exploitable elements  witness the numerous wholly gratuitous sex scenes and even featuring a dance pirouette that culminates in a striptease! The dubbing too is among the worst I've had to sit through for this type of film.

Be careful though because this is the kind of movie where even the cane itself might be a red herring. The final revelation of the motivation of the killer is always enjoyably ridiculous in gialli but here it is just plain dumb. The only thing that might recommend this movie is the gratuitous nudity. EVERY woman that appears on the screen in this movie finds a reason to get naked including a memorable scene where a ballerina suddenly decides to go topless during her routine. Even this becomes a liability howeverNieves Navarro is actually a pretty good actress and I'm sure no one will complain about her two gratuitous sex scenes but does she really need to stand out around bareass naked when all she's doing is discussing the case with her boyfriend? In its favor this movie DOES have some amount of visual style and it will probably be looked on more favorably when it is released on legitimate DVD which shouldn't be too longTHREE Nieves Navaro gialli have been released in the last six months.

Anyway Death carries a cane tells a story that managed to keep my attention till the end but the highlights of the film are the images and the soundtrack.I think of cinema as a conjunction of images sounds and words used to tell a story. In this way a film can reach dimensions far beyond the reach of literature  the imagessounds should not be just servants of the words or story they should also be active agents in the film. From the sixties onward under the influence of the nouvelle vague the camera became much freer. Godard was one of the icons of that era  his creative use of images music lighting and words was a shining light for many filmmakers that came after.In Death carries a cane one can feel this freedom of creation. The story is simple enough Kitty Susan Scott a fashion photographer witnesses a murder. She sees indistinctly through a telescope a man all dressed in black crowned with a black hat typical giallo! stabbing a girl to death. She warns the police but no one takes her seriously  Kitty didn't know where exactly the killing had taken place and where was the body? The body is at last found and the investigations begin. More killings occur and with each killing the killer seems to be getting nearer Kitty...Death carries a cane offers everything one can expect from a giallo  intelligent cameras lighting and editing pretty women and sensuality galore. And one can say that Maurizio Pradeaux has learnt his Argento. The staging of the killings is creatively done  sounds cameras soundtrack and lighting are effectively used to create a suspenseful atmosphere. Many red herrings are thrown around to confuse the viewer and enhance the fun.There are many pretty women Scream Queen Susan Scott Nieves Navarro Anuska Borova playing two different roles! Cristina Tamborra etc...This is a hardtofind film but years ago Death carries a cane was released in Germany under the title Die Nacht der rollenden Kpfe with audio versions in English and German. As a matter of fact Die Nacht der rollenden Kpfe was rereleased this year 2008 but unfortunately only in the German version.".

	schema:headline " Brain damaging goodness!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a remarkably silly giallo that begins with Susan Scott messing with a coin operated telescope in Rome and randomly witnessing a woman being stabbed to death in a house. At first she tries to get help from a policeman passing by with his family but he refuses pointing out he's actually a fireman and that he can't help anyway as his wife will get him into trouble. This daftness will continue!Susan remembers that the murderer had a limp and was dressed in black and it looked like several people witnesses him leave. Susan's boyfriend also has a limp plus he's an artist who uses fabric dummies to stab to death as some sort of crappy art project. These dummies are made by Susan and according to him It's the only thing she does well...apart from making love. This he tells to policeman George Martin who doesn't believe she witnessed anything...until they actually find the corpse to which Susan exclaims happily Hey! They found my corpse!Susan is also friends with journalist Kitty who is going out with a composer who can't get it up. Indeed it's the first thing Kitty tells Susan when she calls! Now it took me a while to figure it out but Kitty also has a sister played by the same actress who is going out with Luciano Rossi and the sister also has a limp and needs a cane to get around. Seeing Luciano who always plays weirdos or perverts actually having a normal relationship was the biggest shock of the film. You'd think he'd be shagging a crocodile while dressed as Ghandi. With a chair stuck up his arse.Of course the killer has a few witness to stab and the cops start finding cane marks everywhere which makes them suspect Susan's boyfriend. This leads the remaining characters on a journey to the truth broken only by Susan having to stop the action to go for a pee  twice! For no reason! Plus they have Luciano Rossi stare into a shop window full of razors just to confirm that he's definitely the film's red herring and Sal Borghese as the designer of a bag held by a witness who wants to link his fashion house to the murders for publicity.Not only is the film daft as hell but director Pradeuax packs it with wall to wall nudity as well including a lesbian flashback bit that someone else flashes back to later in the film. There was so much nudity that my mind started drifting to be honest but still I love films that are as mad as this.".

Susan's boyfriend also has a limp plus he's an artist who uses fabric dummies to stab to death as some sort of crappy art project. These dummies are made by Susan and according to him It's the only thing she does well...apart from making love. This he tells to policeman George Martin who doesn't believe she witnessed anything...until they actually find the corpse to which Susan exclaims happily Hey! They found my corpse!Susan is also friends with journalist Kitty who is going out with a composer who can't get it up. Indeed it's the first thing Kitty tells Susan when she calls! Now it took me a while to figure it out but Kitty also has a sister played by the same actress who is going out with Luciano Rossi and the sister also has a limp and needs a cane to get around. Seeing Luciano who always plays weirdos or perverts actually having a normal relationship was the biggest shock of the film. You'd think he'd be shagging a crocodile while dressed as Ghandi. With a chair stuck up his arse.Of course the killer has a few witness to stab and the cops start finding cane marks everywhere which makes them suspect Susan's boyfriend. This leads the remaining characters on a journey to the truth broken only by Susan having to stop the action to go for a pee  twice! For no reason! Plus they have Luciano Rossi stare into a shop window full of razors just to confirm that he's definitely the film's red herring and Sal Borghese as the designer of a bag held by a witness who wants to link his fashion house to the murders for publicity.Not only is the film daft as hell but director Pradeuax packs it with wall to wall nudity as well including a lesbian flashback bit that someone else flashes back to later in the film. There was so much nudity that my mind started drifting to be honest but still I love films that are as mad as this.";

	schema:reviewBody "Released during the height of Giallo's popularity Death Carries a Cane is a sadly lackadaisical film. It seems as though everyone involved couldn't really be bothered with the sole intention of creating another popular film on the mind of the director and scriptwriters. The acting is mundane the plot is highly derivative the scene settings are very bare and the character's motivations range from unlikely to completely ridiculous and more often than not are an obvious attempt at furthering the plot. The film seems to be taking Dario Argento's masterpiece 'The Bird With the Crystal Plumage' as its main inspiration as the plot centres on someone who witnesses part of a murder and endeavours to solve the case. The plot follows Kitty a young woman that while looking through an observation point spies a murder happening in a house across the street. After doubting her story the police do nothing but then the murders continue and Kitty's boyfriend ends up noticing that all of the murder victims were a part of a ballet group.Stylish murders are an important part of the Giallo so it's lucky that director Maurizio Pradeaux decided to do a good job with this area of the film. The murders are rather tame compared to other genre films but the director makes them stylish and shots of things such as the killer hiding under a bed or on the backseat of a car are good and the canerazor blade murder weapon combo features well. The film benefits from a strong Giallo cast including most notably Luciano Ercoli's spouse Susan Scott. Scott is largely wasted however as her role doesn't allow her strong screenpresence to shine through and she left only with the task of providing some nice nude shots. She is joined by her Ercoli Giallo costar Simn Andreu as well as prolific Italian horror star Robert Hoffman. The plot doesn't flow too well as the murders are the only standout parts of the film and much of the build upaftermath to them isn't interesting especially as the police investigation is mostly lacklustre and redundant. Overall Death Carries a Cane isn't a particularly bad Giallo but it's not a very good one either and Giallo fans can feel free to skip it.".

What really tends to push this one along is the actual murder mystery that plays out which is a rather intriguing and engaging storyline. Initially appearing to be centered around the incidental tourist the gradual reveal of the killers' vendetta against the ballerina company through the use of the mannequins being supplied by the boyfriend that ties everything together and brings them their involvement into the rampage. The buildup to this isn't that bad from the discovery of the bodies and the revelation of the handicap that spurs the interest in the two and provides this with some decent red herrings. That also leads this one into some enjoyable stalking moments that have a lot to like from the opening sequence involving the murderer striking which is seen through a telescope lens that runs out of time before the face can be seen the stalking of a witness through a darkened hallway where the killer again strikes out of nowhere and the tense chase on city streets to get away from a location containing clues to their identity as they race to find a phone from which to call and report on their findings. The finale in the house where the killer appears is exceptionally fun as well with the blackout and misidentification of the killer and the resultant chase through the grounds out to the backyard which has a shockingly tense confrontation in the greenhouse to finally resolve matters. Alongside the nicely frequent nudity present here from the capable performers these here are enough to hold it up over the problems present. The main issue at hand here is the fact that this one never really manages to offer any kind of enjoyable twist on the formulaic story presented. Once again this presents a film in which someone commits a murder seen only by the main character who has nobody else believe their story which is a rather flimsy pretext to start it off but it just dives into numerous cliches after that point. Rather than just dismiss the outrageous story as the ramblings of a deranged woman erring on the side of caution with someone reporting such an incident would've generated a far more interesting story here due to plainly going around the familiar plotline that comes along. The other big problem is that this leaves the film rather bland during the investigation here without too many bodies to knock off which is what leaves the film to feel draggedout in points that don't really need it.

For example I've never seen so many characters carrying canes or walking with limps for no other purpose than to throw suspicion their way. Death Carries a Can even includes twins. Yes twins! What a terribly tired old plot device. It's just lazy writing. Another perfect example of the problems with the plot comes near the end. In this kind of movie it's always easier to kill a character if they're separated from the other characters.

Like the plot the cinematography can also best be described as generally uninspired. It's dull looking. Finally if it weren't for Edwige Fenech Susan Scott could probably be considered the Queen of the Giallo. She's so underutilized in Death Carries a Cane that it ought to have been a crime. She disappears for a large chunk of the movie. And no offense meant to the other cast members but none are anywhere near as interesting as she is.

The camerawork acting music and direction are all flat and the storyline is almost a parody of the giallo genre. You won't guess who the killer is not because of the great twists and turns of the plot but because the filmmakers just drop the answer into your lap with little fanfare or setup at the very end. I was expecting more from this film and I doubt I'll be revisiting anytime soon. Check out Susan's work with director husband Luciano Ercoli from around the same time period especially Death Walks on High Heels if you want to see an example of an excellent giallo.".

	schema:headline " A sombre subdued and entirely enigmatic masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Like many other films from director Michelangelo Antonioni particularly those of his early trilogy looking superficially at the ideas of emptiness alienation and personal disconnection La Notte 1961 is less about traditional narrative storytelling and more about the rigid examination of a single theme and moment stretched out beyond the infinite. When the film starts we're already left with no doubt as to the fate of the couple central to the drama with the breakup of their marriage seeming like a positive inevitability given the disconnection and spatial alienation between the two. As with his following film L'Eclisse 1962 the most important scenes for understanding the film are those at the very beginning. Here Antonioni outlines the basic concerns of his narrative and the personalities of his characters as they attend the hospital bedside of a dying friend. This early scene  in which the differences between the central couple are highlighted and the emotional incompatibility further stressed is combined with a later scene in which the man confesses to his wife on the drive home that he was tempted by the sexual advances of a patient in the very same hospital  sets the scene for the crippling emotional fall out that will be clinically examined by the director throughout the rest of the film.From this point on the narrative of La Notte becomes an echo of this scene in which the couple wander from one setting to the next attempting to continue the facade of a happily married couple while the wife becomes more and more convinced of the inexorableness of their current situation. The style of the film with its stark black and white cinematography and emphasis on the dehumanising presence of cold concrete architecture that dwarfs and suffocates the characters in almost every single frame presents us with a world seemingly devoid of life. As with the final moments of L'Eclisse the overall tone of the film following the wife's crisis of faith is one filled with cold claustrophobia uncertainty and an almost ambient sense of apocalyptic dread. As Lidia wanders a disintegrating landscape of old buildings empty streets and dilapidated relics desperately in search of the past she finds only unfathomable ciphers engaging in either violence or triviality as a last gasp attempt to reclaim a certain joy out of the natural ennui of modern life. Unlike the gang of men brutally cheering on a vicious fist fight or the crowd of gawping onlookers who watch fireworks being shot out of a field Lidia is again cut off and disconnected unable to comprehend or even gleam any sense of the most simple of pleasure from these moments as her personal trip inadvertently takes her back to the place she once lived so many years before.This lengthy sequence is something of a lynchpin to the story showing how the eventual realisation that her marriage is over isolates Lidia even further from the world around her and her vain attempts to still forge a connection with it even if it involves revisiting the past. While Lidia wanders the backstreets and empty lots Giovanni escapes into himself returning to their highrise apartment block and watching the world unfold through the window whilst failing to question just why Lidia has yet to return home. The contrast between these two sequences creates two further important factors in the shaping and understanding of this film one of which is tied to Antonioni's primary concern of sight and perception. The director cements this notion with the opening credits which fade in over a descending crane shot along the front of the couple's highrise apartment building with the vast and seemingly endless cityscape of Milan reflected within the ocean of glass that continue down and down until we lose all perspective.Throughout the film Antonioni has characters framed through windows and mirrors reflected in glass or isolated by the shot composition and its relation to the production design. This continues the theme of examination as the characters are presented as specimens once again further detached from the audience and from themselves as abstract reflections through panes of polished glass. With this in mind La Notte isn't the most inviting of films with the loose structure lengthy scenes and rigid emotions making it something that many viewers may be turned off by. Although on my initial viewing I found it rather long I was never bored with the great performance from Jeanne Moreau and Antonioni's always fascinating use of cinematography location design editing and direction keeping me enthralled from the first scene to the last. Although it lacks the alienlike mystery of L'Eclisse the ending of La Notte is no less thought provoking or enigmatic presenting a complicated interpersonal gesture that seems to go against everything that we might have expected for these characters but in the end becomes almost completely indicative of their previous personal abstractions.Although I don't want to give too much away in regards to the last ten minutes I will say that the most important aspect of this stark dnouement is the letter that is read by Lidia to her husband as they sit sadly in the sand trap. At first we assume that the letter paints Giovanni as the sensitive romantic unable to express his love in any other form than on the page. However when we think about the letter we realise just how bland and unremarkable Giovanni's writing actually is casting light onto the previous scenes of his struggles with creativity pontification and his status as a minor celebrity. This revelation shows the selfishness and desperation of the act to follow and again shows that the character of Lidia is still willing to forge an attempted connection with the world that she once knew no matter how selfless and tortured.".

However if you are looking for what the Cinema can do without a bluescreen to enlighten engross and even dare I say it entertain while at the same time shedding some light on human relationships  this film comes highly recommended. Excellent cast too!With his refinement and cinematic artistry Antonioni was definitely hitting on all cylinders during the early 60's doing stories that would probably raise a loud 'HUH?' at a Hollywood pitch session  then or now.While I don't rate this at quite the same level as L'Aventura this is up there with the best of his films IMHO.".

	schema:headline " Interpersonal soulsearching in 1960s Milan";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is nothing short of an artistic and visual triumph. Apart from being a fine example of the greatest era of European art cinema I like to consider it an artistic statement in photography music and architecture. The modernist functionalist spirit of booming 1960s Milan is captured marvelously as the stars walk aimlessly around apartmentbuildings and stateoftheart houses under the sounds of cool cocktailjazz. In fact I think that there are at least 1015 scenes that if 'frozen' could be seen as highquality artistic photographs in and by themselves. It's the marvelous cinematography and the divine stars that render such movies immortal even though they tackle such dated issues as the relation of intellectuals with politics and money the role of art in overcoming modernity's excesses and the vulgar conduct of the bourgeoisie. Of course the movie is rendered timeless because its main theme  alienation and intramarital fatigue is equally timeless. Marcelo and Jeanne go through one night flirting with other people and trying to hurt each other as much as possible because in fact there is no other way one can impact on the other's life any more. They fail to do this but this is not necessarily good They end up back where they started indifferent and apathetic. That they finally become conscious of this development is their only gain from the night. The dying friend is the catalyst for the couple to start examining its situation but it is the ravishing Valentina that first shook them and forced them to go out of their way finding alternative routes and employing other people in their doomed efforts to instill some new life in their relationship. What Valentina teaches them is that accepting your existentialist apathy is a good first step in dealing with your situation. But when she bids farewell to the audience with the words 'You have exhausted me you two' while the light goes gently down we understand that even a young inquiring person like her has already been surrendered to the boredom of modern life. For all the confessions that follow the main issue of the movie is already resolved It is more of an issue if the couple will face their situation not if they can remedy it. Their feelings have disappeared just like Valentina's lust for life and the dying friend who passed away during the night.".

The symbols have been all used up exhausted just as the couple's love has been all used up. The truth of this film resides for me in its final scene when Moreau Lidia reads the old love letter out to Giovanni as a cold morning mist snakes around the golf course. It talks about waking up next to her and possessing her so completely that she is no longer herself but part of him utterly owned 'an image I want to keep forever.' But now the image is tarnished forgotten and the woman is alone abandoned free of her cage but utterly lost in the dark mean streets of modernity.".

The truth of this film resides for me in its final scene when Moreau Lidia reads the old love letter out to Giovanni as a cold morning mist snakes around the golf course. It talks about waking up next to her and possessing her so completely that she is no longer herself but part of him utterly owned 'an image I want to keep forever.' But now the image is tarnished forgotten and the woman is alone abandoned free of her cage but utterly lost in the dark mean streets of modernity.";

Because having dissected with simple precision the crushing dilemmas of whether or not love is possible realizing this ineffability of human connection he could see this was not the end of our suffering and if this was not the end we could still not rule conclusively that we have no chance to attain peace in this life.After he concluded with the two lovers willingly not pursuing their feelings at the end of L'Eclisse he turned inwards and with each subsequent film he peered under one more veil of false perception. But what was he trying to look into in La Notte what does he find here? La Notte is a step behind L'Eclisse naturally. Here love matters or is thought that it should to the bitter end. The finale is overbearing with pessimism then because love fails to be that saving grace that we're still alone consumed by our desires. But that's not all of it either.Even when Mastroyanni painfully knows that the love he cherished has vanished with time and habit he still clings to it. Even a dragging routine is preferable than the emptiness of solitude. This is how love functions here as a shelter that soothes the existential pains or a mask that mercifully obscures them.But these people are not simply lost adrift in faceless crowds and cold rooms they're clinging on the craving of desire for their salvation. When I say that the mind is not transcended yet in these films of Antonioni's alienation phase it's because it still dictates desire the terms under which a meaningful life should be pursued.But to show that love is not our saving grace because it's subject to the whims and tedium of time would be to concede that we are merciless at the hands of higher forces beyond our control that we're not masters of our fate. It was important in this aspect to go a step beyond to show us characters become aware of the emptiness of desire by willingly giving up on it. But for that we'd have to go ahead to L'Eclisse and Il Deserto Rosso.By itself La Notte may seem like it's laboriously pondering to say too little. As part of an oeuvre though it has a place that can't be dismissed lightly.".

	schema:reviewBody "La Notte is very content to be a film seemingly about the mundane in the bourgeois world of an Italian couple. But what makes it worthwhile is that the time that Antonioni gives for the scenes and actors to breathe ironically enough considering their social and intimate repression allows for some curious moments to slip through some of his best directed. The married couple here of the great Marcello Mastroianni and faceofathousandwords Jeanne Moreau are not necessarily unhappy but unsatisfied with how their lives are at this point. The husband is a very successful and admired author and they are well off. But the question still arises underneath as the subtext in many scenes what's it all really worth? Two of the main setpiecessequences in the film revolve around Moreau walking around aimlessly through the city while her husband is at a signing party and at a rich party at night with a spacious amount of room for the guests.All of these little seemingly mundane moments are not all that the film is made up of and it is in this existential if it is relatively speaking crisis for this couple that what real life that's out there and real pains strike up here and there. I loved the moment where Mastroianni is confronted by a seemingly crazy girl at the hospital is she really crazy or just desperate for someone's affection or attention she is later beat into submission by the nurses? Or when Moreau sees a fight break out with some young men in the less welloff section of town the hesitation and surprise suddenly throws the fighters off. The party itself wherein the 'Night' of the title is revealed has moments of dialog that strike up the symbolic points Antonioni is making. But unlike the director's previous film the visualside of the cinematography has its moments but not necessarily as extraordinary in its overall makeup. Yet the initial peaks of interest both in the actors particularly Moreau who is always a treasure and in the final contemplative act with Monica Vitti endures with better results.Maybe the least in the 'trilogy' that Antonioni made between 1960 and 1962 which still makes it more watchable than the usual arthouse bores of late. There is almost TOO much room for pondering about these characters which makes for what could be seen as 'dull' but it really isn't. Detached maybe but not hard to connect with if open enough this is a very good film if not one of the director's best.".

	schema:headline " Loving to depict bourgeois alienation Antonioni shows here a couple's marriage breaking down with Monica Vitti as a delightful foil";
	schema:reviewBody "In the late 1950s and early 1960s the Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni shot a series of films exploring the psychological torment of his bourgeois protagonists. In spite of the wealth and security they established they had no idea what they wanted in life or what they were supposed to do. In spite of busy social lives they found it impossible to truly connect with other people. LA NOTTE from 1961 is one of these and I think it's the very best of them.As the film opens one morning in Milano married couple Giovanni Marcello Mastroianni and Lidia Jeanne Moreau visit their friend Tomasso Bernhard Wicki in the hospital as he lays dying. Lidia is clearly shaken by the experience and after Giovanni leaves for an appearance to promote his new book the camera tracks Lidia through a long aimless walk around Milano as she processes her thoughts. Here Antonioni anticipating his later film Il Deserto Rosso shows the drastically changing face of Milano in the postwar construction boom and the appearance of new tech gadgetry in everyday life as just one more way people can feel they have nothing certain they can hold on to in this world.Giovanni and Lidia while never outright squabbling have clearly grown cold towards each other. Gradually one begins to wonder if there is any life left in their marriage whatsoever. Things come to a head however when Giovanni and Lidia go that evening to a party at a rich industrialist's villa and Antonioni's favourite actress Monica Vitti appears. Vitti's role as a foil to Giovanni and Lidia is powerful and moving but I think its precise nature should be left unsaid here as it's better audiences aren't spoiled first.A mere description of the plot might seem like nothing happens in this film besides bored people talking and yet another midcentury European cinematic tale of adultery. But LA NOTTE is a film of incredible visual poetry almost like the work of Andrei Tarkovsky. Even scenes that evoke the characters' boredom are shot as such beautiful tableaux that the viewer is enraptured. Antonioni often shoots his characters reflected in mirrors and the like and there is some cinematic legerdemain here that just makes you go wow.Appearing in Antonioni's body of work between two similar films that are often considered a trilogy LA NOTTE has often got less buzz than its predecessor L'AVVENTURA with its daring plot twist or its successor L'ECLISSE with its chic Monica VittiAlain Delon love affair. But I think that in terms of the pictureperfect visuals and elegant pacing LA NOTTE deserves every bit as much praise as those other two classic films.".

	schema:reviewBody "La Notte The Night the 1961 film by Michelangelo Antonioni and the second of his Alienation Trilogy after L'Avventura and before L'Eclisse is a huge artistic leap up from its predecessor film. It's not so much that L'Avventura was such a bad film it's not. It has its moments and a good premise that swiftly decays into anomie and melodrama whereas La Notte even at an hour and fiftyfive minutes in length is a highly focused layered and concentrated adult drama about the ennui that occurs in a marriage of dilettantes where all of one's life has been plotted out beforehand yet happiness still eludes its participants. Yet La Notte is not Italian neorealism in the vein of what dominated that country's cinema in the prior decade and this is clear from this film's opening shots of slowly scaling down the side of a skyscraper to the strains of an otherworldly jazzlike score. The straight lines of the building and the reflected isolation of the city of Milan dead in its modernity evoke the suffocating sterility of the Precisionist painters and a barred prisonlike feel that permeates the film from start to finish. The film was shot in a gauzey black and white that smears beautifully both polar colors into a stark and desistant gray. There is probably no bleaker landscape in film that than which may be called Antonionian. The sight of decaying urban areas along with the odd film score and the moments of lunacy and borderline surrealism lends the whole film a hermetic quality. It is as if the film is its own world and apart from that which the viewer experiences every day. It could be set almost at any time in the last century and in almost any major urban area. Not even Ingmar Bergman captures emotional desolation so well for that director's obsessional penchant for closeups of the human face are too irresistibly inviting to imbue emotion into whereas Antonioni spurns closeups for immuring and trammeling his characters in complex visual compositions.The plot however of La Notte is very simple yet the simpleminded are those most wont to dismiss the whole film as being 'simple' even though it is one of the most complex and realistic films ever to depict a marriage. It follows one day from early morning to the next early morning in the life of a couple. Giovanni Pontano Marcello Mastroianni just off his superstarmaking turn in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita is a famed and highly lauded novelist who also makes a living writing magazine articles. He has enough money to live comfortably in a chic Milanese high rise apartment tower replete with a domestic and all the modern amenities of that era's present. His wife Lidia Jeanne Moreau whom he's been married to for almost a decade cannot stand him any longer and comes from a wealthy family. The writing by Antonioni Ennio Flaiano and Tonino Guerra is masterful and whereas the screenplay in L'Avventura sometimes felt as if it was a bad soap opera especially in the second half this film crackles with depth realism and dialogue that is first rate. Antonioni never forcefeeds his viewer what he wants them to think and lets things remain open for personal imbuement. The cinematography Gianni Di Venanzo is not as spectacular as the island scenery that dominates L'Avventura but it is far more intense and deliberate. The acting by Marcello Mastroianni as Giovanni is outstanding and far richer and deeper than his more lauded performance in Fellini's 8 a few years later. Jeanne Moreau is not an emotional zombie for we see in her reactions to the streetfight and Roberto that despite being a spoiled brat she does have some depth. And we see the same thing in Monica Vitti's character Valentina for she is merely a younger version of Lidia. Were Giovanni to choose her over his wife doubtless in a decade this film would play itself out again with Vitti as the new Lidia and a younger sexier standin as the new Valentina. The acting in this film is so much 'realer' than the fluff Hollywood puts out even back then because the actors are not projecting themselves into roles but letting the roles take them over. Whereas a Tom Cruise or Julia Roberts is always that persona in a slightly different role Marcello Mastroianni and Monica Vitti equally huge international stars in their day are always actors first and stars second.Yet the most frustrating thing about this film is how few critics famed and online anonymities appreciate just how drastically better this great film is over its predecessor in all ways. Yes L'Avventura may have made Antonioni a 'name' but La Notte made him a great filmmaker. Those that find this film too slow or claim it has no 'action' simply will never get what real art is about. They live in a stupor devoid of the pinpricks that a work of art like this can give. Fortunately the characters within the frame are not so hopeless and in the scars that their pricks bear to the viewer the engaged and intelligent viewer in turn will know not only what to salve but where.".

The acting in this film is so much 'realer' than the fluff Hollywood puts out even back then because the actors are not projecting themselves into roles but letting the roles take them over. Whereas a Tom Cruise or Julia Roberts is always that persona in a slightly different role Marcello Mastroianni and Monica Vitti equally huge international stars in their day are always actors first and stars second.Yet the most frustrating thing about this film is how few critics famed and online anonymities appreciate just how drastically better this great film is over its predecessor in all ways. Yes L'Avventura may have made Antonioni a 'name' but La Notte made him a great filmmaker. Those that find this film too slow or claim it has no 'action' simply will never get what real art is about. They live in a stupor devoid of the pinpricks that a work of art like this can give. Fortunately the characters within the frame are not so hopeless and in the scars that their pricks bear to the viewer the engaged and intelligent viewer in turn will know not only what to salve but where.";

When Lidia learns of Giovanni's infidelity the two must ultimately confront the truth of what their marriage has become in the picture's poetic climax.Mastroianni Moreau and Vitti all give fine performances. The cinematography of Antonioni and DOP Gianni Di Venozo perfectly illustrates the film's themes placing characters against their highly modern milieus and articulating what Adorno described as the alienating effect of technology on the modern consciousness. Meanwhile the screenplay by Antonioni and Tonino Guerra is La notte's driving force it has the power of a highly affecting novel every minute hurtling towards the film's inevitable conclusion.In summary La Notte elaborates on themes present in L'avventurra in my humble opinion improving on its predecessor film. An alltime favorite of both Stanley Kubrick and Ingmar Bergman those looking for a film experience that is thoughtprovoking emotional and artful would do well to seek it out.".

They don't argue or fight. They're just quietly beginning to lead separate lives.It's all pretty desperate though underneath the politesse. Together they visit a close friend dying painfully in the hospital. They bring him a few gifts but don't have much to say except for the patient who occasionally squirms with agony. This is some hospital by the way. Here is the patient receiving morphine yet the staff allow his visitors to bring him a bottle of champagne  which Mastroianni shares but Moreau does not.When Marcello leaves alone a young woman who is a patient approaches him in the corridor and pulls him into her room kissing him avidly biting his thighs throwing off her clothing and spreadeagling herself on the bed. She pulls the hesitant Marcello down to her just as the nurses burst in and begin to slap the woman robustly.Driving Moreau home he describes this incident to her but she's not particularly interested.There follows a full ten or fifteen minutes while the camera follows Moreau on a walk around the streets of Milan. She glances at a man slouching against a wall. He glances back. She engages a taxi and tells the driver to wait while she continues her aimless stroll. She witnesses a fist fight. She witnesses some amateurs in a field experimenting with homemade rockets. She crosses street. She says a few words to a wailing little girl. That's it. About fifteen minutes of it.Even after watching what amounts to an introduction it's clear what Antonioni is getting at but the introduction is dull.The photography is not. Each shot is exquisitely framed in black and white. The location shooting is evocative. Milan can be as crummy as any other industrial city. I've never been particularly impressed by Jeanne Moreau's talent although she may be a nice lady in real life. But Mastroianni is always good  handsome but not too handsome reserved but not too much and infallibly polite. He can handle either drama as here or comedic roles as in the hilarious Big Deal on Madonna Street. His best performance and perhaps his best film was as the journalist in La Dolce Vita wallowing in a trough between two gigantic waves that finally wash him up on a sea shore where he can no longer hear the angels sing.It's extremely well done for what it is. But what it is is problematic and to the extent that it's not it's depressing. I took a sensitive young girl on a date to see L'Aventura and she was devastated by the rampant anomi. It turned more intense with the final shots of empty streets in L'Eclisse. It's definitely worth seeing. I can't imagine that anything resembling a film like this a mystery really would be greenlighted today certainly not by the MBAs in Hollywood. Sawbones 5  that's their style.".

Aesthetically it's a very beautiful film right from the memorable credits sequences with the camera panning down a skyscraper while dissonant sounds emanate from the soundtrack which according to Ciak a renowned Italian film magazine was one of Stanley Kubrick's favorites. In retrospect this doesn't come as much of a surprise since its influence can clearly be seen on his final opus EYES WIDE SHUT 1999 what with the lengthy party sequence of the Antonioni film which takes up the entire second half and the two leads' largely unfulfilled sexual odysseys which eventually bring them closer together.The film won the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival and both female leads also emerged as winners of various awards. Though Antonioni was also criticized for rendering Marcello Mastroianni dull I thought that he gave a fine performance undoubtedly the most important Italian star of his generation he managed to divide his career neatly between auterist films and more popular entertainments. Of course Jeanne Moreau was also the top French actress of her time actually this proved to be both actors' only time working with Antonioni before they eventually lent their services to his comeback film BEYOND THE CLOUDS 1995 following a debilitating stroke which has left him speechless to this day now 94 years old he's still active and I consider myself extremely fortunate to have seen him  indeed he was seated in a wheelchair just a few paces away from me!  at the 2004 Venice Film Festival where he was 'presenting' his latest offering the threeparter EROS. Bernhard Wicki a director in his own right appears towards the beginning as a dying friend of Moreau and Mastroianni whom they visit in hospital it is here actually that Marcello has his first fling  with a nymphomaniac patient  thus setting the plot in motion!".

When they visit a friend who's dying in hospital at the outset of the movie Lidia sees in that friend the emotion and feeling that should be present in her husband. That visit sets up the passage they take though the night first at a reception then at a nightclub  where they witness a sexy cabaret act that points out the lack of passion in their life then to an all night mindless society party. They both dabble at liasons at the party and come the dawn Giovanni makes a stab at emotion and reconciliation. Too late she reads a love letter to him that he wrote to her years ago and he asked who wrote that? and Lidia tells him that she doesn't love him and he doesn't love her either. Despite the slow unfolding and heavy symbolism the city of Milan overtakes the couple and prison bars are reflected everywhere and Giovanni's sleepwalking this movie held me entranced. Movies about feelings  especially when no words are spoken  aren't made anymore and the movie world is poorer for it.".

Apparently going to lavish parties with other depressed people isn't helping much. The illness and death of a friend brings things down further. Marcello seems to have the same presence in many films. He is on the surface a cad but an artistic one. He is submerged in existential depths and enjoys nothing. Jeanne Moreau almost never smiles. She knows that to keep her husband she has to go along with his games and even then he accepts her on his own terms. How can we really relate to these rich selfish people who have nowhere to go. They make mundane seem desirable. The film is lavish and the cinematography stunning. The performances are just right and yet the characters they play are not very sympathetic.".

There are a pack of humongous starving shrews loose on a desolate island. A bunch of scientists travel to the island to be terrorized by the shrews.Okay so the dogs yowling because they have wet bathmats appended to their backs and masks to their faces are hilarious I mean terrifying the attempts made to conceal their caninity are also veeeery clever Thorn Sherman is heroically disinterested the music is horrifyingly melodramatic hackneyed theories involving the shrews abound and the method of escape is one of the most laughingly novel ever recorded on film. All of this and the realization that these people spend most of the film living in paralyzing fear of the silliest monsters ever created make this film great. The interior shots are filmed inside the greatest cabin ever. It is difficult to discern whether the walls are decorated with wallpaper or are just supposed to be extremely filthy.

There are a pack of humongous starving shrews loose on a desolate island. A bunch of scientists travel to the island to be terrorized by the shrews.Okay so the dogs yowling because they have wet bathmats appended to their backs and masks to their faces are hilarious I mean terrifying the attempts made to conceal their caninity are also veeeery clever Thorn Sherman is heroically disinterested the music is horrifyingly melodramatic hackneyed theories involving the shrews abound and the method of escape is one of the most laughingly novel ever recorded on film. All of this and the realization that these people spend most of the film living in paralyzing fear of the silliest monsters ever created make this film great. The interior shots are filmed inside the greatest cabin ever. It is difficult to discern whether the walls are decorated with wallpaper or are just supposed to be extremely filthy. The mantel features a haphazardly placed set of candle holders a beer stein a clock set horizontally on the edge and all to emphasize the focal point of the room a picture hanging above the mantel of horse legs beside a lake.

The acting really wasn't too bad in this film nor were the characterizations themselves. James Best as Captain Thorne Sherman que macho eh? stands out as the bestacted of the troupe in his role as the freelance boat captain stranded on the island by a hurricane and forced to rally the few inhabitants against the menace of the shrews.

James Best is convincing as the rougharoundtheedges nononsense Captain Sherman and despite the slimy nature of his character Ken Curtis who also produced the film plays his part well. Furthermore the character Griswold is jovial and lighthearted albeit a bit unlucky And if you can manage to work through the incoherency of some of the lines the dialogue is halfdecent in some scenes I'd even say it's good particularly one of the scenes where Captain Sherman talks to Ann the daughter of one of the doctors. Also the alcohol switch Jerry pulls on Thorne in one particular scene is truly cinematic comedy and I am convinced that it was intentional. I don't mean to offer a false pretense this is not a great film and in truth most filmgoers likely couldn't make it through the entire movie without falling asleep.

The howling wind lightening and music are beautifully done for the soundtrack. The Shrew monsters are believable and not cheaply appearing as monsters too often are in other flicks of that era. Some reader comments on this forum suggest that the Shrews are collie dogs well maybe they are but it certainly is not obvious. The shrews were filmed in a very creative and professional way to make them believable. Some moviegoers only enjoy modern computer graphic action movies and those types will never be satisfied with the artistically crafted creations that preceded this current age in time. Personally I prefer noncomputer graphic generated movies. Ken Curtis renowned as Festus in the TV series Gunsmoke produced and starred in this movie. He did an excellent job as supporting actor and had some action packed fights with the lead actor James Best with Best employing some of his other profession in this film having been a Black Belt in karate in real life. I give the movie a ten out of ten rating based on its originality and nonstop action.".

Shrews are primitive mammals with high metabolism rates. They consume their own weight in food every couple of hours. They are known to attack animals larger than themselves.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS With their little beady eyes and murderous poisontipped fangs flashing a wolfpack of some 200 to 300 giant killer shrews have overrun an almost deserted island off the US Atlantic coast devouring everything on it in order to stay alive and not starve to death. These killer shrews were a experiment in world population control that went wrong by Dr. Mio Craigis Bruch Lumet and his colleague Dr. Baines Gordon McLendod who were on he island with Dr. Craigis' gorgeous daughter Ann Ingrid Goude and the doctors assistant Jerry Ken Curtis and the handyman Mario Alfredo De Soto. It was Jerry who while in a drunken stupor left the cages of the shrews open for them to escape and multiply in the wild and become the deadly threat that they are now. Jerry also became the shrews main course for lunch the next afternoon. In the middle of all this the skipper Capt. Thorne Sherman James Best and his good friend and 1st as well as only mate Rook Judge Henry Dupree come ashore to bring the monthly supply of food and medicine for the island staff not knowing just what their in for. Trying to keep the news of the deadly shrews from them the skipper an his mate Rook is later killed and eaten by a gang of shrews as he went back to bring the supplies ashore. With the skipper now taking charge he and the people on the island try to hold off the deadly shrews as they devour everything alive on the island as they plan to keep the shrews outside their compound long enough for them to cannibalize each other until their all destroyed before devouring them but the deadly shrews have other planes. Fairly good horror thriller with the skipper saving the day as well as the island survivors Dr. Craigis  Ann as well as in the end getting the girl Ann and planing with her to repopulate the earth. In spite of the acute food shortage that Ann's father Dr. Craigis was trying to alleviate. Even though many people and critics made fun of the killer shrews looking like dogs wearing badly motheaten fur coats they were as real and as terrifying as Hollywood could make them look back then 1959. The movies ending was both tense as well as exciting as the skipper the doctor and the girl escaped with steel drums turned over on them and tied together to protect them from the shrews. As they slowly trekked from the island compound to the sea and then swam to the skippers boat to freedom and safety. Gordon McLendon easily stole the show as the absentminded Dr. Baines who you sometime needed subtitles to understand his babbling all kinds of scientific lingo that nobody in the theater audience as well as almost every one in the movie cast could understand. Baines was so focused on his work that when Mario died from a killer shrew bite he excitedly said that isn't it wonderful that the poison that we put out as bait to kill the shrews was absorbed in their systems and has now become part of their natural chemistry! WHAT A NUT!!! Also later when Dr. Baines was attacked and bitten by a charging killer shrew he goes to his typewriter and typed out the symptoms of the poison from the bite that would eventually kill him up until the moment that he expired!".

Being prepared for it being bad did not shape my judgment on the movie nor did it shape my judgment when I saw its cinema brother The Giant Gila Monster another lowbudget blackandwhite flick with horrible special effects bad acting a weak storyline and preposterous moments. Both were directed by Ray Kellogg and both have gone on to be considered cult classics for being so cheap. While I did feel that The Giant Gila Monster was tedious and really uninteresting I do feel compelled to praise The Giant Shrews for being although very cheap and ridiculous fun and entertaining. Even though the movie is very VERY bad there is something about it that I found entertaining in a silly way. It's not scary or freaky but I did not laugh as much as I expected nor did I yawn as much as I expected.The special effects on this film are even worse than those used in The Giant Gila Monster. The 'killer shrews' are a combination of two things coon dogs covered unconvincingly in animal skins and goofylooking puppets with fourinch plastic fangs coming out of their nearly immobile jaws. Neither effect was anything to be proud of yet for some reason they do appear compelling enough given the nature of the film they're being utilized in. Thankfully they did not use the liveaction dogs as much I was thinking they would that would have totally thrown it all off and destroyed any entertainment value.The plot is just as preposterous. Some scientists on a remote island decide that they can save the world from overpopulation by drastically decreasing our physical size so we won't consume our resources so much. They experiment on shrews a species they admit is dangerous when they're hungry and for some reason make them bigger instead of smaller. With a hurricane approaching their only hope is to leave the island so that the shrews will eat each other and then starve to death and thus the world will be saved. From start to finish the storyline is laughable yet I did not pan it so much as I was watching it. I just accepted it for what it was an even though it was totally unbelievable I didn't bother myself so much with thinking about how absurd it was.The special effects are bad the plot is bad the acting is bad the music is okay given the movie's style and overall The Killer Shrews is undeniably a very bad movie. Yet for some reason I did find myself liking it and not because it was so ludicrously stupid and dumb it was for some reason I do not understand. But this definitely stands over the contemporary lowbudget monster flicks with fake CGI monsters and even blander casts and plot conventions.".

Along with the independents came various 'Horror' or 'SciFi' themed shows such as WPIX's Chiller Theater  complete with Claymation hand spooky music and the groaning voice moaning out ...Chhhhhhiiiiillllleeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! and WNEW's Creature Features  starring a fellow dubbed The Creep who actually looked more like a typical 70's Vegas singer than any kind of 'ghoul'... Well anyway for those of us in that age bracket movies like The Killer Shrews take us back to a time when a movie didn't have be filled with tons of gore or overflowing with overthetop violence to scare you... and let me tell you as cheesy as Shrews appears to me now as a 40something this movie absolutely scared the CRAP out of me when I was a 10 yearold! Picture a bunch of kids sitting in front of a 19 inch BW TV down in the musty old basement no other lights on watching a movie with scary doggieshrews that HIDE UNDER BASEMENT STAIRS just waiting to EAT YOU! Now throw in vivid 10 year old imaginations a few creaking floorboards shadows generated by the television maybe a little wind howling outside... well you get the picture. Fast forward a few decades. Channel surfing one night I happen to discover a local PBS station has a Friday night SciFi Movie slot scheduled for 9 every Friday. And  as luck would have it  this Friday's feature is The Killer Shrews!!! So it was with great anticipation that I watched this flick again for the first time in probably 25 or 30 yearswith my 11 year old daughter  who I am proud to say apparently inherited Dad's SciFi gene. On to the movie itself...Well for starters the film itself is grainy and a little dark at times. The black and white looks more like shades of gray. Definitely not a high dollar flick that's for sure. The human characters of the movie are so stereotypically 1950s it's not even funny. The cast features 1 Black guy 1 Latino guy 1 German professortypewith a blonde bombshell Swedish sounding daughter? a Drunk and the 'Hero' guy  who turns out is Roscoe P. Coltrane from The Dukes Of Hazzard TV show !!! Before the movie is into the first 5 minutes you just know the Black and Latino guys are gonna be shrewbait you can just see the lack of depth or dimension in their characters. The Black guy is basically Steppin Fetchit as a sailor the Latino fares a little better as a nerdy scientist  but his character is as dry as Melba toast! and worse off you can't understand a word he says... picture Speedy Gonzales as an intellectual! And  sure enough  these 2 are the first to die! Then there is the Drunk played by Festus from Gunsmoke. He is just a JERK throughout the entire movie you find yourself rooting for the shrews to chomp him to bits! Actually it is kinda funny just how much drinking and smoking goes on throughout the movie by ALL the main characters you would think the movie was bankrolled by Marlboro or Jack Daniels... The soundtrack is actually very good for a movie of this caliber. Suspenseful welltimed with the action downright eerie at times. The plot isn't too bad either as 50s SciFi goes. Boat sails into island to deliver supplies to local scientists. Said scientists have accidentally unleashed radioactively mutated giant shrews with poison fangs no less! onto said island. There is a hurricane approaching so boat can't leave. Giant shrews have eaten everything else on the island now look to humans as next meal. Black guy bites it screaming Lordy Lordy! Help me Lordy! as he gets eaten alive... Latino guy gets only a glancing scratch from a shrew that managed to eat its way THROUGH the compounds adobe walls then hide in the basement  but the scratch proves fatal due to the aforementioned poison fangs! Eventually only Papa Scientist Blondie Hero and Drunk are left as the shrews eat through various walls and doors in the house  finally forcing them into a small fenced courtyard. With nowhere else to go Hero gets idea. Ties together empty 55 gallon steel drums that just happened to be stored in the courtyard uses these as a sort of armored transport to get back to the coast shrews apparently can't swim. Drunk is totally jealous of Hero by now of course Blondie dumped Drunk for Hero and the two men duke it out for the umpteenth time in the movie. Drunk decides he's not going in armored tank Drunk climbs roof and starts shooting at shrews  who by now have busted into the courtyard! Hero Papa Scientist and Blondie scramble away towards the beach in their steel drum contraption  all the while shrews trying to get into the drums for a little snack! This part was actually still a little scary today in the ....BOOO!... kind of way as shrew fangs slobber and heads dart around the barrels desperately trying to get in. Switch back to Drunk who for no other reason then stupidity decides to leave the relative safety of the rooftop and make a run for it...Now everybody in every SciFi movie should already know... if you run you are a GONER. Of course Drunk is no exception  the ravenous shrews feast on his ginsoaked carcass as the other 3 finally hit the beach and swim out to safety... Film ends with a little prophetic ramble from Papa Scientist oddly coupled with Hero basically announcing to Papa he wants to impregnate Blondie?!All in all a great example of finely aged 50s SciFi cheese... I highly recommend it! so does my daughter".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen James Best in a few roles and he is a great actor. I even liked him in the Dukes of Hazzard. He was hilarious. In this role he is the exact opposite of Roscoe P Coltrane. He is a very rational mature man who essential saves everybody from their insanity. The movie starts with Best and an unknown black guy arriving on this island. I have to think about Dave Chappel or some other black comedian. You know that black character is going to be bumped off first. That's what happened. I guess that was 1959. The actors in the movie are really good. I can't believe that the bad guy is Festus Parker. He looks totally different than his TV show character. While the movie is silly at least it is suspenseful. I don't know why people are so upset about the shrews looking like dogs. It was 1959 not 2006. It didn't seem to bother me. One thing that was interesting was the island not being tropical. It looked like an island in a temperate region. The trees were deciduous. I suspect it was filmed in an island off New York. James Best though is a really good actor. He holds one's attention and has a lot of presence. Now 80 he is an acting coach in Hollywood.".

	schema:headline " It's A BMovie. What Do You Expect?";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's face it folks. B movies were to the 50s and 60s what straighttovideo is to us today. Low budgets thin plots just enough action and suspense to get people to look and spend enough money so the producers get a little profit. Plus it's a way for producers directors and actors most of whom couldn't in the door at a major studio to pay the rent and build up their resumes. For us the viewer it must have some appeal because we all seem to be watching the entire film so we can rip it to pieces.That said let's get to ripping this one.First of all keep in mind that the director is Ray Kellogg who also did The Giant Gila Monster and The Green Berets if that's not a diverse resume nothing is. The producer was Ken Curtis Festus from Gunsmoke. He had always wanted to make a movie and John Ford for whom Curtis had made films like The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance The Searchers and The Horse Soldiers encouraged him to go for it. Unfortunately Ken couldn't coach Ford into directing it.Next up...the plot. It concerns seven people trapped on a remote island during a hurricane. In addition to the people we have a few hundred shrews although we never see more than a dozen or so about the size of fullgrown dogs. Science strikes again. The movie then proceeds to show how the seven trapped people try to survive a few hundred hungry shrews trying to get at them.It seems a cadre of scientists trying to figure out a way to increase the human life span experiment on some shrews which are normally the size of a man's thumb. Shrews have a speedy metabolism and can be ready to reproduce in less than a month. Also they have to eat three times their own bodyweight every day or starve. Somehow the scientists mess up a batch of shrews which grow to enormous size. Clearly Ken Curtis was trying to borrow from Tarantula and Them with the premise but not bothering to explain how the shrews grew a thousandfold really hurts the plot. Somehow they also add in that the shrews now have poison in their saliva thanks to ingesting poisoned food set out as a trap figure that one out.The shrews escape thanks to a boozedup scientist played by Curtis. Being the producer he certainly could have made himself the leading man but he wisely chose to be the villain. If you saw him in The Searchers or Gunsmoke you'd realize he's not exactly leading man material. Now the shrews have multiplied and have eaten up all the food on the island. Except of course for the people.The movie starts off too slowly. A boat captain played by James Best yes Roscoe P. Coltrane from The Dukes of Hazzard and his engineer Judge Henry Dupree a minor jazz player of the time arrive at the island to bring supplies. They meet a professor Baruch Lumet veteran Broadway actor and father of director Sidney Lumet his nubile Swedish daughter Ingrid Goude Miss Sweden 1957 and a shotguntoting Ken Curtis. When Best tells them he's not leaving because of the approaching hurricane they all get nervous. We then have to watch them act scared and try not to reveal the shrews to Best. During this time they manage to drink up half the alcohol in sight.Only when the shrews finally show up and start picking off people does the action pick up. Curtis shows what kind of a coward he is and we almost wish he'd get fed to the shrews. I won't spoil the ending except to say it involves some ingenuity and a makeshift tank perhaps the most unique lifesaver in the history of horrorscience fiction.The movie ultimately succeeds best with the actors. Curtis of course cut his teeth with the legendary John Ford. James Best is very good although he admitted later to only doing the movie as a favor to his friend Curtis. Baruch Lumet shows off his stage presence. Gordon McLendon as Radford is a little annoying and stiff but he plays his death scene pretty well. Alfredo DeSoto as the caretaker makes the most of his time even goes down fighting. Of course being the lone Hispanic in the film he's as good as dead anyway. Ingrid Goude is one hot babe but she can't act but she's European and that's what counted to Kellogg he used a French actress who couldn't act in Giant Gila Monster.The only part I hated was Dupree as Rook the engineer. He's black and plays the part with that irritating stereotypical Stepin Fetchit routine that persevered in Hollywood until Sidney Poitier and Woody Strode came along. Being the only black guy in a science fiction film he has the word corpse stamped on his head before the opening credits roll. In Stepin Fetchitstyle roles as played by Fetchit and guys like Mantan Moreland in the Charlie Chan movies he talked ignorantly walked jolly and when in trouble froze in place acted stupid and cried out Oh Lordy! Well Dupree gets chased by the shrews climbs up a low tree and cries out Oh Captain! repeatedly with a stupid look on his face.Of course the downer for the film is the special effects. I don't think even Universal Studious could have come up with something resembling a giant shrew. Here with a thin budget the shrews are nothing but dogs with some fake hair and clay masks with wooden teeth painted white. For closeups you can tell someone offscreen is using a wooden head on the end of a stick. Amazingly Kellogg's gila monster looked more real.Still the visual effects are good. The film was shot in the middle of White Rock Lake in Dallas but the camera does a good job of not showing the opposing shoreline and making it look like the island is really in the middle of nowhere. The island was rented and they could only film on the backside of it but since most of the action takes place either at the compound everyone's trapped in or along the path to the water it doesn't hurt.But like I said at the beginning. It's a grade B movie and you're just supposed to have fun with it whether intentionally or unintentionally. Hey it beats big budget bombs like Glitter and The Mod Squad.".

	schema:headline " Far from great but mildly entertaining.";
	schema:reviewBody "In this cheesy bmovie horror yarn sailor Thorne Sherman James Best finds himself delivering supplies to a small group of scientists who are conducting experiments into the prevention of overpopulation. After taking something of an interest in the beautiful but apprehensive Ann Ingrid Goude  Miss Universe 1957 he accompanies the group back to their home where he meets the rest of the team and has a pleasant drink. With a hurricane imminent Thorne wishes to travel back to his boat but it is only when the otherwise timid Ann points a gun at him that he decides to stay and in turn learns the shocking truth of what the experiments have unleashed upon the island. Far from great but still mildly entertaining The Killer Shrews' was the directorial debut of regular special effects artist Ray Kellogg who created effects some photographic for more than eighty movies during the Forties and Fifties. Interestingly the special effects work in The Killer Shrews' left quite a lot to be desired and one has to question just how much input Ray had on the final results. In something of a stark contrast to the effects present in other Fifties creature features such as Them!' 1954 there is a distinct requirement for a great deal more imagination to see the creatures mutated shrews as anything more than what they actually were. One can easily be forgiven for finding amusement in seeing dogs collies I believe jumping up walls while wearing somewhat silly rubber masks and what appear to be mopheads. Close up shots of the mutated shrews show the viewer a remarkably cheap looking puppet. However the movie relies more on the implication that the shrews may be near or inside the building rather than overexposing the viewer to imagery of the shrews. In that respect the movie works. Removing the poor effects from consideration for a while the movie itself plays out nicely. Although the first fifteen minutes of this relatively short film move slowly it is not long before a fairly interesting multinarrative film. While the shrews take precedence in the film there is an interesting and ongoing clash between Thorne and Jerry Ken Curtis. In fact in some ways one could argue that The Killer Shrews' plays out as an early draft of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead' 1968. The rather wonderful ominous musical scoring help to create something of a foreboding atmosphere which unfortunately Ray Kellogg's direction fails to capitalise on. Without condemning the direction as bad there were moments when a stronger director would have been able to turn a potentially unnerving scene into an exhilarating thrillride. Sadly Kellogg's direction was awfully basic and while the potential was there throughout the movie Kellogg failed to capitalise and regrettably kept The Killer Shrews' in something of a stalemate. Unfortunately the often wonderful musical score occasionally added to the continual moments of absurdity that were present throughout the movie and generated laughs rather than fear.Jay Simms who wrote a number of similar films was responsible for the somewhat impressive screenplay which despite featuring sporadic moments of incoherence was the foremost reason that The Killer Shrews' worked in any way. One would suggest that a more experienced director may have been able to make something more of The Killer Shrews' but as it stands the movie is still enjoyable for one watch. The Killer Shrews' features generally credible and effective acting performances and a fairly interesting and entertaining story. It sadly lacks in the effects and direction departments. Fifties monstermovie fans should probably check it out although the movie does border on ludicrous. This one is apparently quite popular amongst fans of bad' films. My rating for The Killer Shrews'  610.".

Without condemning the direction as bad there were moments when a stronger director would have been able to turn a potentially unnerving scene into an exhilarating thrillride. Sadly Kellogg's direction was awfully basic and while the potential was there throughout the movie Kellogg failed to capitalise and regrettably kept The Killer Shrews' in something of a stalemate. Unfortunately the often wonderful musical score occasionally added to the continual moments of absurdity that were present throughout the movie and generated laughs rather than fear.Jay Simms who wrote a number of similar films was responsible for the somewhat impressive screenplay which despite featuring sporadic moments of incoherence was the foremost reason that The Killer Shrews' worked in any way. One would suggest that a more experienced director may have been able to make something more of The Killer Shrews' but as it stands the movie is still enjoyable for one watch. The Killer Shrews' features generally credible and effective acting performances and a fairly interesting and entertaining story. It sadly lacks in the effects and direction departments. Fifties monstermovie fans should probably check it out although the movie does border on ludicrous. This one is apparently quite popular amongst fans of bad' films. My rating for The Killer Shrews'  610.";

That is because the spend more time on mood and atmosphere instead of clonking the audience over the head with the point of the story. Like Squonkamatic said his review of this film you turn your brain on not OFF when you watch these types of films.Tons of atmosphere in this film. The Templars rising from their tombs and then mounting ghostly horseback! Well you just cant much better than that! I absolutely love the soundtrack as well with the moaningchanting Templar voices. The ending of this film also still packs a punch. THAT is a key sequence that must be seen it's complete form and THEN will you know why I titled this review as disturbing.Pick this up if you can. I have the double DVD from Anchor Bay which is outta print. Stick with the Anchor Bay VHS or wait because it might be coming out again supposedly in late 2005. All FOUR films in fact if the cards are played right and the planets align. I will have my fingers crossed and my prayers prayed for Blue Underground who has taken on this task.Rock on!".

	schema:headline " This zombie films mostly relies on atmosphere and suspense instead of gore and action";
	schema:reviewBody "La noche del teror ciego tells the story of a legion of evil warriors who lived through the 13th century known as the Templar Knights. These warriors wanted to live forever and the way to achieve that was by drinking human blood and offering sacrifices to Satan. So The Templar Knights would gladly torture and use innocent maidens for their rituals and please their master. However their atrocious deeds come to an end when the Holy Inquisition decides to punish them by hanging them in public. Several centuries later in the 1970s two girls named Virginia and Betty go on a trip together with a guy named Roger. After a pathetic soap opera incident Virginia gets jealous of her friends and jumps off the train. Landing on a strange place she finds shelter in some kind of forsaken fortress in ruins. Unfortunately that place is also a shelter for some hideously frightening creatures that become alive during the nightfall until dawn. Those creatures are in fact the Templar Knights who come back to life as zombies every night. Director Armando de Ossorio didn't try to please a bloodthirsty audience that wanted brutal killings for an hour and a half. For the contrary the body count may be humble but La noche del terror ciego takes the zombie subgenre to a different level in which the creatures are more dark mysterious and frightening than gory and brutal. If you are a zombie lover you're probably going to love this film and if you are not you might be pleasantly surprised by this.I have read on the message boards that there were a lot of gore lovers dissatisfied by the lack of blood and guts but I think this film contains a pretty wellbroughtup amount. My favorite scene in the entire movie is one in which one of the girls is trying to hide from the zombies. Since the zombies are blind the girl stays in the same room with them and the only thing she can do to remain undetected is staying absolutely quiet. But since she's so afraid and tense her heart starts beating more and more quickly and all of a sudden we see a closeup of her chest pointing out that she's on the verge of either fainting or running for her life. The living dead knights hear those heartbeats and turn to the poor girl who has no choice but finally running away in fear trying to avoid the nightmarish creatures. This was perhaps one of the most atmospheric situations I have ever seen in a zombie flick. To be honest most of the chasing sequences were practically faultless but that one in particular had to be remarked. Reading the message boards I also came across some people who also complained about a few unresolved questions like How could the zombies hear? Where did they get the horses? How come they were so strong if they were only skeletons?. The answer to all those questions could be this is a horror movie about living dead creatures and it's really not supposed to be realistic. To be honest I think the zombies were more believable than the pointless lesbian story between the two girls which didn't serve a purpose to the story. Then again most couples in horror movies make no sense anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am shocked to see the comments on this film by the users of the IMDB. Shocked and saddened Amando de Ossorio's BLIND DEAD films are the quintessential viewing experience for 1970's Eurohorror. This particular film is nothing short of a masterpiece though brain cell count and attention span deficit disorders that run rampant amongst the youth of today could account for SOME of the negative comments logged. Still ...The first BLIND DEAD film does NOTHING to set it's scene other than to show you Goyaesque views of a crumbling Spanish citadel ... One of the problems in assessing the cultural significance of a film that is 33 years old is related to how it is marketed and by marketing the BLIND DEAD films as Zombie Flesh Eating Gore Fests is to miss Ossorio's point. Therefore the distributors themselves might be as much to blame as any one factor  by trying to cash in on Zombie gorehounds and their easily parted with money companies like Anchor Bay took a beautiful little movie and turned it into an instant reseller's nightmare. If plot is something you look for in your films the BLIND DEAD movies will fall short. They will also fall short on the gore factor since Ossorio was using the gore effects as ways to color his pallete of moods see the first ten minutes of NIGHT OF THE SEAGULLSNIGHT OF THE DEATH CULT for the most vivid example. Ossorio was very much a director of moods and visuals rather than a strict trudging story line that plods from A to B to C and then you're through. Like most European horror from the early 1970's the stories are actually rather unimportant next to considerations like lighting texture color schemes and movement. If you watch a BLIND DEAD movie for a lightning fast paced blood soaked zombie fest OF COURSE you are going to feel like you wasted 15.Ossorio was making parables about his time I see this series as being very subversive commentaries on the Franco regime with the Templar Knights summond from the grave at the start of each film as a way of representing the old values of Spain finding a voice amidst the artistic repression of their time. Spanish art has always been filled with images of horror  suffering so it would make sense that an artist like Ossorio would choose the medium of his time  film rather than oil  canvas  with which to bring forth his vision and fill it with images of horror. But that doesn't mean that his objective was to make a mind numbing splatter film that would beat it's audience into submission with a meathook. If thematic relevance could be found for allowing a pretty supporting actress to be torn to shreds by vampiric Templars in a death ritual well so be it  that kind of stuff sells and was permissable under Franco's dictatorship where straight out sexual content was not.TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD as we know it today stands as one of the watershed films in mixing horror with eroticism before Ossorio the erotically tinged horror flick tended to be softer edged not confront the viewer with TOO much carnage though torture films were huge during the 1970's especially in places like Italy and Germany where film makers were free to make films about whatever they wanted and tended to end happily. Ossorio's work changed all of that we see graphic amputations decapitations  other forms of bloodletting right next to the boobs bikini lines and GoGo boots. Ossorio had a great eye for beauty too and packed his films with a bevy of gorgeous beautiful Eurobabes who would have the most apalling things happen to them right on camera but were never exploitational  the sexual content in Ossorio's work is treated as a plot element itself not just inserted into the storyline to keep the attention of the jaded from slipping.Several of the commentors are correct when pointing out that this movie is slow but I contend that it is slow in a way that emphasizes the poetic nature of his visions  events transpire in a deliberate manner with the action taking place almost like a walz or ballad. Is this a cultural sensitivity issue? Probably  American consumers want MORE FASTER BIGGER and they want it NOW. To require an audience to sit through 25 minutes of a film before even learning why any of this is happening was apparently so unbearable that the original distributor of this film  Paragon Video  actually took it upon themselves to restructure the film so that the middle came at the beginning and the film opens with a death ritualblood sacrifice of a sexy woman to assure braindead Americans that they were going to get to see the boobs  blood that the films were marketed as delivering. And by doing so they not only did a disservice to the movie but shot themselves in the foot since the action never again reaches that frenzied peak of luridness.Anchor Bay Entertainment and Video Treasures did better with their remastered widescreen presentations but still failed to grasp how to adequately market the films to what audience and as such you can go to Amazon  score this tape for about eight bucks from a reseller the outofprint DVD containing both this and the second installment usually runs 30  50 and is considered tres collectable and not even have to put up with a prior rental since AB was marketing to consumers for home sales not rental outlets. If you are interested in finding the pivotal moment of 1970's Eurohorror when art  entertainment met head on and brought forth one of the most widely respected series of the genre this IS it.If you are looking for a gut munching Zombie fest with splatterings and disembowlings I am delighted to report that this isn't it. You don't check your brains at the door when you watch a BLIND DEAD movie you use them.If that is beneath you as a film consumer you are indeed well advised to look elsewhere.".

And by doing so they not only did a disservice to the movie but shot themselves in the foot since the action never again reaches that frenzied peak of luridness.Anchor Bay Entertainment and Video Treasures did better with their remastered widescreen presentations but still failed to grasp how to adequately market the films to what audience and as such you can go to Amazon  score this tape for about eight bucks from a reseller the outofprint DVD containing both this and the second installment usually runs 30  50 and is considered tres collectable and not even have to put up with a prior rental since AB was marketing to consumers for home sales not rental outlets. If you are interested in finding the pivotal moment of 1970's Eurohorror when art  entertainment met head on and brought forth one of the most widely respected series of the genre this IS it.If you are looking for a gut munching Zombie fest with splatterings and disembowlings I am delighted to report that this isn't it. You don't check your brains at the door when you watch a BLIND DEAD movie you use them.If that is beneath you as a film consumer you are indeed well advised to look elsewhere.";

The movie is strong on atmosphere and style similar in some ways to Jean Rollin but without the sex or pretension. The blind dead themselves are one of the creepiest and most effective concepts in any horror movie. Slow moving relentless and deadly with a penchant for flesh eating. The scenes where the dead ride horses to hunt their prey are classic horror. My only small criticism of this movie is that there were so few scenes of them.

	schema:reviewBody "Despite a slow start Amando de Ossorio's Tombs of the Blinddead soon picks up and morphs into the exploitation highlight that you were no doubt expecting going into it. Naturally it's full of plot holes and dubious character decisions but it doesn't matter because it's Ossorio's story surrounding the knights along with the terrifying spectacle of the Templars rising from their tombs that makes this film what it is. The intro to the film gives you an impression of what you're in for as we glide through an ancient monastery. This creepy sequence is very much coherent with the style of this film. Amando de Ossorio seems more concerned with making sure that his creations the knights themselves look as decomposed and disgusting as possible  and he truly succeeds. The gore takes a backseat therefore but it doesn't matter at all. The plot follows three friends on a train one of which decides to leave that safe haven and spend the knight in the deserted town surrounding the monastery. Unbeknown to her that's the same place where Templar knights were left to the crow's years earlier  and they're still mad about it.When you think of zombie movies it's always George Romero's gory classics that spring to mind  and that is another thing that is great about this movie. Tombs of the Blinddead has completely made it's own style and originality is something that the horror genre could use more of. Of course similar plots to this one have been used before but never in exactly this way. Another thing I admire about the director is the fact that he's obviously more concerned with the horror of the story than anything else. Exploitation flicks like this tend to show a lot of nudity or other things that aren't really relevant  but this flick has made a real effort to stay away from needless elements as much as possible. Fans of intellectual cinema wont find much to like here  the dialogue is trite and the acting is rubbish  but there's no denying that this film has at least something resembling a respectable status within the horror genre. The fact that it's been remembered over thirty years on shows that  and if you're a fan of this sort of film then you should definitely make sure you see Tombs of the Blinddead!".

Can the girl escape from the Tombs of the Blind Dead? What a wonderful one of a kind film with some genuine scares. Very few horror movies can claim to have truly unique plots and characters. Horror is a genre that feeds off itself and constantly recycles ideas. That's one of the things that makes Tombs of the Blind Dead such an interesting and refreshing movie. De Ossorio created a new mythos for his film. De Ossorio's zombie like creatures the Templars come complete with a fascinating backstory  Crusaders from the 13th Century who were put to death for practicing black magic their eyes plucked from their sockets by birds. It would have been very easy for the movie to follow the zombie mold set out by Romero in Night of the Living Dead. But the Templars are not the mindless stumbling brand of zombie. Instead they move hunt and kill in an organized fashion. It means the Templars are even more deadly than your average zombie.Tombs of the Blind Dead has so much going for it. The movie just drips with atmosphere. It's aided by a wonderful soundtrack featuring haunting music and an assortment of odd creepy sounds. The crumbling monastery has to be one of the best sets I've ever seen. I can't imagine spending the night in this place. There are some places that look spooky in the daylight and this is one of them. The eyeless Templars are some of the most frightening creatures I've ever seen. They say the eyes are the windows to the soul  so what does that say if your eyes have been plucked out. And the ending is marvelously downbeat. I really wasn't expected such an apocalyptic finish.Oh it's not perfect. There are a few things that bug me. For example where do the Templars get their horses? Is there a horse graveyard somewhere? Also the whole bit where the dead girl comes back to life. It's wonderfully creepy but it feels like padding.

The opening sequence takes us back to the living Knights Templar and their cruel and graphic killing of a scantilyclad young female sacrifice.  We then move up to the 20th century and the churchyard is nothing but a ruin however at night when females wandering about in the middle of nowhere chance upon the ruin the knights wake from their crypts to feed on the blood of such passersby.  Interesting story and one that has many problems of belief.  These knights rise from the ground one moment and in the next they are galloping on horses.  Where did the horses come from?   I couldn't find an answer....perhaps you can.  The acting is passable and I concede that grudgingly.  But do not think I hold only contempt and despair for this film because I really heartily recommend it.  It is scary.  It is very atmospheric.  It is very intense at times. These dead knights are wonderfully madeup and really create frightening moments in the film as they walk toward their victims screaming.  The knights were blinded after death and now when they rise from their earthy chambers they can only hear their way toward their victims.  That is a very inventive concept.  The director Amando de Ossorio knows what to do with lighting set creations and pacing the plot.  There were three sequels to this film and that in itself shows it has SOME merit.  The film also set the trend for mixing sex and gore.  There is a good bit of both more on the sex side and what the female leads lack in acting ability they certainly make up for some of it in their...well how shall I put it....their physical presence.".

Virginia's friend Roger Cesar Burner and Betty hit it off which Virginia disapproves off and takes off for an abandoned town in the countryside. When she is found dead the next day Betty and Roger return to the town where she was found and finds that it belonged to the Knights Templar an old devilworshiping cult from long ago. The police suspect that a local smuggler Pedro Candal Joseph Thelman is the culprit instead of the Blind Dead Betty and Roger suspect. Enlisting Pedro and his girlfriend Maria Maria Silva to help them out the four return to the town to discover that the dead are returning to life and try to hold off the attacks.The Good News This is the first film in the Blind Dead films and they are at their creepiest here. The old Spanish countryside is used to perfection in building suspense as the rural landscape and abandoned buildings weave a thrilling spell that really adds to the allure of the film. It adds an old Gothic feel to the film which helps it out immensely to appeal to the fans of oldschool horror movie fans. The ghostly decayed ruins are just rife with suspense opportunities and any time in the monastery is a perfect example. An almost better example is the Blind Dead themselves. Completely decayed with few facial features and with their faces covered with tattered hoods with bony fingers and a shuffling way of walking after their victims it really adds to their terror and makes them that much more creepy. Their appearance is the best part as they are really creepy looking creations and quite original. It also features so many great highlight scenes that picking one is almost impossible. The first attack in the monastery is great as it's extended playout allows for numerous setups and moments of suspense and ranks as one. Any moment from the final assault is worthy of mention as well as anything involving Templars also. The morgue scene is just as good but the real winner is the attack in the doll workshop. The lighting the editing the glorious makeup and it's action packed wrapup is a great allaround scene that mixes together quite well. The legacy of the Templars is also handled pretty well with the reason for their being is slightly modified from the actual Knights Templar yet still being a clear motive for them.The Bad News The Templars don't get enough screentime as they should and are really only in a couple of scenes altogether. For being the title creatures they ought to be in the movie more. They're creepy enough to hold a viewer's interest for a long period of time and here their few selected appearances is a bit discerning for the diehard fans. It's large body count is also dispatched in pretty bloodless ways as it should've been far gorier than what it is.The Final Verdict Despite the fact that there is only a few selected scenes with the Blind Dead this is a worthy addition to the Euro Zombie craze that is probably more atmospheric than most of it's contemporaries. Gorehounds are advised to investigate but it's not as bloody as others.Rated R Violence Nudity a scene of Rape torture mild language children in danger and several brief sex scenes".

Gorehounds are advised to investigate but it's not as bloody as others.Rated R Violence Nudity a scene of Rape torture mild language children in danger and several brief sex scenes";

I only recently discovered the Spanish Blind Dead series but the original first entry in the series is a great film indeed! This is one cool groovy zombie flick. I love the atmosphere the setting in the Portugese countryside the zombies look great and the fact that it's a Spanish production and a little Portugese it's set in Portugal after all makes this a delightful combination of the zombie film and European frivolousness filled with some attractive women who engage in the occasional cat fight between the all the zombie action some of it on horseback. Yes these templar zombies ride on horseback which is effectively shot in slowmotion very impressive. I understand that in the later films they even start riding motorcycles and driving cars! There's  not surprisingly  some cheezy acting and some improbabilities in the plot but it all feels wonderfully fresh to me.Ossorio's day for night blue filter photography is actually very effective but in the English version director Amando de Ossorio puts in his own spoiler by showing the dead body of the girl who for some strange reason went to this castle but was killed by the zombie templars... when her two friends start looking for her at the castle her dead body is shown lying in the fields. I'm positive the viewer was not supposed to see her body whilst in the following scene the two start looking for her some suspense is thrown in ... but we already know she's dead. A bit odd.Anchor Bay's DVD taught me that a cut version of Tombs of the Blind Dead was released in the U.S. under the title Revenge from Planet Ape in an effort to capitalize on the success of Planet of the Apes. Even in my wildest imagination I cannot think of any possible connection between these two films but a prologue was added to make a connection between the two films an excellent example of the lengths flybynight drivein distributors would go in order to exploit a film.This Spanish take on The Living Dead is great fun worth checking out.Camera Obscura  810".

Tombs though gives monster lovers what they really want...some of the creepiest ghouls ever seen.Director Amando DeOssorio really understands the nature of horror. The crawling fear of a medieval graveyard at night. The inexorable terror of being stalked by the dead. The unbelieving despair of knowing you will be slashed and drained by blind zombies from hell! The scene where the Templars arise from their tombs oozes bonefreezing atmosphere. When they chase the plucky heroine who even steals one of their demon steedsacross a moonlit plain the movie transcends itself to become true art.The final scene is one of the most appalling things I've seen. It is just utterly morbid horror. The fate of a little girl will fill you with fear and disgust. It's extremely disturbing to watch because the girl's reactions are authentic not acting.There are stiff characters and silly dialogue here but all that pales into insignificance compared to the overwhelming aura of evil and creeping horror that De Ossorio conjures here. There were three sequels but the original is the best. If you are looking for real horror not video game gore start right here!".

	schema:headline " First title of the successful and classic Spanish Tetralogy about Templar Zombies by Amando De Ossorio";
	schema:reviewBody "First and enjoyable original of the Templars dead series in which the medieval zombies awake to commit ritual sacrifices . The blind dead Templars return again from the 13th century with this creepy story . Blind Dead Tetralogy  19711975 is among the best and most prestigious Spanish horror pictures of its time . These films are surprisingly wellrealized and eerie  displaying an original premise  some Zombilike are blinded by crows as they made human sacrifices and were executed  but then the clergymen return eventually to the life . The best feature of the films is its title menace  the Blind Dead  the group of renegade knights were condemned for their black magic rituals  mummified zombies from medieval times which rise from their graves to drink the blood of their victims . Executed for their unholy deeds the Templars bodies were left out for the crows to peck out their eyes . Now in modern day Portugal a group of people stumble on the Templars in abandoned monastery  reviving their rotting corpses to terrorize the land . The film starts when a trio  Lone Fleming  Cesar Burner  Helen Harp as Virginia travelling by train  then Virginia flees and refugees at an old castle . There the priests warriors wake up from the tomb and begin their criminal rampage . Ancient Zombies return of graves causing wreak havoc on the place  horrifying and torturing the rural population . They make a brutal massacre and the protagonists are surrounded in a fortress . Meanwhile the starring attempts to save the damsel in disgrace and a police inspector Rufino Ingles is investigating the weird deeds.It is definitely a very entertaining horror flick and eerie as hell and based on Gustavo Adolfo Becker writings as Mount of Animas and Miserere . I got to admit I am a big aficionado of the Tetralogy Blind Dead movies  although have many flaws and gaps  it's still pretty damn good . In Tombs the blind dead we find the famous blind dead zombies which rise from the tombs 500 years after to wreak havoc upon some beautiful Eurobabes . The zombielike pack of ancient warriors priest awake and rising from the graves to kill and torture the unfortunate victims . They were condemned and eternally dammed by cult practicing human sacrifices and blinded by crows and attack on his victims sucking them in hyena style . They encounter their victims by means of screams and sounds . This is a cheap Spaniard production with lack luster and low budget. Special effects are ridiculous and embarrassing absurd and frankly lousy but functional  showing lots of blood and gore . This atmospheric horror movie contains scary scenes when appear the living dead Templars . It's the first and successful and immensely popular Tombs of the Blind dead series which to be continued by mediocre attempt to cash of following exhausted medieval warriors saga as a trilogy as Return of evil dead  Ship of Zombies or Blind dead 2 and Blind dead 3 or The night of the sea gulls . Good exteriors filmed on Pantano San Juan  Monastery Cercon Madrid  Guadalquivir river  Estoril and Lisbon Portugal. Creepy and frightening music especially when the dead attack is well composed by Anton Garcia Abril author of the four eerie soundtracks in Gregorian chores style . Colorful cinematography and very well remastered by Pablo Ripoll . This lack budget film is regularly directed by Amando De Ossorio but is amusing and entertaining .".

Sure the lesbian scene seems a little stupid and off putting with all that soft focus but i'm sure if it had been shot by an actual lesbian it would have looked very different its a MANS idea of lesbians and in Spain in 1971! Cut this one some slack and you wont be let down just look for the wonderful scenes of the undead knights riding horseback through the night. Creepy stuff indeed.".

The pacing is slower than the blind dead themselves.  If you're going to have a slow movie you have to make it interesting.  There are times in the movie when nothing is said or happens for 7 minutes at a time.  There are some serious believability issues as well.  I mean for a bunch of slow blind dead guys they sure are hard to get away from.  All in all Tombs is not half as bad as I remember it being.

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw La Noche del Terror Ciego after all the impressive reviews I had read about the film. And once again a movie failed to deliver at least in my humble opinion.First of all I'll say that I saw the uncut version in Spanish. It also came with the English subs but the translations are not too accurate but rather generic. However the original dialog is rather lame anyway so that's not a problem.On the good side I'll say what everyone has to say about this film it's creepy and drips with atmosphere. The creatures look really cool and I like the fact that they are so slow yet they always end up trapping their victim. But where do the horses come from? Yes it's very visual and poetic that they are horse riders but seriously where were the horses when the Blind Dead were in their tombs? I'll admit the scenes of the creatures look pretty good. Even Peter Jackson ripped them off for a couple of sequences in Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring 1 when the Nazgul surround Frodo before hurting him with the morgul blade 2 when the Nazgul pursue Arwen and Frodo on horseback when Frodo is fading from the wound mentioned in point 1. But in my opinion that alone doesn't make the film good.I don't complain it is a slow movie. I love Lucio Fulci movies and they are the slowest you can find out there. I don't complain about the lack of gore I know there are other types of horror film and I love them I can think of a good combination of lack of gore and atmosphere in Lemora for instance and I love the film. What I complain about is a bad script a lack of interesting situations the plot holes what was the deal with the dead friend that came back to life? It is never explained why and after that she dies in a second engulfed by flames. I was like HUH? the introduction of new characters that never appear again to have a ROLE in the situation the policemen the mad scientist that explains the legend the creepy guy at the morgue that looks like a good character but in the end he does nothing.... That's what really bothered me about this film.I can even forgive that in the last sequences when Betty is running to the train pursued by the Templars she falls down and when the young guy jumps to help her it looks that she is actually preventing him from helping her so that the Templars get them. It's a horror movie we all know that the protagonists do dumb things so I can bear with that. But not the fact that 40 minutes of the film deal with characters and situations that will have no impact on the final outcome. I mean Betty and Roger might as well have waited in the citadel when they first go there to look for Virginia and De Ossorio would have saved us 40 minutes. The outcome would have been exactly the same for the record I think the last scene and its idea are fantastic even though it could have been filmed a little better.I give it a 410 for the cool creatures the atmosphere and the good ideas. Any horror buff has to see this one but maybe it's not as good a movie as you expected. It certainly wasn't for me.".

Even Peter Jackson ripped them off for a couple of sequences in Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring 1 when the Nazgul surround Frodo before hurting him with the morgul blade 2 when the Nazgul pursue Arwen and Frodo on horseback when Frodo is fading from the wound mentioned in point 1. But in my opinion that alone doesn't make the film good.I don't complain it is a slow movie. I love Lucio Fulci movies and they are the slowest you can find out there. I don't complain about the lack of gore I know there are other types of horror film and I love them I can think of a good combination of lack of gore and atmosphere in Lemora for instance and I love the film. What I complain about is a bad script a lack of interesting situations the plot holes what was the deal with the dead friend that came back to life? It is never explained why and after that she dies in a second engulfed by flames. I was like HUH? the introduction of new characters that never appear again to have a ROLE in the situation the policemen the mad scientist that explains the legend the creepy guy at the morgue that looks like a good character but in the end he does nothing.... That's what really bothered me about this film.I can even forgive that in the last sequences when Betty is running to the train pursued by the Templars she falls down and when the young guy jumps to help her it looks that she is actually preventing him from helping her so that the Templars get them. It's a horror movie we all know that the protagonists do dumb things so I can bear with that. But not the fact that 40 minutes of the film deal with characters and situations that will have no impact on the final outcome. I mean Betty and Roger might as well have waited in the citadel when they first go there to look for Virginia and De Ossorio would have saved us 40 minutes. The outcome would have been exactly the same for the record I think the last scene and its idea are fantastic even though it could have been filmed a little better.I give it a 410 for the cool creatures the atmosphere and the good ideas. Any horror buff has to see this one but maybe it's not as good a movie as you expected. It certainly wasn't for me.";

The most egregious is this one Virginia if you thought your boyfriend was paying too much of the wrong kind of attention to your female friend the thing to do was to cause a scene right there on the train...not bail out in the middle of nowhere and start walking! Jeez passiveaggressive drama queen....Aside from that and aside from some other logical plot holes character decisions that make no sense and a revived victim scene that seems to be there for padding this can be enjoyed as a wonderful visual treat. It's way better than Horror Of The Zombies a later Blind Dead film that I actually saw first. That movie was sabotaged by unlikable characters and some intermittently terrible special effects.Also contributing to the atmosphere are the historical and mythic resonances. These weren't really zombies in the classic sense more like mummies with a taste for human blood. Mummies are way scarier than zombies because mummies have an implacable intelligence that wants you you personally dead. And this comes across in the film. These particular mummies also have a basis in an actual if controversial historic cult which is nice. And the way they advanced on their victims was mysterious and creepy instead of repulsive and gory. In fact actual gore is kept to a bare minimum here. My other quibble with the plot After the disastrous botched rescue attempt and the messy dispatching of the train crew and passengers wouldn't the authorities roll a bunch of tanks through that castle and destroy everything with fire? But that's probably just my American desire for happy endings and closure...apparently not a priority in EuroHorror.

	schema:reviewBody "I found this movie to be quite suspenseful and effective even in its televised showing with Elvira's interruptions and comments. When I got to see a tape of the dubbed English version I was really impressed. There is so much in this film to be amazed and awed by the terrifyingyet strangely beautiful scenes of the dead Templars riding down their victims at night the vivid contrast between modern people in Seventies fashions with the medieval monks the incongruity of a beautiful young woman in shorts listening to her radio in the creepy ruins of an ancient monastery. WARNINGSPOILERS AHEAD I loved the way the terrified Virginia made a bold attempt to escape the Templars by stealing one of their own horses and riding off on it and you almost think she's going to escape them. The scene in which she rises from the dead and attacks the Peter Lorrelike morgue attendant is truly scary. There's something about it that really gets me. I think it's the contrast between the sweet young woman she was and the silent sinister creature she has become from victim to victimizer in a total reversal. It's true that there are some characters and scenes that probably interfere with the narrative and aren't all that necessary. I felt that overall the main characters of Roger and Betty were believable and sympathetic and I got very involved in their search for Virginia and their quest to make sense out of what had happened. The uncut Spanish version with English subtitles does make for a smoother storyline and fills in some of the gaps in the better known dubbed version but arguably slows things down a bit. On the other hand we finally get some idea of who the Templars were and how they were just as scary when they were alive. There's a lot of sex and nudity far more than any American film of the period would have shown but that adds to the fun in a sleazy way. I do feel the rape scene was unnecessary and I'm not sure what it's doing in the movie or if it's intended to have any real significance. I read somewhere that one critic claimed that this act of sexual violation right before the rising of the dead monks from their graves was meant to show modern lust versus medieval celibacy or some such thing. There are plenty of holes in the plot and some of it is kind of silly but I have seldom seen a more visually beautiful horror film with its amazing scenes of the crumbling monastery the green fields near the castle the night scenes of the old buildings and the full moon before the Templars rise. And the Gregorian type music is tremendously effective. All in all a mixed bag but I think a fascinating suspenseful film that genuinely grips the viewer.".

The best thing is that they can hear their victims' heart beating so there is no escape. I am not sure whether the Blind Dead are really zombies or vampires as they tend to suck their victims rather than eat them but the victims come back to life to continue the good work. The Blind Dead have horses and swords so they are very hard to escape from however how they have the strength to ride or hold a sword with their withered spindly arms is amazing! The film as well as having some quite nice creepy scenes has the obligatory 70s lesbian sequence which fits perfectly with the rest of the action. I suppose a film maker can only do his best to please all of his viewers. The Blind Dead are nicely made up there is some gore one of the characters Pedro has the sweatiest armpits in film history and makes the mistake of taking on a whole army of the Blind Dead with a small knife. The end sequence is really good as the ZombieVampire Knights take on a train full of passengers and literally suck the life out of them! Very highly recommended to 70s horror fans but please don't answer any history exam questions with any of the films' plot. I intend to enjoy the next episode in the Blind Dead saga asap.".

I recently encountered the effect with Naisu no mori which took some significant shifting on my part to put me in the right place.Oshima is politically radical violently iconoclastic and deeply critical of what he sees as a broken Japanese culture. In this film he targets sensibilities that would be hard for even Japanese viewers to understand today. I didn't even try and simply relegated all the broken souls I saw to a generalized brokenness. Perhaps that makes the film better because it allows us to experience the technique of the thing more directly.The story doesn't matter except that it throws an eighteen year old girl with a screw loose in with a suicidal AWOL soldier and a group of ragtag gangsters. Some of the action takes place in an abandoned futuristic city but the core of the film is in a bunker of some sort. It is a terrific set and one wonders how in the world many of the shots were made. Some of them pan the space showing walls that could not have been there at the start of the shot.It is a complex space concrete with sometimes deep sometimes close walls that seem to change. The floors and ceilings have different heights. There are stone altar slabs with spring water coming from roughly hewn holes. Sometimes the walls and floors have handcarved humanshaped niches. The lighting always seems natural but the sources would be physically impossible. The space reminded me of Tarkovsky.Oshima says he hates Ozu and Kurosawa but the cameras of both clearly is used and extended here. The poses are formal the movements of the eye architectural. This film was unknown to me until today and it replaces Welles' Othello as my go to example of an architectural film. The characters are less people than they are active components of the space. Every action every perception  ours and theirs  is spatially situated. I loved it.

Nejiko eventually bumps into deserter soldier Otoko played by Oshima regular Kai Sato  he is also wandering around alone searching for something unfortunately for Nejiko he isn't interested in sex he wants to find someone to kill him. The pair end up getting taken to a secret compound by 'gangsters' who turn out to be members of a secret army plotting to overthrow the government.The bulk of the film takes place in this military compound inside one of the sheds where Otoko Nejiko and a group of mercenaries are waiting on orders and weapons from the leaders. Unfortunately for the wouldbe revolutionaries a Westerner is driving throughout Japan in a car on a rampage sniping people resulting in all the police and military being deployed trying to stop him and he gets ever closer to the secret army's military base.But whilst all the mercenary men discuss their past their justification of violence their favoured weapons poor Nejiko just wants one of them to make love to her!The film later on leaves the barracks and goes on a search with several members of the group. The cinematography resembles Resnais' in Hiroshima Mon Amour which is one of my favourite films but I think this film beats it!Oshima fills his film with a group of completely differing mysterious characters forces them in close proximity to each other and observes them interacting often with explosive results. None really have importance over the other and all are flawed. For me this film is about the search for Japanese pride after World War 2 and the absurd importance placed upon it above all others things. Oshima critiques each different group's reaction  the students the police and army the elderly the war criminals the businessmen. Only the women are left uncriticised.. The one woman in the film the only one brave enough to leave her home and get what she wants just gets in the way of the men looking for their pride ignoring the fact that a new Japan can only be brought about by the two coming together and starting anew.".

Her bouncy semi nude and simulated sex scenes are scatted throughout this ludicrous movie and meant to keep adolescent members of the audience in their seats. To see Sakurai in action viewers in the theater were forced to sit through rambling meaningless and trite dialog spouted by what has to be some of the most unappealing actors filmed in a Japanese movietheir ugliness is amplified by exhibiting their outofshape bodies in mostly half naked fashion. Fortunately disc viewers have fastforward buttons on their remotes to skip this stuff. To say that scenes lack continuity is to put it mildly. Early shots provide some fine existential viewsespecially those showing empty freewaystogether with provocative symbolism. But this gets quickly buried and forgotten in the abject silliness that follows. Cinematography wide screen black and white is quite good with one of the longest tracking shots if not the longest in Japanese films to that date. The Director often uses homemovie style backandforth panning between speaking actors instead of cuts which allows him to show off and at the same time induce headaches in the viewer. Music is mercifully close to nonexistent. Subtitles are often too long and interfere with viewing Sakurai in action. Since they poorly translate the spoken nonsense the viewer might want to turn them off together with the audio track so as to better see and concentrate on the actress' performance. Best to locate the remote fastforward button before playing. WILLIAM FLANIGAN PhD.".

This time it's not so hard to figure out  Nagisa Oshima decided to make a film that is not too long maybe 90 minutes or so I forget the exact running time set most of it in one location and make it about how human nature is just really really strange sometimes. Especially in Japan. Now contrary to what the title says it's not really a film about suicide at least not fully. One of the main characters IS fascinated by wanting to off himself and keeps on trying to find a way to do it. And he's accompanied by a young 18 year old woman who is quite aroused and wants to get her rocks off with another man. Then there is the other guy who is just really hyped up on guns. But what is the movie about? Well I'm still not sure if it has an exact narrative that can be seen as ABandC straight through. It's more in line with something like the Exterminating Angel as close as I can figure as it's about how the suicide guy and horny girl are walking along one night he her boyfriend sorta and they get caught up in a hideout where a bunch of men are paranoid about a war starting or some kind of attack. And their fears are amped up by reports on the news of a whiteAmerican gunman taking out people at random. There is a lockdown but the people in this big gray hangar could leave whenever they want. But things keep on happening to keep them there...It's maybe a film that most pointedly and wonderfully looks at male frustration and nihilism with this one girl who keeps trying to have something with a man and failing not for lack of being attractive but just because the men are preoccupied with their guns so to speak and paranoia in general. I loved the atmosphere of everything in this one place as the people are there and they don't leave at least until the last fifteen minutes or so. When they do leave Oshima makes some real suspense and action but not how one would expect. It's technically a thriller but everything is underlying and the suspense isn't for the when but how things will happen. I loved it but it's definitely an acquired taste.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE NIGHT WE NEVER METSam Matthew Broderick is the reasonable man in a crazy urban world the man of thoughtfulness and refined taste in a landscape of Leroy Neiman paintings and beer commercials.  The guy would sooner cook for an hour over a hot stove than say supersize it.'By day he's a store clerk in an upscale gourmet eatery and these scenes raise a smile especially for anyone who's visited the actual chain in New York City  the portrayal isn't far off from the reality.  Our man is besieged by hoards of customers who want their imported French cheese cut to impossibly exact standards.  His efforts to remain outwardly polite while you know he'd like to take the cleaver to the relentless clientele are pretty funny and will warm the hearts of clerks everywhere.  In general Broderick is in good form and provides the movie with most of whatever lightness it possesses.Sciorra's lovelorn dental hygienist Ellen is fine enough too and her unknowing interaction with our cheeseslicing hero shows some hopeful chemistry and you may begin to feel you want to see these two get together.One of the main competitors for our lady's affections a stockbroker Kevin Anderson is played as caricature he's the beer swilling fratboy whose idea of aftersex sensitivity is flipping on the football game.  He's kind of funny at times but the movie might be stronger if he was written or acted for us to like him more instead of having us merely recognize him as the flatout wrong' guy in comparison to Broderick's sensitive man. Think of John Candy in Splash taking a cigarette and beer can to the racquetball game we know his lifestyle is not the one our hero should emulate but we can't help but be charmed by the likeable goon.  Whereas this character is merely a goon and pretty unlikable all around.While it's a nice enough light movie for the first half for me the story was somewhat derailed by its unbelievable Hollywood presentation of sex and adultery.  SPOILER AHEAD skip to next paragraph. When Ellen returns home after an evening's misadventures she is naturally faced with the questioning husband Michael Mantell.  Quickly admitting her own indiscretion she then immediately turns the situation around demanding to know why the guy had gone ahead and bought a house without discussing it. Granted it's a valid issue and granted many people use this countering maneuver in arguments.  What's unbelievable is what happens next  the guy starts responding to her question addressing the houseissue in a quiet thoughtful manner.  WHOA.  You'd be hard pressed to find a married person in the world who when faced with hisher partner's totally unexpected adultery would be ready to address anything so calmly.  The guy would surely be bouncing off the walls or else crushed into silence and tears  but see then we might actually feel for the poor schnook and we'd see Sciorra's character in a poor light.  And since that particular audience reaction doesn't serve the romantic comedy the story tries to sneak around it.  You may start to feel that like the husband you're being taken.Further dissatisfaction is just around the corner in the ending.  We realize this is where misunderstandings will get sorted out and our couple will finally see a clear path to one another.  We want the satisfaction of rooting for them.  But it's marred by another unbelievable character reaction followed by an abrupt conclusion that feels rushed and forced too easy and unearned.  You may feel as though the movie's cheating on you again...Anyway if you catch it on cable I recommend the gourmet market scenes. Maybe we'll all be more understanding of the overworked clerks in this great land of ours. ".

In general Broderick is in good form and provides the movie with most of whatever lightness it possesses.Sciorra's lovelorn dental hygienist Ellen is fine enough too and her unknowing interaction with our cheeseslicing hero shows some hopeful chemistry and you may begin to feel you want to see these two get together.One of the main competitors for our lady's affections a stockbroker Kevin Anderson is played as caricature he's the beer swilling fratboy whose idea of aftersex sensitivity is flipping on the football game.  He's kind of funny at times but the movie might be stronger if he was written or acted for us to like him more instead of having us merely recognize him as the flatout wrong' guy in comparison to Broderick's sensitive man. Think of John Candy in Splash taking a cigarette and beer can to the racquetball game we know his lifestyle is not the one our hero should emulate but we can't help but be charmed by the likeable goon.  Whereas this character is merely a goon and pretty unlikable all around.While it's a nice enough light movie for the first half for me the story was somewhat derailed by its unbelievable Hollywood presentation of sex and adultery.  SPOILER AHEAD skip to next paragraph. When Ellen returns home after an evening's misadventures she is naturally faced with the questioning husband Michael Mantell.  Quickly admitting her own indiscretion she then immediately turns the situation around demanding to know why the guy had gone ahead and bought a house without discussing it. Granted it's a valid issue and granted many people use this countering maneuver in arguments.  What's unbelievable is what happens next  the guy starts responding to her question addressing the houseissue in a quiet thoughtful manner.  WHOA.  You'd be hard pressed to find a married person in the world who when faced with hisher partner's totally unexpected adultery would be ready to address anything so calmly.  The guy would surely be bouncing off the walls or else crushed into silence and tears  but see then we might actually feel for the poor schnook and we'd see Sciorra's character in a poor light.  And since that particular audience reaction doesn't serve the romantic comedy the story tries to sneak around it.  You may start to feel that like the husband you're being taken.Further dissatisfaction is just around the corner in the ending.  We realize this is where misunderstandings will get sorted out and our couple will finally see a clear path to one another.  We want the satisfaction of rooting for them.  But it's marred by another unbelievable character reaction followed by an abrupt conclusion that feels rushed and forced too easy and unearned.  You may feel as though the movie's cheating on you again...Anyway if you catch it on cable I recommend the gourmet market scenes. Maybe we'll all be more understanding of the overworked clerks in this great land of ours. ";

The main themes of communication  and isolation are given time to flesh themselves out in three separate stories that center around a shared apartment. I like the pacing in this film it's slow enough to wrap itself around the story but not so slow as to drag.The three main female characters are all good especially Tripplehorn as Pastel the avantgarde artist and pseudo girlfriend of Broderick. I've never seen her do any better with a character. Broderick has a curious role to play as a man who is tolerant of others up to a point like his view of Sciorra's illogical behavior but still has the serenity to offer marital advice to a woman who has just put him through a frustrating case of coitus interruptus. Sciorra's character is more problematic  she has a definite fearaggression streak that gets tempered somewhat by the end but there's also a good deal of tough chick bravado in her performance that makes it interesting.I wasn't completely convinced by all of the transformations in the final ten minutes of the movie but it ties things up neatly enough so you don't feel cheated and leaves enough room for the characters to grow further after the final shot.".

However the pay is not great making it necessary for him to live with a small pack of roommates. He is also still pining for an eccentric wannabeactress named Pastel Jeanne Tripplehorn. One day he spies a slice of salvation in the newspaper. There is a nice apartment for rent in Manhattan but only for a couple of nights a week. That's fine with Sam for the price is right and he can have peace quiet and the occasional date with a lady. Ellen Annabella Sciorra also sees the ad and is desperate for some time away from her inconsiderate husband. She signs up for two of the days with plans to pursue her interest in painting. The third tenant is the owner. Brian Kevin Anderson an Ivy league stockbrokersleazebag who wants a place to hang out with his male buds away from his own domineering fianc Justine Bateman. Soon Sam builds a nice plant holder for Ellen and leaves her some great leftovers. However through a mixed communication she believes it is Brian who has done these acts and she contemplates making a pass at him despite her marital status. Will the lives of these three people remain separate or will circumstances allow them to meet even though they are never at the apartment on the same days? This is a nice film with a clever story and script. Only in the Big Apple I suppose would you find folks willing to rent a place for only two nights a week. The cast is terrific with Broderick especially giving a very funny and touching performance. As for the costumes sets and production values they are great resulting in a movie that looks mighty nice. If you are a romantic comedy fan you can't miss this one! It's fresh plot elements and welldrawn characters make it a welcome find in the world of lighthearted love stories. Yet even if you are not a regular romcom viewer the film still has some funny situations and universal themes that make it a diverting watch for most anyone.".

This has a couple of really laugh out loud funny scenes but the one I really cracked up on was when the lead chick sleeps with the wrong guy by mistake. It wasn't that she had the wrong guy so much but the way the guy acted on the date I mean to me it was hilarious! Than afterward can you hold me?  he replies What I thought we were done! you have to see it and understand what I'm talking about but the sex involved set a speed record just really funny and it didn't even have Broderick in it. The scenes he are in are all pretty good he plays a great loser. He's not as much a loser as he was in Election or Cable Guy but still a great character. If your a Broderick fan this is worth watching or if your a guy looking for a romantic comedy you could watch all the way through without cringing this one is worth seeing. I'm not sure as others have said its very romantic but I did find it funny. 7 of 10.".

This movie is a contradiction to the accusation of Fulci as a misogynist from his later films.  Adrienne LaRussa does a nice job in conveying the almost gentle nature of the female protagonist.  George Wilson as the father does a good job in portraying someone truly evil.  Cries of death to the director were shouted in a theatre due to the film's anticatholic nature.The Catholic church is presented in the film with absolute disdain.  In fact they are seen as greedy and hypocritical.  Beatrice Cenci1969 along with The Witchfinder General1968 are probably the best films dealing with the late middle ages.  The direction is nearly perfect and the story is well done.  The film revolves around a labyrinth of flashbacks in the style of Reservoir Dogs1992.  The main source of influence seems to been The play version of The Cenci by Artoud Antonin as well as the five act play by Percelly Shelly.There are two films that Beatrice Cenci1969 compares with.  One film is Don't Torture A Duckling1972 which also deals with Catholic repression. Another film is The Devil's Honey1986 which deals deals with a woman's urge to be an independant woman.  Beatrice Cenci1969 is not only overlooked by Fulci supporters but by Fulci distractors as well.  This movie shows that Fulci was capable of more ambigious and personal films then the many ones that he direct in his careerIts too bad as he had the talent that would have made him one of the best directors of his generation in Italy.".

This historical drama stands out as a sterling example of Fulci's remarkable cinematic talents Lavishly mounted on a substantial budget it manages to be genuinely poignant and gripping without ever becoming too sappy or melodramatic. Fulci handles the stark and unsentimental telling of this shocking real life tragedy with admirable skill and assurance he delivers a thoroughly convincing and unromantic evocation of the harsh 16th century period setting along with a properly grim'n'gritty atmosphere and trademark startling moments of brutal violence and sadistic torture. Adrienne Larussa gives a strong and touching performance as Beatrice Cenci a gentle yet proud and resilient teenager who plotted with her faithful servant lover Olimpio the always excellent Tomas Milian to kill her cruel and abusive nobleman father Don Francesco Cenci superbly played to the hateful hilt by Georges Wilson. Mavie is likewise sound as Beatrice's longsuffering stepmother Lucrezia and Ignazio Spalla contributes an amusing turn as gross fat slob bandit Catalano. Erco Menczer's sumptuous cinematography gives the movie an impressively lush and expansive look. The grand and melodic score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino and Silvano Spadaccino rates as another major asset. But it's Fulci's inspired direction and the bold vehement antiCatholic stance that really brings a certain raw and direct power to the film. Well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is further evidence that Lucio Fulci was a man of many talents before becoming bitter at diminishing budgets and the pigeonholing of his skills into gory horror. Here Fulci gives us a historical drama about the corruption of the Catholic church and not for the last time! as well as the hypocrisy of Roman nobility It's gory and horrible too but in a dramatic historical way!Beatrice Cenci is the daughter of Francesco Cenci a Roman nobleman whom we first see feeding a man to a pack of dogs. He's a nasty bastard all right and has done something to offend the current Pope and now has to make amends by giving up a third of his wealth. His children all hate him even Beatrice who has petitioned the Pope behind his back in order to enter the church as a nun. This breaks the heart of her lover Vassal Tomas Milian but he still remains loyal and goes with her wishes. However while celebrating the death by smallpox of his two eldest sons! Francesco finds out about Beatrice wanting to join the church and arranges instead to keep her captive in the basement of his tower until he dieswhich seems to happen almost immediately after he says that. As the film jumps back and forth on the timeline we don't get to see what happened right away which allows the Catholic Church to hire medieval Colombo to sort the mystery out! Should that be D'catolic choich?Yes the film is gory and full of violence and torture but I think this only goes to show how awful human beings actually are and how corrupt the Catholic Church were back then. Folks are put on racks burned with tongs and one character foreshadows many a future Fulci film by having a huge nail rammed into his eye. That said the film is not cheap looking and it's all deadly serious. Everything looks exactly like a Fulci film too  no matter how cheap his films became in the late eighties they still retained that certain look. Tomas Milian stands out here as the repressed subdued servant which had me worrying if he would ever do his 'covered in filth screaming' bit it happens about an hour in. It's depressing stuff but it's also interesting to see these directors working in different fields. I'm not watching any of his comedies however although I do like the title The Senator Liked Woman's Bottoms.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lucio Fulci. Just hearing the name will make most cult cinema fans think of blood and gore  and for good reason since the great director was responsible for some of the best gory highlights ever made and for that reason he's just about the last director you would expect to make a period drama. Fulci did have a varied career making films in many of Italy's most famous genres from westerns and Polizi flicks to Giallo and the blood and gore films with which he made his name...however it would seem that period dramas were not his thing as Beatrice Cenci will not feature in my list of favourite Fulci flicks! The plot is actually a decent base for a film and is set in 16th Century Italy. The title character Beatrice Cenci is the daughter of a rich landowner named Francesco Cenci. Francesco is a cruel man who keeps his daughter locked up in a room and tortures her. Naturally she's not best pleased at this arrangement and since she's not the only one who dislikes her father she doesn't have a hard time getting some other people to help her murder him.I have to admit part of the reason why I didn't like this film is because I'm not a fan of period dramas. Naturally my only reason for watching this is because I'm a big Fulci fan and I'll watch anything that the director's name is attached to even if it is something from a genre I have no love for. Even though I found the film rather dull I do have to admire the great director's work on it. He may be best known for his gore flicks but Fulci's talent came out best in his earlier films and here he creates a great atmosphere and manages to pull good performances out of his cast. Aside from Fulci at the helm this film also features another great cult luminary in an early role in the form of the always watchable Tomas Milian. He is joined by Adrienne Larussa who takes the title role and does a good job with it. Despite the fact that this is a departure from what Fulci is best known for it's not completely devoid of the elements that won him his fan base as the film does feature some rather nasty torture scenes. Overall I can respect the craftsmanship on this film but I won't pretend to like it! Recommended to hardcore Fulci fans only.".

	schema:reviewBody "Laura Gemser stars in this storydriven melodrama as a woman who gets revenge on her abusive husband by hiring a hitman to kill him. This is an unofficial entry of the Emanuelle series but definitely one of the better ones and a good film in it's own right. Gemser is still Emanuelle in this but she is no longer the photo Journalist but rather a much abused wife of a very wealthy industrialist. The title suggests that Emanuelle is cruel or evil but in fact the husband did deserve to die as he was brutally raping and torturing his wife and most likely would eventually have killed her. She is left to care for her 14 yearold daughter who has inherited her fathers fortune. Too young to care for her estate Emanuelle is assigned her guardian. Of course things go wrong when Mario the hitman turns up to blackmail Emanuelle who really seems to care for her daughter Livia. Meanwhile Livia meets Mike a boy a couple years her senior and the two begin a very sweet and innocent affair. Mike played by the beautiful Vagelis Varten seems also to love the young girl but neither he nor Emanuelle can protect her from the corruption that surrounds her. Livia eventually loses her innocence to Mario when the man brutally rapes her. To be sure this is entertaining drama and a tale filled with lurid suspense but one problem is that the film is too ambitious for it's own good and introduces too many characters to be able to develop any one to any great length. And this is one case where the sex scenes were actually too frequent and slowed down the story as it unfolded. But this is an Emanuelle film and this is to be expected. i had hoped for a little more time to be spent on Livia's and Mike's blossoming love as it was the sweetest part of the film and Vagelis Varten should have been given more screen time. But it is always a pleasure to see Laura Gemser in romantic scenes with her reallife husband Gabriele Tinti. She is noticeably more comfortable doing erotic scenes when they are with him. 'EmanuelleQueen of Sados' must surely be controversial as the girl who plays Livia couldn't be a minute over 14 years old and yet she appears totally nude throughout the film and is featured in the disturbing rape at the climax. I could imagine this film being banned in certain parts of the world! The music score is nice enough fitting the beautiful Cypress locale but Nico fidenco's score is missed here. I have a Greek DVD which seems to be uncut although there is one short scene of a woman masturbating by the pool that is optically blurred. This is a must for fans of Laura Gemser as she is given a lot of room to act here and is the main player. A fun trashy film recommended!".

Of course things go wrong when Mario the hitman turns up to blackmail Emanuelle who really seems to care for her daughter Livia. Meanwhile Livia meets Mike a boy a couple years her senior and the two begin a very sweet and innocent affair. Mike played by the beautiful Vagelis Varten seems also to love the young girl but neither he nor Emanuelle can protect her from the corruption that surrounds her. Livia eventually loses her innocence to Mario when the man brutally rapes her. To be sure this is entertaining drama and a tale filled with lurid suspense but one problem is that the film is too ambitious for it's own good and introduces too many characters to be able to develop any one to any great length. And this is one case where the sex scenes were actually too frequent and slowed down the story as it unfolded. But this is an Emanuelle film and this is to be expected. i had hoped for a little more time to be spent on Livia's and Mike's blossoming love as it was the sweetest part of the film and Vagelis Varten should have been given more screen time. But it is always a pleasure to see Laura Gemser in romantic scenes with her reallife husband Gabriele Tinti. She is noticeably more comfortable doing erotic scenes when they are with him. 'EmanuelleQueen of Sados' must surely be controversial as the girl who plays Livia couldn't be a minute over 14 years old and yet she appears totally nude throughout the film and is featured in the disturbing rape at the climax. I could imagine this film being banned in certain parts of the world! The music score is nice enough fitting the beautiful Cypress locale but Nico fidenco's score is missed here. I have a Greek DVD which seems to be uncut although there is one short scene of a woman masturbating by the pool that is optically blurred. This is a must for fans of Laura Gemser as she is given a lot of room to act here and is the main player. A fun trashy film recommended!";

This is about the closest the series ever came to a real movie. Gemser has a meatierthanusual role as a trophy wife who has knocked off her rich jaded husband but is being blackmailed by the sleazy character she hired to do it. She falls in love with her late husband's industrialist partner played by Gemser's real husband Gabrielle Tinti and for some reason keeps around her husband's busty mistress who had helped him sexually torture her and who begins plotting with the blackmailer against her. On the other she seems genuinely devoted to her husband's teenage daughter Livia thus this movie was alternately called Emmanuelle's Daughter to capture the lucrative pervert market. The blackmailer a sleazy looking Greek guy who always has a rose between teeth makes his way sexually through the entire female cast but isn't necessarily a very intimidating villain.The ending of this movie is abrupt and incredibly stupid but up until then there is some genuine dramatic tension making this slightly more interesting than the typical Emanuelle flick. It's not nearly as transgressive and disturbing as some of the Joe D'Amato Emanuelle films although the Italian sleazemeister was peripherally involved in this on the production end. There is one unpleasantly graphic but not entirely gratuitous rape scene involving an actress of an indeterminate but probably pretty young agebut no snuff film footage equine masturbation or cannibalism here.Gemser on the other hand looks great and really gets a chance to act for change. Definitely recommended for GemserEmanuelle fans. As for everyone else. . .well why are you reading this anyway?".

Perhaps it was an attempt to fool audiences into thinking that the film has something to do with sadomasochism? Anyway...I really can't say that this film is all that interesting. The sex scenes are not bad but do become monotonous after a while and the cinematography isn't great either so it doesn't benefit from good looking scenes like the earlier Black Emanuelle White Emanuelle did.

	schema:reviewBody "An admirably sleazy entry in Laura Gemser's filmography this has the Black Emanuelle actress and her partner and perennial costar Gabriele Tinti earning some quick bucks in the Greek exploitation film industry. Gemser plays a character called Emanuelle who bears no relation to the Emanuelle she played in the original and the D'Amato series perhaps the character wasn't called Emanuelle in the original Greek version but has been given that name in the dub. This Emanuelle is the abused trophy wife of a wealthy Greek orange magnate a man who likes to humiliate and sexually torture his spouse with his business partners and in front of his nymphet of a daughter Livia. Emanuelle plans and executes the murder of the magnate a plot carried out by a seedy but sexy hit man called Mario Infanti. Emanuelle now guardian of Livia and head of the orange distribution company thinks she's got away with it. But Mario wants more money and the magnate's old cohorts suspect the truth.The plot has an intriguing trajectory as Emanuelle mends her fractious relationship with Livia and becomes romantically involved with another business contact of her late husband Tommy Snow Tinti. A new happy family seems to be forming but the chance of happiness is cut short when Mario rapes Livia and Emanuelle revenges this by shooting him in an old amphitheatre a setting which has the film's melodrama nodding to classical tragedy Emanuelle who'd have thought it?! joining the ranks of Medea and Clytemnestra. It is as if any challenge to corrupt abusive patriarchy means involvement with dangerous allies the past association coming back to haunt the rebels even as they feel they are safe.The story is interrupted at regular intervals by bouts of pretty steamy sex. Emanuelle makes love to Mario and then Tommy Livia makes out with her young beau Mike and Mario makes out with various women. The sex scenes are as graphic as a softcore movie could get and have a horny erotic feel to them. It is however somewhat problematic that the actress playing Livia looks barely older than 15  she has a nude shower scene a tame love scene with Mike a very sexual disco dance and most troubling a brutal and prolonged rape scene where her naked body is abused and tossed around like a ragdoll. The BBFC certainly had problems with this casting and cut over 6 minutes out of the film at its last 2008 submission to remove scenes in which a naked or seminaked child is portrayed in a sexual and exploitative manner including a scene of sexual violence. This certainly gives the film an added edge of danger but the rape  coming out of nowhere in terms of dramatic buildup and Mario's character development  leaves a nasty taste in the mouth.But perhaps a nasty taste is one of the affects that Eurosleaze cinema of this ilk is designed to provoke? If so then Emanuelle Queen of Sados aka Emanuelle Queen Bitch aka Emanuelle's Sweet Revenge et al is a pretty ripe slice of the Eurosleaze a veritable factory of zesty overripened oranges.".

	schema:headline " Should have been called Mario King of the Sados";
	schema:reviewBody "Although several cuts above the average Emanuelle opus the only character who generates any interest here is Haris Tryfonas as Mario the hitman hired by Emannuelle to bump off her wealthy perverted husband by arranging a fatal accident. Most of the film centers on Mario's continuous casual but very passionate conquests of the fair sex and he is mostly responsible for the film's erotic scenes as he trails Emanuelle to blackmail her. A couple of these scenes are with a woman he met on the plane to Cyprus and they're both erotic and humorous as soon as she puts some eggs in the frying pan or some fresh coffee on to boil when he arrives he inevitably has at her. The eggs heat up and explode or the coffee boils over and splatters a perfect accompaniment to their hot passionate sex bouts. Mario is actually pretty cool in demeanor until his vicious side comes out...and his brutal graphic rape of the spoiled pubescent stepdaughter destroys any feelings of approval one might have formed for him. Emannuelle in this film is just as immoral and coldblooded mean and vicious.The abrupt ending only hints at her ambitions coming to an end when her part as instigator in the murder plot is revealed. Worth watching for Tryfonas' performance which is the only element in this that hold one's interest. With his memorable portrayal of the sinister but sexy ladykiller with the fresh daily rose in his teeth Tryfonas alone raises it to a 7. Without him there would be no film at all and it would rate barely a 3.".

	onyx:emotionText "Although several cuts above the average Emanuelle opus the only character who generates any interest here is Haris Tryfonas as Mario the hitman hired by Emannuelle to bump off her wealthy perverted husband by arranging a fatal accident. Most of the film centers on Mario's continuous casual but very passionate conquests of the fair sex and he is mostly responsible for the film's erotic scenes as he trails Emanuelle to blackmail her. A couple of these scenes are with a woman he met on the plane to Cyprus and they're both erotic and humorous as soon as she puts some eggs in the frying pan or some fresh coffee on to boil when he arrives he inevitably has at her. The eggs heat up and explode or the coffee boils over and splatters a perfect accompaniment to their hot passionate sex bouts. Mario is actually pretty cool in demeanor until his vicious side comes out...and his brutal graphic rape of the spoiled pubescent stepdaughter destroys any feelings of approval one might have formed for him. Emannuelle in this film is just as immoral and coldblooded mean and vicious.The abrupt ending only hints at her ambitions coming to an end when her part as instigator in the murder plot is revealed. Worth watching for Tryfonas' performance which is the only element in this that hold one's interest. With his memorable portrayal of the sinister but sexy ladykiller with the fresh daily rose in his teeth Tryfonas alone raises it to a 7.

When the campaign slows down the Commander sends a squad to the top of a mountain behind enemy lines to report on the Japanese troop movements. The squad is commanded by a tough cynical Sergeant who takes no prisoners and even takes the gold from the teeth of the enemy dead. Before the mission starts the lieutenant who has had a cushy job due to a life of wealth and privilege criticizes the Commander over his attitude towards the common soldier and is reassigned to lead the squad.

	schema:reviewBody "Reportedly Norman Mailer's bestselling novel was distilled and sanitized for the screen what book isn't?!  Many people blame this for the rather weak resultant film.  The film IS fairly weak but the adaptation can hardly be the sole cause.  From Here to Eternity and Peyton Place are just two movies adapted from adult novels that were made around this time and were referred to as unfilmable yet the end results were magnificent.  This film concerns hard as nails embittered Ray as an amoral Sergeant who's currently in charge of a motley troop of men in the South Pacific islands during WWII.  Massey costars as a stern General who thinks of men as little more than beads on an abacus as he tries to figure out the strategies and percentages of war.  His assistant Robertson clashes with him on various points and after one particular battle finds himself on a deadly mission alongside Ray and his band of notsomerry men.  Ray gives an okay performance in the film but lacks the sort of leading man magnetism that could have put this over better.  Robertson is thoughtful in his part but doesn't really shine.  Massey has a strong part with many nice moments. Several wellknown TV and movie actors can be found in the troop including the always reliable Jaeckel Best who would later make a fool of himself weekly on Dukes of Hazzard Campbell famous for a guest role on the original Star Trek series the ubiquitous Jones who has an embarrassing role as a lovesick soldier and Rat Pack comedian Bishop who actually gives a nicely balanced performance.  There are some horrible flashbacks featuring various women.  Ray's details his ludicrously presented relationship with trashy Nichols who laughs loudly and inappropriately at the end of it.  Robertson has a dream involving a pallette of society girls he apparently had dabbled with sometimes two at a time.  Real life stripper St. Cyr makes a none too impressive appearance in the beginning of the film inspiring Jones tremendously.  The worst fault the film has is it's pedestrian nature.  There is very little excitement generated throughout even when arresting events are occurring.  The film suffers from tiresome shots of the soldiers marching climbing walking skulking.....  A lot of the momentum gets lost along the way.  This is countered somewhat by several bouts of unfunny physical comedy heated arguments among the men and moments of drunken loudness.  There is just a general unfocused quality in the film possibly caused by shifts in the direction of the plot from the novel. What's worse is that in two hours of film most of the men don't take their shirts off at all and when a few do it's in long shots.  Maybe that's what was missing!  The music does little to enhance the film.  Bernard Herrman who did such miraculous things to Hitchcock films flounders here with unmemorable work.  It's not the worst war film ever made but truly falls short of being a great one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Raoul Walsh's films of the 1950's are uncharted territory much like the South Pacific island where most of the action in Naked and the Dead unfolds. Many of the films aren't available or are rarely seen. Of those that are I'm only familiar with a series of Clark Gable films serving mostly as an excuse for Walsh through Gable to flaunt his reactionary values missing body parts and oldseasalt virility. In none of these films was there any indication that Walsh could deliver something of the scale and complexity of Naked and the Dead which more than equals midperiod lulus like The Roaring Twenties. Walsh was an arbitrary choice to film Norman Mailer's novel. Mailer wrote the book as a young man with a name to make and awards to win. In 1958 Walsh had nothing left to prove to anyone  even when he was Mailer's age I can't imagine him going for Mailer's bludgeoning tactics. Though I'm no Mailer acolyte you do miss his chutzpah at first as the movie has a laidback feel more appropriate for a beach volleyball film. An amphibious landing that brings echoes of DDay is carried out near the beginning of the film during which we're told that 130 men have died but we don't see a single limb get blown off. We just get a couple shots of smoke rising out of the forest as the ships land. You start to worry that Walsh like in those Errol Flynn war films of the 1940's has brought his crew down to Pasadena to film in a state park with three potted palm trees.However the interplay between the actors  Walsh favors longtakes with eight or nine guys just shooting the st stirring hooch and whining about their superiors  is enough to keep you watching. Eventually it dawns on you that Walsh has seen much more of life than Mailer. He is long past the need to sadistically linger on the more dramatic moments of war. You can feel Walsh feeding off his group of actors basking in their youth while lovingly depicting their trials of life the same ones he underwent half a century ago. The approach is very much like Scorsese's in The Aviator in its tendency to concentrate on hope and promise a refusal to wallow in the ugly. Right to the end Walsh resists the impulse to ratchet up the tension  like a conductor guiding his music with a steady pulse the movie just keeps plodding along and a horrific death is given no more emphasis than a running joke about Raymond Massey's character getting a daily bunch of flowers. In the final hour his method pays off. The landscapes open up in spectacular fashion just as each character moves inexorably towards an action that will define them within time like a pin in a map. An authenticity grips the movie and won't let go. The way Walsh has of letting major events happen offscreen begins to feel ominous and evocative of unseen forces worthy of Jacques Tourneur and the underpopulated battles take on massive grandeur in the imagination. A culminating sequence featuring rows upon rows of tanks and mortars battering an invisible enemy is what all directors want to achieve  a moment that goes beyond words into an expression of pure cosmic power millenia of sorrow and rage blending into a firework display for the gods. Think of this as The Naked and the Dead and you'll be disappointed. Think of it as what Terence Malick wanted to do with The Thin Red Line and you will see exactly where he went wrong and where Walsh succeeds. Walsh blows the world up good but unlike the lords of war he does it for love not personal gain. And he takes us all out equally.".

Cummings sends Sgt Croft Aldo Ray and his men into the jungle on a seemingly pointless mission to test a mountain pass that should be easily defended by the Japanese. Croft is a hardnosed leader who kills prisoners and has his men dig gold from the dead's teeth. After a dispute with Cummings Hearn is also sent on the mission. Cummings goes off to headquarters to argue for more troops to stage a big attack. However the small pointless mission may actually hold the key to the island.This is based on Norman Mailer's novel which he infuses with some of his war experiences. First off I don't like the start in Honolulu and the flashbacks. They take the audience out of the war experience. It feels melodramatic and old school like a bad 50s war movie. At its best the movie has a feel of Malick's film 'The Thin Red Line'. The wide field of grass and shots that come out of nowhere give the movie a feeling of foreboding. The cast of characters get scattered in the mission. There is a message being delivered but it's a bit muddled. The movie needs to narrow the focus.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though Norman Mailer wrote many other works like David O. Selznick with Gone With The Wind Mailer never wrote anything as good as The Naked And The Dead. It must have been a source of some frustration to him in trying to top this literary masterpiece.Coming to the screen The Naked And The Dead's impact was neutered somewhat with changes most importantly the death of a main character was eliminated and that person allowed to survive. Still what you get here is a really rancid version of a military campaign in the South Pacific Theater the kind that Hollywood wasn't showing up to that time.There are three main characters. First Cliff Robertson who comes from wealth and privilege and clashes with his martinet of a commanding officer. For that breach of military etiquette Robertson is assigned to lead a patrol behind enemy lines to gather valuable intelligence.The commander he insulted is General Raymond Massey who likes being the martinet but in the end gets showed up rather beautifully by an eager subordinate who took some initiative during a combat situation.Thirdly there is Sergeant Aldo Ray who was probably no prize but whose character was totally twisted by the unfaithfulness of his wife Barbara Nichols. Nichols is just great in a flashback episode as a woman who might just as well have had a sandwich board sign labeled 'floozy' all over her. In some ways her small part is the most memorable in this war film. He's been leading his squad without any officers over him and would like to keep it that way. But he knows his job.Over 59 years later The Naked And The Dead while not totally true to Mailer's words and plot still hasn't aged one single bit. I could see a remake of this one in the future.".

	schema:headline " Contradictions between barbarity and humanity";
	schema:reviewBody "Analysis of the characters in the filmThe main point in the film was the conflict between Hearn and Cummings. Hearn was the representative of humanity and moral and Cummings was the opposite against him. There were several events showing the conflict. Once Cummings summoned Hearn afterward and chastised him for the remark then cautions him against treating the soldiers humanely and urges him to accept that war means killing and death. Cummings suggests that Hearn instill fear and hatred in his men but the lieutenant rejects Cummings' notion as immoral. Second Cummings tells Hearn that in this moment of great destiny for America the only morality is power. There are also several branch lines about the platoon. Most of them are tragic. For example Gallagher is devastated to learn that his pregnant wife has died in childbirth. Croft who was painful because the infidelity of his wife turn out to be calloused and brutal and during the initial landing does not hesitate to personally execute a Japanese prisoner. Wyman who is bitten by a poisonous snake and dies quickly at a river crossing. When Hearn's group is fired upon from the grove Wilson is wounded. Despite Croft's protest Hearn orders him to be taken back to headquarters but the corporal dies moments later. Roth sprains his ankle during the dangerous climb and then later freezes in fear on a narrow precipice. Intending to spur Roth on Croft calls him a lousy Jew causing the soldier to bolt and fall to his death. Fearing Croft will lead them to their deaths Red challenges him but backs down when the sergeant threatens to kill him. At the peak Croft investigates the other side of the hill alone only to be shot and killed by another Japanese patrol. What leads these people to the deathful disaster is not the cruelty of war but the fear which is produced by people himself.At the end of the film Cummings visits the recovering Hearn in the infirmary a few days later. Hearn tells the general that Ridges and Goldstein's dedication saved his life and bolstered his belief that man's innate decency will survive the viciousness of war. Maybe this is an optimistic expectation to reveal the commitment about humanity.The theme of the novelThe story is not simply a narrative of a long war but something deeper. It reflects a social and historical themes. The background of the story is a fictional and tropical island. There are two parallel clues the war and the people in the war.The story takes place on an island in the South Pacific allowing readers to see the relationship between officers and soldiers in the American army which is also a microcosm of American society. Therefore The Naked and the Dead is over the scope of war literature. It is a symbolic to the contradiction between barbarity and humanity. The meaning of Naked in the title is unshielded and nonprotection. It can also be understood as the explosion of human. The thought behind the novel is realism and social criticism. It also has a strong naturalistic color. By using the behaviour out of fear and horror to describe the people as the Naked and the Dead Mailer seems to warn the public that fascism may revive in this century. This is an innovation to those regular war theme novels.They are always living in the wild and irrational ...... and I am lost in the kaleidoscope of death inside. Perhaps there are always only two characters in Norman Mailer's novel the Naked who lose the conscience of humanity and the Dead the shadow of death shrouded. Differences between the novel and the filmWhen Norman Mailer saw the movie one night with his second wife Adele he complained to her that Hollywood had ruined his story. Raoul Walsh the director is quoted in the article as saying the film would not stick too closely to the novel as many of the incidents that were considered shocking at the time of the book's release had already appeared in other films. He had the script rewrittenoften as the film moved through productionand added vivid battle scenes including flamethrowers and tanks that were nowhere in the novel.The apparent differences between the novel and the film were the characters. In the film Hearn was wounded not killed as he was in the book. The flashbacks featuring Hearn also sharply contrasted his cavalier civilian playboy behavior with his serious consideration of moral issues.The illfated Sergeant Croft who it was explained was driven by an overweening urge to command because of the memory of an unfaithful wife. From his actions in the film however one was led to think that he just liked killing.Roth the Jewish soldier who was accidentally killed on patrol. In the novel Roth was drawn as an intellectual who is ambivalent about his Jewishness but is unable to escape antiSemitism. The film portrayed the cruel antiSemitism of Roth's fellow soldiers but ignored the complexities of his own personality.Wilson a harddrinking country boy who died in the book but made it through the movie. Among the major changes from the book to the film the ending of the film was the most affirmative. In the book the idealist Hearn was killed and the sadistic Croft survived. Norman Mailer showed a pessimistic view of humanity but the film weakened it. The film caught neither the spirit nor the intent of the original yarn and became just another war picture.Mailer was so disappointed that he filed suit against RKO Teleradio Pictures and Warner Bros in 1963 seeking reversion of all rights to The Naked and the Dead. The suit was dismissed.The film reviewThe Naked and the Dead has resulted in a professionally but derivative action drama which is no more memorable than similar sagas of strife that have preceded it. Director Raoul Walsh has filled the screen with striking vistas in beautiful color the chilling sound and the fury of conflict but the hearts minds and motives of men exposed to sudden and often useless death which gave the book its awesome power serve merely as sketchy background to battle in this uneven picturization that was unveiled at the Capitol yesterday.The film was come up with an aspect recounted by a platoon doomed to decimation in securing a small island in the Pacific in 1943. The resentment passions brutalities and backgrounds of the men were stated and restated but were generally left with the impression of actors' speaking lines. Here we can see the platoon is in brief and personal outline. They are lonely in a terrible world they never made. They are afraid they hate the jungle their rugged assignments themselves and each other. They recall their sweethearts and wives often. Some are lucky and do survive but others not. It was nearly always as simple as that.Although the Sanders' dialog is plentiful but short of nuances the platoon's stealthy trek its skirmishes with Japanese patrols and the massive climactic assault have been directed with the terrifying realism. It was a great war film. A viewer cannot help but recall scenes of the burning of enemy troops as the lush grass is ignited by the hidden G. I.'s the death throes of a private bitten by a snake the tension of the men as they try to scale a sheer cliff the sounds and the look of the jungle which have been beautifully captured in this color film. Director Walsh and his associates have carefully drawn an impressively stark face of war from The Naked and the Dead but only seldom do they deeply dissect the people involved in it.".

The meaning of Naked in the title is unshielded and nonprotection. It can also be understood as the explosion of human. The thought behind the novel is realism and social criticism. It also has a strong naturalistic color. By using the behaviour out of fear and horror to describe the people as the Naked and the Dead Mailer seems to warn the public that fascism may revive in this century. This is an innovation to those regular war theme novels.They are always living in the wild and irrational ...... and I am lost in the kaleidoscope of death inside. Perhaps there are always only two characters in Norman Mailer's novel the Naked who lose the conscience of humanity and the Dead the shadow of death shrouded. Differences between the novel and the filmWhen Norman Mailer saw the movie one night with his second wife Adele he complained to her that Hollywood had ruined his story. Raoul Walsh the director is quoted in the article as saying the film would not stick too closely to the novel as many of the incidents that were considered shocking at the time of the book's release had already appeared in other films. He had the script rewrittenoften as the film moved through productionand added vivid battle scenes including flamethrowers and tanks that were nowhere in the novel.The apparent differences between the novel and the film were the characters. In the film Hearn was wounded not killed as he was in the book. The flashbacks featuring Hearn also sharply contrasted his cavalier civilian playboy behavior with his serious consideration of moral issues.The illfated Sergeant Croft who it was explained was driven by an overweening urge to command because of the memory of an unfaithful wife. From his actions in the film however one was led to think that he just liked killing.Roth the Jewish soldier who was accidentally killed on patrol. In the novel Roth was drawn as an intellectual who is ambivalent about his Jewishness but is unable to escape antiSemitism. The film portrayed the cruel antiSemitism of Roth's fellow soldiers but ignored the complexities of his own personality.Wilson a harddrinking country boy who died in the book but made it through the movie. Among the major changes from the book to the film the ending of the film was the most affirmative. In the book the idealist Hearn was killed and the sadistic Croft survived. Norman Mailer showed a pessimistic view of humanity but the film weakened it. The film caught neither the spirit nor the intent of the original yarn and became just another war picture.Mailer was so disappointed that he filed suit against RKO Teleradio Pictures and Warner Bros in 1963 seeking reversion of all rights to The Naked and the Dead. The suit was dismissed.The film reviewThe Naked and the Dead has resulted in a professionally but derivative action drama which is no more memorable than similar sagas of strife that have preceded it. Director Raoul Walsh has filled the screen with striking vistas in beautiful color the chilling sound and the fury of conflict but the hearts minds and motives of men exposed to sudden and often useless death which gave the book its awesome power serve merely as sketchy background to battle in this uneven picturization that was unveiled at the Capitol yesterday.The film was come up with an aspect recounted by a platoon doomed to decimation in securing a small island in the Pacific in 1943. The resentment passions brutalities and backgrounds of the men were stated and restated but were generally left with the impression of actors' speaking lines. Here we can see the platoon is in brief and personal outline. They are lonely in a terrible world they never made. They are afraid they hate the jungle their rugged assignments themselves and each other. They recall their sweethearts and wives often. Some are lucky and do survive but others not. It was nearly always as simple as that.Although the Sanders' dialog is plentiful but short of nuances the platoon's stealthy trek its skirmishes with Japanese patrols and the massive climactic assault have been directed with the terrifying realism. It was a great war film. A viewer cannot help but recall scenes of the burning of enemy troops as the lush grass is ignited by the hidden G. I.'s the death throes of a private bitten by a snake the tension of the men as they try to scale a sheer cliff the sounds and the look of the jungle which have been beautifully captured in this color film. Director Walsh and his associates have carefully drawn an impressively stark face of war from The Naked and the Dead but only seldom do they deeply dissect the people involved in it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Naked and the Dead 1958 my rating 7 of 10. I see why this film has a middling score on IMdb after reading a synopsis of the book. If one comes to watch this film after reading the book and hope for it to be very faithful to the book such as a Cain Mutiny film did you will not be happy. I watched the film without reading the book which is considered by many to be one of the greatest novels of the 20th century so I had no preconceptions of how the tale should unfold. For this reason I'm happy I was able to enjoy the film on its own merits I give it a decent score of 7. After reading a synopsis of the book it contains much more personal information about the characters especially pertaining to antiSemitic bigotry and homosexual tendencies. Written in 1948 I bet this book turned some heads it seems ahead of its time. 10 years later America has fought in yet another war and its appetite for war action dramas was changing to a more cynical side. The book mainly focuses on Aldo Ray's character along with some lurid domestic scenes involving soldiers and cheating wives and strippers. Aldo Ray is portrayed as a functioning psychopath not really all that crazy but definitely a murdering sadist as he cold blooded murders a Japanese prisoner. Besides the LieutenantGeneral conflict of Robertson and Massey's characters two action supporting characters I personally like to watch had some decent screen time LQ Jones and Robert Jaeckel. LQ's character is married to a stripper who sends him money silly premise I thought of a Z budget war film LQ was in Iron Angel where he is in a strip club in Asia and there is a stripper there on the main stage up close and personal with a very noticeable appendectomy or caesarian scar. Now that's a really good setting of a raunchy strip bar although I think it had more to do with the film's low budget! Richard Jaeckel gets some good screen time and shows his I'm devastated face he is usually called to perform in his films hey he was a B movie action film guy and one of the few who consistently was called upon to show some emotion other than being angry. This was made by RKO Radio Pictures who was going out of business soon but the production values are decent. We see large military formations in the film not just a squad. Perhaps the end footage was lifted from another film but I doubt it as the end says it was filmed in Panama and probably used our Canal Zone military units at the time for the large scenes. Purists may be dismayed that not much of the tank hardware is accurate but it looks better than the Battle of The Bulge and their newer tanks. Based solely as a war action drama and nothing more I am giving the film a 7 out of 10. If you are coming here after reading the book you may get about 40 percent of the character development guessing and I'm sure would not enjoy it as much. It should be remade now!".

In fact it might've been better to tell the leadup to the fateful patrol in flashbacks. What we get in the Hearn vs. Croft vs. the Japanese vs. the terrain plot strands is a taut captivating plunge into hell and back.It's interesting that at the time that Hearn is injured Croft has the men almost completely in his corner but the tables turn quickly. The men detailed to take Hearn back to the beach grow to respect him whereas Croft's men completely lose respect for him. In a way Croft is a sort of lowlife version of the general. Both men think they're always right dominate those around them and use the war to enhance their egos.Both are shown to be essentially weak men. Hearn seems hapless and almost everything goes wrong for him but he perseveres coming out of his experience stronger and more selfassured. In short his character changes unlike the robotic general and sadistic sergeant. There's quite a bit of chatter about the absurdity of war the unexpected success of the patrol shows how chance plays such a significant role. Oddly enough the very messiness of the patrol confuses the enemy into making a critical mistake and encourages the colonel to mount the decisive attack. By being absent the general was shown up by a subordinate. And Croft giving in to his reckless impulses was eliminated. I'm aware that Mailer's story was altered significantly for the movie which makes me want to reread the novel. The movie stands on its own nonetheless.Strictly as a war movie The Naked and the Dead is very successful. The battle scenes are tense exciting and realistic. Ok we have postwar tanks in several scenes and the Japanese show up with our periodcorrect Shermans but most war movies makedo like this. I'll probably skip through the first part when I watch it again but the second part is not to be missed.".

The story follows a Nazi spy named Henry Faber an extremely vicious Donald Sutherland also known by his code name The Needle who is on to an important information about the Allies invasion plan to Europe during WW2 and might cause a disaster if he gets with that information to Berlin. Kate Nelligan gives a perfect performance as the naive Lucy who gets involved with the dangerous Henry Faber. Adopted from Ken Follet's novel The film successfully keeps the tension on high level in just about every scene. The film is shot in a remarkably beautiful locations in Europe and really captures the alienated atmosphere during WW2. All in all this is a perfect film that shouldn't be missed by anyone who is looking for a powerful and memorable experience. This one is highly recommended 1010.".

The real star of the show is the extremely beautiful Kate Nelligan who falls in love with German spy Die Nadel or The Needle. he kills everything that gets in his way. In the earlier part of the film he discovers that the equipment set up for the invasion of Calais tanks landing craft jeeps etc is all fake and must convey this to Amiral Canaris in the Abwehr.The most interesting part of the movie is that although he is totally ruthless he will not kill Lucy played by Kate. This is most odd since she is hell bent on killing him with shotguns axes revolvers in fact anything she can get her hands on. Here is a man with the greatest secret of the war a German patriot who lets a small woman stop him. He could have killed her and helped the Germans defeat the Yanks in DDay about 10 times over.Although the story is completely unbelievable it is excellently written. The acting displays of the main cast of Casenove Sutherland and Nelligan is very good with Nelligan giving a convincing performance. 1010".

This is a shame as Sutherland produces a truly menacing performance in this film which maintains the suspense of the piece to its conclusion. It's at its best in the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Scottish island. Cazenove is excellent as the crippled pilot and his bittern's at missing out on RAF glory is brilliant.

The best part of the film is the culminating love affair on a remote Scottish island between the murderous German spy Faber Donald Sutherland and the sexually frustrated Lucy Kate Nelligan which is credible and convincingly portrayed.  Sutherland also has a few good scenes in the earlier parts of the movie though certainly not the opening sequence with his curious accent and ludicrously stiff onehanded cycling!

	schema:reviewBody "So at first I had trouble deciding if this film was great or just another war film that would be forgotten about as the years progressed. It was a tough decision that required a day of thought. There were definitely scenes in this film that would embarrass even the most novice movie goer yet there is something about the story and the humanistic approach to a nonhuman element that seeps from this film's pores. The scene that stands out the most in my mind is when Sutherland is running to the rain to catch Lucy. You can obviously tell that he is on a sound stage and water is being thrown in his face. His acting and the way that that particular scene was set up was appalling. It made me laugh instead of feel any sort of suspense or fear. It forced credibility for Sutherland's character right out the door. There were several other scenes that just didn't seem to fit in this film that made you question the theatrical release of this film or if it was a straighttotelevision production. If you can get through these few lapses in the director's train of thought then you will be able to see the powerful story that lies within.When I first saw the box to this film I didn't know what to expect. To my utter enjoyment Eye of the Needle is one of those gems hiding in a mud puddle. After you wipe it off look away from the DVD cover you will begin to see the beauty of this film. As we begin our story we see Sutherland as a normal person but as the film advances our idea and interpretation of his character blows our mind. When most war films simply believe in keeping you in your theater seats by showing graphic images of battle and chaos this film goes in the completely other direction. This is a story between two people and the small battle that they fight for their beliefs. I mentioned earlier that I felt this was a very humanistic film. The reason for that statement is because we witness the human element to war. Billy is the perfect example of a man who has lost a portion of his life yet is too depressed to see the happiness in front of him. Normally in war films this comes late story but in Eye of the Needle it is shown right up front. Next we hardly ever are given a very human side to the villain in these stories. Normally they kill without remorse but again not in this film. What we witness are two humans caught between a hard place with nobody else to turn to. While war is being raged overseas with thousands of troopers it is impressive to see stories like this that revolve around just two people. These two people can have the same effect on the war as a brigade of soldiers. I never saw their reaction to each other coming. I wasn't expecting a message in this film. I brief history lesson about the day to day activities surrounding this dark cloud of our world's history. Also I wasn't expecting to see such powerful acting from Donald Sutherland and Kate Nelligan. Together they created more sparks on screen than most duos today.What they create is better and more realistic than most Hollywood jargon. It is impressive to see this in a war film. I cannot stress that enough. This film surprised me and I am normally not a huge war fan. I think the reason that it stood out was because director Richard Marquand develops two amazing characters and places them in a war torn country only to uproot them again into a place of beauty and nature. We go from one spectrum to the next with Marquand and it works. Ken Follett who wrote the novel that this film is based has done a great job of taking a world that is huge and bringing it down to just these two characters. It is not often that you see that in a war film especially one made in 1981. Overall I flipflopped my decision all around until I finally made a choice. This film was amazing. I can look past the lowbudgeted scenes that make this film dated in the 80s and see the amazing truth behind the characters and story. This is one of the most impressive stories that I have seen come from Hollywood. I could literally watch this film again and probably catch more that I missed the first time. This isn't your average spy film this is instead a film about humans and the comfort we need in our lives. Also I must end with this note if any villain without saying who can use his trademark kill six times in forty minutes you should realize that this film is going to be a great ride.Grade  out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "A ruthless German spy Sutherland discovers the secrets behind the Normandy landings and tries to give the information to the Nazis committing a few murders in the process. But he finds himself stranded on an island the guest of a bitter legless sheep farmer Casenove his lonely wife Nelligan and their little boy. Southerland tries desperately to contact the Uboat waiting for him offshore but is shot and killed by Nelligan.There are weaknesses here and there in the plot. I think we know the moment we see the young boy that he's going to wind up in the clutches of Sutherland's spy. And Casenove doesn't clean and oil his big revolver in an early scene for nothing. And there is a scene towards the end that resembles the Straw Dogs situation with Southerland trying to sneak into a barricaded stone lighthouse.That's about it for the conventional stuff. The rest is pretty original noticeably above average. And the performances are above par too including those of Sutherland who must manage to put on screen a far more complex character than the opening scenes of murder and betrayal reveal. Nelligan is attractive  nurturing and sexy at the same time  without being stunningly gorgeous. Cazenove is often in roles requiring him to be treacherous and weak. He's weak here too both physically and psychologically but clever and brave as well.I'll just say a few words about Sutherland's character Henry Baker whose code name is Der Nadel the needle. All we know of him after the first half hour is that he is a dedicated Nazi spy and a coldblooded killer. Scotland Yard agents who include the superlative Ian Bannon mention in passing that Sutherland was a brilliant student at military school but was raised in a frigid family. He was never married but had one passionate affair. He later reveals that he killed the woman because she broke his heart. His lifelong loneliness synchronizes later with Kate Nelligan's emotional isolation and her glandular glow  her husband is capable of making love to her but avoids both talk and physical contact. Sutherland envies the couple and their grand isolation. Applause for the set decorator. He longs to be left alone on an island with Nelligan and her son. Asked earlier by another agent how one could possibly avoid ruthlessness and killing Sutherland replies One can stop. And although Sutherland doesn't stop he eases off enough at the end to let Nelligan live and she kills him for it.When Southerland is cast up on the doorstep of their cottage like a piece of rotting kelp from another world entirely the couple take him in. Nelligan is delighted to have company. Casenove is suspicious and distant. During his first night in their home while Casenove sleeps she reveals her soul to him reluctantly but honestly and he responds not like a manipulative German agent but like a sympathetic shrink who knows exactly where she's coming from. Southerland says that he envies their son for being loved. Every child is loved says Nelligan. And Southerland replies that no sometimes children can be nothing more than instruments to fill the ambitions of their parents. And we know he's talking about his own childhood.The ending is as tragic as it is because the writers the director and the actors have given us a glimpse into Southerland that has turned him into a recognizable human being instead of just another actionmovie stereotype.The photography is fine. Miklos Rosza's score is recycled from dozens of his earlier films.Neatly done. Worth watching. An adult film not in the cheap sense of the word.".

I think we know the moment we see the young boy that he's going to wind up in the clutches of Sutherland's spy. And Casenove doesn't clean and oil his big revolver in an early scene for nothing. And there is a scene towards the end that resembles the Straw Dogs situation with Southerland trying to sneak into a barricaded stone lighthouse.That's about it for the conventional stuff. The rest is pretty original noticeably above average. And the performances are above par too including those of Sutherland who must manage to put on screen a far more complex character than the opening scenes of murder and betrayal reveal. Nelligan is attractive  nurturing and sexy at the same time  without being stunningly gorgeous. Cazenove is often in roles requiring him to be treacherous and weak. He's weak here too both physically and psychologically but clever and brave as well.I'll just say a few words about Sutherland's character Henry Baker whose code name is Der Nadel the needle. All we know of him after the first half hour is that he is a dedicated Nazi spy and a coldblooded killer. Scotland Yard agents who include the superlative Ian Bannon mention in passing that Sutherland was a brilliant student at military school but was raised in a frigid family. He was never married but had one passionate affair. He later reveals that he killed the woman because she broke his heart. His lifelong loneliness synchronizes later with Kate Nelligan's emotional isolation and her glandular glow  her husband is capable of making love to her but avoids both talk and physical contact. Sutherland envies the couple and their grand isolation. Applause for the set decorator. He longs to be left alone on an island with Nelligan and her son. Asked earlier by another agent how one could possibly avoid ruthlessness and killing Sutherland replies One can stop. And although Sutherland doesn't stop he eases off enough at the end to let Nelligan live and she kills him for it.When Southerland is cast up on the doorstep of their cottage like a piece of rotting kelp from another world entirely the couple take him in. Nelligan is delighted to have company. Casenove is suspicious and distant. During his first night in their home while Casenove sleeps she reveals her soul to him reluctantly but honestly and he responds not like a manipulative German agent but like a sympathetic shrink who knows exactly where she's coming from. Southerland says that he envies their son for being loved. Every child is loved says Nelligan. And Southerland replies that no sometimes children can be nothing more than instruments to fill the ambitions of their parents. And we know he's talking about his own childhood.The ending is as tragic as it is because the writers the director and the actors have given us a glimpse into Southerland that has turned him into a recognizable human being instead of just another actionmovie stereotype.The photography is fine. Miklos Rosza's score is recycled from dozens of his earlier films.Neatly done. Worth watching. An adult film not in the cheap sense of the word.";

The title Eye of the Needle is that it is a reference to the eye of the stiletto blade that Nazi spy Henry Faber uses to kill his enemies . This World War II movie is set in London 1940  during the Blitz when it opens  there a German Superspy  the Needle Donald Sutherland gravitates towards murder and treason . Meanwhile  a young couple goes out in their Just married car  but they have a strong accident . Four years later  a new allied offensive to take place  Normandy or Calais   then  the Needle discovers a vital evidence about the Allies DDay invasion  Operation Overlord . As The Needle capable of terrible violence  he often uses killing means to carry out his purports  at the same time being relentlessly chased by Godliman Ian Bannen . While en route to report his Nazi commander  Admiral Canaris  Secret Service chief  he makes for the Scotish coast to escape on a UBoat when his small boat is shipwrecked before being picked up and the Needle is washed ashore . Posing as a shipwrecked sailor  he washes on a deserted England island  off the Scottish coast  being saved by a family formed by a crippled man Christopher Cazenove  his wife Kate Nelligan and child . And the spy becomes involved with the spouse while he waits to be picked up and he  then  begins to contemplate his role in the war  as both of them must decide between their love or country .Interesting dramathriller plenty of thrills  taut  intrigue and twists . The film relies heavily on Donald Sutherland character when he falls in love with the woman and their lovely as well as twisted relationship . Despite of the fashionable sex and violence  this is a satisfyingly oldfashioned sort of film that avid fans of the genre will love . Nice acting by Donald Sutherland as a German spy carrying information that will reveal the target and being stranded on an isolated island  Donald gives a perfect performance as a cold killer using his trusty switchblade against suspects . This was one of three films in five years where Donald Sutherland played a German character who was either a Nazi or son of a Nazi . The movies are Bear Island 1979 Eyed of the needle 1981 and The Eagle Has Landed 1976. None of the main characters  Sutherland  Nelligan Cazenove  is very sympathetic  but all of them are well drawn  which is more important here . Support cast is frankly good  such as Ian Bannen as relentless pursuer  David Hayman as Canter  Bill Frazer and debut credited theatrical feature film of actor Bill Nighy and first full length feature of Rik Mayall.Colorful and brilliant cinematography by Alan Hume shot on location in Mull  Argyll  Oban and Bute Scotland  Blackbush Airport Hampshire and in Shepperton Studios Shepperton Surrey England . A cottage and lighthouse were constructed on the The Isle of Mull for the production . Impressive and breathtaking musical score by Hollywood maestro Miklos Rozsa in one of his last soundtracks . This intelligent thriller that the Bristish production seems to produce every two or three years was compellingly directed by Richard Marquand . He was hired by George Lucas after seeing Eye of the needle and only nonAmerican to direct a Star Wars film  The return of the Jedi Lucas was mainly impressed how Marquand was able to finish a difficult production on time and on Budget  a factor which was critical on a huge production like Star Wars . His first film was the terror one titled The legacy79  he went on with the successful The jagged edge 85 .

However once Sutherland reaches the island his character takes on a kind of Frankenstein quality the monster we thought we have been watching takes on a sudden pathos that you seldom get with run of the mill thrillers. And for that matter even in most Hitchcocks. Sutherland was a perfect choice for the role and Nelligan is his equal. Very well cast these two.The last minute of the film without giving anything away slips a little.It should have had that lopped off. But that is a very minor quibble.Also it is a very rare chance to catch one of Miklos Roszas scores. Rosza always could be picked out from any other and he is more or less just going through the notes here a long way from his best but even Roszas worst were better than a lot of composers bests.And compared to most of the thrillers of the eighties and nineties this is a bloody masterpiece.".

As I said the second half of EYE OF THE NEEDLE changes in genre slightly so for all the lads who enjoyed the warspy story will become rapidly bored with the second half romantic interlude . I've never read Ken Follet's novel but I got the impression it was something of a pot boiler that women read on sunny beaches so perhaps the story has been badly translated to screen ? That's not to say the movie is bad . Donald Sutherland carries the movie as the cold  ruthless but charming  Needle  who'd probably cut his mother's throat if it expanded the cause of Hitler . It'd be easy for Sutherland to go right over the top in the role but he plays the part in a subtle manner and I did enjoy the aspects where it's revealed he's a spy and the subsequent hunt for him  Even if it leaves a plot hole  How was he able to operate in Britain for four years after his first murder ?   but unfortunately if you enjoyed this aspect then you'd probably be annoyed with the second half and the amount of violence in the early part of the movie means much of the audience the film was intended for wouldn't want to see the latter half".

Movie is really successful about giving audience the pressure of the timeline.But the most important thing is this movie holds the tension into the lives of people who has no connect with the war.Spy hides in the home of a family which lives in an islandfar from war.They don't know who he is and police don't know where he is.So movie adds new level of adventure to its structure and gets some kind of thriller atmosphere.Will the secrets be in the hands of Nazis and what will be the end of the family.         Donald Sutherland plays a classical performance.The director does a good job about creating the tension.And the most beautiful thing is the movie itself.It has all the 70's spy movie genre and cinematography and holds the 'danger to the civil' factor besides all superpower states relationships.         And my conclusion for this movie is simpleNo matter how far you arethe war will be knocking your doorin one way or another.".

Movie is really successful about giving audience the pressure of the timeline.But the most important thing is this movie holds the tension into the lives of people who has no connect with the war.Spy hides in the home of a family which lives in an islandfar from war.They don't know who he is and police don't know where he is.So movie adds new level of adventure to its structure and gets some kind of thriller atmosphere.Will the secrets be in the hands of Nazis and what will be the end of the family.         Donald Sutherland plays a classical performance.The director does a good job about creating the tension.And the most beautiful thing is the movie itself.It has all the 70's spy movie genre and cinematography and holds the 'danger to the civil' factor besides all superpower states relationships.         And my conclusion for this movie is simpleNo matter how far you arethe war will be knocking your doorin one way or another.";

About the only portion of the movie that you could believe in was that Germany would want to know where the landing would be. Ignore for the moment that the British had captured all the spies but even if they had not they wouldn't have let one roam around like this just to reassure the Germans that the landing would be at Calais. It isn't one major thing that makes the movie not work. It is the culmination of all the things wrong that makes the movie fail. Bad directing bad scripts no attempt at authenticity at all all combine to just make the movie fall flat. Generally speaking spies should fade into the woodwork. The suspense comes in with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being detected. On this one that game was over from the start. This spy was doing anything but spying. Your only chance at getting something that has some credibility and instills some suspense may be to read the book.".

The whole outcome of the war hinges on whether he manages to do so which makes for one of those thrillers that's packed with suspense from the very beginning until the very end. This is a film made with a gritty nasty streak to it and Sutherland is thoroughly convincing here just as good as he was playing the hero of DON'T LOOK NOW and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.

	schema:reviewBody "Author Ken Follett was making a name for himself long before the current crop of spy thriller authors came along. Along with a few other writers he took on the job of creating a believable world of spies in the tradition of Ian Fleming's James Bond and the sales of their books led to those being created today. In 1976 he wrote the novel EYE OF THE NEEDLE and in 1981 it was made into a feature film. The movie didn't do amazing box office but it did offer a well thought out slow burn spy thriller that takes place in WWII.It's shortly before DDay and preparations are in order to launch an attack against Germany by the allied forces. Germany has been doing their best to infiltrate England and the find out when the attack will come and where it will come from. Inserted into the country their top spy a ruthless assassin and sociopath has discovered that a fake mockup has been created to divert the Germans. As he is about to be caught he escapes to a remote island and now must wait to be picked up by a Uboat.The spy is Heinrich Faber Donald Sutherland known as The Needle because of his weapon of choice for assassination is a stiletto. When he arrives at the island he meets its only inhabitants the disabled man of the house David Christopher Cazenove his wife Lucy Kate Nelligan and their young son Joe. Counting on their hospitality he stays with them a few days. In that short amount of time a romance between Faber and Lucy unfolds two lonely people for different reasons brought together.For Faber his life is one of solitude and the opportunity for a connection to another human being is rare at best. For Lucy we have a woman whose husband has withdrawn from the world due to the injury that left him disabled. We are presented with two people who should not have the affair that they do but because of the situations life has left them in they find one another.David becomes suspicious of Faber and looks into just who he is and what he has with him. The result of his investigation is murder at the hands of Faber. When Lucy realizes what is going on it is left to her to stop this spy from contacted his Uboat and taking information with him that will cause England to lose the war. With her life and that of her young son in the way will she be up to the task at hand? And will the romance that came between the two prevent either from doing what they must? The movie is a slow burn a thriller that unspools the story at a pace that offers more story than action. It takes its time to place the characters in the right place to maneuver them into emotional moments and to allow the viewer to get to know each of them before events occur. We understand why David is bitter why Lucy is lonely and why Faber is determined to complete his mission. Life is messy and the intersecting of these three people shows how unpredictable it can be.Director Richard Marquand has done a fantastic job of creating both the remote location of the small island with the remote feelings on hand in the characters. It is this combination that pulls us in to wonder what will happen to hope for the best and to fear the worst. The fact that Faber at any moment could just kill all three people including a young child makes him one of the more dangerous characters seen on film. And yet we understand why Lucy is drawn to him due to her circumstances.All of the actors involved give it their best. It isn't a splashy movie but a subtle one and their performances match that subtlety. For me this was the second film I'd seen Nelligan in the first being Dracula. She does a great job here but for some reason never made it to megastar status. She should have. Sutherland shows that his acting chops were not a fluke in and that he is incredibly talented.As I said the movie did respectable business but was not a smash hit. Fortunately we have the chance to see it in pristine condition with this release from Twilight Time. The odds of finding a better looking edition of this movie are unlikely. Extras include an isolated score track audio commentary with music historian Jon Burlingame and film historians Julie Kirgo and Nick Redman and the original theatrical trailer. As with all Twilight Time editions this one is limited to just 3000 copies so fans will want to make sure they pick one up before they are gone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Philip Raven Alan Ladd is a gun for hire. He lives alone in a small room and gives milk to a lonely cat every morning. But he doesn't seem to appreciate the company of humans. He never smiles and he won't trust anybody.  He is asked by Willard Gates to kill a man and steal documents from him. After Gates paid Raven with hot money Raven decided to find Gates to settle a score with him. In the meanwhile a cabaret performer Ellen Graham Veronica Lake the girl friend of a Police lieutenant is secretly charged by a senator to infiltrate a company  Nitro  that is suspected to sell army secrets to the Japanese. For this she goes to an audition to be hired by Willard Gates owner of a cabaret but also an employee of Nitro. In the train on her way to Los Angeles Ellen Graham meets Philip Raven both unaware that they are involved in the same case. When they arrive in Los Angeles the Police is after him and he has to kidnap Ellen to get away from it. Realizing they have the same enemy Ellen convinces Raven to forget his own interest and start to fight the people of Nitro in the interest of the country. This is the first Alan Ladd Veronica Lake movie but it is also probably the best. The plot the acting the dialogue and the direction are so great that these make This gun for hire' a classic film noir. At the beginning the credits mention introducing Alan Ladd. For his first leading role the least we can say is that Ladd gives a great performance. It is obvious that his character inspired the character of Jeff in Le samourai' by JeanPierre Melville with Alain Delon. Both characters have the same attitude and the same clothes. They live alone a small room. They never get involve in any relationship and both are very professional. They are only kind to animals and children in Le samourai' Delon had a bird in his room. Also the sequence on the pedestrian bridge of the railroad has clearly its equivalent in Le Samourai'. I was really impressed by the first sequence when Ladd execute his contract and also by the sequence where Ladd and Lake are running across the city to escape from the Police which is much of the movie. How breathtaking! This is truly great cinema quiet a good surprise for a director Frank Tuttle who is not that well known. I've seen The Blue Dahlia' the Glass key' and this gun for hire' these last three days film noir retrospective in Oak Street Cinema Minneapolis in this order reverse of the chronological one but I must say that the quality increase in this order. This gun for hire' is much darker and less funny than the movie they made together after that but it is a better film noir. Definitely a masterpiece. High recommended 910.".

I was really impressed by the first sequence when Ladd execute his contract and also by the sequence where Ladd and Lake are running across the city to escape from the Police which is much of the movie. How breathtaking! This is truly great cinema quiet a good surprise for a director Frank Tuttle who is not that well known. I've seen The Blue Dahlia' the Glass key' and this gun for hire' these last three days film noir retrospective in Oak Street Cinema Minneapolis in this order reverse of the chronological one but I must say that the quality increase in this order. This gun for hire' is much darker and less funny than the movie they made together after that but it is a better film noir. Definitely a masterpiece. High recommended 910.";

	schema:headline " Great early Noir";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a great compelling crime thriller that stands the test of time quite well. This would be one of the first movies I'd choose to show to a fan of recent movies who wants to explore classic thrillers but doesn't know where to start along with The Maltese Falcon and one or two others. While many period pieces are appreciated this one still provides a jolt of adrenaline right from the opening scene when Alan Ladd rips the maid's dress and slaps her. He's a bad man no doubt about it and his portrayal throughout most of the movie is surprisingly dark even by today's standards. His character Raven is a man whose sole act of human compassion is not to murder a crippled orphan in cold blood and Ladd's performance is underplayed just enough to make him chillingly believable. This is a relatively early feature in the cycle that would later be called film noir. A few films had begun to establish the new look and feel for the new generation of gangster movies but the archetypal noirs were still a couple of years off. This movie is an interesting example of the early style because it visits the typical noir territory culturally and emotionally but avoids the stereotypical noir cast of characters. Rather than a flawed weak man and a femme fatale This Gun For Hire gives us a coldly amoral killer as the male lead and a tough streetwise woman as the main good guy her cop boyfriend spends most of the film running around frantically and accomplishing nothing. Visually this film is pure noir. It's directed by Frank Tuttle who made the first version of The Glass Key in 1935 combining a hardboiled gangster story and expressionistinfluenced lighting. This Gun For Hire fits firmly into that mode and shows that many of the stylistic trademarks of the supposedly postwar Noir style were firmly in place before the US had even been in WW2 for a full year. More importantly it provides thrills and a great dose of the good stuff in a neat 81minutelong package.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film that launched Alan Ladd's career This Gun For Hire is a very short film like the earlier Public Enemy which gave James Cagney his stardom. This would be the normal length of a B film but it definitely gets all it wants to say in its brief running time.Essentially we have three stories where all the principal players get brought together in the end. The first involves Robert Preston investigating a reported payroll robbery of the firm that Tully Marshall is the president of. Note that I said 'reported robbery.' The second involves his girl friend entertainer Veronica Lake being recruited by no one less than a United States Senator to get the goods on one of Marshall's top aides Laird Cregar who they think is doing some fifth column work at the behest of Marshall. Finally we have contract killer Alan Ladd who's hired by Cregar to bump off Frank Ferguson who is blackmailing Marshall as to his treasonous activities. Preston Ladd and Lake don't know they are all on the same case but by the end of the film they do.Alan Ladd became Paramount's answer to Humphrey Bogart as a star of actionadventure films and noir films. This Gun for Hire launched his career. He was enormously popular through the Forties Paramount's biggest star after Crosby and Hope. He played cynical tough guys in modern films but then branched into westerns where for the most part he was the gallant hero. In fact the ultimate gallant white knight hero in Shane.His part as Raven is a difficult one yet he pulls it off. He's a cold blooded contract killer one of the earliest ever portrayed as a film protagonist. Yet he's human and you see flashes of it his concern for cats. As a cat lover I can sure identify with that. Raven is also one of the earliest characters in cinema who talks about child abuse making him what he is. Groundbreaking when you think about it.Next to Ladd the biggest kudos have to go to Laird Cregar borrowed from 20th Century Fox to play Willard Gates. Gates is a top company executive with Marshall's firm which is a defense contractor which is why the Senate is interested in him. He's basically a jerk who thinks he's so clever. Veronica Lake gets to him real easy because of his weakness for the nightclub scene. And he really doesn't take the full measure of Raven even though the audience is very aware of how deadly he is.When you think about it what Cregar and Marshall do is unbelievably stupid. They hire Ladd to kill Ferguson and then pay him with hot money from the alleged robbery. Why would you do that? Chances are in the rackets they're involved in they might have need of his services in the future. Not a guy to get mad at you. In fact their double cross is what sets the whole film plot in motion. Moral is never double cross a guy who says and means that I'm my own police.This Gun for Hire was Director Frank Tuttle's finest film. He was a contract director for Paramount who did a whole bunch of films with their various stars in the Thirties and Forties. When he hadn't worked in a while Alan Ladd got him a job directing him in Hell On Frisco Bay while he was at Warner Brothers and Tuttle also directed A Cry In the Night which Ladd produced. Ladd remembered and was grateful to Tuttle for helping break through into top star ranks. Ladd was like John Wayne that way ever ready to help a colleague down on his luck.Veronica Lake is recruited by a U.S. Senator with a fictitious name but in fact there was a committee looking into all kinds of things like this in the Senate in regard to the conduct of the war. It was headed by a Senator from Missouri named Harry Truman who went on to higher office. I wonder if Truman liked This Gun for Hire? Veronica Lake got a big boost in her career. She and Ladd became a classic screen team as a result of this film.This film is one great cinematic classic so important to so many careers and still keeps you on the edge of your seat today.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a straightforward linear quickmoving story based on a much more interesting book. But it's still an entertaining movie and probably close to required viewing if you enjoy noir andor Forties movies.Raven Alan Ladd is a hired killer evidently without remorse or nerves who is paid to knock off a blackmailer. The blackmailer was trying to take to the cleaners a corrupt industrialist who was coincidentally helping the enemy. This is during WWII. However Raven is paid in counterfeit bills on the assumption the police will catch him when he spends the money. He discovers the plot and decides to take out the guy who hired him and the fellow the industrialist who was behind it all. The movie bills Veronica Lake and Robert Preston above the title Laird Cregar just below the title and Alan Ladd last in big type as Introducing Alan Ladd. Some introduction according to IMDb Ladd had already appeared in more than 40 films in unbilled and minor parts. This was Ladd's breakthrough movie and he's very good in it. I don't think he was much of an actor but he had a lot of star presence especially in the movies he made in the Forties. There was always something passive but potentially dangerous about him. His looks could have kept him in the pretty boy category but for whatever reason didn't. Veronica Lake for me is something of an acquired taste but for whatever reason she and Ladd made an effective pairing that was repeated several times. Laird Cregar played the heavy and he was an interesting actor. Big and fleshy he was something of a Raymond Burr type but more versatile. Robert Preston is seldom mentioned in regard to this movie and this must have ticked him off. Here's a guy who usually played best friend of the lead gets a good part as the lead in a solid movie  and winds up being overshadowed by Ladd.The first five minutes or so of the movie are among the most efficient I've come across in establishing a major player's character and complexities. We first see Raven waking up in his rented rooms and checking the clock. Nothing out of the ordinary there. In very short order however he's taken a gun out helped a stray kitten get into his room and given it some food slapped hard and full in the face a maid who tried to kick out the cat showed up at the blackmailer's place where he meets the blackmailer who was supposed to be alone the blackmailer has his secretary with him so he just kills them both on the way out a little girl on the stairs asks him to get her ball which has rolled away she sees his face he obviously thinks about shooting her too  but gets the ball for her and leaves. In just a few minutes Raven's cold ruthlessness and his conflicts are established and so is a sort of sympathy for him. These first few minutes in my view are what make the movie work.".

	schema:headline " Hooray for Gates and Tommy!";
	schema:reviewBody "Frank Tuttle is one of those directors like William Seiter who is not consistently good but who could do a terrific job now and then that retains our admiration. Seiter directed Laurel  Hardy in their best feature film THE SONS OF THE DESERT and turned in an above average job with the Marx Brothers in ROOM SERVICE. Tuttle did this film noir classic and did it well. Based on a novel or as the author called it an entertainment by Graham Greene Tuttle made a star of Alan Ladd and created the first of a series of films costarring Ladd and Veronica Lake as his cool opposite number. He was ably abetted by a good cast of character actors Laird Cregar Tully Marshall Robert Preston at the start of his career Marc Lawrence.... It was a terrific little thriller.Laird Cregar's Willard Gates is one of the funniest neurotics in film noir. An overweight lady's man he seems to go in both directions using his money and nightclub to pick up women and yet being a trembling tub of lard who enjoys reading Naughty Paris at Night while eating a box of chocolates in his private bedroom on his train. Cregar's Gates is augmented by his chauffeur  bodyguard  factotum Tommy who has a wicked sense of ghoulish humor and is able to make his queasy boss go nuts with fear just by describing a possible method of getting rid of Lake's prospectively dead body tied with cat gut that would disintegrate in a month allowing her body to rise in a river and leave her death a mystery. Cat gut what a horrible word! quivers Gates. Marvelous  just look at Lawrence's grin as he speaks. He knows what he's doing.The novel is a peculiar problem not too frequently mentioned in discussing the film. It was set in 1935 in the midlands of England. At the beginning Raven is shown going to the office of a man who turns out to be Europe's leading peace advocate. He comes in using a letter from an unknown person. The peace advocate is happy at the recognition given to him by the letter's author and sits down to read it. In a moment Raven kills the man and then his secretary who is a witness.

Seiter directed Laurel  Hardy in their best feature film THE SONS OF THE DESERT and turned in an above average job with the Marx Brothers in ROOM SERVICE. Tuttle did this film noir classic and did it well. Based on a novel or as the author called it an entertainment by Graham Greene Tuttle made a star of Alan Ladd and created the first of a series of films costarring Ladd and Veronica Lake as his cool opposite number. He was ably abetted by a good cast of character actors Laird Cregar Tully Marshall Robert Preston at the start of his career Marc Lawrence.... It was a terrific little thriller.Laird Cregar's Willard Gates is one of the funniest neurotics in film noir. An overweight lady's man he seems to go in both directions using his money and nightclub to pick up women and yet being a trembling tub of lard who enjoys reading Naughty Paris at Night while eating a box of chocolates in his private bedroom on his train. Cregar's Gates is augmented by his chauffeur  bodyguard  factotum Tommy who has a wicked sense of ghoulish humor and is able to make his queasy boss go nuts with fear just by describing a possible method of getting rid of Lake's prospectively dead body tied with cat gut that would disintegrate in a month allowing her body to rise in a river and leave her death a mystery. Cat gut what a horrible word! quivers Gates. Marvelous  just look at Lawrence's grin as he speaks. He knows what he's doing.The novel is a peculiar problem not too frequently mentioned in discussing the film. It was set in 1935 in the midlands of England. At the beginning Raven is shown going to the office of a man who turns out to be Europe's leading peace advocate. He comes in using a letter from an unknown person. The peace advocate is happy at the recognition given to him by the letter's author and sits down to read it. In a moment Raven kills the man and then his secretary who is a witness. This is changed in the movie to the murder of Baker a blackmailer and his girlfriend by Raven. The letter is from an important industrialist and munition dealer  Sir Marcus. His associate is the middle man between Sir Marcus and Raven as Gates is in the film. But it is not in southern California in 1942 and not dealing with treason with Japan.

The most enlightening thing I found when reading up on the film was that the studio were so blown away by the efforts of Alan Ladd as Raven they turned the script around to make him the film's chief axis and boy what a smart move that was for this is Alan Ladd's show all the way.Ladd plays Raven with brilliant icy veneer he's cold and devoid of emotion his only trip to anything resembling caring is an affinity to cats because in his own words cats don't need anyone they are on their own just like me the result is one of the most unnerving killers put on to the 40s cinema screens. Veronica Lake is the stunning female of the piece she glides thru the picture with ease as Ellen a character with her own issues but thankfully she's integral outside of any sort of romantic plot even tho she is the only one who gets close enough to Raven to learn anything about what makes him tick. Robert Preston as Michael Crane was to be the films focus but he becomes a mere side part thanks to Ladd's barnstorming show and Laird Cregar is suitably shifty as Gates. It's a fine film in its own right it's tightly filmed wonderfully scripted and contains a great noir ending but ultimately it's all about the cold as death hitman Raven and the great performance by the man who played him. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This Gun for Hire has an uncommon richness of details for a film noir and a terrific supporting cast. There are as many small original ideas and nuances as in an early Hitchcock movie. This Gun for Hire is impregnated with a kind of elegant sarcasm that later got lost as the noir genre became more and more minimalistic. Many scenes dug themselves deep into my memory this is what makes watching movies so fascinating. It starts with Raven the frail insecure bad guy played by Alan Ladd caring for a cat in his boarding house while someone plays harshly on a badly tuned piano somewhere in the vicinity. Another beautiful scene That Raven is not the hard boiled character he yearns to be is underlined by his meeting a crippled girl on the stairs that lead to the man he is to murder. On the way back after the job the girl stops him and asks him to retrieve a ball she had let fall and cannot reach because of her impediment. First Raven wants to kill her because she is a witness. He reaches for his gun then he hesitates and finally decides to pick up the ball hands it over to the girl and leaves hastily. The well acted and filmed encounter does not take more than ten seconds but it is deeply moving.Veronica Lake sings! Apparently it was an item that her kind of character was required to deliver in a movie like this. Her curious Hocuspocus song sung during an audition for a job as a conjurer is a sheer delight! I know the refrain by heart and could recommend the film for this song alone. Never ever have I seen someone sing with such a bored deadpanattitude  it's fantastic! Lake is doing little conjuring tricks all along  the song's lyrics are actually commenting those tricks. And just listen to the quirky warbling of the accompanying orchestra!Laird Cregar and Marc Lawrence constitute a memorable team as Willard Gates the man who had framed Raven and his chauffeur and sidekick Tommy. Willard Gates is afraid of Raven to the point of hysteria Tommy likes nothing better than seeing his arrogant boss scared. The strange relationship between the two persists to the climactic ending during a gasattack exercise. How Tommy happily gloats after having scared his boss by entering his office with a gas mask is a sight to behold. It is a fine example about how Schadenfreude can soothe a hurt self! Also notable is the character of the big schemer behind it all a grizzled paralyzed tycoon who does not give up to the very end trying to shoot Raven with a gun disguised as a pen. Finally he gets a heart seizure and as his last act among the living catapults a glass of milk from the tray fixed to his wheelchair.Frank Tuttle belongs to Hollywoods lesser known directors. This film shows he could do a very good job. He added suspenseful action parts shot on location to his films in This Gun for Hire there are good shots of a railroad yard and of Raven fleeing over a long narrow footbridge across the tracks.".

Veronika Lake is wonderful and very gorgeous inclusive singing two songs. I disagree with the reference of filmnoir for This Gun For Hire since there is no femmefatale no dirty cop no weak man other than Gates or sordid motivation.

Having finally watched the whole thing I can easily see why Curtis Hansen and Brian Helgaland gave This Gun For Hire that respectful tip of the hat.It is obvious that this was made during WWII from its references to the overseas menace but I personally wouldn't let such politics get in the way of enjoying and understanding this movie. To do that one must focus on the character of Raven as played by Alan Ladd a vicious detached hitman with a soft spot for kids and cats...but no friends. He doesn't kill because it's fun for him it's just a job. He does live by his own code a major tenet of which is never to doublecross him. One thing that seems to sail right over people's heads is the fact that Raven is the product of an abused childhood. That such a defining bit made it to the screen and that the abuser was female should tell one how little audiences paid attention to such things in spite of the fact that such were not and are still not isolated incidents.Patriotism does not motivate Raven in the slightest just his own self interest. The reason he eventually does what he does has more to do with Veronica Lake probably the only friend he has ever truly had. I almost wonder if in her he sees the mother that he never truly had...but one can also write that one off as Freudian BS so make of it what you will. One thing that shouldn't be ignored on the other hand is the fact that but for a lucky distraction he would have plugged her to leave less of a trail. It's only when she refuses to hand him over to his enemies that their strange friendship really begins. All this makes Raven one of the most unromantic unglamourous hardboiled protagonists that have made it to screen.Now as to Ms. Lake the thing that struck me about her was how unglamourous SHE was here. I don't mean that as an insult mind just that she seemed to share a characteristic with Kathrine Hepburn in that comparing her with the other sex goddesses of the time would be like comparing the moon to the sun. As is fitting with the story she strikes one as being more motherly rather than gun moll material. Not that she can't bring the house down her opening songandmagic routine is one of the great alltime showstoppers. In fact the only time I really had cause to hate her is when she gets into the arms of her cop fiancee and says Hold me. at the end but it's a minor complaint. Had there been a more radiant actress the whole thing would have fallen apart. As it is she fits perfectly.Don't let the overt mobilization messages distract you.

	schema:headline " Ladd Lake Treason  Treachery";
	schema:reviewBody "This Gun For Hire is an excellent early film noir with an intriguing storyline and some memorable performances especially from Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake. The screenplay by W.R. Burnett and Albert Maltz was adapted from Graham Greene's novel A Gun For Sale and incorporates a heady mixture of blackmail murder betrayal revenge espionage and treason to ensure that the excitement never flags. This movie's famous for propelling Alan Ladd to star status and also features the first appearance of the now legendary LaddLake partnership.The opening scenes quickly establish that Phillip Raven Alan Ladd is a ruthless hit man who loves cats but has absolutely no compunction about violently attacking a maid without any real provocation. After killing a chemist who'd been blackmailing the Nitro Chemical Corporation NCC and having been paid by their employee Willard Gates Laird Cregar he discovers that he's been paid in marked bills and that the police have been informed that the money was stolen from the NCC. Predictably this sets Raven off in pursuit of Gates so that he can take revenge as swiftly as possible.Gates also runs The Neptune Club where he employs an entertainer called Ellen Graham Veronica Lake. By coincidence Ellen is the fiance of Police Lieutenant Michael Crane Robert Preston who's been put in charge of tracking down the alleged thief.Raven's pursuit of Gates leads him to take a train journey to LA during which he meets Ellen. When Gates sees that Raven's on the train he notifies the police but Raven's successful escape leads to a sequence of events which culminate in Ellen persuading Raven to abandon his quest for deadly revenge and to take a course of action which ultimately brings an end to the NCC's involvement in a plot to sell a secret poison gas formula to one of the US's wartime enemies.Alan Ladd is very impressive as the cold laconic psychopathic killer who hates and distrusts everyone and never shows any sign of humour or emotion. The root of his personality disorder lies in his appalling childhood experiences which he describes to Ellen whose manner towards him draws out an element of trust which he almost certainly hasn't ever shown to anyone else before in his adult life.Ellen is the most compelling character in the story as she's not only a singer dancer and magician but also Crane's fiance Raven's confidante Gates' employee and an agent who's been employed by the government to gather evidence about the traitorous activities of the NCC Willard Gates and the corporation's evil boss Alvin Brewster Tully Marshall. Veronica Lake displays a kind of cool composure which is very engaging and the level of warmth which she shows towards Raven in finely balanced and proves to be precisely what's required to gain his trust.Laird Cregar provides good support as the fat slimy Gates who's hooked on peppermints and perfectly happy to be an agent of death even though he has no stomach for violence himself. Tully Marshall also gives a very colourful performance as an elderly invalid who's irredeemably wicked and wheelchair bound but also a powerful and traitorous top industrialist. John Seitz's cinematography with its expert use of shadows perfectly enhances the sense of menace and distrust which seems to pervade the whole movie and the fact that it remains so interesting and entertaining so many years after it was made is strong evidence of its considerable quality.".

	onyx:emotionText "This Gun For Hire is an excellent early film noir with an intriguing storyline and some memorable performances especially from Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake. The screenplay by W.R. Burnett and Albert Maltz was adapted from Graham Greene's novel A Gun For Sale and incorporates a heady mixture of blackmail murder betrayal revenge espionage and treason to ensure that the excitement never flags. This movie's famous for propelling Alan Ladd to star status and also features the first appearance of the now legendary LaddLake partnership.The opening scenes quickly establish that Phillip Raven Alan Ladd is a ruthless hit man who loves cats but has absolutely no compunction about violently attacking a maid without any real provocation.

This was Alan Ladd's breakthrough performance and although he is billed under the title with introducing credits he had made many films prior to this often in small unrewarding roles sometimes uncredited. His Philip Raven is coldblooded ruthless but vulnerable his abusive past always foremost in his mind although he shows a soft spot for cats children and Veronica Lake. In their first pairing Ladd and Lake show the electric intensity that made them a great screen pair of the 1940s. Both were petite blond with cool acting styles that belied their sometimes sensitive natures no matter what kind of a tough front they presented. Lake's character Ellen Grahame is a nightclub performer her vocals were dubbed by Martha Mears who finds herself drawn into spying on her rather suspicious boss. Laird Cregar is the almost sympathetic villain Gates who burned Raven and in doing so has signed his own death warrant. Robert Preston portrays Ellen's fiance Lt. Michael Craven who is determined to capture Raven. When Ellen unwittingly finds herself alongside Phillip on a train she ends up in on his job and later in the proceedings as his 'hostage'. They soon form a rather tentative bond as Raven relates his horrendous childhood beatings at the hand of a nasty relative. She reaches out to him and although he rejects her comfort he thinks she's trying to make him go soft he agrees to help her get Gates to reveal his dastardly plans for America involving bombs this was during WW2 after all. There is an almost misty eyed longing in their faces sensing that maybe if in another time or another place things might have been different. A touching moment when Raven rests his head on Lake's shoulder on the train his telltale deformed wrist exposed.There can be no good ending for this killer for he is a bad guy. But after pulling off what he was so set on doing he also has redeemed himself through his friendship with Ellen. Did I do okay for you? Phillip asks her with his dying breath to which she responds with a compassionate smile and nod. A tiny grin briefly crosses his face before he closes his eyes. Ellen embraces Michael uttering the somewhat inane phrase Oh Michael my darling hold me. Fade out to final credits. The other films Ladd and Lake made together are becoming increasingly hard to find there really ought to be a DVD box set.The DVD looks very good however there are no extras included not even the original theatrical trailer.

	schema:reviewBody "his Gun For Hire has been described as 'one of the most important early films noir' and one that 'helps to establish a number of conventions of the genre'. 1 The film's enduring significance lies in its influence on a particular subset of classic and postclassic noir films featuring the figure of the lone assassin. Directed by Frank Tuttle himself something of a Paramount Studios gun for hire the film's exploration of the last days of a solitary embittered hitman reverberates through everything from JeanPierre Melville's Le Samourai France 1968 to more recent meditations on the form  Luc Besson's The Professional USA 1994 and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog USA 1999.Scriptwriters Albert Matz and W.R.Burnett adapted Graham Greene's A Gun For Sale 1936 to the American screen transposing the original story of a London hitman to the emblematic noir territory of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Greene's Phillip Raven is 'dark and thin and made for destruction...a screwedup figure' with a 'repulsive' harelip who is contracted by a wealthy industrialist to kill a socialist minister. 2 In the Paramount scenario Alan Ladd plays the considerably less disfigured Raven hired to dispense with a blackmailing industrial chemist in the employ of chemical tycoon Alvin Brewster Tully Marshall.Matz and Burnett embellished Greene's leftleaning political thriller with some definitively American elements not the least of which was the incorporation of prevailing American propagandist sentiments. Midshooting schedule this interwar production was thus able to graft an overt antiJapanese discourse onto Greene's narrative of political intrigue. Tellingly the American script also transforms Greene's wealthy industrialist Sir Marcus into a monstrous figure of capitalist corruption. Brewster 'King Chlorine' a desiccated wheelchairbound tyrant has been read as a thinly veiled portrait of Henry Ford. 3 On a more minor note Matz and Burnett give Raven's brutal existence a new and thoroughly contemporary Freudian motivation  he kills to avenge his own abuse at the hands of a unforgiving aunt.This Gun for Hire unfolds with workmanlike efficiency. Raven is established as a reprehensible killer. His Spartan way of life and implacable approach to the business of killing are amusingly contrasted with effete executive and nightclub owner Willard Gates Laird Cregar. Gates' corpulent figure and abhorrence of violence make him an unlikely middle man in the criminal hierarchy that extends from Raven to Brewster. Gates' decadent tastes 'leg shows' and chocolate mints! and affected manner are played up by Cregar with camp relish. His craven thuggish sidekick Tommy completes the vaudevillian effect.Where Raven's name signifies his dark predatory attributes his nemesis Lieutenant Michael Crane Robert Preston bears an appropriately innocuous avianinspired moniker. Crane's cop is a colourless character whose halfhearted pursuit of Raven and dreary attempts at romance only serve to foreground the genuine frisson developing between his quarry and his girl. Ellen Graham Veronica Lake is a thoroughly overdetermined femme fatale who is by turns Crane's devoted fiance a nightclub singer and employee of Gates a US secret agent and Raven's accomplice and 'friend'. She and Raven become increasingly entangled in the Nitro Chemicals political and criminal racket. They share a risqu night together as 'strangers on a train' and establish a rapport on the run that arguably counteracts the film's final unconvincing and overemphatic clinch between Graham and Crane.True to the spirit of the dangerously seductive noir femme Graham ultimately betrays all the men she comes in contact withall of course in the service of the collective good of the country. Given that her character is forced to bear the considerable weight of the script's heavyhanded patriotism Lake's performance has historically been damned with faint praise. She is nevertheless a luminous presence in the film.If the protagonists in This Gun For Hire are typical of noir Tuttle takes his time consolidating the film's formal credentials. Early scenes are characterised by a certain prosaic quality. The mise en scne is decidedly nonnoirish with fussy interiors and indifferent lowcontrast lighting. Action consistently takes place in daylight and locations are seemingly benign  Raven's hotel a cosy cafe the busy street. But as the narrative unfolds and Raven becomes embroiled in the unforeseen political repercussions of the 'hit' the lighting regimes and locations shift accordingly. Raven becomes hunted rather than hunter and increasingly inhabits the seedy nightclubs train stations and oppressive urban locations that constitute the natural habitat of the beleaguered noir protagonist.".

	onyx:emotionText "his Gun For Hire has been described as 'one of the most important early films noir' and one that 'helps to establish a number of conventions of the genre'. 1 The film's enduring significance lies in its influence on a particular subset of classic and postclassic noir films featuring the figure of the lone assassin. Directed by Frank Tuttle himself something of a Paramount Studios gun for hire the film's exploration of the last days of a solitary embittered hitman reverberates through everything from JeanPierre Melville's Le Samourai France 1968 to more recent meditations on the form  Luc Besson's The Professional USA 1994 and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog USA 1999.Scriptwriters Albert Matz and W.R.Burnett adapted Graham Greene's A Gun For Sale 1936 to the American screen transposing the original story of a London hitman to the emblematic noir territory of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Greene's Phillip Raven is 'dark and thin and made for destruction...a screwedup figure' with a 'repulsive' harelip who is contracted by a wealthy industrialist to kill a socialist minister. 2 In the Paramount scenario Alan Ladd plays the considerably less disfigured Raven hired to dispense with a blackmailing industrial chemist in the employ of chemical tycoon Alvin Brewster Tully Marshall.Matz and Burnett embellished Greene's leftleaning political thriller with some definitively American elements not the least of which was the incorporation of prevailing American propagandist sentiments. Midshooting schedule this interwar production was thus able to graft an overt antiJapanese discourse onto Greene's narrative of political intrigue. Tellingly the American script also transforms Greene's wealthy industrialist Sir Marcus into a monstrous figure of capitalist corruption. Brewster 'King Chlorine' a desiccated wheelchairbound tyrant has been read as a thinly veiled portrait of Henry Ford. 3 On a more minor note Matz and Burnett give Raven's brutal existence a new and thoroughly contemporary Freudian motivation  he kills to avenge his own abuse at the hands of a unforgiving aunt.This Gun for Hire unfolds with workmanlike efficiency. Raven is established as a reprehensible killer. His Spartan way of life and implacable approach to the business of killing are amusingly contrasted with effete executive and nightclub owner Willard Gates Laird Cregar. Gates' corpulent figure and abhorrence of violence make him an unlikely middle man in the criminal hierarchy that extends from Raven to Brewster. Gates' decadent tastes 'leg shows' and chocolate mints! and affected manner are played up by Cregar with camp relish. His craven thuggish sidekick Tommy completes the vaudevillian effect.Where Raven's name signifies his dark predatory attributes his nemesis Lieutenant Michael Crane Robert Preston bears an appropriately innocuous avianinspired moniker. Crane's cop is a colourless character whose halfhearted pursuit of Raven and dreary attempts at romance only serve to foreground the genuine frisson developing between his quarry and his girl. Ellen Graham Veronica Lake is a thoroughly overdetermined femme fatale who is by turns Crane's devoted fiance a nightclub singer and employee of Gates a US secret agent and Raven's accomplice and 'friend'. She and Raven become increasingly entangled in the Nitro Chemicals political and criminal racket. They share a risqu night together as 'strangers on a train' and establish a rapport on the run that arguably counteracts the film's final unconvincing and overemphatic clinch between Graham and Crane.True to the spirit of the dangerously seductive noir femme Graham ultimately betrays all the men she comes in contact withall of course in the service of the collective good of the country. Given that her character is forced to bear the considerable weight of the script's heavyhanded patriotism Lake's performance has historically been damned with faint praise. She is nevertheless a luminous presence in the film.If the protagonists in This Gun For Hire are typical of noir Tuttle takes his time consolidating the film's formal credentials. Early scenes are characterised by a certain prosaic quality. The mise en scne is decidedly nonnoirish with fussy interiors and indifferent lowcontrast lighting. Action consistently takes place in daylight and locations are seemingly benign  Raven's hotel a cosy cafe the busy street. But as the narrative unfolds and Raven becomes embroiled in the unforeseen political repercussions of the 'hit' the lighting regimes and locations shift accordingly. Raven becomes hunted rather than hunter and increasingly inhabits the seedy nightclubs train stations and oppressive urban locations that constitute the natural habitat of the beleaguered noir protagonist.";

	schema:reviewBody "As a piece of cinema Frank Tuttle's 'This Gun for Hire 1942' is both brief and insignificant a throwaway crime story about a hardened assassin a glamorous girl a police manhunt and an international conspiracy. It's just what you'd expect from an adaptation of Graham Greene's A Gun for Sale one of those novels with such low literary aspirations that the author affectionately labelled them entertainments to distinguish from his more noble and artistic works. Greene certainly wasn't kidding  entertainment is provided in great abundance the film delivering short and sharp thrills that keep the viewer on the edge of their seats. Alan Ladd in his first major role carves up the screen as an emotionallytormented contract killer who will cradle a kitten in his arms but won't take kindly to any woman who gets in his way. Veronica Lake looking positively luminous is the woman who gets in his way but whose charms are enough to melt even the hardest of hearts. The success of their teaming spawned a fruitful partnership during the 1940s.Philip Raven Ladd is afforded the introduction of a classic hardboiled antihero. After waking up to lovingly greet a stray cat with fresh milk he then rips open the dress of the landlady's daughter who tries to disrupt the cat's breakfast before reprimanding her with a taut slap across the side of the face. Raven is not presented to us as a hero but neither as a villain like all good film noir protagonists his personality and motivations are tantalisingly ambiguous and so our sympathies towards him are confused. Blonde bombshell Veronica Lake arrives on the scene with a lively performance of Now You See It Now You Don't her singing voice dubbed by Martha Mears that is sure to have any male viewers quickly sitting upright. In this film Lake has none of the frail passiveness that of her followup Ladd collaboration 'The Glass Key 1942' instead bringing an independent and subtly erotic charm that is reminiscent of what Lauren Bacall would provide two years later in 'To Have and Have Not 1944.'Alan Ladd here also benefits from the absence of a love interest. One of the few weaknesses of 'The Glass Key' was the unintentionally awkward romantic sequences between Lake and himself. Ladd can surely play hardboiled but he doesn't do tender very well unless the object of his affection is feline. In 'This Gun for Hire' his relationship with Lake is first one of necessity but gradually transforms into a mutual respect and an understanding that hints just enough at sexual attraction without drawing attention to it. Robert Preston is adequate though oddly insubstantial as the film's most reputable character and Laird Cregar is interesting as the plump and cowardly villain who's inadvertently bitten off more than he can chew. The film winds down in its final twenty minutes or so and the finale's weak attempt at patriotism  an apparent obligation under the current political climate  serves to distance the modern viewer from the engrossing and intimate thriller we had previously enjoyed. Nevertheless if you see it on the rental shelf this gun is very much worth hiring out.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the second half of 19th century and the first three quarters of 20th century Portugal was a country of emigrant labourers. Fifty per cent of its active population emigrated to evade poverty and seek better life conditions abroad. But now things changed and Portugal is a country of immigrants mainly after its admission in the European Union and the collapse of the USSR and other East European socialist regimes. Brazilians Ukrainians Russians natives of the former Portuguese African colonies like Cape Verde for instance and also Asians came and are still coming to Portugal also in search of better life because they always thought that we in the west are all or almost all rich people so they could become rich too. This documentary movie shows us in a very thorough and realistic way the life of these people in Lisbon. They are only lisboetas lisboners by adoption therefore there is some irony in the movie title. We can see their troubles in all aspects of their life beginning with the difficulty in getting residence visas for which they have to wait for hours in queues at the Service of Foreigners to be interviewed by officials in Portuguese despite the fact that most of them don't master the Portuguese language. Then it's the labour problem. Most of them are exploited by unscrupulous employers who take advantage of the fact that many of them are illegal immigrants with no visas and may be denounced to the authorities at any time and get expelled. Most of them work in the building construction with very low salaries and no protection. In the movie we saw one of them saying that he got 25 euros for a 12 hour work. Then we are shown their everyday life we hear their talking on the phone to their families who stayed at home and those conversations are very moving sometimes. We hear their opinions about the country where they are now some favourable some others not. We see their various religious practices Muslim Orthodox Christian etc. But the most charming scenes are those where their children many of them already born in Portugal play talk are interviewed and give also their infantile but interesting opinions and look at us through the camera with their beautiful innocent eyes. This movie is an important and true document of a reality very often unknown to the Portuguese citizens but that deserves to be fully known.".

The three soon become friends and get into various adventures together including cleaning the floor with scrubbing shoes dodging the splunks going down a river in barrels and helping Pippi with the problem of having to go to a children's home.

I know that reading about her as a little girl I was endlessly jealous of Tommy and Annika who got Pippi as a playmate. I wished she'd move next door to me.This movie doesn't do such a great job of translating the Pippi character. She seems less creative and imaginative and more crazy and dim. There's something about the character of Pippi that is lacking in the movie and the movie loses a lot because of that.But Pippi aside the movie isn't ALL bad. It's a late 80's kids movie with cheesy special effects poor acting and a silly story. But through all this it is still enjoyable. The situations that Pippi and Tommy and Annika get in are still fun and it's a good movie for young kids. If you do show this movie to your kids though be sure to buy them the books afterwards and show them what Pippi is REALLY like.

The sets costumes and special effects are adequate.  The music is bouncy.  There are lots of fun Pipi stunts and much childhood wish fulfillment.  All good clean fun. Somehow though the film is less than the sum of its parts.I think it must be the plotting and pacing.  The supercompetent Pipi so outmatches her opponents  a villainous real estate agent and an uncompassionate human services worker  that you never feel any suspense or concern for her safety.  In fact Pipi comes across as such a smartmouthed brat that I began to sympathize with her playmates' whiny father.  The story itself meanders from incident to unrelated incident until the movie positively drags.So this is a movie that it is safe to let your kids watch unsupervised. That's a good thing because you won't want to sit through it yourself at least not more than once.".

Guess what? I enjoyed it a lot! Sure. It's goofy doesn't always make sense is anachronistic at times and is not serious cinematography. But I liked it.The music was cheerful the songs were uplifting and arguably one of the best parts of the movie. The kids were great too. It's sad that the actress playing Pippi didn't go on to do more work especially if it had been more ageappropriate... hard to imagine she was only 10. She did a really fine job. I also got a kick out of seeing Dick Van Patten in his bit part.The monkey was probably the worst actor in the film but since they probably paid him peanuts and bananas they probably didn't waste any money.The flying machine was totally unrealistic but it IS a kids movie. The cleaning of the floors was probably the best scene in the movie.It was just good clean fun that I would be happy to let my kids watch if I had any and the songs are WAY better than Barney's.   People who object to the film have just left their childhood senses of wonder long behind. They don't believe Pippi when she says that you can do just about anything if you believe in it.".

I also got a kick out of seeing Dick Van Patten in his bit part.The monkey was probably the worst actor in the film but since they probably paid him peanuts and bananas they probably didn't waste any money.The flying machine was totally unrealistic but it IS a kids movie. The cleaning of the floors was probably the best scene in the movie.It was just good clean fun that I would be happy to let my kids watch if I had any and the songs are WAY better than Barney's.   People who object to the film have just left their childhood senses of wonder long behind. They don't believe Pippi when she says that you can do just about anything if you believe in it.";

There she introduces the kids to her madcap ways while dealing with stuffy adults and some thieves. Okay this is meant for kids and only kids so let's keep that in mind before ripping it apart. I know it's corny and cheesy and I can't say that I enjoyed it very much but I think I might have if I had seen it when I was a child. I am old enough to have seen this when it was first released but for some reason I didn't. Truth is I forgot this movie even existed until recently catching it on TV. The cast all does fine particularly Tami Erin as Pippi. Not recognizing her I looked at her other roles and saw this was the biggest part in her limited acting career. I also saw that she did a sex tape a few years ago. I can only imagine that is either deeply disturbing or extremely exciting to people who were fans of her back in the day. Aside from Tami there's some solid support from vets like Eileen Brennan Dick Van Patten and John Schuck. There are also many songs in this but none is more catchy than the theme song that's repeated throughout the movie. I want to warn you in advance this song will find a corner of your brain to inhabit and it will be impossible to get it out. Overall it's a fun little movie that will play better to preteen girls than anybody else. Just be prepared that it's pretty sugary and corny. Oh and that theme song will stay in your brain forever.".

This review will hopefully be a nonpolarized summary for those who are interested in finding out more about this movie.This adaptation is true to the spirit of Lindgren's books though it is set in America rather than Sweden faithfully recreating the plucky wildly pigtailed Pippi Longstocking and her endearing anarchy at the Villa Villekulla complete with her horse her monkey her gold coins her whopper tales her superhuman strength and her constant besting of adults. Though a bit oldlooking for the role of a supposedly nineyearold girl Tami Erin does manage to capture Pippi's spunk mischief and childlike appeal.The curious aspect of the film comes in the form of its incongruously modernsounding songs playing against a 1950s backdrop though the songs are quite catchy as well as a slightly choppy narrative with several abrupt scene changes that make certain sections of the movie seem somewhat incomplete. There is a silly cartoonstyle feel to parts of the movie though other parts are quite amusing.It is a Grated movie in the first sense with absolutely nothing inappropriate though do keep in mind that Pippi can do anything she wants including climbing all over the roof of her house and its fine supporting cast of adults include Dennis Dugan as the everexasperated father of neighbors Tommy and Annika John Schuck as Pippi's father and Eileen Brennan who is her usual hilarious self as the stuffy head of the orphanage.The most curious thing about this film is that in spite of its little oddities you find yourself feeling quite happy when the film is over. I was eight years old when the movie came out in 1988 and I absolutely adored it at the time. After all Pippi gets to do all the things that children wish they could do if they knew they could get away with it. Though there is a slight 80s quality to the film it seems to hold up fairly well and can still be seen on video shelves at major retail stores which says something about its appeal these decades later. It is a children's film as opposed to a family film which means it will greatly appeal to of course children. . .or childrenatheart. But since that is the essence of Pippi herself then the film seems to hit the mark.".

It is not high art or great movie making per se  but it captures the fun rebellious fantastic world of a little girl having adventures refusing to be ordinary and standing up a world of bossy grownups. The spunk chutzpah and indefatigable spirit of Pippi is one that I am sure many adults would like to quell and crush as we see in overmedicated children in our country today! This movie would never be made now as she does some very dangerous things like running away and going into a fire to save kids. But it is a fantasy and she is like a superhero... I am sure that the studio would be paranoid that some kid would copy these fantasy actions and sue them.She ate pancakes for dinner washed the floor with rollerskate brushes and stuck to her guns. Honestly a great role model for children because it is a story that appreciates a child's view of the world.The musical refrain is something so sweet and innocent that my older daughter just sang it to me as her bedtime song.If you have kids between 58 years they will like it immensely so rent it and you'll be singing along..

She does a decent job as the weird daughter of a sea captain that has arrived at an old house along with a horse and a monkey. Of course she gravitates toward the neighbor kids whose parents immediately see her as a bad influence. She is a child living a world of rules and regulations.

I'm sure the UK version was released as Those Whom the Gods Wish to Destroy and might have been a combination of both Teil 1 and Teil 2 edited together.It must have been dubbed as it had an English soundtrack. I think the film poster had the film title carved out of a rock face a bit like the Ben Hur poster.It was some long time after seeing the film that I found out it was part of a series of traditional German Folklore tales. I can recall the scene where Siegfried kills a somewhat cardboard looking dragon and bathes in its blood.  Unfortunately a leaf gets stuck to his back and the only part of him not bathed in dragon blood is where the leaf was stuck.  Everywhere he was covered in blood makes him impervious to any weapon.  He subsequently walks through a fire and only gets burned where the leaf was stuck leaving him with a leaf shaped scar on his back. Later on during some subterfuge someone his wife I think sews a patch onto the back of his tunic where the leaf had been stuck and the villain is then able to aim a  spear at the only place where he can be wounded and killed.That happens about halfway through and its that which makes me think the UK release was edited from both films. I'd certainly like to see this again but so far I've not ever seen it available on video.".

	onyx:emotionText "I remember seeing this when it was on release in the UK. I'm sure the UK version was released as Those Whom the Gods Wish to Destroy and might have been a combination of both Teil 1 and Teil 2 edited together.It must have been dubbed as it had an English soundtrack. I think the film poster had the film title carved out of a rock face a bit like the Ben Hur poster.It was some long time after seeing the film that I found out it was part of a series of traditional German Folklore tales. I can recall the scene where Siegfried kills a somewhat cardboard looking dragon and bathes in its blood.  Unfortunately a leaf gets stuck to his back and the only part of him not bathed in dragon blood is where the leaf was stuck.  Everywhere he was covered in blood makes him impervious to any weapon.  He subsequently walks through a fire and only gets burned where the leaf was stuck leaving him with a leaf shaped scar on his back. Later on during some subterfuge someone his wife I think sews a patch onto the back of his tunic where the leaf had been stuck and the villain is then able to aim a  spear at the only place where he can be wounded and killed.That happens about halfway through and its that which makes me think the UK release was edited from both films. I'd certainly like to see this again but so far I've not ever seen it available on video.";

Originally this was a twofilm silent epic made by Fritz Lang in the 1920s. Back in the 1960s there had already been a vogue for German directors remaking Lang movies  the decade saw the resurgence of Dr Mabuse as a film character for instance  so it was only natural that populist director Harald Reinl would be the man to tackle this fantasy epic.Reinl was by this stage of his career an experienced director with the WINNETOU series of films and he goes out of his way to make WHOM THE GODS WISH TO DESTROY a finelooking movie. It's an epic fantasy romp with lots of action and big storytelling to recommend it. What I particularly liked was the combination of political intrigue and oldfashioned heroism which makes this feel like an old peplum flick.The standout performance here is from Uwe Beyer playing Siegfried. Siegfried has a great little storyline I won't spoil it only to say it works very well in the classic tradition. Beyer was a former athlete and he certainly acquits himself well in a physical part. The ubiquitous Karin Dor plays in support and there are minor parts for Skip Martin THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH and later western star Terence Hill. My favourite parts are the trip to Iceland the encounter with the dragon and the volcano.".

	schema:headline " Decent film about the famous saga";
	schema:reviewBody "Die Nibelungen Teil 1  Siegfried is a 1966 movie by Academy Award nominated director Harald Reinl about a topic which is frequently dealt with in German lessons at school as well. Reinl and writer Petersson also worked together on several Winnetou films. I enjoyed parts of it even if I still believe Fritz Lang's approach is superior. If you don't like silent blackwhite films however Reinl may be the way to go. The film is basically carried by Uwe Beyer a very successful athlete in the 1960s and a complete newbie to acting. However he made a decent job with Siegfried portraying him as a heroic naive beau. Most of the other characters were played convincingly too Kriemhild Brunhilde Hagen etc. Beyer died very early because of heart failure by the way and it is assumed this may be due to his longtime abuse of doping substances.The famous dragon fight sequence was a bit short but we get all the other important scenes too. The final murder scene the Alberich fight Siegfried's encounter with Brunhilde her betrayal and many more. Terence Hill before his Spencer collaborations plays one of the supporting characters and is still credited with his real name here Mario Girotti. The movie won a Golden Screen an award for films that lured the most visitors into German cinemas and rightfully so. It must have been quite a spectacle on the Big Screen.As a whole it is not worse than most American films from the 1960s and certainly worth a watch especially if you are interested in mythology or just films about heroic sagas in general. You will probably enjoy this film even more if you are not too familiar with the story as the plot is really not easy to predict. There is also a sequel just like Lang's and another 1960's Nibelungen production this has 2 parts that deals with Kriemhilde's fate and revenge but I thought this was not so great like the first film. The cast is not too known especially abroad except Karin Dor who you may have seen in a Bond movie. But that does not hurt the overall picture at all. Recommended.".

Also the technical effects are of course deficient if you are used to today's movies. The attempt to make it look as if Brnhilde is riding through the air to mention only one instance of this is very clumsy  almost an object for laughter if you are in a derisive mood.This movie is not for those who want a movie to heed faithfully to an original text. Although in this case there is of course no ONE text either  the story of Siegfried and Brnhilde  or Sigurd and Brynhild as we call them in the Scandinavian countries  exists in very many shapes. To me however the flaws and oddities did not matter a bit! Because this is a wonderful beautiful movie with wonderful beautiful actors set in a medieval fantasy world  sometimes interspersed with pictures from the barren landscape of Iceland. There is love adventure heroes and human feelings that we all can still relate to envy jealousy passion love hate lust for revenge... And there are so many beautiful details to look at in clothes jewels horses weaponry castles churches... all the strong and beautiful colours and all the gold!

	schema:reviewBody "Though not on par with some of his more noted works such as Dazed and Confused or Before Sunrise The Newton Boys is still a noteworthy film by Richard Linklater focusing on the alltoreal story of the four Newton brothers from Ulvade Texas who ended up robbing over eighty banks and a train in just four years before finally being arrested and imprisoned in 1924.What Linklater does here that is most interesting is his use of music and detached style of shooting. Nearly all of the music on the soundtrack consists of bluesinfused upbeat country style which is consistent with the setting of this movie but not necessarily the tone. There is a dark underlying element to this story most notably in the evolution of the main character Willis played so wonderfully and engagingly by Matthew McConaughey it makes one shake their head as to why he would continue to make useless romantic comedies these days. Willis begins the film as bright optimistic a loyal son and brother but upset about the way justice is mistreated in south Texas. Determined to right this wrong he becomes enamored with the idea of robbing banks justifying it by claiming that the banks are the real thieves and his form of stealing would simply be a little thief taking from a big one. Though many of the subsequent scenes are nothing original in this genre simply derivative of Bonnie and Clyde or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid the four leads are all very engaging and likable especially McConaughey and Ethan Hawke. Linklater keeps the audience at a distance with the use of the awkward music and the lack of character depth. In many cases the supporting cast is simply that rather than an opportunity to reflect the brothers' view of their lives and worldview. Nevertheless the film is as a whole better than the most recent of its kind. It has an innocentlike quality to it thanks to the fervent belief of Willis Newtown doing this was simply a way to make money and for that reason there was no reason for them to stop.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Newton Boys tells the story of Willis Joe Jess and Dock Newton four brothers who become some of the most notorious bank and train robbers the history of America has ever seen. And they're based on real life events and people making it all the more exciting.What really keeps this movie afloat are the actors. McConaughey Ulrich Hawke and D'Onofrio are all versatile and personable actors breathing life into their characters by their sheer presence. The story is told largely from McConaughey's point of view and it's actually one of his better performances and fits his usual mannerisms perfectly unlike in some other movies where they are somewhat distracting.The plot is also entertaining though because it's based on real life it ends up being somewhat repetitive until the final third when the big twists start rolling. Not that the first two acts aren't interesting but they don't raise the stages the same way a fictional story would. It's not a huge problem but it's noticeable especially if you've seen a lot of gangster films.In the end The Newton Boys is well worth a watch if you're into the idea that sometimes real life is more exciting than any movie andor if you're looking for a good gangsterrobber movie to check out.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Newton Boys tells the story of Willis Joe Jess and Dock Newton four brothers who become some of the most notorious bank and train robbers the history of America has ever seen. And they're based on real life events and people making it all the more exciting.What really keeps this movie afloat are the actors. McConaughey Ulrich Hawke and D'Onofrio are all versatile and personable actors breathing life into their characters by their sheer presence. The story is told largely from McConaughey's point of view and it's actually one of his better performances and fits his usual mannerisms perfectly unlike in some other movies where they are somewhat distracting.The plot is also entertaining though because it's based on real life it ends up being somewhat repetitive until the final third when the big twists start rolling. Not that the first two acts aren't interesting but they don't raise the stages the same way a fictional story would. It's not a huge problem but it's noticeable especially if you've seen a lot of gangster films.In the end The Newton Boys is well worth a watch if you're into the idea that sometimes real life is more exciting than any movie andor if you're looking for a good gangsterrobber movie to check out.";

	schema:headline " Linklater's surprising but not altogether successful step into genre";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this on DVD because it was recommended by Jonathan Rosenbaum on his tenbest list for the year and the cast interested me especially D'Onofrio and Skeet Ulrich. This confirms my admiration of the underseen Ulrich who's the doubting consciencestricken brother. His uneasiness stands out against the tedious goodoldboy jollity of the others. That shtick is a little too easy to do and I don't think it gets the Twenties quite right really. Rosenbaum is a great film critic but his end of the year recommendations are not always to be trusted which makes you wonder about how writteninstone his 1000 films list is. He also said that since the expansive images were a big part of the pleasure of the movie he didn't know how good it would be on DVD.Gosh was it really so easy to rob a bank in those days? The way some of the robberies go makes it look like it was all a cinch but surely they'd be scared sometimes because you still stood to go to jail for it maybe for a good long time. Actually it was easy to robe banks with squaredoored safes and it isn't so hard to hold up a little bank today.This is surprising from Linklater not only because of the step into genre but because of his willingness to glorify and simplify his goodboybadboy crew. Where are the tormented and confused guys of his stoner movies? Matthew McConaughey certainly does rise to the challenge with a spirited and enthusiastic performance but all his moments are still clichs. Hawke similarly grins and giggles in a quite shallow way. His character is not well defined and D'Onofiro arguably the best actor of the bunch is wasted. Statistically the Newton bank robbers were remarkable but Ebert may be right that they are less famous than Dillinger or Bonnie and Clyde because they were too respectable i.e. dull. The screenplay lacks an angle other than the glib one of boys on a lark which fails to convince and even when things go wrong lacks a tragic dimension.The action is desultory lacking a strong focus on character or action or any guiding principle. Hence comparison with 'Bonnie and Clyde' or more dashing adventures in the same vein like 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' or 'The Sting' simply isn't really possible. This isn't in the same league. It utterly pales in comparison to European robbery films like 'Rififi' or the recent 'Mesrine' gangster epic starring Vincent Cassel. Only the few moments with Dwight Yoakam as Brentwood Glasscock the brothers' explosives expert provide a welcome 'Rififi'like hint of bankrobbing as a challenging activity requiring certain skills and techniques.This is not to say you can't have fun watching. These young actors are in their physical prime and that includes the ladies notably the handsomelooking Julianna Margulies as McConaughey's girlfriend. The period flavor is sometimes ripe and tasty. The production is very goodlooking and there is some nice cinematography a silhouetted image of the mail train the Newton brothers are about to rob is particularly cool. The whole cadre things are set in including the jaunty music is conventional but it's undeniably fun. The movie's a little long but the climactic later scenes are involving. But still this is very far from Linklater at his best and Rosenbaum ought to admit he erred in ranking it so high.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the tradition of such as the James Daltons and Doolins of the previous century the Newton Brothers who hailed from Uvalde Texas were more in that tradition as they robbed banks and such throughout the middle part of the USA in the post World War I years. The Newtons are played by Matthew McConaughey Skeet Ulrich Ethan Hawke and Vincent D'Onofrio. Watching them on the screen I kept thinking of that theme from the Dukes Of Hazard just some good old boys meaning no harm.Especially McConaughey who is the leader and brains of the outfit. He just oozes country boy charm. It serves him in very good stead when the Newtons are standing before the bar of justice. It also serves him well in courting Julianna Margulies who in that other country tradition stands by her man though she has to do some thinking on it.Like the other family outlaw gangs of the west the Newtons had their associates though for them none like Bob Ford. Like the James Brothers they tried to switch to trains. It was that switch to trains that led to their downfall and a close call for one of the brothers. For the Newtons that train robbery was the equivalent of what happened to the James gang after the Northfield Minnesota bank job. One of them nearly doesn't make it.No one was ever killed during a Newton caper a fact that stood them in good stead at trial. The sentencing hearing with McConaughey is also outstanding.I liked Vincent D'Onofio who is the most rebellious of the brothers. He'd be going the outlaw way even without family support.The Newton Boys does very well in depicting post World War I in rural America. American agriculture after the boom of World War prices for food abroad and for the troops never shared in the Roaring Twenties boom for the city folk. This film depicts that fact very well.The four players who depict the Newtons and the rest of the cast are set perfectly in their roles. One thing about the Newtons I have to say is that the film is done with style in the way they did their crimes.".

In fact the movie started and it was in colors and very nice colors by the way.We see Willis Newton Matthew McConaughey and before we notice we are in Texas with the horses ranches and the cowboys that always seem good people when they mostly do bad things. Maybe it is because we love to hear them talking and the cast of this movie is very convincing in that aspect. Soon Willis encounters two younger guys riding some difficult horses. These are Jesse and Joe Newton Ethan Hawke and Skeet Ulrich also cowboys and Willis' brothers. Now we're living the true story of the Newton Brothers.With the help of Brentwood Glasscock Dwight Yoakam alias Glass and later with the last brother Dock's Vincent D'Onofrio collaboration Willis and his gang robbed a lot of banks and one train that got them to their end. Well not their end because unlike any regular cowboy the Newtons reached ages surpassing the 70 years.With his writing partners director Richard Linklater created his adapted vision of the story located in the pages of Claude Stanush's book. His own vision of these enchanting cowboys that made up stories to beautiful women drank a lot and lived a full life. Stanush Linklater and Clark Walter achieved something wild in terms of screenplay because I'm not sure if a man could live the situations these characters experience but who knows? In other cowboy movies like American Outlaws these things occur and it's all about the characters. In Outlaws it was the excellent Colin Farrell now it is a whole talented ensemble.I'm a fan of Richard Linklater's work. And admirer of his camera settings colors...The respect he has for his colorful characters without caring how surreal they can be at times when he is telling a real story. Led by McConaughey's Willis who makes a more charismatic leading man than Farrell usual in Linklater's filmography Ethan Hawke follows in good shape as always he commits more with Linklater than with any director. Then we have a gifted Skeet Ulrich in one of his most natural and charming performances he isn't getting many jobs today but here it was a great work. As always Vincent D'Onofrio sticks to what is requested of him. It is also to notice Dwight Yoakam's efforts in his most remarkable appearance now I won't forget about him. Everyone else fulfills and the women I was talking about Louise Brown has an important part played convincingly by the always good Julianna Margulies.It was some weeks ago that a friend of mine told me he did a work about a director's filmography.

Also in the cast are Julianna Margulies Charles Gunning Chloe Webb and Casey McAuliffe. There is the claim that the Newton boys never killed a soul during their robbing the bigger thieves...the banks.";

One thing for sure it's better than the critics would have you believe. Oddly enough it drags a bit near the end overall retained interest for most of the two hours. It is nicely filmed with good 1920s sets and music.Matthew McConaughey is easily the star of this as the mastermind of the group and he's the most interesting character of the Newton boys. He had a strange funny smile in this role. I had to laugh out loud a few times looking at it. Some bad news no one else here is likable and there is way too much usage of the Lord's name in vain.I do agree with the critics that something is missing here something that prevents it from being rated higher. Note two of the actual robbers are shown in 1980 interviews one on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson! In the other interview the thief still sees nothing wrong with what he did! Amazing.".

Oh the poor little bank robber's having a hard day at the office.The film also has problems in terms of writing and performance. It's hard to believe that Julianna Margulies's character would be head over heels for the top Newton bro someone that stunning would surely be able to find numerous lawabiding boyfriends. The film needed less bank robbing scenes and maybe a few showing how she was ostracized by society andor poor and Mr. Newton gave her a new lease on life...something like that. Perhaps Julianna was bored with this thin role for there is little life in her performance.Only one or two of the brothers especially Skeet Ulrich as the youngest stand out in any particular way. The music is hokey and the whole thing goes on far too long. If you see it though do stay till the very end to catch interviews with the real Newton brothers toward the end of their lives.".

Good grief!In short if you want to sit through a two hour long film that seems like four hours and see a bunch of guys acting cute and playful while robbing banks with banjo music playing in the background then this film is for you.

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Linklater as a writer and director loves to let his characters breathe while on screen and confine them to a day's worth of events. However with The Newton Boys he attempts to infuse his laidback style with a true crime caper concerning the Newton Gang a group of four brothers who robbed banks in the United States during Prohibition. He conducts the film in an episodic manner devoting over two hours to these brothers their robberies and their schemes by simply allowing their conversations to prevail and the charm of the actors to carry the film.The ringleader of the gang is Willis Newton played by Matthew McConaughey a suave smoothtalker who maps out these heists. His brothers are the amiable ladies man Jess Ethan Hawke the lovable softy Dock Vincent D'Onofrio and the youngest and wiliest Joe Skeet Ulrich. In addition the brothers seek the help of Brentwood Glasscock country singer Dwight Yoakam to help blow the safes of banks with ample amounts of nitroglycerine. The Newton's work under a simple code of conduct which states they won't kill they won't harm or rob any women or children and they won't snitch.Immediately what The Newton Boys lacks is the element of perspective. Examining successful biopics of recent time like Jersey Boys and The Wolf of Wall Street both films benefited from the perspective of many of their individuals particularly Jersey Boys which showed how one story was told with bias from each of the band members. Despite spending two hours with these brothers we feel like we're hanging out with them more than we're being told their story or learning of the men themselves. The brothers never transcend past caricatures and Linklater's energy level and interest in these characters seems greatly diminished especially considering his last several films.The irony with Linklater and The Newton Boys is here's a film about bank robbers running from the law and it manages to be less interesting than Linklater's formal directorial debut Slacker which focused for no more than five minutes on a single character and Before Sunrise which simply featured two characters walking and talking. Linklater's investment in his characters is noted with every film I've seen from him but here it's as if he's within arm's length of his characters at all times never gravitating towards them to learn about them despite the glacialpace of the film. The conversations between the men reiterate tired ideas describing how robbing the banks isn't a bad thing because they're essentially stealing from insurance companies so clearly stealing isn't so bad. These conversations undermine the titular characters and the coffinsealing nail is no perspective is ever provided on these men to show how we're supposed to view them.So The Newton Boys drags on without much energy like someone who worked a fortyfive hour week and begrudgingly took on a twelve hour shift to follow it up. As it meanders and rifts around it manages to drain the energy out of us the audience as well and we're left with a film that's lifeless and impotent two traits I never thought I'd associate with Linklater. All the pieces are here aesthetically with the costumes the music and the aura of the Roaring 20's all captured with visual flair and the four young leading men prove they have charisma but at the end of the day that's all they have and a film about bank robbers needs more than that.Starring Matthew McConaughey Ethan Hawke Skeet Ulrich Vincent D'Onofrio and Dwight Yoakam.

But the worst part in all that story is that they got caught on their last venture the postal train robbery because one of the gang of brothers shot another member of that brotherly gang because he did not stick to what he was supposed to do went on the other side of the train and got frightened by someone who did not have the identifying hat they were all supposed to wear. A mistake another mistake and the whole venture came to a stop though they apparently did not recuperate all the money neither the authorities not the Newton Boys because the part that was hidden away by one of them was done so under the influence of alcohol not the money of course but the Newton Boy who was supposed to bury it and he could never so he says at least remember where it was. If you are not afraid of the strong cowboy Texan accent of these boys you can watch it and entertain yourself with the dream of what you could do with three million 1924 dollars.

	schema:reviewBody "The Newton Boys Richard Linkletter's account on this family of criminals was a surprise when it was shown on cable recently. The strength of the story which was cowritten by the director is based on a real family of bandits who never became as famous as other notorious criminals of the era. Perhaps because they were basically farm boys they never got involved in killing their victims yet they manage to rob a string of banks that had a simple type of safe. Once bigger and more complicated devices were adopted it ended the way they did business.Willis the brain of the organization learns from someone he meets on the road when he leaves his rural home how to blow a bank safe with the help of explosives. Willis in turn gets his three brothers involved in helping him for the different jobs throughout the middle of the country and even in Canada. Willis who falls in love with the attractive employee of a hotel news and tobacco stand is a successful robber whose luck runs out when he tries his hand at robbing a train that is carrying about three million dollars a fatal miscalculation on his part.The film is fun to watch because of the easy chemistry among all the brothers. Matthew McConaughey Ethan Hawke Skeet Ulrich and Vincent D'Onofrio appear to be having a great time with their characters and with each other. Joanna Margulies is a lovely Louise the woman who falls in love with Willis. Dwight Yoakam is seen as the man who teaches Willis his trade as a bank robber.At the end of the film we watch one of the brothers appearing as a guest of The Tonight Show as he looked then. All brothers it appears went straight after their brush with the law and lived long lives. Richard Linkletter did a film that is fun to watch as it is never heavy and keeps moving at a quick pace.".

Dirty Dancing is another one I can think of  Linklater is quite possibly my favorite director and Before Sunrise and Dazed and Confused are two of my favorite movies of all time.  I really enjoyed this movie the 2nd time I watched it but it still isn't in the realm of Before or Dazed.  The 4 male leads are charming but I was most affected by Hawke whose character should have had more screen time and Ulrich I was surprised how well he acted in this movie and also how young he appeared.  I liked McConaughey in this movie but felt his character monopolized the movie and the time should have been spent more equally among the brothers.  The movie is good if you like the 4 male leads and the best part of the movie to me was the credits which had clips of interviews of 2 of the real Newton Boys. ".

One being the first view we got of the Nitro and the little comments about Avis liking it kept under the bed. The other being when a bottle of nitro falls from his pocket in the train he catches it with his foot.  This man can act as well as sing! His delivery of the lines and his facial expressions were good.  I totally believed in the geeky character Dwight Yoakam portrayed.  I saw him in Sling Blade and was impressed but had not seen any other performances so how could I judge?  Time to start listening to his music I think.

Costume pictures often reek of Classics Illustrated comic books. This is among the few whose script as filmed is not an insult.Director Franklin Schaffner obviously loves the material. He later returned to the period with Lionheart the Children's Crusade after Planet of the Apes Patton and his other famous epics.The film's atmosphere is incredibly strong  I was absolutely sure that this was shot on location in Europe until I recognized the Universal hillside towards the end. Rarely does a Hollywood movie hide its back lot origins so thoroughly.Minor drawbacks must be acknowledged. The girl suffers well silently but can't deliver her few lines. Maurice Evans is an awful ham showing once again why he was Orson Welles' least favorite actor. There's a handful of clumsy process shots and Paul Frees not only delivers the opening narration but voices both Sammy Ross and Michael Conrad later familiar from Hill Street Blues. Someone in the Universal sound department thought that Frees' voice was undetectable and it isn't. It gets worse you can hear Frees as four separate characters in Spartacus.None of these quibbles matter. The War Lord is romantic poetic mildly gritty by today's standards and the production design cinematography and music are all gorgeous. The tumultuous siege of the tower is solid in the way things were before computers and features what seems to be every stuntman in Hollywood including Joe Canutt Hal Needham Richard Farnsworth and Buddy Van Horn. I wish Universal could figure out a way to keep the DVD in print. Remastering might help. If you have a multisystem multiregion player at this writing a far superior widescreen Danish transfer is available from both UK and German Amazon.IMDb lists at least 250000 worse ways to spend two hours than The War Lord. Make yourself comfortable and enjoy.".

Maurice Evans is an awful ham showing once again why he was Orson Welles' least favorite actor. There's a handful of clumsy process shots and Paul Frees not only delivers the opening narration but voices both Sammy Ross and Michael Conrad later familiar from Hill Street Blues. Someone in the Universal sound department thought that Frees' voice was undetectable and it isn't. It gets worse you can hear Frees as four separate characters in Spartacus.None of these quibbles matter. The War Lord is romantic poetic mildly gritty by today's standards and the production design cinematography and music are all gorgeous. The tumultuous siege of the tower is solid in the way things were before computers and features what seems to be every stuntman in Hollywood including Joe Canutt Hal Needham Richard Farnsworth and Buddy Van Horn. I wish Universal could figure out a way to keep the DVD in print. Remastering might help. If you have a multisystem multiregion player at this writing a far superior widescreen Danish transfer is available from both UK and German Amazon.IMDb lists at least 250000 worse ways to spend two hours than The War Lord. Make yourself comfortable and enjoy.";

This is one of Heston's best performances as he actually loses himself in the role at least in a few spots rather than projecting his standard Chuck persona. He's somewhat superstitious as everyone is during this period longing for a little love which he never had a chance to have before and in strange if expected competition with his younger brother Stockwell. The fighting scenes are excellent a bit ahead of their time even if they don't seem so now. Back then having guys clanking swords always carried the same limited appeal but here there's some nicely energetic choreography quite complex in places. As someone states near the beginning the atmosphere has a queer moody tinge and all the players seem caught in a suffocating tragedy waiting to happen. Director Schaffner as he would continue in later films conveys a reality to all the proceedings despite a rather fantastic setting from our point of view in modern times.Most of the actors are terrific. Boone is Boone being his usual tough ornery personality no one would mess with this guy. Stockwell is tremendous it's a shame he only appeared in a few more films which no one went to see and faded. He's very intense here his envy of his brother and coveting his station a palpable energy. Forsyth the object of Heston's desire does seem out of place never really in sync with the rest of the cast. In a way this works in her character's favor what with the suggestion of witchery surrounding her. Farentino in an early role doesn't get to show much range but what he does show is very effective. You genuinely feel for his plight towards the end due to the strong emotion he projects. In all this is a smallerscale epic than what one is used to from Chuck El Cid and Ben Hur for example but the almost intimate focus on this patch of land and the small cast of characters works in its favor.".

There are no superwomen wielding swords in battle very little profanity and the only sex is in PG form. Made in 1965 The Warlord is an accusing yet romantic look at medieval Europe. It's no Disney movie but you could still take the whole family to see it.The cast is first rate. Forget El Cid. This is the role Charlton Heston was born to play. You can pretty much say that about all the great actors in this story most of whom are gone now. Richard Boone Guy Stockwell Maurice Evans Michael Conrad...but thank heaven we have them all assembled here in this exciting yarn about the middle ages. There's plenty of action romance and even a little comic relief. Men will enjoy the kickbutt sword fights Heston kicks one guy in the groin actuallycrude but effective. Ladies should enjoy the romance if they can remember that this is happening in the year 1060 long before the women's movement. The hero Chrysagon fights two empires for the love of one woman says the promo. Even in 1965 that was enough for most women. The peasant girl Bronwyn played by Rosemary Forsyth has scores of men killing each other over her although quite unintentionally.Other good ingredients a rousing and romantic musical score and some welldone outdoor photography of Chrysagon's tower fortress and the battle scenes.All in all this is a great movie to watch on some Saturday afternoon. It will take you away from your problems for a while to a time and place long ago. And since medieval Europe really stank it will make today's world look pretty good to you again.".

I could have used a few more action scenes like the viking raiders attempt to storm Chucks tower. That was some epic battle sequence. The cast all act like theyre medieval guys. Richard Boonewith his tremendous facehas a great role as Boris. They even got a dwarfmascot in there who fits right in. Rosemary Forsyth is about the only one out of place she looks like shes been growing up on a Malibu beach not a filthy hovel in a cold swamp village. Her hair just doesent look like 1060. Theres no real hero to this story Chuck plays a tough soldier defending a village who lets his weaknesses carry him away women. As the story develops you see him lose the trust and control of his command. I found myself shouting at the screen. This same story has played out countless times since the dawn of man...On top of the world and just cant resist that mystic female power. Hey maybe Monica Lewinsky could have replaced Forsyth.  Even better than Chuck is Guy Stockwell. I think he died recently. This was one of his major roles and he was always a seriously underated actor. He plays Draco and hes cool. He had a great voice but wasnt in too many good films. This was a great performance he will always be remembered for.".

Meanwhile  warhardened Chrysagonn falls in love with a peasant girl named Bronwyn Rosemary Forsyth  adopted daughter of the old Odin Nial MacGuinnis though she is unfortunately engaged to someone else James Farentino. The nobleman uses an old law which allows knights his feudal right of first night called Ius Primae Noctis after the wedding celebration. Nevertheless Chrysagon and Bronwyn become enamored and vow to never apart .This mood piece is an interesting story set in the 11th century with impressive production values full of scenes like ancient prints pulsating action in the keep attack and excellent performances. Splendid evocation of medieval time based on the play The lovers by Leslie Stevens Outer limits and welladapted by John Collier Silvia Scarlett and Millard Kaufman Bad day at Black Rock. Topnotch Charlton Heston as Norman noble who invokes his right and steals a bride Guy Stockwell as embittered deranged and ambitious brother. And gorgeous sensitive Rosemary Forsyth who never bettered her role as frail and enamored peasant  in addition Richard Boone does a sincere portrayal as a veteran warrior . The aces in the hole of this stunning movie are the evocative musical score by Jerome Moross and colorful cinematography by Russell Metty with wonderful images of all kind of skies and turquoise interiors. Furhermore appropriate costumes fitting to Middle Age by Vitti Nino Novarese. The motion picture picture is finely directed by Franklin J. Schaffner in the first collaboration to Heston who later directed him in Planet of apes and as coprotagonist Maurice Evans who in War lord plays a likable priest.

	onyx:emotionText "XI century the powerful Duke William of Ganthe sends his main knight Chrysagon Charlton Heston and some warriors to defend coastal villages in Normandy against continuous Frisios attacks that sack ravage rampage and pillage. Meanwhile  warhardened Chrysagonn falls in love with a peasant girl named Bronwyn Rosemary Forsyth  adopted daughter of the old Odin Nial MacGuinnis though she is unfortunately engaged to someone else James Farentino. The nobleman uses an old law which allows knights his feudal right of first night called Ius Primae Noctis after the wedding celebration. Nevertheless Chrysagon and Bronwyn become enamored and vow to never apart .This mood piece is an interesting story set in the 11th century with impressive production values full of scenes like ancient prints pulsating action in the keep attack and excellent performances. Splendid evocation of medieval time based on the play The lovers by Leslie Stevens Outer limits and welladapted by John Collier Silvia Scarlett and Millard Kaufman Bad day at Black Rock. Topnotch Charlton Heston as Norman noble who invokes his right and steals a bride Guy Stockwell as embittered deranged and ambitious brother. And gorgeous sensitive Rosemary Forsyth who never bettered her role as frail and enamored peasant  in addition Richard Boone does a sincere portrayal as a veteran warrior . The aces in the hole of this stunning movie are the evocative musical score by Jerome Moross and colorful cinematography by Russell Metty with wonderful images of all kind of skies and turquoise interiors. Furhermore appropriate costumes fitting to Middle Age by Vitti Nino Novarese. The motion picture picture is finely directed by Franklin J. Schaffner in the first collaboration to Heston who later directed him in Planet of apes and as coprotagonist Maurice Evans who in War lord plays a likable priest. Schaffner filmed several hits as Papillon Boys from Brazil and of course Patton and some flops as Nicholas and Alexandra Day of dolphin and Lionheart.

I can't remember exactly but I think they also addressed the issue of the violence in the movie  which by today's standards is pretty mellow. It seems to me they talked about it as adding credibility to the film in terms of historical content. When does that happen anymore? I don't know if it's included in the DVD but it would be cool. I also think Franklin Shaffner was a wonderful director. No slop. No unnecessary scenes. And as good as Heston is the performance that blew me away was given by Guy Stockwell. Oh my god. How was his brother Dean more visible in the industry? I don't know. And of course Richard Boone was terrific  especially in his last tender scene comforting Heston  the son he never had. I usually hesitate watching movies that I saw as a child because I don't want to lose the special feeling they gave me as a child but this one certainly retains the romanticism and excitement found in a few other movies such as Journey to the Centre of the Earth Samson and Delilah and Demetrius and the Gladiators.

But it's not only the look of it that they tried to make medieval but the way everybody thinks and behaves. Somebody thought through the questions did 11thcentury Norman fighting men believe pagan gods existed at all and if so what did they think they were? and how might Norman knights and priests have squared with their consciences participating in pagan customs?. Chrysagon is not only good but according to his younger brother tediously righteous but everybody including him assumes that he can and will shag on the spot any peasant who takes his fancy. It's only a superstitious fright that stops him. He has power of life and death over the peasants and takes for granted that they are inferior yet he also accepts that local law and custom have some weight which he can't simply brush aside. It's going to be a hundred years before anybody invents courtly love so all the Normans  including Chrysagon himself  take for granted that any feeling for a peasant girl deeper than crude lust is as at best an unmanly weakness at worst madness or bewitchment. His men are all loyal followers of many years' service but as they see their lord starting to go mushy over some slut and endanger them all by provoking a peasant revolt on her account their loyalty starts to crumble. His younger brother who was moreorless content to play second fiddle to him when they were both household knights finds himself resenting the gap in status that has opened up between them now he is his brother's vassal. All this has credibility.It's far from perfect. Perhaps it really was necessary to label the peasants' religion as Druidism in order to convey the notion of preChristian paganism to the average viewer  but did they really have to call the heroine Bronwyn? A friend of mine was misled by this into assuming the action was set in Brittany  she couldn't otherwise account for Druids and Celtic names! And she is the one real embarrassment of the film. Her character is written as hopelessly sweet feeble and drippy  no detectable personality  and Rosemary Forsythe doesn't look or sound like any kind of peasant from any place or time in history. Even so The War Lord is one of the most medieval films I've ever seen and is definitely worth watching if you can find it.".

	schema:headline " An Honourable Failure";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is set in mediaeval Normandy and the war lord of the title is the knight Chrysagon de la Crue. Chrysagon does not rank very high among the Norman aristocracy. His lands are poorconsisting mostly of marshland and he has the thankless task of defending them on behalf of the Duke against warlike Frisian raiders. He is impoverished having been forced to pay an extortionate ransom after his father was captured by the Frisians. Nevertheless he is still a feudal lord having nearabsolute power over the peasants within his domain.At first he tries to exercise this power in a just and humane manner for example he saves the lives of poachers accused of poaching deer a capital offence at that time when he dismisses the evidence against them. Things change however when he meets a young village girl Bronwyn. She is engaged to be married to Marc a young peasant but Chrysagon struck by her beauty claims the right of Droit de Seigneur which permits a feudal lord to sleep with any woman within his domain on the night before her marriage. Having spent the night with her he falls obsessively in love and refuses to give her up. Marc and the other villagers swear revenge and inform the Frisian chieftain that Chrysagon is holding his young son as a prisoner. The Frisians launch a raid to rescue the boy and lay siege to Chrysagon's castle.The film was based on a play called The Lovers Charlton Heston altered the title after his production company bought the film rights. This would suggest that he was more interested in military action than in the love story but in fact both elements are equally important. Chrysagon can be seen as a tragic hero facing a classic dilemma the choice between love and honour. A choice of this type was a common theme in the plays of Pierre Corneille himself from Normandy and the appeal of The Lovers to Heston may have been due to the fact that a few years earlier he had had a big success starring in another mediaeval drama with a similar theme El Cid partly based upon one of Corneille's most famous plays. Chrysagon is a battlehardened middleaged bachelor whose life has been dominated by what he calls his cold mistress his sword. Suddenly he realises that he has a chance of happiness with a beautiful young woman but he can only achieve that happiness if he fails in his duty to his vassals who expect that he will rule them justly and to the Duke who expects that he will keep the peace.The film's main strength is the vivid picture it gives of the Middle Ages and the sense of a world very different from ours. The battle scenes are very realistic and convincing especially the siege of the castle. Its main weakness is that the love story of Chrysagon and Bronwyn is never really credible. Heston is a fine actor but even good actors have their limitations as well as their strengths. Heston's main strength has been playing men of action not just military heroes although he has played plenty of those but also statesmen such as Richelieu and Thomas More creative artists such as Michelangelo and religious leaders such as Moses. Sensitive individuals given to strong emotions have been less in his line of country several of his characters have had wives or sweethearts but affairs of the heart have generally taken a lesser role in his films. Will Penny may be an exception but even here Will's rather gruff tenderness for Catherine is very different to Chrysagon's guilty obsessive passion.It is therefore not surprising that Chrysagon the warrior comes across as more credible than Chrysagon the lover. In Heston's scenes with Bronwyn he comes across as too stiff and stolid. The casting of Rosemary Forsyth as Bronwyn was not ideal either. Although her innocent beauty made her physically right for the part she is far too passive. For the story to work the audience need to believe that she returns Chrysagon's passion for her or at least that she is torn between her two lovers. Unfortunately there is no sense of this in the film. The impression is given that she is meekly submitting to Chrysagon's will because she is too frightened to defy him which means that he ceases to be a tragic hero and becomes a villain little better than a rapist.If the filmmakers had merely wanted to make a mediaeval adventure story they would probably have made a very good one. The appear however to have had something more ambitious in mind namely to make that rare thing in the cinema a genuine tragic drama. I think that they failed in this ambition but it was an honourable one and The War Lord can be seen as an honourable failure. 610".

Nevertheless he is still a feudal lord having nearabsolute power over the peasants within his domain.At first he tries to exercise this power in a just and humane manner for example he saves the lives of poachers accused of poaching deer a capital offence at that time when he dismisses the evidence against them. Things change however when he meets a young village girl Bronwyn. She is engaged to be married to Marc a young peasant but Chrysagon struck by her beauty claims the right of Droit de Seigneur which permits a feudal lord to sleep with any woman within his domain on the night before her marriage. Having spent the night with her he falls obsessively in love and refuses to give her up. Marc and the other villagers swear revenge and inform the Frisian chieftain that Chrysagon is holding his young son as a prisoner. The Frisians launch a raid to rescue the boy and lay siege to Chrysagon's castle.The film was based on a play called The Lovers Charlton Heston altered the title after his production company bought the film rights. This would suggest that he was more interested in military action than in the love story but in fact both elements are equally important. Chrysagon can be seen as a tragic hero facing a classic dilemma the choice between love and honour. A choice of this type was a common theme in the plays of Pierre Corneille himself from Normandy and the appeal of The Lovers to Heston may have been due to the fact that a few years earlier he had had a big success starring in another mediaeval drama with a similar theme El Cid partly based upon one of Corneille's most famous plays. Chrysagon is a battlehardened middleaged bachelor whose life has been dominated by what he calls his cold mistress his sword. Suddenly he realises that he has a chance of happiness with a beautiful young woman but he can only achieve that happiness if he fails in his duty to his vassals who expect that he will rule them justly and to the Duke who expects that he will keep the peace.The film's main strength is the vivid picture it gives of the Middle Ages and the sense of a world very different from ours. The battle scenes are very realistic and convincing especially the siege of the castle. Its main weakness is that the love story of Chrysagon and Bronwyn is never really credible. Heston is a fine actor but even good actors have their limitations as well as their strengths. Heston's main strength has been playing men of action not just military heroes although he has played plenty of those but also statesmen such as Richelieu and Thomas More creative artists such as Michelangelo and religious leaders such as Moses. Sensitive individuals given to strong emotions have been less in his line of country several of his characters have had wives or sweethearts but affairs of the heart have generally taken a lesser role in his films. Will Penny may be an exception but even here Will's rather gruff tenderness for Catherine is very different to Chrysagon's guilty obsessive passion.It is therefore not surprising that Chrysagon the warrior comes across as more credible than Chrysagon the lover. In Heston's scenes with Bronwyn he comes across as too stiff and stolid. The casting of Rosemary Forsyth as Bronwyn was not ideal either. Although her innocent beauty made her physically right for the part she is far too passive. For the story to work the audience need to believe that she returns Chrysagon's passion for her or at least that she is torn between her two lovers. Unfortunately there is no sense of this in the film. The impression is given that she is meekly submitting to Chrysagon's will because she is too frightened to defy him which means that he ceases to be a tragic hero and becomes a villain little better than a rapist.If the filmmakers had merely wanted to make a mediaeval adventure story they would probably have made a very good one. The appear however to have had something more ambitious in mind namely to make that rare thing in the cinema a genuine tragic drama. I think that they failed in this ambition but it was an honourable one and The War Lord can be seen as an honourable failure. 610";

Garzzara is the worst showing the same kind of emotion usually reserved for everyday mundane tasks like doing the laundry or grocery shopping. You'd hardly know from his demeanor that the lives of three people rest in his hands. And when something does finally happen the special effects are so ridiculous looking that the movie losses any credibility it might have had. The giant sea creatures the rescuers run into are little more than normal salt water aquarium fish filmed with a zoom lens and a bad looking miniature of the submarine. That's right  The Neptune Factor looks like it was filmed in someone's home aquarium. A giant clown fish  oooooh how scary! There's nothing much more frightening than the sight of a ludicrously large Nemo.To say I was disappointed by The Neptune Factor would be a gross understatement. A good cast is put to waste with nothing to do. In the end I've got to rate this one a 210.".

And when something does finally happen the special effects are so ridiculous looking that the movie losses any credibility it might have had. The giant sea creatures the rescuers run into are little more than normal salt water aquarium fish filmed with a zoom lens and a bad looking miniature of the submarine. That's right  The Neptune Factor looks like it was filmed in someone's home aquarium. A giant clown fish  oooooh how scary! There's nothing much more frightening than the sight of a ludicrously large Nemo.To say I was disappointed by The Neptune Factor would be a gross understatement. A good cast is put to waste with nothing to do. In the end I've got to rate this one a 210.";

It looks like the producers bought a little toy submersible and borrowed someone's aquarium and let er rip. Okay this is preStar Wars effectswise but no one could take this seriously even back in 1973. Oh the look of fear and awe on Borgnine's face when he sees a.... giant goldfish! Perhaps the only thing of minor interest is whether James Cameron was inspired by this film to create 'The Abyss.' It does have some of the same elements. Of course unlike 'The Abyss' this film is idiotic example Gazzara yelling at Mimieux for putting the sub in danger of exploding from sea pressure yet the same pressure has no effect on HUMAN BODIES swimming around in EVEN GREATER DEPTHS soon after and it's dully plotted acted directed written scored.

After waiting 95 minutes the audience is treated to a Jules Verne moment in which 'giant' eels corral the probe's survivors as they run out of oxygen.

The problem is like a lot of other reviewers mentioned is that nothing much happens. A lot of peering and ponderous talking with little interest to it all. A group of American scientists are conducting an experiment involving underwater living until an earthquake occurs causing a research facility to fall into the abyss. They only have so many hours before they're out of oxygen so a crew in a mini submarine are sent down to find them despite the risks of more aftershocks. Really the taut situation that unfolds should sell it in a threatening pressureinduced manner but instead we get a padded out story with a very limp rhythm. No urgency left it with any sustained suspense lingering only on stolid dramas of a threadbare narrative and static direction. There's a few dazzling glimpses when the crew is exploring the murky abyss but the model sub and the overblown sea life didn't create any sort of thrills and when it tried it was quite laughable in its execution. The performances don't fair any better despite the best efforts of Ernest Borgnine and Walter Pidgeon. As for Ben Gazzera and Yvette Mimieux they come across very bland. Composer Lalo Schifran contributes the score. Established but too plain to be fun.".

And they give it their all but they just can't get a lot of mileage out of it particularly when the really big fish are just really big and pretty grainy close ups of little fish that you might find in somebody's home aquarium. And then there's the submarine itself which is clearly a plastic model and which seems to have filmed at the bottom of a kiddie wading pool with some plastic seaweed stuff thrown in.If this sounds boring well it is. Now and then a really bad film can become accidentally entertaining. It may be so bad that it's astonishing as in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.

Special Effects don't make a film an interesting plot does. The plot here is an old and tried one in the movies the disaster flick. When I saw this film on the big screen the story did succeed in capturing my interest. Will they find the missing scientists? Did anyone survive? Do they all make it back? When the story entices the viewer to ask these questions and wondering at what will happen in the next 60 seconds  as this film actually DOES do!  then the producer and director succeeded at what they were trying to do. I enjoyed this film so much I stayed in the theater and sat through it a second time! A good film  if they ever decide to do a remake I hope they give it a budget that will include good special effects. After all when they remade IT! The Terror From Beyond Space they had a hefty budget and retitled it ALIEN. Two and half stars out of five ain't bad.".

An undersea research lab investigating the cause of earthquakes gets some firsthand data when a tremor rocks the ocean floor sending the lab careening into a deep crevice. On the surface doctors Pidgeon and Mimieux along with divers Borgnine and Rhodes attempt to locate the lab along with its three inhabitants one of whom is Mimieux's boyfriend. With time running out the lab only has seven days worth of life support and with no clues to the lab's whereabouts they call in Gazzara who operates a special deep water sub called Neptune. With considerable difficulty and conflict they discover that the lab has slipped far beneath the normal realm of exploration meaning the Neptune must go to places heretofore never witnessed by man. Once there they find that the deepest recesses of the ocean contain massive oversized fish and sea life thanks to the warmth emitted from volcanic fissures creatures which severely obstruct the crew's chances of retrieving the men they're searching for! Pidgeon is far beyond the peak of his talents here often seeming befuddled and dispassionate despite his inherent likability from decades of prior screen triumphs. Borgnine is markedly heavier than he was just one year earlier in The Poseidon Adventure though his stunt double is notably more slender. His performance is almost reserved in contrast to some of his more bombastic portrayals and he doesn't embarrass himself even if he is not the first person who comes to mind as a deep sea diver! Mimieux is attractive but hasn't got much to do besides look worried stunned and dazed. Gazzara is horribly miscast and gives a stoic wooden performance topped off with an atrocious Atlanta GA accent. Rhodes is another one without a lot to do but he retains his likable persona. The film has been roundly criticized from its release to the present for its effects concerning the giant fish actually regular sea life projected UP CLOSE against the portals of the Neptune and that aspect of the film is definitely preposterous and poorly handled. However there is still considerable tension and some otherwise fine miniature work and underwater photography. Another issue is the amount of light and clarity of the water at these murky depths and the premise that men can simply emerge from their vessels and scuba dive in pressures that intense. One thing that robs the film of emotional impact is the fact that the audience barely gets to meet the trapped technicians before they disappear and their plight is never shown through the duration of the film. Also the finale is rushed and rather poorly handled. Continuity is an issue as well. Mimieux appears in a different wash and wear outfit nearly every time she appears even in the same day. It's a miracle her clothes don't change within scenes. Note the way she and Pidgeon seem to wear the same outfits whenever they're on deck no matter which day it is. More unbelievable than the giant fish is the presumption that Borgnine can shimmy in and out of his oddly ragged considering how new everything else is! scuba suit in the time allotted. A scene between Mimieux and Borgnine which may have illuminated her relationship with the missing doctor and added a little more emotional depth to the story was cut prior to release. Still there's something endearing about the clean bright sets the earnest performers the mysterious and unusual aspects of the storyline and the mostly effective effects. Though it can be a bit tedious at times it should be a reasonably pleasant viewing for fans of the stars or for fans of 70's disaster flicks. Mimieux and Borgnine would reunite a few years later in The Black Hole.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the late 1960s I discovered the Lincoln Arts Cinema on West 57th Street in Manhattan  my sister and I went there to see THE LION IN WINTER when it came out. Subsequently I went by myself or with others in particular to see the series of rereleased films of Charlie Chaplin in the early 1970s. But all things are ephemeral especially buildings and businesses. The Lincoln Arts Cinema eventually went out of business. One of the last productions I saw there was a double bill a rarity of THE NEPTUNE FACTOR with a comedy possibly RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER but I am not sure. It was a sign of the times that this showcase for single film classics or wouldbe classics ended up doing a double bill. Also that one of the films was THE NEPTUNE FACTOR.I rarely went to science fiction movies so it must have been the comedy that I really wanted to see. In any event for some reason this inner space story lingered in my memory rather than the other film even if it was the Sellers' movie. For one thing it intrigued me to watch a movie about underwater exploration deep sea at that. The period was one when there were too many submarine disasters the Thresher the Scorpion the Dakar the Minerve. So there was a realization of the potential for total disaster as we explored or traveled in the seas. The real achievements in underwater exploration were still in the future it was another decade before Dr. Robert Ballard located the wreck of the Titanic. So the potential for an interesting film was there. Regrettably the movie was not that good  but it does make one want better films on the subject.At some near future date there is an underwater station set up on the ocean floor. An earthquake occurs and the crew is trapped. So the government sends a team with a submarine to do a difficult rescue. The team is headed by Walter Pidgeon and Yvette Mimieux and it sends the submarine under Ben Gazzara and Ernest Borgnine to the rescue. What follows in the film is a kind of special effects travelogue of what the rescue crew sees under water and how they overcome various obstacles until they finally locate the toppled tower of the underwater lab  just in time of course as some monster of the deep is attacking I recall it does get one of the endangered crew who is fighting it to save his comrades. The photography was the best part of the movie  it did make the viewer take interest in that portion of the globe that covers three fifths of our planet. But as is rightly pointed here on the thread it did not really show the bizarre lifeforms of the deep sea  creatures that rarely see sunlight. Of course the real problem is that deep sea photography before Dr. Ballard's descents two and a half miles down were extremely difficult  and impossible for a commercial Hollywood film. So one has to allow for this failure while enjoying the fish and fauna that is seen.The performers try hard particularly Borgnine who attempts some comic relief. A reviewer on this thread mentions Gazzara's performance as wooden. I hesitate to go that far he seemed more tired than wooden but I have seen him to far better effect in THE STRANGE ONE and other performances. Pidgeon was in his film dotage  trotted out as an authority figure of one type or another at the time with his aged appearance erasing memories of the good looks of thirty years before in MRS. MINIFER or HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY. In his later years every time I saw Walter Pidgeon's performances unless the film script gave him some good moments his thickened pursed lips always made me think him a caricature of himself. In the end the interest in the subject matter is the best thing going for THE NEPTUNE FACTOR coupled with the photography even with it's limitations. So I give it a 5 out of a possible 10.".

	schema:reviewBody " May contain spoilers  ...but when I watched it in 1973 it was one of the several 60's70's films that got me into scuba diving. Reviewing it 44 years hence and with over 1500 dives under my belt I'm amazed by the excellent underwater macro photography probably done in an aquarium with the extremely limited technology available at the time. No need to repeat the plot here but be only advised that the first two thirds of the movie will put you to sleep and if you happen to know 1.01 about dive physiology and physics will surely get you angry at the goofy plot guys diving to depths that would require a week inside a decompression chamber etc... On the other hand remember this was filmed at a time when diving was deemed adventurous and heroic. LOL! At the 23 mark the action consisting of macro shots of little tropical fishes make you take an imagination leap where you are a one inch scuba diver dropped inside a tropical aquarium full of small critters that usually feed on the likes of you is probably even more boring. This film requires discipline for you to go to the end credits however seeing that there are people cheering the latest Alien franchise production the creators of this amateurish movie deserve at least an accolade for the effort. Unless you cannot get your hands on a soso reading or comedy just skip it.".

Reviewing it 44 years hence and with over 1500 dives under my belt I'm amazed by the excellent underwater macro photography probably done in an aquarium with the extremely limited technology available at the time. No need to repeat the plot here but be only advised that the first two thirds of the movie will put you to sleep and if you happen to know 1.01 about dive physiology and physics will surely get you angry at the goofy plot guys diving to depths that would require a week inside a decompression chamber etc... On the other hand remember this was filmed at a time when diving was deemed adventurous and heroic. LOL! At the 23 mark the action consisting of macro shots of little tropical fishes make you take an imagination leap where you are a one inch scuba diver dropped inside a tropical aquarium full of small critters that usually feed on the likes of you is probably even more boring. This film requires discipline for you to go to the end credits however seeing that there are people cheering the latest Alien franchise production the creators of this amateurish movie deserve at least an accolade for the effort. Unless you cannot get your hands on a soso reading or comedy just skip it.";

The story has enough moments of suspense to keep the viewer interested and enough plot to move the story along at a reasonable pace. A lot has been said about the lack of special effects. I'm not too bothered by this. They are no better or worse than other films from that era. The premisegiant fish at the bottom of the ocean does not suspend our disbelief too much. The important thing here is the search and rescue of the scientists trapped at the bottom of a crevice and not the mutant fish. The final rescue happens too quickly but this does not hinder the film too much.Overall a good film to watch on a rainy Sunday. I give it 6 mutant fish out of 10.".

It stars Ben Gazzara Ernest Borgnine Yvette Mimieux and Donnelly Rhodes as a quartet of people using an experimental diving craft to search for an ocean floor laboratory. The lab wasn't located in the wisest of places and an undersea earthquake sweeps it a great distance away. Naturally the Neptune is going to have to search far and wide to find this lab as the time rapidly runs out.Overall a mild adventure that only starts getting interesting toward the end. If one is hoping for more thrills or more monsters they'll be disappointed because the menacing fauna consists of ordinary marine life made to look huge through photographic trickery. Directed by Canadian born Hollywood veteran Daniel Petrie A Raisin in the Sun Fort Apache the Bronx it could have been a pretty brief movie if it had more get up and go in its favor. As it is it IS slowly paced and its characters are not well defined by screenwriter Jack DeWitt Canadian Pacific A Man Called Horse.Still the cast mostly comprised of veteran Canadian character actors with a few token American names in place treats the material with as much gravity as they can muster. Gazzara is actually kind of annoying in the top billed hero role what with his mannered style of delivery. But Borgnine is particularly good and Mimieux looks just gorgeous. People may recognize guys like Chris Wiggins 'Friday the 13th The Series' and Leslie Carlson Videodrome in supporting roles. Cast member Stuart Gillard later became a director himself beginning his career with 1982s' Paradise.Producer Sanford Sandy Howard Man in the Wilderness Circle of Iron apparently spent quite some time researching supposedly to make it as accurate as possible but it's lot of effort spent on a film that does entertain but doesn't reach its full potential. At least it has a fine soundtrack both in terms of score and sound design.It may remind viewers of the later James Cameron film The Abyss to some extent.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A step up from the first... but a pretty small one";
	schema:reviewBody "When The Olsen Gang became a franchise writers Bahs and Balling were quick to eliminate characters that were deemed unnecessary or simply didn't seem to make sense in that the gang continues their adventures... gone are the hookers from Hansen's bar Benny's fiance Ulla and the two other kids in the Jensen estate... Brge remains as the only kid of Kjeld and Yvonne. The acting starts to find a more grounded level instead of always being so incredibly overplayed. DynamiteHarryportrayed by none other than Preben Kaas who could possibly play a major drunk better than one who iswell was... RIP one in real life? Benny's hopeless drunk of a brotherwho is of course very skilled in the use of explosives is introduced. The series moves towards the great films that we have come to know it for. The humor is still mostly silly... still containing a few mixups as well though most of these are much funnier and so infrequent they manage to surprise yourather than annoy you as got to be the case with those of the first. The plot is an interesting case not so much for the writing itselfcertainly not it's quite pedestrian not at all up to the level of some of the later films but for how early the idea it presents came about in the series. The Gang going straight... no more crime... with the added twist that they are framed for a robbery they didn'tbut certainly could have commit. Added to the cast are now the wellknown Ghita Nrby as the young female social worker of Egonwho has a schoolboy crush on her... illustrated by the seemingly angelic light that appears around her person many of the times he looks at her... believe me it's funnier than it sounds who helps the three career criminalsbefore Danish audiences knew and saw them as such getting real jobs. Most of the jokes about about pornography are absent... as is the let's face it gratuitous halfnude women. In their place are more of the social commentary and satire that the first showed signs of and that we know and love the later films foralong with the daring heists the human touch and the energy. Authority is made fun of yet againthough less bombastically and this time German discipline and rehabilitationpsychology are thrown into the mix too. Usually funny and more often than not hysterically so. This is also when the series start to feature longer films... the first was an hour and 20 minutes this clocks in at not much less than two full hours. Arguably much of this time could one do without... the scene at the bar featuring the gang Harry and Mrs. Hansen the social workerand a scene or two immediately following it is too long and could easily be cut without it detracting from the overall experienceopposite that however are the delightful scenes at the toy factory which are among the funniest in the series. But this is still a step up. A step further away from the mediocrity of not only the first film but most other Danish films of the period. It wasn't until later that this series really started to stand out but this is still a step and one in the right directionit's always annoying when franchises start to step away from the path it really should stay on. A few key ingredients are still missing and overall this film just isn't really much better than the first. It's still worth watching at least to those who want to see how it all started. I recommend this to the biggest fans of the series and those who want to observe the roots of it. As a bonus Poul Bundgaard shows off some of his talent as an opera singer in this film. Also this has a fairly good amount of James Bondian gadgets... for anyone who enjoys seeing that in movies. 610".

	onyx:emotionText "When The Olsen Gang became a franchise writers Bahs and Balling were quick to eliminate characters that were deemed unnecessary or simply didn't seem to make sense in that the gang continues their adventures... gone are the hookers from Hansen's bar Benny's fiance Ulla and the two other kids in the Jensen estate... Brge remains as the only kid of Kjeld and Yvonne. The acting starts to find a more grounded level instead of always being so incredibly overplayed. DynamiteHarryportrayed by none other than Preben Kaas who could possibly play a major drunk better than one who iswell was... RIP one in real life? Benny's hopeless drunk of a brotherwho is of course very skilled in the use of explosives is introduced. The series moves towards the great films that we have come to know it for. The humor is still mostly silly... still containing a few mixups as well though most of these are much funnier and so infrequent they manage to surprise yourather than annoy you as got to be the case with those of the first. The plot is an interesting case not so much for the writing itselfcertainly not it's quite pedestrian not at all up to the level of some of the later films but for how early the idea it presents came about in the series. The Gang going straight... no more crime... with the added twist that they are framed for a robbery they didn'tbut certainly could have commit. Added to the cast are now the wellknown Ghita Nrby as the young female social worker of Egonwho has a schoolboy crush on her... illustrated by the seemingly angelic light that appears around her person many of the times he looks at her... believe me it's funnier than it sounds who helps the three career criminalsbefore Danish audiences knew and saw them as such getting real jobs. Most of the jokes about about pornography are absent... as is the let's face it gratuitous halfnude women. In their place are more of the social commentary and satire that the first showed signs of and that we know and love the later films foralong with the daring heists the human touch and the energy. Authority is made fun of yet againthough less bombastically and this time German discipline and rehabilitationpsychology are thrown into the mix too. Usually funny and more often than not hysterically so. This is also when the series start to feature longer films... the first was an hour and 20 minutes this clocks in at not much less than two full hours. Arguably much of this time could one do without... the scene at the bar featuring the gang Harry and Mrs. Hansen the social workerand a scene or two immediately following it is too long and could easily be cut without it detracting from the overall experienceopposite that however are the delightful scenes at the toy factory which are among the funniest in the series. But this is still a step up. A step further away from the mediocrity of not only the first film but most other Danish films of the period. It wasn't until later that this series really started to stand out but this is still a step and one in the right directionit's always annoying when franchises start to step away from the path it really should stay on. A few key ingredients are still missing and overall this film just isn't really much better than the first. It's still worth watching at least to those who want to see how it all started. I recommend this to the biggest fans of the series and those who want to observe the roots of it. As a bonus Poul Bundgaard shows off some of his talent as an opera singer in this film. Also this has a fairly good amount of James Bondian gadgets... for anyone who enjoys seeing that in movies. 610";

The Olsen gang are the only witnesses to the robbery and is therefor blamed for the crime by the police.

Preben Kaas is just wonderful in the role of Harry!Funniest line of the movie's gotta be Benny Og Kjeld solgte japanske ?pinde p Langelinje og blev smidt i vandet af en svensker Keld Det var aldeles ikke nogen svensker han var bare almindelig fuld!

	schema:reviewBody "Die Oma ist tot which basically means that grandma is dead is a German movie from 1997 so this one has its 20th anniversary this year. It runs for 85 minutes so is relatively short as this already includes a solid amount of closing credits too. It was a small screen release and an earlier career effort made by Hape Kerkeling with his significant other Angelo Colagrossi back then one of many collaborations until they separated. I believe this film is evidence how Kerkeling may be a great host and entertainer but in terms of acting he is not exactly a revelation. Admittedly he is not worse than everybody else in the cast here probably better but just not anywhere near the level he reaches in other fields.The movie is about a married couple who gets visited by the wife's mother. Sadly the mother dies quickly afterward and the couple have to try their best to fulfill her last wish of being buried in Poland as the wife and mother originate from Poland. After runins with undertakers that prove way too expensive the duo and the kid who use this for skipping school drive to Poland themselves in their car and it becomes a bit of a road movie at that point. This journey to Poland is basically the entire second half of the film and many complications ensue including confusion about coffins huge sums of money cars etc. In general you can also see from this film here that back in the 1990s cars played a way bigger role in many German films than they do today. This includes the Manta films for example but there are more example such as films about traffic jams or a mix of cars and Berlin Wallrelated subjects. But back to this one here. I think it has its okay moments but sometimes the parallels between Kerkeling and Gottschalk whose films are relatively weak too cannot be overseen. i have to give this movie a thumbsdown as well. Most of the attempts at comedy have not worked out in here. Or maybe they did back then but this also means that the film has not aged well at all. Watch something else instead. And don't be fooled by the title it's straightup comedy but never a black comedy which you may have guessed and which also could have meant the film to turn out much better.".
